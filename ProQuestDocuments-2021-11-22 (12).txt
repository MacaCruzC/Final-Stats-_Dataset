Texto completo: It took three months, but the New York Times is finally coming back around to acknowledge a story it covered at the time — that Ukraine’s government did indeed interfere in the 2016 election.
A lengthy report in the paper this week downplayed the election meddling by referring to it as “unfounded or overblown theories about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election.” But that the New York Times is acknowledging it at all is progress.
The New York Times had previously only talked about the matter as if it were a partisan myth, a theory pushed only by Trump and conspiracy-minded Republicans. In a report last month, the paper said that the “charges” of Ukraine’s election interference — they’re only accusations without any basis, right? — actually originated in (where else?) Russia.
"American intelligence officials,” the article said, “informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election."
And yet that claim hasn’t been backed up by any further details or reporting. Thomas Rid, a strategic studies professor at Johns Hopkins, pointed that out in a separate piece for the Atlantic, rightfully noting that neither the New York Times nor anyone else has “offered the concrete details, direct quotes, or names that would ordinarily back up such a grave claim.”
But guess who did offer the concrete details, direct quotes, and names that back up the assertion that the government of Ukraine thrust itself into 2016? That was none other than the New York Times itself.
Before the New York Times started lying about Ukraine's interference in 2016, it had been the paper that initially reported on it. Ukraine's government ran to the New York Times with interviews and materials (very dubious materials) that year, and the result was an article that eventually led to the resignation of Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort.
Manafort was certainly a crook, but how did he manage to be a crook for decades, taking money from pro-Russia oligarchs in Ukraine, without being caught? It wasn’t until he took a position on the campaign of a candidate who had been excessively friendly toward Russia that suddenly a strange diary showed up in the possession of a Ukrainian government agency, the diary conveniently exposing him as a major bank fraudster and tax evader. What a coincidence!
No matter what you think of Manafort, that whole thing embarrassed the Trump campaign. Ukraine was responsible for it.
The New York Times might now think that particular instance of election interference has been “overblown,” but it did happen, and at least the newspaper is accepting that fact.
Photo Caption:FILE - In this June 27, 2019 file photo, Paul Manafort arrives in a New York court. President Trump's former campaign manager is to be arraigned on state mortgage fraud charges. Ukraine's president appears to be playing to both sides of the U.S. political divide, hedging his bets to ensure U.S. financial and military aid keeps flowing no matter who wins next year's election.

Texto completo: Los manifestantes que irrumpieron este martes en la embajada de Bagdad, Irak , y provocaron incendios en su interior gritaron desde fuera de la sede diplomática “ Muerte a Estados Unidos “. Manifestantes y combatientes de milicias mostraron así su enfado por los ataques estadounidenses que provocaron el pasado fin de semana la muerte de 24 miembros de una milicia respaldada por Irán.
Los hombres, según the New York Times, no consiguieron entrar al edificio principal de la embajada pero desde el exterior gritaron, arrojaron piedras y dibujaron grafitis en los muros para exigir a EEUU que retiraran sus fuerzas aéreas de Irak.
La situación seguía siendo delicada y los manifestantes incluso amenazaron con acampar a las afueras de los edificios estadounidenses. Su entrada en una de las zonas más vigiladas de la capital iraquí sugiere que las autoridades del país, que simpatizan con sus reivindicaciones, hicieron la vista gorda .
El presidente Donald Trump salió rápidamente a condenar la irrupción en el complejo de la embajada, que tachó de “ataque” y responsabilizó al gobierno iraquí por descuidar la vigilancia compartida de la sede diplomática.
“Irán mató a un contratista estadounidense e hirió a muchos. Respondimos con fuerza como seguiremos haciendo siempre “, tuiteó el presidente. “Ahora Irán está orquestando un ataque en la embajada estadounidense en Irak. Los consideraremos los únicos responsables. Además, esperamos que Irak use sus fuerzas para proteger la embajada. ¡Y así se lo hemos hecho saber!”, exclamó Trump en la red social.
Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!

At No Name Restaurant, an unceremonious end to a storied 102-year-old Boston establishment

Texto completo: The masses arrived with coolers overflowing with Miller High Lifes and Sam Adams. At the nearby docks, fishermen unloaded their catch and fended off wailing sea gulls. The air smelled of salt and fish. Inside the No Name Restaurant, tons of seafood were broiled and fried and peddled at bargain prices.
“This place was a destination," remembered Pam Roberts, who graduated from Simmons College in 1980 and flocked to the seafood joint each summer after exams. “Half the fun was standing outside with a six-pack. If the wait was over an hour, you just got two six-packs. A whole mess of friends. Pure chaos. And it was wonderful."
The restaurant on South Boston's Fish Pier shook some of its rough-and-ready charms over the years, but it remained a hot spot — until Monday night.
The No Name announced Monday that it would be shuttered immediately. Bankruptcy documents show it owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to creditors including the Massachusetts Port Authority, the City of Boston, and several seafood companies.
What's more, the No Name stopped paying property taxes in 2013, and Boston has put a lien on the property. No Name owes the city close to $700,000 in back taxes including interest, according to city records.
“It's a significant sum of money. We don't take it lightly," said Emme Handy, chief financial officer for Boston.
Handy said the city has a “99 percent collection rate" because it is first in line to be paid. Asked why the city hasn't taken further action to collect taxes, Handy said it can take several years and can involve pursuing a foreclosure proceeding.
While the dollar amount is sizable, that is not what is unusual about the No Name situation, said Handy.
“To me what stands out a little more is zero dollars of payment from 2014 to 2020. That is striking to me," she added.
A lawyer for No Name did not return e-mails seeking comment Tuesday. The restaurant thanked its customers and employees on its Facebook page Monday night and said that, “After over 100 years, we had to make the difficult decision to close the No Name Restaurant."
The establishment filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which provides for the liquidation of property and the distribution of assets to creditors. Staffers learned of their looming unemployment only 24 hours prior, during a management meeting Sunday night.
The sudden closure — on the day before New Year's Eve, no less — was an unceremonious end to a storied 102-year-old Boston establishment that manifested the American dream and served a diverse cast of locals and tourists over the years.
The oldest continuous family-owned restaurant in Boston, the No Name traces its history back to a small hole-in-the-wall eatery founded in 1917 by John Contos. He'd arrived from Greece as a penniless 16-year-old, then worked 80 to 90 hour weeks to keep his new restaurant afloat. The no-frills, cheap seafood joint was aimed at the fishermen and warehouse workers toiling away in the neighboring businesses.
“Originally, the place was supposed to be called Deluxe Diner," Contos's son Nick told the Globe in 1997. “My father planned to cater to all the men who worked on the Fish Pier. But word got around about the restaurant, and soon people were coming from all over. There wasn't any sign out front. That's how the place got its name. Since it didn't have a sign, customers started calling it the No Name."
Rick O'Connor secured a summer job at the restaurant in the 1960s and recalls a boiling hot kitchen full of chowder cauldrons, scalding dishwashers, and hard workers who never complained.
“Papa John [Contos] would send me down to the boats for haddock and I'd bring them up in a basket. He'd send me back down, and by the time I returned he'd have all the previous haddock seared fileted and frying," said O'Connor.
In the spring of 1967, the restaurant renovated to become a mere 40 inches wider and serve five dozen (rather than three dozen) customers. Three years later, back when the chowder sold for 95 cents, Globe staffer Anthony Spinazzola called the No Name “one of those places about which people say, 'Don't write about it, you'll spoil it.' "
But for the next half-century, people kept writing about it. The Tampa Bay Times, San Diego Union-Tribune, and The New York Times all sent correspondents to cover the No Name. The restaurant cemented its place alongside other Boston seafood staples like Anthony's Pier 4, Legal Sea Foods, and the Union Oyster House. Celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse stopped by in 2002. Politicians like Michael Dukakis and Mitt Romney gave it a shoutout during their campaigns. Cambridge-born comedian Lenny Clarke told the Globe in 2009 he took all out-of-towners to the No Name, calling it “the best buy in town."
Jessica Nazario, 30, ate what turned out to beher final meal at the restaurant a couple months back. She estimated she'd been there more than 50 times.
“It's the staff and the familiarity that makes it a staple of Boston. Everything is changing so much, but No Name has always been there, and we've always felt comfortable going," she said.
Her father Jose Perez immigrated from El Salvador in 1980 and began driving a cab shortly thereafter. For a decade, passengers pointed him to the No Name and he ate there himself. Every weekend. And nearly every weekday. The restaurant offered a discount for cabbies, and the staff served him extra shrimp on his already towering broiled shrimp sautee plate.
“Every time I was there, I felt like I was at home," said Perez.
Within 15 hours of the management's Monday night announcement, more than 450 people had commented online with messages of shock and nostalgia. Some like, Perez, had eaten there recently. But most, like Pam Roberts, recalled memories and meals from bygone eras and a Seaport without sleek skyscrapers, sky lounges, and Sweetgreen.
Despite the fond memories of its patrons, though, it was clear that the No Name was struggling.
“When places like this go, people argue to save them for nostalgia's sake, but they haven't patronized them in decades," said Patrick Maguire, a hospitality consultant and advocate for service industry workers. “Nostalgia doesn't pay the rent in a competitive environment."
After John Contos' death, his son Nick took over the No Name's management. Since Nick's death in 2004, the restaurant has remained in the family. Members of the Contos family did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the Globe regarding the sudden closure and bankruptcy filing.
In a farewell Facebook post Monday night, the family wrote: “To our employees, many of whom have been with us for decades, we cannot thank you enough — we thank you for your tireless dedication and hard working service."
On Tuesday afternoon, a message taped to the restaurant's front door read, “We will be closed today for a management meeting. Happy Holidays." By then, staffers — old and young — hadworked their last shift at the No Name. And the century-old haunt had turned off its fryers, stopped its shipments, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.

Texto completo: You won't hear young Democrats deride Bernie Sanders with the "OK, boomer" dig. At 78, he's actually too old for the cohort, but that's not why he won't get dinged. He's the most popular Democrat among the under-35 crowd, and judging by recent polling, he's the second-most popular Democrat overall. Sanders has raised nearly twice as much money as the frontrunner, Joe Biden, and seems to have scooped up support from a declining Elizabeth Warren in the past 60 days. Despite a heart attack that sidelined him for a week, he marches on, now buoyed by a poll showing that in a head-to-head matchup against Donald Trump, he would do better than Biden -- though within the margin of error.
Sanders' appeal, the experts explain, is founded on "authenticity." Is he humorless, repetitive, cloying and rigid? Sure. But these are signs that he really believes something! He's not a packaged, blow-dried (no argument there), insincere pol cooked up in a political laboratory. He's the real deal.
Let's concede that Sanders is sincere, and that he is, with some small hypocrisies -- did you know he was a millionaire? -- honest. But what people actually believe is kind of important, and Sanders professes and sells a series of prejudices that do him no credit.
Sanders claims to be a democratic socialist in the European mold, an admirer of Sweden and Denmark. Yet his career is pockmarked with praise for regimes considerably to the left of those Scandinavian models. He has praised Cuba for "making enormous progress in improving the lives of poor and working people." In his memoir, he bragged about attending a 1985 parade celebrating the Sandinistas' seizure of power six years before. "Believe it or not," he wrote, "I was the highest ranking American official there." At the time, the Sandinista regime had already allied with Cuba and begun a large military buildup, courtesy of the Soviet Union. The Sandinistas, Sanders had every reason to know, had censored independent news outlets, nationalized half of the nation's industry, forcibly displaced the Miskito Indians and formed "neighborhood watch" committees on the Cuban model. Sandinista forces, like those in East Germany and other communist countries, regularly opened fire on those attempting to flee the country. None of that appears to have dampened Sanders' enthusiasm. The then-mayor of Burlington, Vermont, gushed that under his leadership, "Vermont could set an example to the rest of the nation similar to the type of example Nicaragua is setting for the rest of Latin America."
Sanders was impatient with those who found fault with the Nicaraguan regime:
"Is (the Sandinistas') crime that they have built new health clinics, schools, and distributed land to the peasants? Is their crime that they have given equal rights to women? Or that they are moving forward to wipe out illiteracy? No, their crime in Mr. Reagan's eyes and the eyes of corporations and billionaires that determine American foreign policy is that they have refused to be a puppet and banana republic to American corporate interests."
Sanders now calls for a revolution in this country, and we're all expected to nod knowingly. Of course, he means a peaceful, democratic revolution. It would be outrageous to suggest anything else. Well, it would not be possible for Sanders to usher in a revolution in the U.S., but his sympathy for the real thing is notable. As Michael Moynihan reported, in the case of the Sandinistas, he was willing to justify press censorship and even bread lines. The regime's crackdown on the largest independent newspaper, La Prensa, "makes sense to me" Sanders explained, because the country was besieged by counterrevolutionary forces funded by the United States. As for bread lines, which soon appeared in Nicaragua, as they would decades later in Venezuela, Sanders scoffed: "It's funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is, that people are lining up for food. That is a good thing! In other countries people don't line up for food. The rich get the food and the poor starve to death."
Sanders' stopped learning about economics and politics about the age of 17. He still believes that corporate "greed" is responsible for human poverty, and that the world is a zero-sum pie. The more billionaires there are, the less there is for everyone else. "I don't think billionaires should exist," he told The New York Times. So in the Bernie ideal world, we non-billionaires would be deprived of Amazon, personal computers, smartphones, fracking (which reduces greenhouse gases), Uber, Walmart, "Star Wars" movies and very possibly our jobs. Millions of children would be deprived of school scholarships, while the arts, medical research and poverty programs would be that much poorer. Billionaires are not heroes, but by making them boogeymen, Sanders betrays his economic infantilism along with a large dose of demagoguery.

Texto completo: VERMILLION, S.D. - Starring in an episode of a Netflix show doesn't help you pick your child up when her rare disease has crumpled her to the ground in a parking lot.
It's a lesson Breteni Morgan-Berg has been learning again and again after a whirlwind year in the spotlight. Her 7-year-old daughter, Kamiyah, has an exceedingly rare gene mutation that causes her to collapse multiple times a day. Kamiyah's illness, a mutation of a gene known as KCNMA1, got diagnosed last year after extensive medical sleuthing.
Kamiyah's condition made her a star in an episode of "Diagnosis," the Netflix medical detective documentary series based on the New York Times column of the same name. But her time in the limelight didn't cure her gene mutation - that remains a work in progress. Instead, it grew her family: researchers dedicated to find her a treatment and other families dealing with the same gene mutation who thought they too were alone.
The media exposure also gave Morgan-Berg and Kamiyah a louder voice. They're known now; Kamiyah's condition is a known issue. That helps too, when seeking assistance, when Morgan-Berg is making another call for help, or one more emailed request.
"If there's anything Netflix and the New York Times did for us - granted I pushed myself to that point and that's how we got there - but it makes it much harder to ignore," Morgan-Berg said.
The helpers
Kamiyah, and her appearance on the Netflix show, has catalyzed a growing network of support in the medical community. Dr. Lisa Sanders, the model for the brilliant, medical mystery solving doctor-detective main character in the show "House, M.D.," featured Kamiyah in her Diagnosis column in the New York Times prior to the collaboration with Netflix. She's just a text message away.
Dr. Sotirios Keros was a early and crucial part of Kamiyah's medical family. He got to know her in 2018 after a colleague referred the child with the then-undiagnosed condition to him.
For Kamiyah, Keros couldn't have been at a better place in a better time. A New York resident, Keros regularly commuted to Sioux Falls to work as assistant professor in pediatric neurology at Sanford Children's Hospital and the University of South Dakota, where there was a shortage of professionals with his expertise. His specialized background in neurology and ion channel physiology meant when he saw Kamiyah's condition, what she was suffering from was clear, he said.
Keros got Kamiyah's gene mutation on a special rare disease database known as CoRDS, hosted by Sanford Health. He also co-founded a foundation - the KCNMA1 Channelopathy International Advocacy Organization - meant to help support the research into the KCNMA1 mutation and helping connect those with the condition with researchers and each other.
Kamaiyah's appearance on Netflix didn't trigger an avalanche of donations into the foundation ("Nope, nope, nope, nope"), said Keros. That funding might come in time, as a result of family fundraising and growing awareness of the condition. But the foundation is serving a more immediate purpose, acting as a crucial link between those struggling with the condition - giving them a place to turn.
"The reason we started the foundation was this exact reason: to give people education and just a place to turn," he said. "Some diseases, like this one, there really isn't any treatment, but just being involved with other people is its own kind of help."
Another key member of Kamiyah's support team is Dr. Andrea Meredith, a researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who first heard about Kamiyah in Sanders' column. She was stunned to later learn the gene that causes Kamiyah's condition was the exact same one she was currently researching. Previously, she had only heard of one such patient - an anonymous Chinese family documented in a 2005 paper.
"When Kamiyah's mom gave us the genetics report - I almost fell over because one of the mutations we had picked out of the publicly available database, with no other information other than the sequence change, ended up being the mutation that she had," Meredith said. Her work involves growing mice genetically modified with Kamiyah's condition, a key component of further research.
Meredith, too, has growth close to Morgan-Berg and her family, and helped co-found the KCNMA1 foundation with Keros. Kamiyah's photos are all over Meredith's lab, Morgan-Berg said. Meredith has a daughter who is slightly older than Kamiyah, and the two families met up in New York when Kamiyah and Morgan-Berg were making media appearances in connection to the Netflix show.
"One of the most powerful things about meeting Kamiyah in person was the ability to see that sweetness and it's amazing how she has that childlike innocence and sweetness, yet she's afflicted by these very powerful symptoms," Meredith said.
Meredith is now working to secure funding from the National Institutes of Health to expand her lab, due to the sheer volume of people contacting her seeking help.
"She has no idea what she means to us," Morgan-Berg said.
Also helping Kamiyah, quietly, is Massachusetts-based Q-State Biosciences. Q-State had no comment about its work with Kamiyah: "Q-State is still in the early stages of research on this project, and cannot provide details right now," said a spokesperson.
But Morgan-Berg said Q-State's work involves matching Kamiyah's genetic profile against available drugs to see if there's anything that could help - possibly the most immediately promising work, if they find something.
The bad and the ugly
With the good came the bad. Kamiyah's newfound fame from the New York Times column and Netflix show brought out the worst in some people, Morgan-Berg said. Online trolls attacked Kamiyah's family, specifically her mother, accusing her of being a terrible wife, a fame-seeking welfare mom and worse.
"Terrible, horrible things you can't even make up yourself. Trolls just come out of the woodwork," she said.
Morgan-Berg locked down her Facebook account to shield herself from the worst commenters, but that didn't keep them all away.
She worried the Netflix show might make it seem that Kamiyah's condition was cured and everything was fine now. But she knows that's not the case, and she wishes others did too.
The research grinds on, a silver-bullet solution hasn't shown up and the big media exposure didn't solve her family's biggest immediate problem: negotiating the tangled web of bureaucracies to get Kamiyah the help she needs now, trained care providers who can help take care of a growing girl, protecting her from her own body.
"It's hard enough to be told that Kamiyah is going to die before they can help us, that the information that we give on Kamiyah could help someone else," said Morgan-Berg. "But the fact is that we can't even get help with the quality of life we have left."
Morgan-Berg is required to interview and hire the care providers first, then seek funding. But because Kamiyah's condition is so rare, it can be difficult to obtain what she needs through Medicaid. Morgan-Berg said she's applied for coverage for the care providers multiple times, and gotten turned down each time, putting her in a quandary: Let the caregivers go, or pay for them out of pocket?
It's an ongoing battle that makes her dream of moving to Denmark, just to be close to friends she met online whose son Atle has the same condition as Kamiyah. But she presses on, powered by her family, friends, the growing network of others with the same condition and medical professionals dedicated to finding answers.
"I don't want to look back and think, 'I could have done more. I want to know I've done everything humanly possible,'" Morgan-Berg said. "So when this comes crashing down and Kamiyah is not here - and that is super dark - I can look back and be like, 'I know in everything I could have done I didn't leave anything unturned, I fought the good fight.' And that, at the same time as I was fighting the good fight, what she lived -- the way she lived -- was happy."

Texto completo: He worked with the Monty Python troupe and was known for his own projects, including the Beatles parody band the Rutles.
Neil Innes, the British humorist and musician who was an honorary member of the Monty Python comedy troupe and made a name for himself with a nutty assortment of musical and television projects, including the Beatles parody band the Rutles, died on Sunday near Toulouse, France, where he had lived in recent years. He was 75.
His wife, Yvonne Innes, said the cause was a heart attack.
Mr. Innes, a multi-instrumentalist, was a particular type of songwriter: one who excelled at satirical songs and parodies of other people's music, but who could also write a pretty good straight song. Sometimes it was hard to tell the difference.
In the early 1960s he was one of the first members of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, also known as simply the Bonzo Dog Band. He wrote the group's biggest hit, "I'm the Urban Spaceman," which climbed into the Top 10 on the British charts in 1968.
In the 1970s he wrote material for Monty Python, the groundbreaking six-member comedy troupe. Midway through that decade he and Eric Idle, a Python, came up with the Rutles, a deadpan parody of the Beatles; the group not only recorded albums but also made films, most notably the mock documentary "The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash" in 1978.
Mr. Innes also performed live shows throughout his career and was still doing so recently.
"His humor is gentle and whimsical, long on non sequiturs and only occasionally risqué," Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times, reviewing a show in 1985 at the Bottom Line in Manhattan. "He skewered pomposity in all its guises, from preciousness to enforced singalongs. With a mobile face that could metamorphose in seconds from Buster Keaton to Bob Dylan, and the slightly italicized gestures of a crack vaudevillian, Mr. Innes could get laughs whenever he wanted to."
Neil James Innes was born on Dec. 9, 1944, in Danbury, England, northeast of London, to Edward and Rita (Hudson) Innes. His father was in the military, and he spent part of his childhood in postwar Germany.
He took piano lessons as a child, taught himself to play guitar and dabbled in drawing and painting. He pursued his art interest first at the Norwich School of Art, then at Goldsmiths College School of Art, graduating in 1966. That same year he married Yvonne Catherine Hilton.
While in school he had begun playing in what was originally named the Bonzo Dog Dada Band.
"The Bonzos tumbled out of the heady early-'60s art-school scene, an ever-changing troupe of eccentrics who delighted the college crowd with a riot of exploding wardrobes, archaic instruments, prewar novelty songs and jazz-age pop," according to an entry about the group's first album, "Gorilla" (1967), in "The Mojo Collection: The Ultimate Music Companion."
"We found the sort of songs we wanted to learn from old 78 Gramophone records," Mr. Innes told NPR in 2004, "the breakable ones, which we used to buy in street markets."
The group is seen in the Beatles movie "Magical Mystery Tour" playing its song "Death Cab for Cutie." The Bonzos also appeared in about 20 episodes of "Do Not Adjust Your Set," a children's television show that had a lot of adult fans thanks to a cheeky cast that included Mr. Idle and two other future Pythons, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Mr. Innes was never a Python, but he did contribute material to "Monty Python's Flying Circus," which premiered in England in 1969.
He also appeared in the movies "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" (1975) and "Monty Python's Life of Brian" (1979), as well as films by individual Pythons.
The Rutles started as a quick gag on "Rutland Weekend Television," a BBC sketch comedy series about a laughably small-town TV station. Mr. Idle wrote and starred in the show, which ran for two seasons in the mid-1970s; Mr. Innes's job was to contribute one or two songs per episode.
"Not many people saw it," Mr. Idle wrote of the series in his memoir, "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" (2018). "Because it had no live audience, I was never very sure whether it was funny or not, and some people kindly went out of their way to point out that it wasn't."
But, of course, it was, particularly when, in the second season, it aired a sketch that featured a segment on a local band that looked and sounded an awful lot like the Beatles and performed a tune written by Mr. Innes called "I Must Be in Love."
The band, the fake newscaster said, "created a musical legend that will last a lunchtime."
In October 1976 Mr. Idle hosted "Saturday Night Live," then in its second season, and played the Rutles clip. Lorne Michaels, creator of "S.N.L.," became a fan and saw possibilities for a full-length mockumentary, an idea he sprang during a brainstorming meeting at which Mr. Innes was a casual participant.
"I was sitting to one side, on a window sill in an executive office, high up in the Rockefeller Center in New York, listening to all this when suddenly everyone started looking at me," Mr. Innes recalled in a 2014 interview with The Birmingham Mail. "Lorne asked if I could write 20 more Rutles songs by next Thursday lunchtime. I said I would try!"
"All You Need Is Cash," a TV movie shown in both England and the United States, was the result. In the mock band, Mr. Innes was Ron Nasty, the John Lennon-like Rutle. (Mr. Idle, as the Paul McCartney character, Dirk McQuickly, lip-synced.) And he was responsible for the songwriting.
John J. O'Connor reviewed "All You Need Is Cash" in The Times. "The music and lyrics," he wrote, "all written by Mr. Innes, smartly capture the essence of the Beatles and then, ever so cleverly, turn it to mush."

Mr. Innes was also known for two British TV series, "The Innes Book of Records" (1979-81) and the children's series "Puddle Lane" (1985-89).
In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Miles, Luke and Barney; and three grandchildren.
As news of Mr. Innes's death spread, each social media post by admirers seemed to single out a different sketch or song or television show that he created or to which he contributed. Danny Kelly, a British music journalist, put it simply.
"A genius at the very eye of the hurricane of British comedy and music," he wrote on Twitter, "What a CV."

Texto completo: Nothing much happened in America in the 2010s. The unemployment rate declined slowly but steadily; the stock market rose; people’s economic situation gradually improved. There were no terrorist attacks on the scale of 9/11, no new land wars to rival Iraq and Vietnam. The country was relatively calm: Violent crime and illegal immigration trended downward, teenage delinquency diminished, teen birthrates fell and the out-of-wedlock birthrate stabilized.
In Washington, only two major pieces of legislation passed Congress, both of them predictable — a health insurance expansion under a Democratic president and a deficit-financed tax cut under a Republican. No enduring majorities were forged; control of government was divided for seven of the 10 years. There were few bipartisan deals, even as the policy fads that came and went — education reform, deficit hawkishness — left underlying realities more or less the same. Inertia and inaction were the order of the day.
If this doesn’t sound like a complete description of the decade — well, it isn’t. It’s a provocation that leaves out a lot of important indicators (the opioid epidemic and the collapsing birthrate above all) that deliberately doesn’t mention populism, the Great Awokening or Donald Trump, and that ignores the feeling of crisis, the paranoia and mistrust and hysteria that have pervaded our public life throughout the later 2010s.
But the provocation represents a truth that’s important for interpreting all that paranoia and polarization and mistrust — because even if you believe that the mood of crisis, the feeling that the liberal order might be cracking up, is the defining feature of the departing decade, you still have to reckon with why that feeling has crested so powerfully in a period surprisingly short on world-altering events.
Consider, by way of contrast, the decade before this one. Between 2000 and 2009, the United States experienced the Florida recount and the dot-com bust, suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl Harbor, launched two major foreign invasions, attempted the transformation of the Middle East and failed, and entered the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression. Meanwhile, disruption was everywhere: Newspapers perished, partisan cable networks ascended, the smartphone took over the world, and the Amazon-Google-Facebook internet consolidated into something like its current shape.
Compared to this litany, the 2010s look a little uneventful, don’t they? Even if you declare Obamacare a big (expletive) deal and grant Trump’s election world-historical significance, even if you bring in European dramas like Brexit and the Syrian refugee crisis, even if you pretend self-driving cars are really happening (just as soon as they learn to drive in rain) … even then, the last decade’s disruptions don’t quite measure up.
So why does the psychology of the 2010s, relative to the country’s mental situation in the Bush or Clinton era, feel so disappointed, distrustful and deranged?
Let me suggest, as one possible answer, that we consider U.S. history since the end of the Cold War as a three-act play. The first act, the 1990s, was a period of hubris , when we half-believed that we were entering a new age of domestic dynamism and global power — that our leaders deserved trust again, that the emerging digital age would be a blessing, that our innovators were on the threshold of great discoveries and our military was ready to spread liberty’s blessings round the world.
The 2000s, in turn, were an era of nemesis — when the most overstretched expressions of that ’90s hubris, from the Pets.com version of the new economy to the Bush doctrine to the exurban housing boom, all met their grimly predestined fate. In one bust after another, in failed wars and Wall Street fiascos alike, the confidence of the ’90s collided with unavoidable realities, and Rudyard Kipling’s gods of the copybook headings made their inevitable return.
But as the 2000s ended, the revenges of reality had not yet been properly interpreted. The failed administration of George W. Bush was there as a scapegoat, Barack Obama was there to play the savior, and first liberals and then some ideological conservatives insisted that in fact everything would have been fine, the optimism of the 1990s indefinitely extended, if only Bush had taken their preferred policy course instead.
Bush was, indeed, an unsuccessful president, but this conceit was false, and the gradually unfolding revelation of its falseness made the 2010s an era of disillusionment , in which the knowledge we gained mattered more than the new events we experienced. The sense of crisis, alienation and betrayal emerged more from backward glances than new disasters, reflecting newly awakened — or awokened, if you prefer — readings of our recent history, our entire post-Cold War arc.
Thus, for instance, our Afghanistan and Libyan follies weren’t nearly as important or destructive as our Iraq debacle of the prior decade, but they were more revelatory — in the sense of demonstrating that humanitarian interventions and nation-building projects don’t work out any better with liberal technocrats in charge than under Cheneyites, that there wasn’t a simple “good war” waiting to be fought by smarter people once the Bush-era cowboy spirit went away.
Or again, the election of Trump probably wasn’t the moment of authoritarianism descending — but it was an important moment of exposure, which revealed things about race relations and class resentments and the rot in the Republican Party and the incompetence of our political class that inclined everybody to a darker view of the American situation than before.
Or yet again, what changed in our relationship to Silicon Valley in the 2010s wasn’t some new technology or business model but our gradual realization of what those technologies and business models were doing to our minds, what they probably weren’t doing for social or economic progress, and how the internet might need to be resisted rather than just happily embraced.
Even the apparent trend toward secularization, the decade’s most notable religious shift, partially reflected a pattern in which Americans who had effectively ceased practicing Christianity years earlier finally made that disaffiliation official.
Meanwhile, in case after case the 2010s were a decade when cranks were proven right and the establishment wrong about developments from prior decades — about the wisdom of establishing Europe’s common currency, about the economic and political consequences of the turn-of-the-millennium opening to China, about the scale and scope of sexual abuse in elite institutions (not just the Catholic Church, though the cranks were right there, too).
In this sense the Jeffrey Epstein scandal was an appropriate capstone for the decade. Epstein’s worst crimes belonged to the 1990s and the 2000s rather than the 2010s, but the full revelations only arrived now, in the age of disillusionment, adding to the retrospective shadow cast across the entire political and journalistic class.
And that shadow feels deeper, in a way, because of the stability with which this essay opened. The 2010s were filled with angst and paranoia, they pushed people toward radicalism and reaction, but they didn’t generate much effective social and political activity beyond the populist middle finger and the progressive Twitter mob. They exposed the depth of problems without suggesting plausible solutions, and they didn’t produce movements or leaders equipped to translate disillusionment into programmatic action, despair into spiritual renewal, the crisis of institutions into structural reform.
It is this peculiar cultural predicament — the combination of disillusionment with stability, radicalization with stalemate, discontent and derangement with sterility and apathy — that I keep calling decadence . Whether it will last another 10 years is an open question; a catastrophe or a renaissance might be just around the corner. But as we usher out the 2010s, this decade of distrustful stability and prosperous despair, it has no rival as the presiding spirit of our age.

Texto completo: Dejó cinco heridos y una comunidad de judíos traumada; pero el apuñalamiento masivo perpetrado por un hombre el sábado por la noche en la casa de un rabino en Monsey, Nueva York, podría haber provocado consecuencias aún peores , según testigos de esta escena de terror.
Algunos de los presentes se enfrentaron al agresor y consiguieron contener su furia, asegura The New York Times. Posteriormente, el agresor huyó. Fue detenido dos horas después en Harlem, cuando la policía identificó el carro con el que dejó el lugar.
Josef Gluck, un hombre de 32 años, contó que el atacante, identificado posteriormente como Grafton Thomas, de 37 años, tras irrumpir en la casa con la cara cubierta por una bufanda empezó a ir de un lado al otro con un machete en la mano, “tratando de golpear a todos”.
“Hey, te atraparé”, le gritó. Él primero huyó. En la cocina, recogió a un niño pequeño, y luego salió a un porche. Después volvió atrás, y trató de enfrentar a Thomas. “Agarré una mesita de café antigua y se la arrojé a la cara”, dijo Gluck.
Otras de las personas presentes en la casa lucharon contra el intruso, lo golpearon con objetos y lo forzaron a retirarse, reporta el Times. Cuando Thomas fue detenido, aún estaba ensangrentado . De los cinco heridos que provocó presuntamente, cuatro fueron atendidos y ya salieron del hospital, mientras que uno permanecía este domingo por la tarde con fracturas en el cráneo, agrega este periódico.
El gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, definió este domingo el apuñalamiento como un “acto de terrorismo doméstico”. En su opinión, esta acción violenta —la última de una serie de ataques perpetrados contra la comunidad judía en la región— fue impulsada por el “odio”.
Por su lado, el presidente Donald Trump dijo que se trató de un ataque “antisemita”. “Todos debemos unirnos para luchar, enfrentar y erradicar el flagelo del antisemitismo “, agregó.
Mientras tanto, la comunidad judía del área de Nueva York y de Estados Unidos se interroga sobre cómo detener la creciente violencia antisemita, destaca NBC News. Muchos miembros de esta comunidad están aterrorizados , aseguraron líderes judíos y otras personas que forman parte de ella.
Cuatro funcionarios electos judíos en Nueva York pidieron al gobernador Cuomo que que declarara un estado de emergencia y desplegara la Guardia Nacional para “patrullar y proteger visiblemente” los vecindarios judíos ortodoxos de la zona.
Otras personas manifiestan incertidumbre sobre cómo abordar la situación. “No estamos seguros de qué hacer, porque no estamos acostumbrados a esto”, dijo el rabino Jon Kelsen, decano de Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, una moderna escuela rabínica ortodoxa en el distrito de Bronx de la ciudad de Nueva York.
Si por lo general las peticiones de más seguridad generalmente suponen la solicitud de una mayor presencia policial , algunos temen que más seguridad pueda obstaculizar el diálogo que Kelsen indicó como tan importante.
“En este momento, las herramientas que tenemos para la seguridad [son] más policías y más armas”, dijo Audrey Sasson, directora ejecutiva de Judios para la Justicia Racial y Económica. “Pero la pregunta para mí es cómo podemos construir otras herramientas “, agregó.

Attacks on faith communities raise a familiar question: When does hate become domestic terrorism?

Resumen: Two attacks on communities of faith raise a familiar question: When are incidents of hate domestic terrorism? The answer is complicated.

Texto completo: One man goes on a stabbing spree at the home of a rabbi during a Hanukkah celebration. Another opens fire with a shotgun inside a Texas church with deadly results.
When do these two apparently unrelated acts of hate during the holiday season become clear cases of domestic terrorism? Should perpetrators be prosecuted as terrorists under the law?
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo didn't hold back in labeling the machete attack in the town of Monsey on Saturday night as "an act of domestic terrorism. " Officials have yet to characterize or offer a motive for the killing of two worshipers at the West Freeway Church of Christ in the Fort Worth suburb of White Settlement the next morning.
In the New York case, suspect Grafton Thomas faces five attempted murder charges. The criminal complaint against him, obtained by The New York Times, says he researched Adolf Hitler online before the attacks. In Texas, the Tarrant County sheriff's office identified the gunman as Keith Thomas Kinnunen, 43. He was shot to death by a member of the church security team.
Whether or not it was the primary intent of the attackers, both incidents served to strike fear into groups, those gathered as members of communities of faith. That would basically fit the definition of domestic terrorism under the USA Patriot Act of 2001 – acts violating criminal laws to "intimidate or coerce a civilian population" or to try to affect the policy or conduct of government.
Domestic terrorism may be part of the law, but prosecutors can't file it as a charge. Those deemed responsible in highly publicized incidents that many would consider acts of terror may face charges of homicide, assault or commission of hate crimes depending on how heinous their actions, but not a charge for inciting terror itself.
To some experts, it's a hole that ought to be filled.
"I think we do need it," said Mary McCord, legal director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and a former acting U. S. assistant attorney general for national security. Though hate crimes can overlap with what is generally considered terrorism, having domestic terror as a separate prosecutable act recognizes it as unique.
"A lot of domestic terrorism crimes could be hate crimes. But not everything," she said. She said a domestic terrorism law might better protect the USA from anarchists rather than just those whose hate takes on a personal agenda.
That appears to be true when it comes to the suspect in the New York attack, said Jason Blazakis, director of the Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism for the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.
"The Thomas attack should be considered both a hate crime and an act of terrorism – these two things aren’t mutually exclusive," he said.
Though turning domestic terrorism into a prosecutable criminal act might sound like one of those rare issues upon which both Democrats and Republicans in Congress could agree, it's one that also attracts opposition from both sides from those concerned with civil liberties. If abused, such a law could be used against those with viewpoints, however radical, protected by the First Amendment.
Terrorism, along with hate, is changing. Instead of being organized by groups, such as 9/11's al-Qaida, many terror suspects are loners.
"Today's terrorist is oftentimes the lone person who feels a connection to others who have committed violence in the past," often from readings culled on the internet, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino.
That could make it harder for prosecutors.
"A lot of times, we don't know when an act of mass violence is ideologically driven even though it may have a terroristic effect," Levin said.

Texto completo: A man pulled out a shotgun at a Texas church service and fired on worshippers Sunday, killing two people before he was shot to death by congregants who fired back, police said.
Authorities at a Sunday evening news conference praised the congregants who opened fire as part of a volunteer security team at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement. It was unclear if the two people who were killed were the two who shot at the gunman.
"This team responded quickly and within six seconds, the shooting was over. Two of the parishioners who were volunteers of the security force drew their weapons and took out the killer immediately, saving untold number of lives," said Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who also hailed the state's gun laws.
Britt Farmer, senior minister of the church, said, "We lost two great men today, but it could have been a lot worse."
Authorities said there were more than 240 congregants in the West Freeway Church at the time of the shooting.
White Settlement Police Department Chief J.P. Bevering said the gunman had sat down in a pew before getting up, taking out a shotgun and firing at a parishioner, who was killed. He said the church's security team then "eliminated the threat."
Officials have not released the names of the victims or the gunman. FBI Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said they're working to identify the gunman's motive, adding that he is "relatively transient" but had roots in the area.
DeSarno also said the gunman had been arrested multiple times in the past but declined to give details.
An elder at the church told The New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard who responded to the shooter, calling him a dear friend.

Sleepy LaBeef Dies at 84; Versatile Rockabilly Artist Known for Rollicking Sets

Texto completo: He never had what would be considered a hit record. But he gained a following for his ever-changing live shows and constant touring.
Sleepy LaBeef, an early and enduring rockabilly artist who helped fuel a resurgence of that genre in the 1970s and '80s, especially with his propulsive live shows, died on Thursday at his home in Siloam Springs, Ark. He was 84.
His daughter Jessie Mae Lynn LaBeff confirmed his death. A cause was not given.
In 1991, at which point Mr. LaBeef was 35 years into his musical career, The New York Times called him "a living, breathing, guitar-picking history of American music." He claimed to know 6,000 songs and played, as he put it at the time, "root music: old-time rock 'n' roll, Southern gospel and hand-clapping music, black blues, Hank Williams-style country."
Elvis Presley was a contemporary (six months older), and, like Presley, Mr. LaBeef made his first records in the 1950s. He was living in Texas at the time, recording on small labels there, but in the mid-1960s he moved to Nashville. Eventually he signed with Presley's original label, Sun Records.
In the 1970s and '80s Mr. LaBeef maintained a particularly exhausting touring schedule -- 200 to 300 shows a year -- playing clubs all over the United States and also finding surprising success in Europe, which embraced rockabilly.
"He has played bullrings in Portugal in Spain," The Boston Globe wrote in 1983, "music halls in Germany, Italy and England, and a festival in Finland within earshot of the Soviet Union."
He continued to record and perform until recently, working a rich basso profundo voice and an onstage versatility that made each show unique. He made a point of adjusting his sets to the mood of his audience, throwing in more blues, or more upbeat rock, or whatever, as needed.
"I don't plan anything," he told the music writer Peter Guralnick, who devoted a chapter to him in his book "Lost Highway: Journeys and Arrivals of American Musicians" (1979). "It's all trial and error, I guess. If the first two or three things don't work, then we just move around and try something else."
Bobby Rich, one of many drummers who backed him, once said, "Every night he'll play songs I've never heard, and I follow the best I can."
Thomas Paulsley LaBeff was born on July 20, 1935, in Smackover, Ark. "Sleepy" was bestowed upon him by schoolmates because of his droopy eyelids; "LaBeef" was the later suggestion of one of his early record companies.
He was the youngest of 10 children. His father, Charles, was a farmer who later worked the oil fields, and his mother, Jessie (Coke) LaBeff, was a homemaker.
He said his upbringing in the United Pentecostal Church was his strongest musical influence. He left school in eighth grade. At 14, according to "Lost Highway," he traded a rifle to his brother-in-law for a guitar, and soon he was playing in church.
He moved to Houston at 18 for a land surveyor job and in 1954 married Louise Barstow. The two of them sang in gospel groups around town. Hearing Presley's first Sun records, recorded in 1954, was a revelation.
"I said: 'Hey, this is crazy. This is what I'm singing,"' he told The Boston Globe in 1983. "Except he was singing blues lyrics and country lyrics with the same gospel beat I was using."
Mr. LaBeef switched to secular music and began playing and recording in Texas, work that caught the interest of Columbia Records in Nashville, which signed him in 1964. By the end of the decade he had switched to the Plantation label. He had also managed an unusual career detour: He acted in a low-budget 1968 movie called "The Exotic Ones," also marketed under the title "The Monster and the Stripper." The plot: Hunters capture a swamp monster and exhibit it at a strip club. Mr. LaBeef, who was an imposing 6-foot-6, played the monster.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. LaBeef never had what would be considered a hit record, though "Every Day," a 1968 Columbia single, and "Blackland Farmer," released by Plantation in 1971, briefly made the country charts. His albums for Sun included "Western Gold" (1976) and "Downhome Rockabilly" (1979). He also released albums on Rounder and other labels.
But he was always defined more by his performances than by his recordings. The vast repertoire, he said, came naturally.
"I don't know why," he said, "I used to just listen to a song twice on the jukebox, and I'd have it."
In addition to living in Arkansas, Texas and Tennessee, Mr. LaBeef spent a stretch of years in Massachusetts -- the result, as he told the story, of a disastrous road trip. Heading out of Maine, bound for a show at Alan's Fifth Wheel Lounge in Amesbury, Mass., on New Year's Day 1977, his tour bus caught fire.
His clothes and many other possessions were destroyed, though the bus was somehow still operable enough that he made it to Amesbury and played the show. The club's owners offered him a room and an open-ended booking. He stayed in Amesbury for years before returning to Arkansas.
It was at the Fifth Wheel that Mr. Guralnick, who lived nearby, first went with a friend to see Mr. LaBeef.
"I had traveled thousands of miles to hear music like this, played in just this kind of setting," he wrote, "and as Sleepy ran through what must have been a typical set (featuring everything from Muddy Waters to Webb Pierce to Elvis Presley and Little Richard), I turned to my friend, whose expression mirrored my own, and we both silently asked the question: Could this be for real?"
Mr. LaBeef's first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second marriage, to Oquita Richards. In 1978 he married Linda Sharon Cerny, who survives him, as do his daughter Jessie and three other daughters, Melody Burns, Melinda LaBeff and Tomie LaBeff; a son, Robert Jordan Spencer; 12 grandchildren; and a number of great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews and cousins.
In 2013, returning to Houston for a show, Mr. LaBeef told The Houston Chronicle that he was still occasionally adding songs to his repertoire, though he was wary of sending fans home disappointed that they hadn't heard their favorites.
"I know so many, and people want to hear this or that," he said. "They almost make the program up for me. But I like good music no matter where it comes from."

Texto completo: The company gets that many daily submissions to edit descriptions and details about products for sale on its site. How does it keep up?
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hi, This is Karen Weise, the tech correspondent for The New York Times in Seattle. Since the holiday shopping season is ending, it's not a bad time to talk about Amazon.
Let me start with a single, large number critical to the shopping experience on Amazon: five billion. Each day, Amazon gets five billion submissions to edit descriptions and details about the products for sale on its site. The edits come from the companies that fill Amazon's Everything Store.
That's 1.8 trillion edits a year that Amazon needs to sort through. Are they accurate or misleading? Do they follow Amazon's rules or even the law?
Some of the edits are simple updates to a product, or a company trying out new marketing. Others are tactics used to sabotage a competitor's products or add a certification, like Food and Drug Administration approval, that an item does not have.
If shopping on Amazon can feel a little chaotic -- duplicate listings, weird variations, descriptions that don't quite match a product -- this daily edit is a big reason.
I learned the importance of five billion from Amazon when I was reporting on what has happened in the two decades since Amazon began letting outside companies list goods on its site. The move sharply increased the selection customers can find when they type in Amazon.com, and now about 60 percent of Amazon's sales come from these outside merchants.
My article detailed how Amazon has squeezed more out of these suppliers over the years, making Amazon's services, like advertising and fulfillment, essential to succeeding on the site, often in ways that make it harder to do business elsewhere.
I heard so much about how companies scramble to respond when Amazon changes its rules, which it does to present customers with a coherent, consistent experience even as the selection and number of sellers have grown so large.
Amazon's decision to open its doors to outside sellers has been essential to its ability to get us almost anything in a matter of days, if not hours. It's what lets us turn to it with the random, near stream-of-consciousness list of things that pop into our heads. Though my memory is hazy, I'm pretty sure one of my family's first Prime Now orders came soon after my son was born: We got diapers, chocolate -- and vermouth for Negronis.
Like Facebook in its effort to sort out fake news, Amazon has turned to algorithms to organize and police its site, and said it was spending $ 400 million a year to do so. On Thursday, the company said that it had record holiday sales and that "billions of items were ordered worldwide."
Jeff Wilke, the chief executive of Amazon's consumer business, told me that the company's long-term future depended on patrolling the site without harming well-meaning merchants.
"We have a strong incentive to be as accurate as possible in identifying bad actors, make very few mistakes when we're wrong," he said, adding that Amazon also wants to give people second chances when they make an honest mistake.
People who have worked at Amazon's marketplace debate whether the company can build systems fast enough, and accurate enough, to keep up. Some say the gap is closing; others fear the rot may grow too fast to catch.
I find myself thinking of a conversation I had toward the beginning of the year with Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, a research company. "If the chaos continues, I don't know how long a consumer will be willing to put up with it," he said. "They are a marketplace of trust, and if you cannot trust it, the whole premise of Amazon completely evaporates."
That trust comes down to big decisions and little details, like those changes submitted five billion times a day.
Some stories you shouldn't miss

-
It's the end of an Uber era. The ride-hailing company's founder, Travis Kalanick, stepped down from its board after weeks of selling down his stake in Uber stock.
- Delivery, at a cost. Amazon is adding to its army of delivery drivers in a way that puts a priority on speed and cost over safety, ProPublica and BuzzFeed News found, citing internal documents and interviews. Amazon said that safety was a top priority and that last year it invested $ 55 million in "safety improvement projects."

ToTok, a popular messaging app, is secretly a surveillance tool run by the government of the United Arab Emirates, Mark Mazzetti, Nicole Perlroth and Ronen Bergman found. This was not a hack, but by design: Companies affiliated with Emirati intelligence created the app. (The Emirati government declined to comment for the article.)
- R.I.P., "Antennagate." The 2010 iPhone's struggle to make calls was No. 42 in The Verge's list of the top 84 tech flops of the decade. No. 1 was Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who undid net neutrality.

Texto completo: Melena Ryzik, a culture reporter for The New York Times, hosted a screening on Dec. 17 of "Just Mercy," a drama about a death row inmate who was wrongfully imprisoned. She spoke to the actors Michael B. Jordan ("Black Panther," "Creed," "Fruitvale Station") and Jamie Foxx ("Ray," "Django: Unchained"), as well as Bryan Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative and author of "Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption," which inspired the film. These are highlights from the conversation, edited for length. Above from left, Jordan and Foxx.
MELENA RYZIK Bryan, did you feel any trepidation about dramatizing these stories and your own story as well? BRYAN STEVENSON You have to be persuasive when you're trying to change the world. You can't just stand up and shout things and demand things. You have to go where people are. And Michael embraced that approach in the performance. MICHAEL B. JORDAN When I first met him, I was intimidated. I don't really get star-struck like that. But when I met Bryan, it was certain. RYZIK Jamie, you have said that you have known Michael since he was tiny. JAMIE FOXX Yeah, when he had little cornrows and a very little tank top. When we went to the movie, I took guys with me that were like, hardened. I know some thuglike guys that don't cry. And there was a point in that movie where I heard people weeping because of his performance. JORDAN Jamie is a big brother, man. When it comes to acting, he's to me one of the [greatest]; he's on Mount Rushmore. RYZIK Bryan, you were a producer on the movie and you were on set sometimes. Were there things that you needed to see? STEVENSON I completely trusted the entire cast. Michael came to Montgomery, Ala., and we spent a lot of time just talking about the weight of this history that gave rise to this. We've allowed our politicians to govern through fear and anger. That's what has given rise to mass incarceration. I mean I spent the first 20 years of my career in the court. I was undercover. I didn't want people to know what I was doing. I felt like to get people out of prison, to get people off death row, it was like operating the Underground Railroad. There's a smog in the air created by decades and centuries of racial inequality. I don't think slavery ended in 1865, I think it just evolved; it turned into decades of terrorism and violence and all of us were impacted by that. RYZIK I should mention that this is the first film that Warner Bros. has made with an inclusion rider, which means that it gave more opportunities to women, to people of color and other underprivileged groups, and that was Michael's doing.

'Cannot dismiss them': New York Times and Washington Post editors say Trump supporters deserve media's 'respect'

Texto completo: The executive editors of the New York Times and the Washington Post admitted that the publications "have to do better" when it comes to covering and understanding supporters of President Trump.
Joining Sunday's Meet the Press on NBC, New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet and Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron agreed that the papers should "respect" and not be "dismissive" of Trump supporters.
“I don’t want to be dismissive of people who support the president. I think they’re owed our respect, and they certainly have mine,” Baron said. “They feel that the so-called elites in Washington have not paid attention to them, that they don’t understand their lives ... They feel that the president is actually listening to them and addressing their concerns, and so they tend to believe him.”
"We have to do a better job understanding why some people support Donald Trump," Baquet added. "I agree with Marty; we can’t dismiss everybody that supports Donald Trump. I think we have to get out in America much more than we do and talk to people.”
He continued, "I think we cannot dismiss everybody who supported Donald Trump, and we just cannot dismiss them. First off, that’s not journalistically moral. It’s journalistically moral to reach out, understand the world, and to be read — that’s our job."

Trump has been critical of both outlets and their coverage of him during the course of his presidency so far. Earlier this year, he canceled the White House's subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post and has railed against reporters at both papers, something Baquet has said puts his reporters' "lives at risk."
Earlier this month, the New York Times endorsed Trump's impeachment.

2019 pop culture Top 10: Greta Thunberg, Lizzo, Baby Yoda

Texto completo: So long, 2019, the year of $2.8 billion in global box office for "Avengers: Endgame," four Oscars for "Bohemian Rhapsody," one hot priest in Amazon's "Fleabag," 19 consecutive weeks at the top of Billboard's Hot 100 for "Old Town Road," more than two million RSVPs to a Storm Area 51 invasion that never materialized, three decades shaved off Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci throuh digital de-aging in "The Irishman," and 115 presidential tweets in one day of House Judiciary Committee impeachment debate.
Whew, we actually made it through this exhausting litany of pop culture events? Indeed, thanks in no small part to these 10 high points that brought clarity, honesty and a modicum of joy to the big picture. And if 2020 is taking requests for numbers, how about everyone gets a 20-minute nap?
Greta Thunberg At 16, the girl from Sweden was named Time's 2019 Person of the Year for, among other things, motivating millions of people to take part in September's international climate strike, "the largest climate demonstration in human history." Whether addressing world leaders at the United Nations or clapping back at President Donald Trump's Twitter insults, Thunberg confronted adults with the message that climate change is real. So is the courage of this young activist, who's also become a role model for people with Asperger's syndrome. We're equally impressed and grateful that she's helping save the world from itself.
The 1619 Project Kudos to the New York Times for this major initiative to mark the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved people from Africa to the American colonies. Led by Times investigative journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, the project's superb collection of historical essays, literature, artwork and photography explored the awful legacy and lasting impact of slavery on everything from politics and transportation to health care and banking. The result didn't merely re-examine history, it drove home the fact that our country still needs to come face to face with the past in order to have a better, more just future.
Baby Yoda Forget for a moment that Disney+ is a corporate behemoth. Its new "Star Wars"-themed series "The Mandalorian" has given us Baby Yoda, the only thing besides a space alien invasion that could unite the partisan divide that is America. Just by peeking out from a blanket and sipping a cup of soup, Baby Yoda has inspired memes, song parodies and feelings of well-being and happiness known to last, oh, at least three minutes. Why does this child from Yoda's species represent something so special? Because "Star Wars" is ultimately about rebel alliances battling galactic empires. May the force of the adorable be with you.
'Surviving R. Kelly' and the R. Kelly interview The Lifetime docu-series (executive produced by Detroit's Dream Hampton) put a powerful spotlight on years of allegations of sexual abuse against young women and minors by the R&B superstar. What's happened since it aired? Kelly is now in prison without bond and facing state and federal charges. And who can forget Gayle King's remarkable composure during her interview with Kelly for CBS? His goal may have been damage control, but instead he stood in rage as King calmly sat and said, "Robert." Stay tuned for the premiere of "Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning" on Jan. 2.
'American Carnage' Written by Politico's Tim Alberta (a graduate of Brighton High and Michigan State University), this 600-plus-page book — subtitled "On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War and the Rise of President Trump" —takes a deep dive into the discord and revolt from within that has redefined the GOP. The New York Times praised Alberta for his "fascinating look at a Republican Party that initially scoffed at the incursion of a philandering reality-TV star with zero political experience and now readily accommodates him." The level of detail here, plus the vivid portraits of old-school leaders like John Boehner seeing their power evaporate, is as impressive as it is illuminating.
'Hustlers' The year in capitalism could be explained through charts and graphs, unemployment figures, interest rates and so on. Instead, might we suggest viewing it through the prism of this drama from director Lorene Scafaria that's based on a true story of strippers who scammed Wall Street dudes of their ill-gotten gains? Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu are wonderful as, respectively, the mastermind of the scheme and the novice who accepts the perks of credit card fraud. But who's really fleecing whom? As Lopez's character concludes in the final scene with a judgment worthy of an economics PhD, "This city, this whole country, is a strip club. You've got people tossing the money, and people doing the dance."
'Years and Years' This HBO miniseries deserves to be required viewing for anyone wondering what things could be like 15 years from now. That's the time frame covered by this look at the Lyons family of Manchester, England, as they face catastrophes — the firing of a nuclear bomb, a banking failure that wipes out savings, an immigration crisis that leads to heartbreaking personal loss — and scientific advancements that come with huge ethical questions. Toss in Emma Thompson as a politician named Vivienne Rook who makes Boris Johnson seem like an amateur at wreaking havoc and you've got a haunting cautionary tale.
Lizzo She is a voice for female empowerment and body positivity. She remains fearless in the face of controversy. She copes with the inevitable backlash against her success like, in her words, "a grown-ass woman." Lizzo is a pop-culture phenomenon who is here to stay. Leading the field with eight Grammy nods, she enters 2020 spreading her essential message: Never let anyone make you feel less than. We love her music, her attitude, and yes, that ultra-tiny designer bag she carried at the American Music Awards. It was sized to hold — how to put this for a family newspaper? — her regrets.
Daniel Dale's fact-checking Since moving from the Toronto Star to CNN in June, the Canadian journalist has become a cable news standout for his dogged fact-checking of the Oval Office occupant and other politicians. He's so thorough, he deserves to be nicknamed Tenacious D. Counting at least 21 falsehoods from Trump's impromptu press conference during recent NATO meetings, Dale wrote for CNN's website, "Embarking on a dishonesty blitz while at a foreign summit would be strange behavior for any other president. For Trump, long impervious to norms of propriety and accuracy, it was just another Tuesday." Here's hoping he continues to cover future presidents, be they Republicans or Democrats.
'When They See Us' and 'Chernobyl' One was a Netflix limited series from Ava DuVernay that dramatized the rush to judgment after a brutal crime and manipulative tactics that resulted in the 1990 conviction — and the 2002 exoneration — of the African-American teenage boys known as the Central Park Five. The other was an HBO limited series that traced the efforts of Soviet scientists to expose the full extent of a 1986 nuclear reactor disaster. So what did these two very different narratives have in common, besides being TV at its best? Their commitment to showing what happens when those in power distort the facts. Better than any civics lesson, they explained how the truth can save lives -- and our souls.

Texto completo: Restaurants open. Restaurants close. It is not an easy business. While a definitive statistic on how many new restaurants fail — it varies from 17 to a whopping 90 percent, according to different studies — when a restaurant closes, it's sad: sad for the neighborhood, sad for the restaurant and its employees, sad for diners. Here are the restaurants that closed over the past year that we mourn the most.
Chakra, Paramus For 15 years, noted owner-chef Thomas Ciszak has been offering elevated American food in his 180-seat dining room. Among the knock-out dishes were horseradish-crusted crab cake, chili cinnamon-glazed Chilean sea bass and flavorful Portuguese octopus. His wife, Evelyn, served as general manager, head mixologist and sommelier. But in August, the German-born chef, who also heads Blue Morel in Jersey City as well as restaurants in the South, closed his 7,000-square-foot Paramus landmark. According to Ciszak, the real estate and liquor license were worth more than what the restaurant could earn serving food and alcohol. He said that he does not expect another restaurant to move into the space.
He and his wife have just opened Brasserie Memere, a classic French spot at 107 Vervalen Street, Closter; brasserie-memere.com.
Houlihan's, Weehawken In early October, Houlihans, a chain restaurant frequented by chefs, abruptly closed its Weehawken location. The nationwide chain, headquartered in Kansas, said that it was closing because of an ongoing dispute with the landlord, developer Hartz Mountain. It is popular for its solid American fare cooked from scratch, including burgers, salads and soups.
There are 14 Houlihans in New Jersey. The one in Paramus recently had a makeover.
The Dog & Cask, Rochelle Park More than six years ago, Irishman David Parker introduced what he said was a true European gastropub, one that went beyond burgers and beer. His interest, he said, was "global street food." He said he knew that there were many restaurants in the region that serve traditional American food. His mission was to serve more "advanced items." And so Dog & Cask's menu featured items including grilled Portuguese octopus with basil aioli, sriracha salmon tartare and a charcuterie board. And of course beer: 20 taps, 10 devoted to local breweries' fare.
Still, in late October, the Dog & Cask shuttered and later was sold to the owners of Rumba Cubana, according to J.C. Kapas Real Estate Company, which closed the sale. It is not clear when a Rumba Cubana may open.
17 Summer, Lodi it wasn't the typical location for a fine-dine restaurant. Yet brother-and-sister team Joseph and Jenna Cuccina, Lodi residents, opened their BYOB in their town's working-class residential neighborhood — and it was thrilling. The Record gave it 31/2-out-of-4 stars in a review, with shout-outs for its superb pasta, terrific homemade bread and divine blood-orange olive oil cake. In 2016, a year after opening the restaurant, the James Beard Foundation named Joseph, who suffers with Celiac disease (he can sample his pasta, but not eat lots of it), a semifinalist for Rising Star Chef of the Year. He was then 28 years old. He trained his sister, who took care of the front of the house and everything else, to cook and for the past year or so she joined him in the kitchen.
Yet this September they closed their restaurant. What they plan next is not known.
Pig & Prince, Montclair Chef Michael Carrino, a Food Network "Chopped" champion, reigned over one of the most stunning restaurants in Montclair: Pig & Prince. The New American restaurant was housed in an old station house of Montclair's Lackawana Station, boasting soaring ceiling, red brick walls, a big long bar and huge metal chandeliers. The restaurant, which opened seven years ago, received three stars from New Jersey Monthly magazine and a "Worth It" from the New York Times. Several months after closing, Carrino opened a fresh pasta shop in Nutley, Mike's Pasta and Sandwich Shoppe, with his business partner, Mike Cosenza, who was his sous chef at Pig & Prince.
It's not clear what will happen to the space; it's a historic site.
Talde, Jersey City He may live in North Jersey — Fort Lee, specifically — but celebrity chef, cookbook author and "Top Chef" contestant Dale Talde closed his only New Jersey spot in October just as he opened a new restaurant in Westchester. His first Talde, located in Park Slope, Brooklyn, had closed a while ago. Talde and his business partners dissolved their seven-year-old restaurant group Three Kings this year and Talde and his wife Agnes (the two have a little boy) have started their own company, Food Crush Hospitality, in hopes of opening restaurants and look into other opportunities, perhaps a TV show.
The Filipino-American chef's latest venture, Goosefeather in Tarrytown, NY, serves modern Cantonese food.
Twisted Elm, Elmwood Park With seemingly no warning in late July, The Twisted Elm in Elmwood Park, one of the first gastropubs in North Jersey, closed. It opened in 2011. Last year, its burger was named one of Bergen's best by NorthJersey.com and The Record. It had many fans, many taken by surprise.
Said one Reddit commenter: "RIP great beers and vegan food 5 minutes from my job. I was there on their last night and didn't even know."
Tillie's, Short Hills It may have served the best key lime pie in North Jersey, plus some really good seasonal food, but after five years, Karen and Wirt Cook closed their 45-seat restaurant in Short Hills. The couple had been doing everything themselves — they didn't even have a dishwasher. Plus since they opened, they became parents to four kids. October 26 was the restaurant's last day of service.
Wirt Cook today is executive chef of Sojo Spa Club in Edgewater. Karen Cook is on her way to becoming a nurse.
Osteria Radici, Allentown It may not have been located in North Jersey, but Osteria Radici, the acclaimed BYO restaurant in Allentown, is too important for the Garden State not to bemoan its death, no matter where you live. On Oct. 19, chef and owner Randy Forrester closed his award-winning Italian restaurant, which four months after he opened it was named a semifinalist for Best New Restaurant by the James Beard Foundation.
This year, Forrester himself was nominated Best Chef Mid-Atlantic. Forrester said he closed his 18-seat restaurant because, among other reasons, it was too difficult to make money without a liquor license. "We think about wine, cocktails and beer the same way we think about food," he told The Record. "We want to be able to offer these things along with our dishes." The restaurant closed on Oct. 19, two years after it opened. Forrester moved to Portland, Maine, to pursue new opportunities.
Blue Moon, Woodcliff Lake After nearly two decades, Blue Moon Mexican Cafe in Woodcliff Lake closed in early October. Owner Howard Felixbrod closed the Mexican restaurant reportedly because of a higher minimum wage and app-based food delivery services. Another Mexican restaurant is scheduled to take its place. Still open are the Blue Moon locations in Englewood, Wyckoff and Bronxville, New York.
Biggie's, Ramsey After six years in Ramsey, seafood restaurant Biggie's Clam Bar is no more. The second expansion of the longtime Hoboken company into Bergen County closed as did the original Biggie's. The only one remaining is on Route 17 in Carlstadt.

Obamacare ruling deserves to take center stage in presidential election Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: In ducking its opportunity to rule on the constitutionality of the entire Affordable Care Act, a federal appeals court has done a large favor for President Trump and the Republican Party. But it leaves millions of people in uncertainty and anxiety. It was unnecessary and unethical.
By sending the case back to the district judge in Texas who had ruled against Obamacare, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals virtually guaranteed that it won't reach the Supreme Court in time for a final decision before the November election.
That lets Trump and his party off the hook, inviting them to duck the issue during the campaign, rather than level with the voters on how - or whether - they would replace what the courts might eventually throw out.
Make no mistake: Trump and the Republicans want the court to trash Obamacare, but not in time for the voters to hold it against them in November. And no matter the potentially drastic, even deadly, consequences for everyone who depends on its coverage.
That's virtually everyone in America, not just the 11.4 million who obtained health insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces or the 13.6 million who were added to the Medicaid rolls in the 36 states and District of Columbia where, unlike Florida, human lives outweigh right-wing ideology.
The Affordable Care Act also guarantees private insurance coverage despite pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, allows children to remain on parental health plans until they are 26, makes insurance companies return excess profits, forbids them from canceling policies except for fraud, bars lifetime limits on benefits, and requires large employers to offer insurance to their workers.
Trump put the federal government on the side of Florida and 16 other states, all controlled by Republicans, that joined with three individuals suing to have the entire law discarded.
Former Attorney General Pam Bondi, who now works for Trump, put Florida on the wrong side of that litigation. Her successor, Ashley Moody, keeps us there.
Moody owes it to the people to say how much or how little of Obamacare she would have her party replace if the courts eventually overturn it. Everyone running for office next year, from the president to the Congress to the state legislatures should also have their answers at the ready.
Health care topped all other issues in an exit poll of voters in the 2018 mid-terms, which returned the House to Democratic control, and is second in the current campaign only to Trump's impeachment.
The Fifth Circuit's decision is glaring in two respects.
* The trial judge, Reed O. Connor in the Northern District of Texas, had already declared all of Obamacare unconstitutional because Congress repealed the tax charged to people who did not obtain insurance. Upon upholding only that part of his decision, the appeals court sent it back to him to explain his reasoning about the rest. That was unnecessary - an act of judicial laziness if not worse.
* The 2-1 split in the panel illustrated the worsening politicization of the federal judiciary along ideological and partisan lines. The two judges in the majority owe their appointments to Presidents George W. Bush and Trump, and both are or have been members of the Federalist Society, the rigidly right-wing organization that has become the gatekeeper for judicial appointments under Trump.
The dissenter, Senior Judge Carolyn Dineen King, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, rebuked the Texas judge for accepting a case in which there was no real violation of anyone's rights. Without the tax, she reasoned, the mandate was already unenforceable; Florida and the 16 other plaintiff states had nothing at stake at all. She would have overturned the district court's order "because none of the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the coverage requirement.
"And although I would not reach the merits on remedial issues, if I did, I would conclude that the coverage requirement is constitutional, albeit unenforceable, and entirely severable from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act."
Without the tax, she wrote, the law "does not do anything or bind anyone." What was left of the coverage requirement "does nothing more than require individuals to pay zero dollars to the IRS if they do not purchase health insurance, which is to say it does nothing at all."
She criticized her colleagues for not rejecting "textbook judicial overreach."
Congress, she emphasized, had made its intent plain by repealing only the tax, not any of the other elements of the law that have proved popular.
What they should know is that the requirement they repealed has since been credited with saving some 700 lives. That's the estimate in a working paper by Treasury Department economists based on mortality rates and on the numbers of people who appeared to have purchased health insurance after the IRS told them they had been fined for not having it. The New York Times reported the story Dec. 10.
This week, Florida Phoenix reported that an estimated 2,700 Floridians aged 55 to 64 died between 2014 and 2017 on account of Florida's refusal to extend Medicaid to 500,000 people who are in the coverage gap between eligibility for Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies.
So it bears remembering that human lives are at stake in what might seem to be an arcane legal battle over federal jurisprudence. Also, ours is the only industrialized democracy that does not regard health care as an inalienable human right.

Texto completo: Linda Celeste Sims, the Alvin Ailey dancer, talks about pouring her life experience into a riveting performance of "Cry."
Every so often a great dancer transcends her own brilliance, somehow expanding its outer limit. Last week at City Center, Linda Celeste Sims, a member of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for 24 years, did just that in a rapturous performance of Ailey's 1971 "Cry," a 16-minute solo dedicated "to all black women everywhere -- especially our mothers."
This season Ms. Sims, 43, danced the work for the first time as a mother -- she gave birth to her first child, Ellington, in May -- and something shifted.
"I went deep, I went really deep," she said in a telephone interview on Thursday, reflecting on her performance the night before. "It almost felt like I wasn't performing for you, I was actually just speaking from my body."
"I kind of was in a zone," she added, "in a very spiritual zone." The audience was right there with her.
Ailey choreographed "Cry" as a birthday present for his mother, Lula Elizabeth Cooper. Its three sections -- to music by Alice Coltrane, Laura Nyro and the Voices of East Harlem -- carry the soloist through states of grieving and rejoicing. In the opening section, the dancer's manipulations of a long white cloth call up images of domestic labor, maternal care and regal independence. The sorrow of the second section turns to euphoria in the third, as she flings and kicks up her white ruffled skirt to the chant of "right on, be free."
Judith Jamison, who first danced the solo, described her interpretation of the role in an interview with The New York Times in 2000: "I was to be a woman who did the most servile of work but was never defeated by it. I was a mother protecting her children. I was a queen who'd come from Africa." The dancers who have inherited the solo, Ms. Sims among them, are coached to draw from personal experience to access its emotional depths.
Ms. Sims -- who is married to Glenn Allen Sims, also a longtime Ailey dancer -- spoke about pouring her life experience into a performance as electric for her as it was for those watching. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How did you feel before going onstage last night?
I started crying because I was going so deep in emotion. I was like, O.K., you can't start crying before you start the piece because then you won't get through it -- we need to focus. It just came up, and I'm glad I was able to share that with the audience, because it's sometimes a scary part of being a dancer, to be very vulnerable.
How has being a mother changed your relationship to "Cry"?
I've probably done the piece for over 15 years, close to 20, and it has never felt so full of nonstop emotion. I lost my dad last year. He passed away in May, and it's interesting because my husband and I were trying to conceive a child for about a year and a half, and a month after my father passed away, I got pregnant. It was almost like where there's death, there's life.
So I have all of that emotion of losing someone who you really love and you're very close to. But when you have your own child, it's like a new understanding of what love means, you know?
And all of that came into your performance?
There are lots of little bits of the piece where I feel that I go into a dark place, and I was able to actually open those channels and allow it to happen. I was using all the struggle, the pain, the no sleep, the stress, the happiness, the joy -- everything that I experienced in these past eight months and before.
I was a little bit out of breath, but that's O.K. -- I felt like I got through it pretty good, and besides that, I felt good inside, I felt good in my heart.
Were you thinking about your son?
There are parts of the piece where I'm carrying the cloth and it's like, it could be his body. What if he dies?
Alvin choreographed the piece for his mother, but who knows what she actually went through. There are a lot of weighty gestures, weighty movements in the piece. So I try to imagine: What if that was my child? What if that was my child that was murdered? What if that was my child being abused?
What other moments are especially meaningful for you?
Every time the second song begins [Laura Nyro's "Been on a Train"], it's very emotional for me. "Been on a train," she says. "Baby, did you hear the whistle blow?" It's gentle but you can hear the pain in it. She sings it like she's whispering it almost. And for some reason it reminds me of -- you've been on a journey in life, and even though you think you've experienced everything, pain and agony and loss of loved ones, life will always bring you more.
This was your second "Cry" this season. Was the first as intense?
The first time I didn't let it go all the way. I think I was afraid it wouldn't read to the audience. But I thought: Why am I holding just that little, like, 30 percent of it, why am I still holding on to that? I said, There's no room for that today. I just want to be honest.
How have you felt physically, coming back to dancing after pregnancy?
My approach is: Be gentle with your body. I look at my body now and I'm like, I've got a different shape. As dancers we think we have to look a certain way, we have to be cut, we have to be thin. No. It's not about that. I'm happy. This body has given life, and I look at myself and love myself even more. This is it, this is me.

Texto completo: The live-action Pokémon feature, starring Ryan Reynolds, airs on HBO. And Sam Mendes's feature directorial debut is available to stream.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's on TV
POKÉMON DETECTIVE PIKACHU (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. The first live-action movie based on the Pokemon franchise is sure to please fans of the video game series -- less so film buffs. Tim (Justice Smith) arrives in Ryme City, where Pokémon and humans coexist, after his father, who is a detective, seemingly died in a car accident. He meets the fuzzy and adorable title character (voiced by an amusing Ryan Reynolds), who suspects Tim's father may not be dead. The pair team up with a young journalist (Kathryn Newton) and search the city's seedy streets for answers. The movie, directed by Rob Letterman, places colorful Pokémon creatures in a neo-noir ascetic, a juxtaposition that recalls "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" (1988). While that adds some visual eye-candy, most critics have said the film could have used a more ambitious plot.
What's Streaming
AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999) Stream on Amazon or Hulu; rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. With Sam Mendes's Golden Globe-nominated war drama "1917" in theaters this week, revisit his feature directorial debut, "American Beauty," before it leaves Amazon Prime Video and Hulu on Dec. 31. Lester (Kevin Spacey) is an advertising executive in the suburbs who is going through a midlife crisis. He's drowning in his own sorrow until he meets his daughter's cheerleader friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and becomes infatuated with her. As he tries to impress her, other plotlines unfold. New neighbors move in, his daughter starts a relationship and his wife has an affair. The characters' lives come together in a powerful climax, which leaves the moral of the story up to interpretation. The film made a splash when it first opened 20 years ago, taking home five Oscars, including best picture.
BETTER THINGS Stream on Hulu. The highs and lows (well, mostly lows) of aging take center stage in the third season of this dramedy series, now available on Hulu. The creator, director and star Pamela Adlon plays Sam, an actress and single mother of three in Los Angeles who is confronting menopause and her 50th birthday. Her children are going through their own changes: leaving for college, getting their periods, smoking marijuana. This is the first season Adlon worked on alone after her co-creator, Louis C.K., left the show in 2017. In his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik named the season a Critic's Pick and wrote that the series "kept its voice while taking on a structure that's ingeniously both impressionistic and more cohesive." The show is set to return for a fourth run next year.
HOT GIMMICK: GIRL MEETS BOY (2019) Stream on Netflix. In this Japanese drama, teenager Hatsumi (Miona Hori) is manipulated by her neighbor Ryoki (Hiroya Shimizu) and forced to become his slave. When Hatsumi's handsome childhood friend Azusa (Mizuki Itagaki) moves back to town, they start to date. But Ryoki's jealousy and Azusa's ulterior motives prove dangerous.

Crosswords are a science for student at Hopkins

Texto completo: During finals this month, Johns Hopkins University students were busy trying to solve a crossword puzzle. The key question: What America's first research university is not named.
If they knew the answer " the most common blunder people make when referring to the school, calling it 'John' Hopkins " then they were off, recognizing that dropping an 's' out of some of the answers would help them solve the whole, Hopkins-themed 'Solve for S' puzzle.
Usually the president of Johns Hopkins, like most college leaders, sends a video at the holidays thanking members of the university community for all their contributions. This year, Ronald J. Daniels sent everyone a crossword puzzle, one built by a graduate student in cognitive science whose research interests dovetail with this hobby. Tom McCoy studies computational linguistics and is a puzzle constructor of such skill that he has had multiple crosswords published in the New York Times. He agreed to craft a puzzle that gives lots of shout-outs to his school.
Such as: What a particle discovered by a team including Johns Hopkins physicists is not named. (Answer: Higg boson.)
'I thought it was brilliant,' said Pedro Ribeiro, spokesman for the Association of American Universities, who has seen a lot of year-end videos come across his desk over the years. It can be hard to convey a message in a way that grabs attention and speaks to all of a university's constituencies. 'It was innovative, charming, a thoughtful way of engaging the university community.'
Ribeiro also had some advice: Don't try to do it in pen.
Some of the questions are far easier for people with a Hopkins connection, but some clues include hints, such as, 'JHU-run gifted education program that sounds like a body of water plus a beverage plus a question.' (The answer is the acronym commonly used for the school's Center for Talented Youth.)
Or: 'Sport JHU excels in, with a crossword term as its middle six letters.'
Within just a few days, 21,000 people had looked at the puzzle online " spending an average of more than 40 minutes on the page " and 1,800 people had solved the puzzle.
'I was very proud to have this crossword make it onto the meme page' that students run, McCoy said. 'That's a very different kind of recognition than I usually get.'
Those who solved the puzzle got a congratulatory video from Daniels and his wife applauding, and a certificate that had some students joking on social media that with this diploma they could go home, skipping final exams.
McCoy loves Hopkins, which he chose in part because of his faculty advisers, so he enjoyed making the puzzle. It was difficult because he was trying to fit so many school-related words in that he worried the last ones would be aggravatingly obscure, random crossword-y words with lots of vowels like 'etui' (a French needle case, obviously) and 'Omoo' (the super-popular Herman Melville novel).
He grew up solving crosswords with his large family and started designing them in high school. At the same time, he was entering competitions that used logic puzzles to solve linguistics problems " and puzzling over the curious local dialect in his hometown of Pittsburgh.
By the time he was at Yale University, he knew what he wanted to study. And he got an idea for a crossword from a class there, in which a professor explained there are very few words in English that sound the same " except for the stress placed on a syllable " but have very different meanings, such as 'conquered' and 'concurred.' That led McCoy to try to think of puns such as, 'Summary of an easy negotiation,' when the phrase was, 'I came, I saw, I concurred.'
'If you're a linguist or a crossword constructor,' McCoy said, 'part of your brain is analyzing every part of language you encounter.'
Kyle Mahowald, a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at Stanford University, pursues academic questions similar to those considered by McCoy " and also makes crosswords. He said he knows McCoy through his research and his puzzles, both of which he admires. Making a crossword draws on computational, quantitative skills and a more creative linguistic side, he said.
'There's a similar mixture that goes into being a computational linguistics researcher,' with lots of coding, math and empirical work, Mahowald said. 'It certainly helps to have a love of language and be interested in the quirks of language.'
Paul Smolensky, a professor of cognitive science at Johns Hopkins, a partner researcher at Microsoft and one of McCoy's academic advisers, said the theoretical learning McCoy does 'is really a puzzle-solving exercise: You see a pattern in a set of words or a pattern in a set of sentences. You have to try to figure out what the rules are that explain the patterns.'
The field of cognitive science itself is a puzzle, Smolensky said, piecing together what has been learned about the mind from linguistics, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, philosophy and computer science with the development of artificial intelligence. And because the questions raised are difficult to measure and observe directly, cognitive scientists have to be creative in devising ways to try to understand what people are thinking, like watching where babies look to glean what grabs their attention.
'Tom himself,' he added, 'is truly exceptional and amazing.'

Obamacare ruling should take center stage Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: In ducking its opportunity to rule on the constitutionality of the entire Affordable Care Act, a federal appeals court has done a large favor for President Trump and the Republican Party. But it leaves millions of people in uncertainty and anxiety. It was unnecessary and unethical.
By sending the case back to the district judge in Texas who had ruled against Obamacare, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals virtually guaranteed that it won't reach the Supreme Court in time for a final decision before the November election.
That lets Trump and his party off the hook, inviting them to duck the issue during the campaign, rather than level with the voters on how - or whether - they would replace what the courts might eventually throw out.
Make no mistake: Trump and the Republicans want the court to trash Obamacare, but not in time for the voters to hold it against them in November. And no matter the potentially drastic, even deadly, consequences for everyone who depends on its coverage.
That's virtually everyone in America, not just the 11.4 million who obtained health insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces or the 13.6 million who were added to the Medicaid rolls in the 36 states and District of Columbia where, unlike Florida, human lives outweigh right-wing ideology.
The Affordable Care Act also guarantees private insurance coverage despite preexisting medical conditions such as diabetes, allows children to remain on parental health plans until they are 26, makes insurance companies return excess profits, forbids them from canceling policies except for fraud, bars lifetime limits on benefits, and requires large employers to offer insurance to their workers.
Trump put the federal government on the side of Florida and 16 other states, all controlled by Republicans, that joined with three individuals suing to have the entire law discarded.
Former Attorney General Pam Bondi, who now works for Trump, put Florida on the wrong side of that litigation. Her successor, Ashley Moody, keeps us there.
Moody owes it to the people to say how much or how little of Obamacare she would have her party replace if the courts eventually overturn it.
Everyone running for office next year, from the president to the Congress to the state legislatures should also have their answers at the ready.
Health care topped all other issues in an exit poll of voters in the 2018 mid-terms, which returned the House to Democratic control, and is second in the current campaign only to Trump's impeachment.
The Fifth Circuit's decision is glaring in two respects.
*The trial judge, Reed O. Connor in the Northern District of Texas, had already declared all of Obamacare unconstitutional because Congress repealed the tax charged to people who did not obtain insurance. Upon upholding only that part of his decision, the appeals court sent it back to him to explain his reasoning about the rest. That was unnecessary - an act of judicial laziness if not worse.
*The 2-1 split in the panel illustrated the worsening politicization of the federal judiciary along ideological and partisan lines. The two judges in the majority owe their appointments to Presidents George W. Bush and Trump, and both are or have been members of the Federalist Society, the rigidly right-wing organization that has become the gatekeeper for judicial appointments under Trump.
The dissenter, Senior Judge Carolyn Dineen King, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, rebuked the Texas judge for accepting a case in which there was no real violation of anyone's rights. Without the tax, she reasoned, the mandate was already unenforceable; Florida and the 16 other plaintiff states had nothing at stake at all. She would have overturned the district court's order "because none of the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the coverage requirement.
"And although I would not reach the merits on remedial issues, if I did, I would conclude that the coverage requirement is constitutional, albeit unenforceable, and entirely severable from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act."
Without the tax, she wrote, the law "does not do anything or bind anyone." What was left of the coverage requirement "does nothing more than require individuals to pay zero dollars to the IRS if they do not purchase health insurance, which is to say it does nothing at all."
She criticized her colleagues for not rejecting "textbook judicial overreach."
Congress, she emphasized, had made its intent plain by repealing only the tax, not any of the other elements of the law that have proved popular.
Did some of those voting to repeal the tax have a deeper, sinister motive in mind? Were they trying to expose all of Obamacare to constitutional challenge?
Only they know. What they also should know is that the requirement they repealed has since been credited with saving some 700 lives.
That's the estimate in a working paper by Treasury Department economists based on mortality rates and on the numbers of people who appeared to have purchased health insurance after the IRS told them they had been fined for not having it. The New York Times reported the story Dec. 10.
This week, Florida Phoenix reported that an estimated 2,700 Floridians aged 55 to 64 died between 2014 and 2017 on account of Florida's refusal to extend Medicaid to 500,000 people who are in the coverage gap between eligibility for Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies.
So it bears remembering that human lives are at stake in what might seem to be an arcane legal battle over federal jurisprudence.
Also, ours is the only industrialized democracy that does not regard health care as an inalienable human right.

Yes, I have a personal stake on the climate, and so do you

Texto completo: For the Monitor
In a recent opinion piece (Monitor, Dec. 21), I was attacked for opposing the Granite Bridge pipeline, a multi-decade investment in fracked natural gas that will cost New Hampshire ratepayers of Liberty Utilities over $400 million and worsen the climate crisis compared to clean alternatives available today.
Although I clearly stated that I “work on clean energy” and have made my positions and affiliations abundantly clear for years, the writer called me “underhanded” and insisted I was opposing Granite Bridge for “personal financial interest.”
As a longtime advocate for public ethics and transparency, I do not take such accusations lightly. I therefore welcome this opportunity to explain my personal reasons for opposing this and any other long-term investment in fossil fuels. I also invite the author to disclose whether his piece was written by himself or the Granite Bridge lobbyist with whom he works, who leveled the very same accusations against me prior to publication.
Like generations of my family before me, I have been committed to environmental protection since growing up in the woods and mountains of New Hampshire. When I took a defining college course on climate change in 2003, I determined there was no more urgent issue facing our planet and began a 13-year effort to stop fossil fuel money, and other special interests, from corrupting our politics as a nonprofit campaign reformer in NH. Sadly, I did not succeed, as the millions of dollars in donations from big oil, gas, and coal – and billions in resulting taxpayer subsidies – make painfully clear each year.
My failure to bring about systemic change in politics led me to seek a different path for climate action after 2016. I joined an employee-owned Benefit Corporation and began helping N.H. towns and nonprofits say no to fossil fuels by harnessing N.H.'s abundant solar resource. (Contrary to my critic's unsupported claims, research shows that N.H. could meet 100% of its energy needs year-round with clean renewables while cutting costs for all).
The founders of my company, ReVision Energy, graciously agreed to let me keep speaking out on matters of concern to me, regardless of whether they help or hurt our business. In this case, the cost of opposing a major N.H. utility and its many political allies in Concord likely outweigh the benefits of advancing heat pumps, which total just 2.8% of ReVision's N.H. sales (contrary to the author's claim, I do not sell heat pumps).
In an effort to walk the talk, my wife and I also set out to invest our family's savings in transitioning off fossil fuels through solar panels, electric vehicles, and heat pumps. Although my critic insists (again without evidence) that they do not work well in the cold, I am pleased to offer him something more than the several independent studies I previously cited: an invitation to spend a winter night with us and judge for himself (lasagna and apple crisp on me)!
As for Granite Bridge, before taking my position I spent hours listening to the pipeline's lobbyist at Liberty Utilities and reading the studies he sent (commissioned by the utility). Then I re-examined the independent research on fracked gas, pipeline explosions and fugitive methane emissions, which are 86 times more potent than CO2 at warming the planet and effectively negate the global warming “benefits” of gas versus oil and coal, according to peer-reviewed research in the journal Nature and many other publications. As the New York Times reported just this month, “natural gas…has become the biggest driver of emissions growth globally” thanks in part to a recent jump in gas flaring. New pipelines simply cannot solve the climate crisis, as my critic claims.
Finally, I re-examined the hidden costs of climate damage, which the International Monetary Fund estimates at $649 billion in the United States, or $2.7 billion in New Hampshire every year. I considered the $645 million in N.H. coastal property threatened by rising seas and the many premature deaths and unnecessary hospitalizations Granite Staters suffer from fossil fuel pollution and Lyme disease in a climate that is already warming far faster than predicted.
All of which brings me back to the reason I was attacked for opposing Granite Bridge: self-interest. The truth is, I do have a personal stake in stopping new fossil fuel investments wherever they occur – and so do you. For the good of my three young kids and yours, I refuse to be silent about the mounting climate crisis or the emerging clean tech solutions to which I have chosen to dedicate my public career in a manner that is anything but “disingenuous” or “underhanded.”
As for my presumed opponent in this debate, I wish him and his union well, and look forward to the day when New Hampshire policies allow us to put thousands more union tradesmen to work building the clean energy future our kids and climate demand, as neighboring states have shown.

Texto completo: When the world seems to be spinning off its axis, count on the internet to throw a shiny piece of cheese in your face and snap you back to reality. The cheese-toss was only one weird practice popularized via social media in 2019, when users managed to take a break from their indignations du jour. Memes, challenges and quizzes entranced us in wave after wave as the year passed. We got older. We wallowed in wrong answers. We branded our summer -- twice. And ultimately we fell for something really, really cute. Here's a good chunk of what we were obsessed with online in 2019.
The Egg
On Jan. 4, a new Instagram account posted the unremarkable stock photo above and stated its raison d'etre. "Let's set a world record together and get the most liked post on Instagram. Beating the current world record held by Kylie Jenner (18 million)! We got this," the caption read. The mission was accomplished within 10 days, and by December the simple photo had nearly 54 million likes -- proof that people have way too much time on their hands. The egg was later featured in a PSA created by the ad exec who started the account and funded by Hulu. It aimed to raise mental health awareness.

White Claw summer
White Claw hard seltzer has been around since 2016, but in 2019 we got a full-on White Claw summer. In July, the phrase "Ain't no laws when you're drinking claws" spread with an assist from YouTube comedian Trevor Wallace. There was a rash of memes, videos, outrageous drinking contests, T-shirts and, eventually, Halloween costumes. There was even a shortage that might not have been a shortage after all. The multiflavored spiked seltzers' relatively low alcohol and caloric content, plus the product being coincidentally gluten-free, made White Claw a marvel among millennials -- or at least that was the running joke.
--
Hot girl summer
Yup, 2019 had a choice of two summers. In May, Megan Thee Stallion released her first album, "Fever," tagging herself a "hot girl," and it grew from there. A couple of months later she coined "hot girl summer," solidifying a lifestyle trend. Gals, guys, playlists, TV shows, celebrities and brands were all celebrating their nongendered #hotgirlsummer. The rapper tweeted a midseason explanation: "Being a Hot Girl is about being unapologetically YOU, having fun, being confident, living YOUR truth, being the life of the party etc." And, you know, memes and selfies and stuff. Around the time kids were prepping to head back to school, "Hot Girl Meg" dropped the very explicit song "Hot Girl Summer," featuring Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign. The trademarking process is ongoing.
--
Wrong answer
Now this was a social game anyone could get behind: Post a picture and pose a question, then demand wrong answers only. "Name this movie." "Who is this?" "What does this person do for a living?" "What is happening here?" Wrong answers only. It was a flat-out invitation for punch lines, a kind of Cards Against Humanity for the social media set. Though this wasn't the first time the concept had popped up online, the meme went viral on Twitter and beyond over the summer. There were some splendid results, especially in the "name this movie" category.
--
Bottle cap challenge
With mystical beginnings involving a taekwondo instructor whose Instagram account is now private, the bottle cap challenge was born in late June. Days later, John Mayer and then Jason Statham made it mainstream with slo-mo videos of themselves roundhouse-kicking caps off of bottles. Suddenly everyone was kicking. The challenge sucked in lots of celebrities, including Justin Bieber, Lizzo and Ryan Reynolds, who tried his kick on an Aviation Gin bottle cap. Mariah Carey even sang one off. Oh, yeah, real people did the challenge too. Then Kendall Jenner ruined everything when she rode up on a jet ski and kicked a bottle cap into the ocean.
--
FaceApp
First people loved it. Then they were terrified by it. When a new FaceApp filter went viral in July, normal and famous folks alike were initially delighted to show off what they would look like in their old age. More than 150 million people worldwide downloaded the app. Then some folks freaked out at the suggestion that the app might gain access to all of a user's photos, not just a single picture uploaded for aging. Turns out that wasn't true, but it sort of sucked the air out of the trend, as did this essay about the lesson to be learned from the FaceApp experience. Hint: It had nothing to do with online security but a lot to do with Social Security.
--
'Shallow' duo
Social media Absolutely Knew that Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper were a thing after the actors' lovey-dovey "Shallow" performance at the 2019 Oscars. Gaga had broken up with fiance Christian Carino in the midst of awards season, and Cooper would split from Irina Shayk in June. It got confusing! But the rumor wasn't, and still isn't, true. They definitely are not dating. Gaga would like it if people stopped asking her. In the meantime, the official video of the duet has almost 240 million views.
--
Cheese challenge
For a few brutal weeks near the start of the year, people were chucking slices of American cheese at unsuspecting babies, then posting the videos online. Because cheese hanging off a baby's face while they try to figure out what just happened is hilarious, right? Then older kids, adults and pets became targets too. So much pranky fun in such a small plastic wrapper. But the worm eventually turned and the guy who appears to have launched the cheese challenge on Twitter apologized for it, saying it had gotten "way out of hand." Never fear: A baby is extremely unlikely to be traumatized by facial contact with a processed cheese food, experts said. And the pets? Well, they could just eat it.
--
Meryl screams
In the Season 2 premiere of "Big Little Lies," Meryl Streep's character, Mary Louise Wright, let out a scream. The online audience responded by letting out its memes. It was promptly declared the show's best moment. Will the scream become like the theme song from "Cheers," or Lady Gaga singing "Shallow"? Or will it simply stay a scream? Many fans predicted Streep would win an Emmy for the scream, but alas, Emmy rules mean the show's second season isn't eligible until 2020. Can a scream echo that long?
--
The 'Cats' trailer
Forget about the mildly less upsetting second trailer that came out last month -- it was the first sneak peek at the upcoming "Cats" movie that made the internet lose its collective mind. "I don't know why you're all freaking out over miniature yet huge cats with human celebrity faces and sexy breasts performing a demented dream ballet for kids," one Twitter wit wrote. Though there was no single overwhelming meme, the single overwhelming reaction was, um, horror. "I know it's been a couple of days, but we just wanted to do a wellness check on everyone who saw the #CatsTrailer," an NPR's "Wait, Wait" account tweeted in the aftermath. "Anyone need to talk?"
--
OK, boomer
This dismissive reference to baby boomers or anyone perceived as old-fashioned, or even older, has been going around for a few years in memes, gifs and comments. That said, it went mega-mainstream at the end of October when the New York Times published the story "'OK Boomer' Marks the End of Friendly Generational Relations," declaring that Gen Z had snapped over financial inequality and climate change. "Frankly, being unaware of the happenings among young people until the New York Times writes about it is possibly The Most Boomer Thing Ever," Los Angeles Times culture columnist Mary McNamara wrote in a piece titled "Relax, Boomers. You're OK, Just Old." Let's see how long this one lasts, now that the grownups are in on the joke.
--
Baby Yoda
Baby Yoda, a.k.a. "the Child," started on the Disney+ series "The Mandalorian," but he belongs to the internet now. People don't have to watch the show to love Baby Yoda, 'cause he's just so dang cute, though he is neither a baby nor Yoda. Some memes revolved around him holding things; other see him messing around in the cockpit, listening to popular and not-so-popular tunes. Baby Yoda has religion. Baby Yoda is crafty. Even Elon Musk loves Baby Yoda. But the little green fella won't make it to Earth, unfortunately, until a few months into 2020. Except for on the arm of that one guy. Yep, Baby Yoda won the internet in 2019.

The Media Is Broken

Texto completo: And not for the reasons you think.
Those of us in journalism primarily do one thing: cover events. We report and opine about events like election campaigns, wars and crimes. A lot of the events we cover are decisions -- a decision to reform health care or write a tweet -- so we tend to congregate in the cities where decision makers live. The internet has sped up the news cycle. Now we put more emphasis on covering the last event that just happened. But it's still mostly events.
But a funny thing has happened to events in this era. They have ceased to drive politics the way they used to. We've seen gigantic events like impeachment, the Kavanaugh hearings, the Mueller investigation and the "Access Hollywood" tapes. They come and go and barely leave a trace on the polls, the political landscape or evaluations of Donald Trump.
Events don't seem to be driving politics. Increasingly, sociology is.
Do you want to predict how a certain region is going to vote in the 2020 presidential race? Discover who settled the region in the 17th and 18th centuries. If the settlers were from the East Anglia section of Britain, then that region is probably going Democratic. If the settlers were from the north of Britain, that region is very likely to vote for Donald Trump.
Do you want to predict how a state is going to vote? Find out how that state voted in the 1896 presidential election. As Washington University political scientists Gary Miller and Norman Schofield have observed, 22 out of the 23 states that voted Democratic in 1896 had turned Republican by 2000. Similarly, 17 of the 22 states that voted Republican in 1896 had turned Democratic by 2000. The parties have flipped regions.
Do you want to predict how an individual is going to vote? Ask a simple question: Is she urban or rural?
Geographic and psycho-sociological patterns now overshadow events in driving political loyalties and national electoral outcomes. Demography is destiny.
There's a more precise way to put this. An event is really two things. It's the event itself and then it's the process by which we make meaning of the event. As Aldous Huxley put it, "Experience is not what happens to you, it's what you do with what happens to you."
When a whole country sees events through a similar lens, then you don't have to think a lot about the process people use to make meaning. It's similar across the land. But when people in different regions and subcultures have nonoverlapping lenses, the process by which people make sense of events is more important than the event itself.
For reasons I don't understand, we've had an epistemic explosion over the past few decades. Different American regions and subcultures now see reality through nonoverlapping lenses. They make meaning in radically different ways. Psycho-social categories have hardened.
We in the media will continue to cover events, which, of course, is absolutely necessary. But with some noble exceptions (I'm thinking of Thomas Edsall of The Times and Ronald Brownstein of The Atlantic), we underreport on how meaning is made in different subcultures. You can't make sense of reality without that. Often we throw up our hands: "Can't these people see the facts?!?" I'm as guilty as anyone.
In this new context, I'm curious to know how lenses get crafted. For example, intersectionality is a lens that was created by theorists decades ago and is now a way of seeing that many people use to organize their view of reality. How did that happen?
I'm curious to know how a man in rural Idaho who has lost a son to suicide and a brother to fentanyl sees the impeachment hearing. How does he make meaning of that event in real time?
I'm curious to know how you can change another person's lens. Can you do it by writing and talking or do you have to move her to a different place and immerse her in a different reality?
I'm curious to know how power inequality shapes people's lenses. As Jonathan Rauch suggests in the current issue of National Affairs, ideological polarization is not on the rise, emotional polarization is on the rise. We don't necessarily disagree more. We perceive our opponents to be more menacing. We see more fearfully.
The big difference for those of us in media is that the main story is not only where the decision makers are creating events. It's also and maybe more so in the eyes of those doing the perceiving.
Obviously, in this era it's even more important to have a news organization that is ideologically, culturally and geographically diverse, so you can surface and explore the different unconscious ways groups see.
It's also important to ask different questions. It's not enough to simply ask people's opinions through polls and interviews. Epistemology is deeper than opinions. It's found through deeper probing.
This is a wonderful opportunity for us to think about our jobs in more profound ways. The core insight is that in a hyper-pluralistic society you can't know people in other groups until you know how they know you.

Texto completo: A collection of long-lost Zora Neale Hurston stories, a heart-stopping novel about a migrant's journey across Mexico, a look at the crisis facing America's working class and more.
'American Dirt,' by Jeanine Cummins (Flatiron, Jan. 21)
Lydia, a bookstore owner, had a pleasant life in Acapulco before the arrival of a violent cartel called Los Jardineros. After her husband publishes an exposé about the group's leader in the local newspaper, her family is massacred, and Lydia and her young son must go on the run. This novel is a heart-stopping story of survival, danger and love, as they undertake the grueling journey to the United States.
'American Oligarchs: The Kushners, the Trumps, and the Marriage of Money and Power,' by Andrea Bernstein (Norton, Jan. 14)
Bernstein, an investigative journalist, maps the two families' paths to the White House, describing their arrival in the United States as immigrants, how they amassed and hid wealth, and how they leveraged their political power.
'Black Wave: Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the Forty-Year Rivalry That Unraveled Culture, Religion, and Collective Memory in the Middle East,' by Kim Ghattas (Holt, Jan. 28)
Going back to 1979 -- the height of the Iranian Revolution that brought down the monarchy and ushered in an Islamist government -- Ghattas shows how Saudi Arabia and Iran's fractured relationship has had profound consequences for the entire region. Ghattas, a Lebanese journalist who has covered the Middle East for decades, focuses on people whose lives were upended by the rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, including the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in 2018.
'Cleanness,' by Garth Greenwell (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Jan. 14)
In this follow-up to his debut novel, "What Belongs to You," Greenwell returns to his unnamed narrator, an American teaching in Bulgaria, who is now preparing to leave. Desire, longing and taboo all converge here, as the teacher reflects on the encounters and relationships that shaped him.
'Hitting a Straight Lick With a Crooked Stick,' by Zora Neale Hurston (Amistad, Jan. 14)
A new collection of short stories by the author of "Their Eyes Were Watching God" includes eight selections that were recently discovered in archives and periodicals. The stories here deal with race, class, migration and love, and are an invaluable window into African-American experiences during the Harlem Renaissance.
'Long Bright River,' by Liz Moore (Riverhead, Jan. 7)
In Moore's suspenseful new novel, two sisters in Philadelphia are driven apart by the opioid crisis. Kacey is an addict, living on the streets, while Mickey, a police officer, does her best to keep tabs on her sister. Kacey vanishes, coinciding with a string of killings, and Mickey races to discover what happened to her sister.
'Such a Fun Age,' by Kiley Reid (Putnam, Dec. 31)
The premise for this timely debut novel is anything but simple: the perils of babysitting while black. Emira, who is African-American, is accused by a grocery store security guard of kidnapping her young charge, a white child. Emira is humiliated, angry, and hardly assuaged by her employer's good-faith efforts to help. But soon the women are bound together as the ramifications of the episode follow them both.
'Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope,' by Nicholas Kristof & Sheryl WuDunn (Knopf, Jan. 14)
Kristof, a New York Times columnist, and WuDunn, a former reporter at the paper, assess the inequality that's endemic to the working poor, telling stories from across the country. The heart of the book is set in Kristof's hometown -- Yamhill, Ore. -- where nearly a quarter of his classmates have died from overdoses, accidents or suicide. The authors are careful to show not just misery but moments of optimism and resilience, too.
'Uncanny Valley,' by Anna Wiener (MCD, Jan. 14)
When Wiener took her first job at a start-up, she was (like many liberal arts majors at the time) ambivalent about tech: intrigued by its promises but aware of the specter of dread surrounding it. "Uncanny Valley" recounts her years working in San Francisco as the tech industry was radically reshaping the country. She's perceptive about her own motives as well as those of her colleagues. Her insightful, darkly funny memoir may confirm many of your worst fears about big tech and the people driving it.
'Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis,' by Ada Calhoun (Grove, Jan. 7)
Why do Gen X women seem to be struggling? As Calhoun contemplated her own malaise and unhappiness, she realized that most women her age were grappling with many of the same worries: insecure finances, stalled careers, the pressures of caregiving. In her book, she explores why for so many Gen Xers -- who were raised expecting "to have it all" -- it's practically impossible to keep up.

Texto completo: A new investment standard would reward efforts to protect tropical forests.
When I moved to the Amazon "Wild West" town of Paragominas in northern Brazil in 1984 as a young scientist studying forest recovery on abandoned pastures, I expected a town filled with bandits and land grabbers. Instead, what I mostly found were courageous, hard-working families from across Brazil who had come to the rugged town of sawmills, cattle ranches and smallholder settlements to improve their lot in life.
But as the global outcry over recent Amazon fires and the rise in deforestation has demonstrated yet again, the stigma surrounding Amazon farmers as accomplices in this destruction remains, making enemies of would-be allies.
Indeed, outrage over the fires and President Jair Bolsonaro's rhetoric and actions obscures a central question: Can responsible, law-abiding landholders and businesspeople in the Amazon -- like those I met in Paragominas -- compete with people who break the law, grab land and forest resources and drive much of the deforestation?
The simple answer is no. And until that changes, it will be difficult to stop the cutting and burning of these forests, which worldwide account for about a tenth of the carbon dioxide emissions that are warming the planet. But two recent developments suggested things may be changing for the better.
One turn of events was the decision by the California Air Resources Board in September to endorse -- after 10 years of design and debate -- a Tropical Forest Standard that could protect the forests of the Amazon and beyond. The standard sets rules for state, provincial and national governments in the Amazon to limit deforestation so that they can qualify to sell credits to companies seeking to offset some of their greenhouse gas emissions.
This standard is designed to make sure that the carbon offsets that companies are buying are actually going to real, verifiable deforestation efforts. What's significant about the standard is its size -- it focuses on recognizing and rewarding successful forest conservation across entire states, provinces or even nations in the Amazon. Moreover, and this is critical, it includes principles for guaranteeing that indigenous groups and other local communities have a voice in the policies and programs that are developed.
California's endorsement of the standard also sends an important signal to the governors of these Amazonian states and provinces and leaders in other tropical regions that their efforts to protect their forests have been recognized and soon could be rewarded.
The second sign was the recent announcement by Jeff Bezos that Amazon, the online retailing giant, would achieve "climate neutrality" by 2040. That means the company -- and many others that have made or plan similar announcements -- in all probability will soon be looking to buy carbon credits to offset their emissions.
The California standard could help translate these voluntary corporate commitments into hundreds of millions of dollars or more over the next few years to finance conservation efforts in the Amazon, Borneo and other tropical forest regions.
If tropical forests are to be protected, these kinds of financial incentives are imperative. Why? Consider the reality of the land market in the Amazon: An acre of cleared land is worth far more than an acre of forest. This means that farms that are mostly forested, as required by the law, are worth far less than farms that are mostly cleared. Forest-conserving farmers who are helping slow climate change because of the large amount of carbon contained in forest trees receive nothing in return.
This market reality has given an unfair advantage to farmers and land grabbers who succeed in avoiding law enforcement efforts to stop deforestation. They simply cut and burn large tracts of the forest illegally to grow crops or raise cattle, or to make a claim of ownership by showing productive use of the land.
Financial incentives could spur farmers to conserve more forest on their farms and to start reforesting along rivers and streams ahead of a 2040 deadline to do so.
This is where the California tropical forest standard comes in. It offers the potential for changing the incentives. The retailer Amazon, commercial airlines and dozens of other companies that are making similar pledges to climate neutrality could, through their purchase of carbon offsets, inject money into the tropical regions that are building their economies while protecting forests and recognizing the rights of indigenous peoples.
And if the online retailer is just the beginning of a much larger corporate wave, the demand for these offsets, delivered according to the rules established by the California standard, could grow rapidly. In addition, other states or nations with carbon cap-and-trade programs, including the Canadian provinces and perhaps even China, should be encouraged to adopt the California standard.
Developing clear rules to govern these financial transactions was one of the goals of a recent United Nations climate summit in Madrid but was not completed. Among the issues unresolved, for instance, was this: If an American company achieves voluntary climate neutrality in part by investing in a Brazilian program that is reducing emissions by curtailing deforestation in the Amazon, is Brazil still able to claim those emission reductions as progress toward its commitment under the Paris climate agreement to reduce greenhouse gas pollution?
But even before this standard is activated, provincial and local governments in Brazil and other countries urgently need investors and technical support now to slow deforestation.
Brazil has succeeded before. In 2004, the country began an effort to slow Amazon deforestation. It expanded the reach of protected forests, it suspended farm credit in counties with high rates of deforestation, and it ramped up law enforcement. Between 2004 and 2012, deforestation declined by 77 percent. But the effectiveness of those efforts began to wane because they were not accompanied by sufficient incentives to encourage governments, farmers and local businesspeople to protect their forests. As a result, deforestation has been rising since 2012, up 29 percent in the 12 months ending in July 2016. That equals more than 3,000 square miles of forest that was cut or burned.
California has been a leader on climate change and alone is one of the world's largest economies. Now that its Air Resources Board has endorsed this standard, governments elsewhere and the business community should use the standard to reward those in the Amazon serious about protecting its tropical forests.

Texto completo: In interviews with Reagan's budget director, David Stockman, he exposed doubts about the supply-side economics that the administration had embraced.
William Greider, a reporter, editor and popular author who examined the United States, its politics and its position in the world through an economic lens for four decades for The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, The Nation and other media outlets, died on Wednesday at his home in Washington. He was 83.
His son, Cameron, said the cause was complications of congestive heart failure.
Mr. Greider worked for 15 years at The Post, where he was a national correspondent, an assistant managing editor for national news and a columnist.
His writing then took a more polemical and leftward turn at Rolling Stone, where, as a columnist and national affairs editor from 1982 to 1999, he began investigating the defense establishment and challenging mainstream political and economic thought.
He joined The Nation in 1999 as the national affairs correspondent and was also a correspondent for six "Frontline" documentaries on PBS, including "Return to Beirut," which won an Emmy in 1985.
Mr. Greider's best-known books include "One World, Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism" (1997), about the global economy; "Secrets of the Temple" (1987), a critique of the Federal Reserve system; "Who Will Tell the People? The Betrayal of American Democracy" (1992), which laid bare how powerful interests had co-opted the political system so that it would work for them and not for the working class; and "The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy" (2003), in which he took a hard look at American capitalism and discussed ways of reforming it.
Reviewing "The Soul of Capitalism" in The New York Times, the journalist John B. Judis called it "a bold and ambitious attempt to remedy the lack of vision that has plagued the American left since the decline of New Deal liberalism."
But perhaps Mr. Greider's most influential piece of writing was an essay in The Atlantic in 1981 titled "The Education of David Stockman," which caused a national uproar.
Mr. Stockman was a young Michigan Republican who served briefly in Congress before becoming President Ronald Reagan's budget director. Branded the "whiz kid" of the administration, he was in charge of implementing Reagan's plan to balance the federal budget by 1984 while cutting income taxes and social spending and increasing military spending.
In a series of interviews with Mr. Greider, Mr. Stockman revealed his skepticism about the supply-side theory of economics, on which the plan was based, and admitted that it had caused considerable doubt and confusion within the administration.
"None of us really understands what's going on with all these numbers," Mr. Stockman told Mr. Greider in one of several damning passages.
The essay won the George Polk Award for magazine writing and was reprinted as part of Mr. Greider's subsequent book, "The Education of David Stockman and Other Americans" (1982), a broader indictment of Reaganomics and its shortcomings.
Before Reagan named him his vice-presidential running mate, George H.W. Bush had called this approach "voodoo economics," saying Reagan's policies would greatly increase the national debt. Mr. Greider's account was one of the first to explain what was actually going on behind the administration's curtain.
"Greider's narrative is now a piece of history," the historian Bruce Mazlish wrote in The New Republic. Mr. Greider's essay, he said, was "destined to appear in future anthologies of politics, for it raises fundamental issues of faith, loyalty, betrayal, morality and personality."
William Harold Greider was born on Aug. 6, 1936, in Cincinnati. His father, Harold William Greider, was a research chemist, and his mother, Gladys (McClure) Greider, was a teacher.
He was raised in Wyoming, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb, and went on to study at Princeton, where he majored in English and served as associate editor of The Daily Princetonian, the campus newspaper. He received his bachelor's degree in 1958.
Asked in a 2009 interview with Princeton Alumni Weekly if the university had shaped his political philosophy, Mr. Greider said no.
"I grew up a conservative Republican in the Robert Taft mold," he said. "What changed me was after graduation, when I went out as a reporter and quickly began to experience the broader world. That led me to appreciate things I had once despised, such as the New Deal and liberal economics."
He started his newspaper career at The Wheaton Daily Journal in Illinois, where he met his future wife, Linda Furry, when they were both reporters there. They married in 1961 and had a son, Cameron, and a daughter, Katharine.
They all survive him, as do his sister, Nancy Gluck, and four grandchildren. His brother David died in 1966 and his brother Richard died in 2006.
Mr. Greider worked for The Louisville Times, covering City Hall and the Kentucky state house, and in 1966 was sent to Washington for both The Times and The Louisville Courier-Journal. He moved over to The Washington Post in 1968.
His son said Mr. Greider's early years at The Post, when he expanded his horizons by reporting from American Indian reservations and covering the civil rights and labor movements, were among the most meaningful to him as a journalist.
"He was disaffected from the day-to-day mechanics of politics," Cameron Greider said, "but he was never disaffected from the notion that America could live up to its promise."

Monument and Project to Focus on Black Women of Suffrage Movement

Texto completo: This is part of an ongoing Washington Informer series about the Women's Suffrage Movement and an initiative that includes Informer Publisher Denise Rolark Barnes that will use the lens of history, the fabric of art and culture and the venue of the public square to shine a light into dark places, equipping all with a compass to chart the way forward. The initiative lives in the institutional home of the Washington Informer Charities.
A January article in the New York Times noted the decision to erect a statue of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton on the Mall in Central Park.
The monument, scheduled for a 2020 unveiling in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, would feature renditions of the two women best known for helping to secure that right - Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
The article noted, "that the suffrage movement was big, broad and diverse is meant to be reflected in the image of a scroll unfolding between Anthony and Stanton like a very long to-do list (procure more rolled oats, seek equality) naming and quoting 22 other women whose contributions were greatly significant."
Of the 22 women selected, seven are African-American. Some of them - Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell - stand as towering figures in the history of American social activism, and yet none is set to receive a statue of her own, in this configuration.
"In effect, the monument, a maquette of which is on display in Albany, manages to recapitulate the marginalization Black women experienced during the suffrage movement to begin with, when, to cite but one example, they were forced by white organizers to congregate in the back during a famous women's march, in Washington, in 1913, coinciding with Woodrow Wilson's inauguration," the article's author, Ginia Bellafon-te, wrote.
Feminist and activist Gloria Steinem told the Times of the monument, that "it is not only that it is not enough, [but] it's that it looks as if Anthony and Stanton are standing on the names of these other women."
Bellafonte wrote that the inclusion of the scroll at the center of the monument, and the way the women are positioned toward it, suggests they are writing the history of suffrage, which is in itself problematic because Anthony and Stanton coedited a six-volume compendium - "The History of Women's Suffrage" - that gave them ownership of a narrative that erased the participation of Black women in the movement.
Last month, the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) weighed in.
The DLPA, connects people to the riches held within America's libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions, announced a project powered by Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company founded by Melinda Gates, that will highlight the role of Black women in the suffrage movement.
The project is scheduled for launch in conjunction with the centennial of the ratification of the 19th amendment in 2020. It will focus on Black women's activism from 1850s to 1960s, including, but not limited to, their role in the women's suffrage movement, civil rights movement and women's right's movement, according to DLPA.
Cultural artifacts included in the collection will have a clear and compelling relevance to contemporary issues like voting rights and intersectionality, as well as contemporary movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, DLPA said.
In addition, the new collection will expand upon DPLA's existing collections about Black women's activism - collections that primarily include source sets on Ida B. Wells and anti-lynching activism; Fannie Lou Hamer and the civil rights movement in rural Mississippi; and the Equal Rights Amendment.
Ultimately, the goal of the new collection will be to elevate Black women's activism in the national narrative in places where it has been erased.
"Nobody wants to know a colored woman's opinion about her own status of that of her group," Mary Church Terrell once wrote. "When she dares express it, no matter how mild or tactful it may be, it is called 'propaganda,' or is labeled 'controversial.'"

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.

Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO - The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.

Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. - Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.

Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES - Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 - more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."

Burning Man organizers
sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. - Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.

Relief group: 216,000
fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT - More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.

Texto completo: Meet the team dedicated to helping schools and students teach and learn with The Times, using the news of the day to create a safe and welcoming space to develop critical-thinking skills.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Two years ago, Donna Amit-Cubbage, a middle school English teacher in the Philadelphia area, was struggling with how to answer her students' tough questions about political issues: What's going on with the border wall, for instance.
"I didn't know how we could talk about it in class with middle school kids," Ms. Amit-Cubbage said. "I was up there in the front of the room trying to explain scary things, and it was hard for me."
Then she stumbled upon The Learning Network, a New York Times section dedicated to creating resources for teachers and students to teach and learn using The Times. The section started in 1998 and now publishes approximately 1,000 teaching resources a year, most of which are completely free for students.
The Learning Network team consists of five Times editors, all of whom have worked as teachers, along with a professional development manager and a senior news assistant. Each school day, the team posts at least one Lesson of the Day, one Student Opinion prompt and one Picture Prompt. The editors place themselves in the shoes of teachers and students while they create posts.
"I came across this treasure trove of material, and once I kind of stepped my foot in, I was in love," Ms. Amit-Cubbage said.
She now uses Learning Network writing prompts each week in her classes. Walls in her classroom are covered in essays that her students have had featured in The Times.
"It helped me to help them develop a voice and stand up for what is right and stand up for what you believe in," she said. "Whether we agree or disagree, it didn't matter. And it got into some heated debates and discussions, but all the while it's still helped to build community within our classroom."
Susan Shatford, a library media specialist at Marblehead High School in Massachusetts, recently wrote an article for The Times about how virtually her entire school uses the newspaper and The Learning Network.
"As a public school, we don't get Title I money, so we're kind of at the mercy of whatever the town budget is, and lately our town budget has been really hurting," Ms. Shatford said in an interview. Free access to The Times, thanks to the School Sponsorship program (a way for readers to sponsor schools), changed that, she said.
Katherine Schulten, who has been affiliated with The Learning Network since its inception and has served as its head editor since 2006, said The Learning Network editors are always responding to three things: what's going on in the education world; what's important in the news; and what new initiatives and platforms The Times is using to disseminate the news.
"We're always responding to the news, that's our main job," said Ms. Schulten, who is writing a book about The Learning Network. "But we're also responding to what changes The Times is making."
Nicole Daniels, an editor on the team, recently wrote a Lesson of the Day about grandmothers who studied sea snakes. She doesn't think of herself as a science person, but a Times article about the grandmothers had struck her as sweet, so she tried to imagine ways a teacher could connect with it.
"After reading the article a couple of times, I was like, this is actually about doing community science projects," Ms. Daniels explained. "It's about how can young people, old people, anybody in between go out into their communities and do citizen science." So in her lesson, she asked questions such as: "Would you ever want to become a citizen scientist? Why?" and "Think of something in your community that could be researched or observed by a citizen scientist. Why is this topic important to study?"
Michael Gonchar, who took over as The Learning Network's head editor in January, is most excited about the section's interactive nature.
"We have thousands of students who comment on our site over the course of the year," Mr. Gonchar said.
The section recently posed a question to students about whether the United States owes reparations to the descendants of enslaved people.
"It had a bit of a mostly positive run on Twitter, but one response scoffed at the fact we were asking high schoolers that question -- but in my opinion, that's really the point," Ms. Daniels said. A goal of the section is to help young people learn to think critically, she added.
"All of our comments online are moderated," Mr. Gonchar explained, "and it's probably one of the few places on the internet where students can be in a safe space to share their ideas. They know that the forum is going to be a space for serious conversation."

Texto completo: The former One Direction member succeeded thanks to a mix of streaming, digital sales and vinyl.
On his way to one of the best weeks for an album this year, the former One Direction member Harry Styles did it the old-fashioned way and the of-the-moment way.
"Fine Line," Styles's second LP as a solo performer, topped the latest Billboard chart with the equivalent of 478,000 in sales, according to Nielsen Music -- the third-biggest total for an album in 2019 -- using every tactic in the industry playbook. Though it lacked a blockbuster hit single ahead of its release, "Fine Line" sold 393,000 copies as a full album, aided by the now-common bundles that pair a copy of the album with concert tickets and merchandise. It also had 109 million streams, the largest total of the week and the third-best debut this year.
But there was a throwback element as well: "Fine Line" sold 28,000 copies on vinyl, the fourth-best week for that format since Nielsen Music started tallying numbers in 1991, behind only Jack White's "Lazaretto," Pearl Jam's "Vitalogy" and Adele's "25."
The New York Times critic Jon Pareles called Styles "a promising work in progress," noting that the singer had "expanded his retro-rock timeline, while still working with the core brain trust from his first album." Commercially, Styles managed to more than double the first-week total for his solo debut, a self-titled release from 2017, which started with 230,000 equivalent units. Only Taylor Swift's "Lover" (869,000) and Post Malone's "Hollywood's Bleeding" (489,000) had better opening weeks this year.
Behind Styles, Blake Shelton's greatest-hits collection "Fully Loaded: God's Country" was No. 2, with 96,000 units, lifted by another ticket bundle; "Please Excuse Me for Being Anti-Social" by Roddy Ricch, last week's chart-topper, fell to No. 3 with 81,000 units; "Hollywood's Bleeding" by Post Malone was No. 4 with 63,000 units; and the soundtrack to "Frozen II" was No. 5 with 60,000 units, ahead of two Christmas albums, "Christmas" by Michael Bublé and "The Best of Pentatonix Christmas" by Pentatonix.

Texto completo: Judging the past by the values of today can be its own kind of intolerance.
NARA, Japan -- In Canada recently, I ran across one of the most anguished mea culpas I've encountered in a long time, in a piece prominently displayed in The Toronto Star. Its author, JP Larocque, confessed that in 2008, he foolishly dressed up for Halloween as someone from south of the American border, thus being guilty, all at once, unusually for his considerate homeland, of racial insensitivity, cultural appropriation and a joke in inexcusable taste. That a photo of himself wearing a sign that said, "MEXI-CAN'T" might surface at any moment meant, even more profoundly, that he had "lived with regret ever since."
I read the piece with care and sympathy, not least because Canada is such a model of global awareness and forward thinking. And it was hard not to feel for this gay man of biracial origin who remained haunted by his tone-deaf cruelty. But a lesser part of me couldn't help wondering if he hadn't committed even more egregious sins over the past 11 years (or even 11 days). I certainly have. And whether he didn't feel that cultural mores and assumptions are always shifting, rendering what was not so exceptional in one era abhorrent in the next. Aren't all of us at least a little more mature and discerning now than we were a decade ago, partly because we've been schooled by our mistakes? Before long, I was beginning to wonder whether Larocque, a writer for the TV series "Slasher," wasn't simply replacing ethnocentricity, noxious and unacceptable as it is, with chronocentrism -- a term coined in 1974 to suggest among other things, prejudice against other times, rather than against other races.
One of the blessings of the past few years is that many of us have learned to look with more understanding and clarity at the Other. To be different is not to be worse. Yes, a vicious new xenophobia is arising in many parts of the world in response to the erosion of borders, but in part that's because more and more others are working to look past the stereotypes and dismissive tags of yesterday. Even as many strive so hard to cultivate tolerance when it comes to race, religion and gender, however, those same people seem ever more ready to countenance intolerance when it comes to earlier times -- on the grounds that they were intolerant. The shaky assumption behind such chronocentrism is that we have advanced beyond our forebears to a state of relative enlightenment.
In certain respects -- the treatment of women, say, and the L.G.B.T.Q. community, as well as of what Canadians call "visible minorities" -- we have. Growing up dark-skinned in an England of "Paki-bashing" and the influential demagogue Enoch Powell predicting rivers "foaming with much blood" if people who looked like me continued to be born in his gray-skied land, I'm delighted to return to a newly open and creative London where the average person was born in another country. My four grandparents, all born in India, came of age in a richly multicultured society, but one in which they had little chance of encountering neighbors from Cambodia or Haiti or Ethiopia, as so many New Yorkers or Angelenos can today. Even 20 years ago, I could never have imagined that in 2008 the United States would elect a president who is a living refutation of black-and-white distinctions.
I'm less thrilled, though, when people fault Shakespeare, say, for daring, in his job as writer (and actor), to try to enter the souls of a woman, a Moor and a devil from Italy (which he does in "Othello" alone). I'm wary of assuming that, just because T.S. Eliot held some positions that we now find offensive, we are more "moral" or attuned to the complexities of human nature than he was. I'm glad that I live in a more diverse world than my grandparents could have imagined, but I'm not sure that means I'm wiser than they were.
For a grateful immigrant like myself, the blessing of America is its freedom from the habits and constraints of the past, its eagerness to right injustices, its belief that we can do better than we did. That is part of what draws people like me here from older and more disenchanted cultures. But those who dismiss the past just because it's past run the risk of not appreciating the fact that the past, like most of us in earlier times, was imperfectly doing its best. As more and more of us imprison ourselves in the moment -- thank you, addictive screens! -- we devolve into a "presentism" that shares some of the cruelty of racism. Technology may advance along a relatively straight line, each innovation leading to the next, but human nature does not.
One definition of an adolescent is a person who thinks that what is new is better, precisely because he has so little sense of what is old. One definition of a grown-up is someone who appreciates how little she can be sure of or dismiss. The surest way to be in the wrong is to assume with blind conviction you're in the right.
As I came to the climax of Larocque's article -- "I can't expect forgiveness, now or ever" -- I said a silent prayer that the writer would not be committing a sequel to his article in 2030, or even next year, berating himself for having values in 2019 that will seem woefully outdated by then. When Oscar Wilde has a character say, "Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern. One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly," he's writing of not just hemlines and suits, but of judgments and assumptions. That we think differently than we did does not mean that we're better than we were.

Texto completo: Spokane's dining scene - once mostly meat and potatoes, burgers and fries, and national chains - is coming into its own.
During the past decade, dishes grew more vibrant and varied. Chefs got creative, took risks, and focused on seasonal ingredients from local farms and food producers. Diners- including vegetarians and vegans, those who went gluten- or dairy-free, and many who simply started caring more about where their food comes from - enjoyed increased options. And media from outside the area took notice.
The 2010s played a pivotal role in helping further refine our tastes and define Inland Northwest cuisine.
Local kitchens, bars
and rising stars
Four chefs were semifinalists for Best Chef Northwest in the prestigious culinary awards from the James Beard Foundation: Anna Vogel, Laurent Zirotti, Adam Hegsted and Jeremy Hansen.
Culinary competition shows featured a spate of local contestants. Ricky Webster was most successful, winning two holiday baking shows: Food Network's "Christmas Cookie Challenge" in 2018 and this year's "Christmas Cookie Matchup" on Hallmark Channel.
Tony Brown competed on "Guy's Grocery Games." So did Travis Tveit. And Zirotti, who also was on "Beat Bobby Flay." (He didn't.)
Food Network came here, too. Alton Brown brought his live show to Spokane in 2015 and 2017. Guy Fieri rolled up in his signature red convertible Camaro, filming segments around the region for "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives" in 2010 and 2018.
Rise of boutique coffee shops and roasters
Of note is Indaba, which expanded its empire from one to five locations. Roast House launched in 2010, opening First Avenue Coffee shop in 2018. Sandpoint's Evans Brothers also expanded, opening two outposts - in Coeur d'Alene in 2017 and Spokane in 2019. Ladder, started as a pop-up in 2017, opened its cafe and roastery in 2018. Also in 2018, National Geographic Travel named Spokane in a top-10 list titled "These Unexpected Cities Have the Best Coffee in the U.S."
Brewing boom
It started around 2012, when Northern Lights - godfather of the local craft beer scene since 1993 - rebranded as No-Li. Iron Goat opened the same year, moving to bigger digs in 2016. Other new breweries that opened in the past decade - too many to list - include Whistle Punk, Black Label, TT's Old Iron, Perry Street and Bellwether. For more, check out the Inland Northwest Ale Trail, which started in 2013 with 16 breweries, listed 44 in 2018, and in 2019 launched a free mobile app - versus a paper map - to help track beer lovers' brewery visits.
High spirits
The 2010s saw big growth for Dry Fly, the state's first small distillery since Prohibition. The Spokane company expanded its tasting room and production area in 2017 and has since been gearing up to increase production even more, moving into this newspaper's renovated downtown press building in the new year to accommodate the uptick. Other local distillers established during the past decade include Warrior, 2 Loons Distillery and Up North Distillery.
Bon Bon helped usher in a new decade of high-quality cocktails when it opened in 2010, followed by Boots Bakery & Lounge, Volstead Act and Hogwash Whiskey Den, which takes its drinks up a notch with hand-carved ice. Spokane also welcomed its only designated tiki bar, Tiny Tiki, as well as the city's new smallest bar, Bijou, with only seven seats. Also elevating the cocktail scene: Cease & Desist Book Club, which offers a speakeasy-esque experience - patrons enter through a hidden door in a bookcase - and restaurants with upscale bar programs, such as Clover, which opened in 2012 and made 2013's list of Top 100 New American Bars by Food & Wine's Cocktails. Rounding out newer restaurants with notable drink menus are Durkin's, Casper Fry, Ruins and Eyvind along with Hegsted's Wandering Table, Gilded Unicorn and Honey Eatery & Social Club.
Growth of Eat Good
Hegsted expanded his ever-growing Eat Good Group of restaurants, adding - along with aforementioned eateries - Incrediburger & Eggs, Doughlicious, Pocket Bar, Yards Bruncheon, Republic Kitchen, Farmhouse Kitchen & Silo Bar, Eat Good Café and Le Catering. He also founded Crave! Food and Drink Celebration, launched in 2017, and still serves as its culinary director.
Chef-driven
Chef-driven - and often chef-owned - eateries are on the rise. Those include Italia Trattoria, opened in 2010 by Vogel and partner Bethe Bowman, as well as all of Tony Brown's establishments (Ruins, Stella's) and those founded by Hansen and his wife, Kate, particularly Inland Pacific Kitchen. David Blaine established Central Food in 2012 when Kendall Yards was still very much a construction zone. Travis Dickinson, former executive chef at Clover, along with Justin Curtis, former front-of-the-house manager at Clover, opened Cochinito Taqueria in 2018. The same year, Mike Jones, chef and owner of Mizuna, added Austin's Live Fire Barbecue, and Philip Stanton, who had worked at Italia, opened Park Lodge. Peter Froese, who worked at Santé Restaurant & Charcuterie, opened Gander & Ryegrass in the spot that formerly held the Hansens' flagship restaurant. Ella Piskun, who worked at the Hansens' now-closed Common Crumb Artisan Bakery, opened her own modern French bake shop and café, miFlavour, with her husband, Max.
Chad White, who competed on season 13 of Bravo's "Top Chef" - he finished ninth out of 17 - came home in 2015 after more than a decade away. He has since opened Zona Blanca, a ceviche counter, as well as two High Tide walk-up lobster bars and a joint venture called TT's Old Iron Brewery in Spokane Valley.
Better bread
The best thing since sliced bread might be the emergence of small-batch bakers who are boosting the artisan bread scene one naturally leavened loaf at a time. The Grain Shed, opened in 2018, is at the forefront of the movement, baking with ancient, landrace and heirloom grains grown within 100 miles of Spokane. They're stone-ground in-house, then baked in a custom wood-fired oven. Glorious Artisan Bakery, opened in 2019, features Shepherd's Grain flour and long ferments. Central Food sells its high-quality house-made breads by the loaf. So do pop-ups such as Lucky Lady Bread Co.
Veggie-forward
Vegetarians and vegans have more options - from dedicated vegan restaurants such as Boots, Rüt Bar & Kitchen and Allie's Vegan Pizzeria & Café to other restaurants - such as Eyvind, Cascadia Public House and Lucky You Lounge - that offer vegan and vegetarian entrees along with meaty menu options.
Food trucks
and farmers markets
More farmers markets and food trucks arrived on the Spokane food scene, which banded together to form the Greater Spokane Food Truck Association in 2012 "to promote and advance the food truck scene."
National nods
Large metro dailies featured Spokane's food scene - from the New York Times, which included local restaurants and bars in a Frugal Traveler column in 2017, to the Los Angeles Times, which ran the 2016 story "Wine and Dine to your Heart's Content in Horn-of-Plenty Spokane, Wash." In 2015, the Wall Street Journal named Spokane one of "Six Great Small Cities for Food Lovers."

Texto completo: Kurt Eichenwald sat down at the desk in his Dallas home office and logged onto Twitter. The prominent journalist and author was used to Internet invective " especially then, in the weeks after he posted a particularly inflammatory tweet about President Trump.
More than 170 notifications awaited him when he signed on that evening, Dec. 15, 2016.
But he didn't make it past the first one: A GIF that strobed violently across his computer screen, flashing a red, yellow and blue geometric pattern behind the words 'YOU DESERVE A SEIZURE FOR YOUR POSTS.'
Within seconds, Eichenwald, who has epilepsy, suffered a seizure. He would have died, he has said, if his wife hadn't walked into the study and found him.
The GIF set off a highly unusual court battle that is expected to equip those in similar circumstances with a new tool for battling threatening trolls and cyberbullies. Last week, the man accused of sending Eichenwald the moving image, John Rayne Rivello, was set to appear in a Dallas County district court. A last-minute rescheduling delayed the proceeding until Jan. 31, but Rivello is still expected to plead guilty to aggravated assault. And he may be the first of many.
The Epilepsy Foundation has announced it lodged a sweeping slate of criminal complaints against a legion of copycats who targeted people with epilepsy and sent them an onslaught of strobe GIFs " a frightening phenomenon that unfolded in a short period of time during the organization's marking of National Epilepsy Awareness Month in November.
With Rivello's expected guilty plea, the foundation has a legal road map for fighting back.
'These kinds of attacks need to be taken seriously,' Allison Nichol, the Epilepsy Foundation's director of legal advocacy, told The Washington Post. 'There needs to be a very aggressive response, both by the foundation and by law enforcement. What these people did is incredibly dangerous to people with epilepsy and it just cannot stand.'
Nichol said the organization has identified at least 30 instances in which a Twitter user responded to content the foundation posted on its own page by posting flashing or strobing lights.
'What they're doing virtually is no different than walking into a convention they know is the Epilepsy Foundation with a strobe light, hoping to cause seizures,' Nichol said. 'It has the capacity to induce exactly the same harm.'
In 2018, Eichenwald's lawyers won an important ruling in a federal lawsuit they filed against Rivello in Maryland, alongside the criminal case in Texas. In that order, Chief U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar rebutted claims that there was no 'physical contact' between Eichenwald and Rivello, arguing that GIFs are composed of light, which do strike the eyes of a viewer.
Swaths of the ruling read like a physics textbook: 'Light comes in rays, or waves, comprised in part by photons. . . . Photons hit the retina and are converted into electrical signals. . . . Such electrical signals from strobing images 'can trigger seizures in certain individuals with epilepsy.' '
Lawyers for Rivello, a 32-year-old veteran who lived in Salisbury, Md., did not respond to requests for comment.
Eichenwald's attorney, Steven Lieberman, has an arsenal of analogies he uses when comparing the assault to more commonplace violence. It's like anthrax in an envelope, he said, or digging a pit trap for a blind person, or like shining a laser pointer in the eyes of a pilot trying to land a plane.
'The fact that an electric impulse was used rather than an envelope for poison makes no difference,' Lieberman said. 'This is an issue of an assault using a new sort of technology.'
Rivello's supporters " among them neo-Nazis and white nationalists, including Richard Spencer " have also argued that the issue is about freedom of speech. But in an amicus brief to the criminal case, the First Amendment Clinic at Duke University School of Law argued such actions are not constitutionally protected.
'A brawler who tattoos a message onto his knuckles does not throw every punch with the weight of First Amendment protection behind him,' the brief stated. 'Conduct like this does not constitute speech, nor should it. A deliberate attempt to cause physical injury to someone does not come close to the expression which the First Amendment is designed to protect.'
The attacks on Eichenwald and the Epilepsy Foundation recall a 2008 spate of digital assaults on the organization. In March 2008, one of the foundation's forums was hacked, and assailants were able to post hundreds of messages embedded with strobe GIFs, apparently targeting the members of the online message board, many of whom had epilepsy.
The site was temporarily shuttered and security tightened, said foundation spokeswoman Jacqueline Aker. The FBI also investigated the breach, she said.
The investigation into this year's attacks is still ongoing, but foundation leaders believe it was a coordinated campaign.
A representative for Twitter said the company will permanently suspend accounts 'dedicated to causing offline harm' and is also 'exploring additional options to help protect the people on Twitter from this type of abuse.' One way to prevent a GIF attack, the representative said, is to turn off the autoplay function that allows the images to strobe on sight.
In the case of Eichenwald, who has written extensively about his struggles with epilepsy, court documents state Rivello was aware of his condition " and was also apparently motivated by overt anti-Semitism.
Rivello tweeted the GIF from the account @jew_goldstein, according to court documents, which he also used to message other Twitter users. Two days before he sent the strobe, Rivello wrote privately that Eichenwald 'deserves to have his liver pecked out by a pack of emus,' according to direct messages recovered in an FBI investigation.
In the hours following his tweet to Eichenwald, Rivello sent more private messages to other users, according to court records.
'I hope this sends him into a seizure,' he wrote in one.
'Let's see if he dies,' he wrote in another.
And then: 'I know he has epilepsy.'
In an archived version of the @jew_goldstein account, which has since been suspended, the feed is brimming with anti-Semitic hatred, far-right references and attacks on Eichenwald, whose father is Jewish.
The final archived tweets were about 'the Jews and their lies' and referred to Eichenwald as a 'vile propagandist.' The account also retweeted a user who congratulated him on his 'Jew bullying.'
On Rivello's iCloud account, the FBI found images of an altered Wikipedia page for Eichenwald, edited to list his death date as the day following his receipt of the GIF and to include more anti-Semitic references.
After Rivello's arrest, a group of neo-Nazis rallied to his defense, starting a fundraiser to foot his legal fees, reported Eyes on the Right, which tracks right-wing hate groups. Spencer, a white supremacist who organized the deadly 2017 'Unite the Right' march in Charlottesville, tweeted his support.
Spencer also appeared to refer to Eichenwald in a conversation with one of his deputies quoted in the Atlantic. As the white supremacists struggled to recall Eichenwald's name, Spencer asked, 'What is that guy's name? The one whom we almost killed?'
'No, no,' the other revised. ' We did not send that.'
'We collectively almost killed him,' Spencer replied, saying an alt-right activist 'sent him a meme.'
Eichenwald is a former reporter for the New York Times whose writing in Newsweek has been critical of Trump. He's also one of nearly 3.5 million Americans affected by epilepsy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. And he's still dealing with the consequences of the seizure he suffered after opening his Twitter account in December 2016, Lieberman said.
He had partial paralysis on the left side of his body, Lieberman said, and it threw off the medication he was taking " which, after years of trying different drugs, was finally helping him feel better. Until just a couple months ago, Eichenwald was too nervous to hold his goddaughter, concerned his arms wouldn't be stable enough.
His team hopes that legal prosecution will put an end to these attacks, the fulfillment of a promise Eichenwald's wife made to his Twitter attacker in the minutes after she found him convulsing in front of the strobing GIF.
'This is his wife,' she wrote to @jew_goldstein, 'you caused a seizure. I have your information and have called the police to report the assault.'

Cloudless and 43 degrees at kickoff, North Jersey still managed to produce an air quality deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups Sunday, which had to include the Steelers fans in MetLife Stadium who were forced to breathe in the toxic frustration of a defense that suddenly can't win for winning.
In one sequence in the second half of a season-curdling 16-10 loss to the team the New York Times reflexively refers to as the Woeful Jets, the Steelers forced consecutive three-and-outs only to have someone from its laughably suspect offense - special teamer/running back Bennie Snell - hop offside as New York was punting, resulting in a Jets first down. Naturally, the superb defense walked back onto the lawn, forced another three-and-out, and ultimately gave the offense another three cracks at overturning a modest Jets lead.
Of course, that was not to be, in part because it's never a good week when your team has as many arrests as touchdowns, and it would not even have managed its weekly touchdown had not T.J. Watt continued his campaign for defensive player of the year with a sack/forced fumble/fumble recovery that set up Mason Rudolph's 29-yard strike to Diontae Johnson just before the half.
"Football is the ultimate team game; everybody has to produce," Watt said evenly after the offense scored only one TD for the seventh time in the past eight games. "I think the beautiful thing about football is it takes all three - offense, defense, special teams -to win a football game. We have to get back in the lab as a team and we're never going to separate. This is the Pittsburgh Steelers. We love everybody in the locker room. We believe in everybody in the locker room. It's just a matter of putting together a complete game."
Right now it's hard for this team to put together a complete possession. They've had the ball 24 times in the past two games, with 19 of those possessions ending in either a groan-inducing Jordan Berry punt or a turnover.
Now making the playoffs is just a matter of beating a team on the road, a team that doesn't much care either way, and having another team lose on the road to another team that doesn't much care either. You like those odds? They're about 35%, according to the mathematically inclined.
"I don't like our season's fate in somebody else's hands," said standout safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, meaning the hands of the Houston Texans, who'll in all likelihood need to beat Tennessee at home next week for the Steelers to find a backdoor to the postseason. "I don't like that. It's very frustrating."
Imagine how the offense feels.
Tomlin had a hard time setting any tempo for this shaggy rendition Duck, Duck, Rudolph (Santa's gotta make it to town) after Duck Hodges extended his interception streak to four picks in five possessions (two last week, two this) in the first half. As a result, Duck didn't last until halftime, but came back to play most of the fourth quarter when Rudolph left with a shoulder injury that had him still wincing in the postgame locker room.
Watch your local outlets this week for any notice regarding midweek quarterback auditions before next week's visit to Baltimore. And go deep.
Sunday's quarterbacks converted three of 14 third-down situations, and Duck's terrifying flight of deep-ball incompetency reached 6 for 33 on third-and-7 or longer. The closest the Steelers came to having a competent quarterback on the field was when Ben Roethlisberger wandered out there to see how badly center Maurkice Pouncey was hurt. Pouncey left under his own power with a Roethlisberger escort, but the offense returned to the backup generators. One year ago this weekend, Roethlisberger threw for 380 yards at New Orleans. No one's thrown for 300 since, and only one person, the injured-and-injured-again James Conner, has run for 100-plus in one game this season.
"We can't really say it's too frustrating," said cornerback Mike Hilton after the defense held a fifth consecutive team to 17 points or fewer. "We know we're the strong part of this team. We try to put our team in the best position to win and we have to find ways to close the game out. You hope to be able to control your own destiny and just tend to your business, but now we need some things to fall our way. We've got to make sure we win next week."
The guy you feel for most acutely in this situation is, at least for me, Watt, who leads the league in quarterback hits and forced fumbles and is now the only player in Steelers history with 13 or more sacks in multiple years. He'll hope to avoid remembering 2019 as the first year he won defensive player of the year (his older brother has won it thrice) but watched an injured offense scuttle his chance at team success.
He says he won't remember it like that.
"I love all those guys in the locker room," he said. "I see them work. I see everything behind the scenes that a lot of people don't have the luxury of seeing. Everybody is working their tails off to win football games. I can promise you that. we're going to get back to the lab. I trust every guy in that locker room and we're going to perform."
With maybe two touchdowns at Baltimore (I guess three would be out of the question), they could even perform in January. But I doubt it.

Texto completo: It's easy to forget those left behind in a strong economy.
In the weeks leading up to Christmas in 1975, my mother made a hard choice: Her marriage was dead and it was time to leave it.
My father had not been physically abusive, but he had also not been kind. He was a drinker and philanderer who had dishonored my mother, an upstanding and conservative woman who never caroused or cavorted.
My mother left with my brothers and me, a gaggle of little boys stretched out over eight years -- from the oldest, at 13, to the youngest, me, at 5 years old.
My great-grandfather had recently died, shortly after his wife. Theirs was a love deep and strong. Her death hastened his. How to live in a world when the woman who was your world has moved into memory?
My great-uncle, a man who could neither read nor write, had lived with my great-grandparents his entire life. They had taken care of him. But, with his father's death, he now needed another caretaker.
My grandmother actually owned the house my great-grandparents and great-uncle lived in, so this collision of unfortunate circumstances created an opportunity to solve two problems with one action: My mother, my brothers and I would move into the house because we needed somewhere to stay, and my mother would become my great-uncle's caretaker because he needed help.
In the days before Christmas we loaded our meager things onto the flatbed of my grandmother's husband's pickup truck and ferried them across town to our new home. On Christmas Eve, as we stood in a nearly empty house, a call came. It was my grandmother calling from our new house.
She said Santa had just stopped there.
My brothers and I ran out of the house into the cold stillness of the night, jumped on our bikes and raced through the town's streets toward the new house. My mother trailed us in the car, her headlights illuminating the way for us.
That was the last time I was ever in the old house.
We burst into the house, eyes aglow, short of breath, mood electric. Gifts ringed the Christmas tree. Nothing major; we were poor.
My mother had worked at a poultry processing plant, dismembering chickens on an assembly line before getting a job as an office assistant at the high school, taking night courses to finish her degree and eventually landing a job as a teacher.
But that one salary had to finance a family of young boys in school and an old man who couldn't work.
We struggled. Many of our toys came from foraging rummage sales or picking through heaps of trash at the city dump.
My mother, being a resourceful and industrious woman, planted and gardened and bought some pigs and a calf. We would be poor, but we wouldn't be hungry. I think part of her determination to make our new life work was also to prove all the folks in town wrong: the one who warned that half-a-man was better than no man, the ones who thought my mother was trying to reach higher than her station.
That is how I grew up: working a garden and chasing runaway hogs that rooted out of their pen. I grew up watching my mother make quilts so that we wouldn't catch a chill from the winds that whistled through the drafty house. I grew up watching my mother clipping coupons and stretching two bags of groceries over two weeks.
This Christmas, please remember the people like my family: the poor, the people whose lives took a turn, those starting over, the fractured families, those working hard but not quite getting ahead.
It can be tempting in a strong economy like this one with such a low unemployment rate to overlook the poor. It can be easy in the consumer craze of Christmas to forget when we are splurging on gifts that there are people without food or medicine.
Poverty has declined in the U.S., but it has by no means disappeared. According to the Census Bureau, in 2018 there were 38.1 million people living in poverty, including 11.9 million kids under the age of 18.
And in this is a distinct and disturbing racial disparity: 20.8 percent of black people live in poverty, compared to 8.1 percent of non-Hispanic whites, 10.1 percent of Asians and 17.6 percent of Hispanics.
This is one reason that I was heartened to hear candidates at Thursday's debate specifically invoking and remembering the poor. As Pete Buttigieg put it, "I know you're only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics, but we've got to talk about poverty in this country."
Yes we do, and there is no better time to remember the poor than on Christmas.

Texto completo: With lawmakers at odds over a trial's format, impeachment proceedings are in limbo.
Top Democrats on Sunday renewed their demands for witnesses to testify at President Trump's impeachment trial, citing newly released emails showing that the White House asked officials to keep quiet over the suspension of military aid to Ukraine just 90 minutes after Mr. Trump leaned on that country's president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The emails, released late Friday by the Trump administration to the Center for Public Integrity, shed new light on Mr. Trump's effort to solicit Ukraine to help him win re-election in 2020, the matter at the heart of the House's vote on Wednesday to impeach him for "high crimes and misdemeanors."
With the Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders at odds over the trial's format, Democrats seized on the emails in an effort to put pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Mr. McConnell, who wants a bare-bones proceeding, has rejected a proposal by his Democratic counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, to have four top White House officials testify.
One of those officials is Michael Duffey, a senior budget official who told the Pentagon to keep quiet about the aid freeze because of the "sensitive nature of the request," according to an email sent on July 25. An hour and a half earlier that day, Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to "do us a favor, though" and investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
"What is a trial with no witnesses and no documents?" Mr. Schumer said Sunday during a news conference in New York City. "It's a sham trial."
In a statement late Saturday, Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the budget office, called it "reckless to tie the hold of funds to the phone call" and pointed to an earlier meeting in July where the suspension was announced.
With lawmakers home in their districts for a two-week holiday recess and Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer unable to come to terms, the proceedings are in limbo. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she will not send the Senate the articles of impeachment, necessary to bring about a trial, until she receives assurances from Mr. McConnell that the proceedings will be fair.
Mr. Trump, at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, for the Christmas holiday, was largely quiet on Twitter on Sunday until late afternoon, when he accused Democrats of precisely what they have accused him of: asking a foreign government to interfere in an election.
"The Democrats and Crooked Hillary paid for & provided a Fake Dossier, with phony information gotten from foreign sources, pushed it to the corrupt media & Dirty Cops, & have now been caught," Mr. Trump wrote. "They spied on my campaign, then tried to cover it up - Just Like Watergate, but bigger!"
In a letter last week to Mr. McConnell, Mr. Schumer proposed a trial beginning Jan. 7 that would give each side a fixed amount of time to present its case, and called for four top White House officials who have not previously testified to appear as witnesses. They are Mr. Duffey; Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff; Robert Blair, Mr. Mulvaney's senior adviser; and John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser.
Mr. McConnell, who is closely coordinating trial strategy with the White House, quickly rejected the request. But Mr. Trump has said he is open to witnesses; with the Senate all but certain to acquit him, he is demanding a speedy trial to clear his name. In withholding the articles, Ms. Pelosi is betting the president will lean on Mr. McConnell to give in to Democrats' demands.
"If the president is so innocent and claims he's innocent, why would he not allow, just like Richard Nixon did, the people that were closest to him to testify?" Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who is seeking the presidential nomination, said Sunday on the CBS program "Face the Nation."
Referring to Mr. Duffey, she added, "He says, 'Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping the information closely held to those who need to know.' What does that mean? What a great question. That's a question I want to have answered."
But Democrats say Ms. Pelosi is wise to hold onto the articles, because Mr. McConnell is effectively allowing Mr. Trump to plan his own trial.
"She is focusing a spotlight on the need to have a fair trial in the United States Senate," Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said on "Face the Nation." He said that was "especially necessary" with Mr. McConnell "saying publicly that he's not going to be an impartial juror, even though that's what the oath will require, that he's going to work in lock step with the president, who's the defendant in this case."
But Republicans, in turn, have accused Ms. Pelosi of overstepping.
"I actually don't think the speaker, who has great power in a lot of cases, has the power to decide not to send over the determined will of the House of Representatives," Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said on "Face the Nation." "They have voted. They have voted on two articles. They need to come and defend those two articles."
At least one academic, Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor who testified as an expert for Democrats during the impeachment inquiry, has argued that Mr. Trump will not be impeached until the articles are transmitted. Republicans have cited that position in their demands for Ms. Pelosi to move forward.
"It's a really untenable position, we think, for Speaker Pelosi to say, 'This president is such a clear and urgent danger to the world, to the globe,' that we have to basically trample his constitutional rights, to force a quick impeachment, and then say, 'Well, we're going to hold up impeachment papers and articles of impeachment to send to the Senate,"' Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."
"How can you possibly justify the contrast to say, 'This is urgent,' to then say, 'Well, we'll just have to wait and see'?" he added.

Texto completo: Reality TV made him a star, but he owes more to another medium, says historian
Talk radio has President Trump's back. 'Where does it say in the Constitution that if Washington's establishment doesn't like the results of a presidential election, they get to do whatever they want to do to overturn them?' asked the broadcast king, Rush Limbaugh, after the House formalized its impeachment inquiry in October. 'They have been trying to get rid of Donald Trump under false, lying premises since election night.' Mark Levin claimed that several of the witnesses testifying in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment hearings 'exposed themselves as part of a cabal.'-
To these radio hosts, Trump's voters are the ones who are really under attack: 'He's a surrogate for their hatred for us,' said Limbaugh. Given this robust defense, it's not surprising that Trump regularly retweets or quotes hosts like Limbaugh, Levin and Laura Ingraham.
But there's more to these apologetics than the fact that right-wing talk radio hosts agree with the president's views. Trump sounds just like them. Reality TV may have enshrined his celebrity, but Trump's tone, his concerns and his willingness to shock people are most at home on the radio waves during rush hour.
He calls the House investigation 'The Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!'-and a 'hoax.' He asserts without evidence that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is 'a corrupt politician and a criminal' and that Republicans are dealing with 'human scum.'
It's rants like these "-which mimic what millions of conservative Americans consume on the airwaves " that have helped Trump build and cement a durable bond with these voters. This relationship might prove to be the president's political salvation, propelling him not only past impeachment but maybe even to a second term.
When Trump declared his candidacy in 2015, reporters and analysts of all political stripes dismissed him as a sideshow. Not only did he lack political experience, but he kept saying things that politicians just weren't allowed to say. One astute observer thought otherwise: Limbaugh. He said he and his producer were 'laughing ourselves silly' during Trump's announcement speech, but he also presciently observed: 'This is gonna resonate with a lot of people, I guarantee you, and the Drive-Bys' " Limbaugh's term for mainstream journalists " 'are gonna pooh-pooh it. They're gonna relegate it to the carnival characteristics of the campaign and so forth, but it's gonna resonate, just like [1992 and 1996 presidential candidate Ross] Perot did.'
How did Limbaugh know that Trump's message would connect? Maybe because a lot of what the candidate said sounded like his show. The most controversial line in Trump's campaign announcement speech was his assertion that Mexico was sending the United States 'rapists' and others who brought drugs and crime with them. This claim horrified many Americans. But later that summer, after Trump was pushed on the point during the first Republican primary debate, Limbaugh defended him, arguing: 'You know, they try to dump on Trump, demand proof from him that the Mexican government is knowingly sending rapists, murderers and purse snatchers, and this kind of thing. They are! It's something I know full well. We've had the stories. We've done them on this program.' And indeed, he had: For more than a decade, Limbaugh had been railing about 'violent criminals' that 'countries like Mexico' were 'unwilling to take back.' To Limbaugh and his audience, Trump was showing a refreshing willingness to tell uncomfortable truths that Republican politicians shy away from because they are afraid of offending liberal sensibilities or being accused of bigotry.
Stylistically, Trump is far more talk-radio host than buttoned-down politician. For instance, he employs snarky nicknames to rip the mainstream media. While Levin bemoans the 'Washington Compost' and 'MSLSD,' Trump lashes out at the 'Failing New York Times,' 'Deface the Nation' and 'Very Low Ratings' CNN.
The extreme rhetoric Trump uses, especially on immigration, has long been a staple of talk radio (and other conservative media, like Fox News and Breitbart). During the 2007 debate over bipartisan immigration reform, Limbaugh warned that the Senate bill would 'fundamentally, and perhaps permanently, alter American society for the worse.' Fellow talker Michael Savage said then-Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) was engaged in 'gansterism' after Lott complained about talk radio hosts.
Seven years later, when Republican House Speaker John Boehner revealed his principles for immigration reform, Limbaugh exploded again. To him, the push to admit immigrants who, he claimed, saw the United States as 'no place special'-was one more part of the left's campaign to degrade America. Liberals were teaching young Americans in public schools, he said, 'not only not to love the country, but they're being lied to about how the country was founded, why it was founded, who founded it and what its purpose is.' And now, with immigration reform, Limbaugh fumed, the Republican Party wanted 'the end of the country as we know it.' While Ingraham admitted in 2014 that she personally liked Boehner, she, too, declared that what he was doing on immigration was 'a nightmare. It is political suicide both for the free market and ultimately for small-government conservatism.'
What enraged hosts and listeners the most was that, instead of going to war to defeat such dangerous ideas, establishment Republicans like Boehner were proposing them and trying to punish the few courageous conservatives who dared to fight back. That's what happened to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) in 2015 when he voted against a procedural rule on a trade bill that would have given President Barack Obama authority to negotiate deals faster. Leadership's attempt to punish Meadows enraged Levin, who called Boehner a 'fool' and a 'moron' and demanded: 'We need a new Republican Party that's principled, that's conservative, that believes in America. Not this crap that goes on inside the Beltway.'
Listening to talk radio, it was clear that many of the people in right-wing audiences wanted this sort of fire from politicians, too. But they had concluded that most Republican officials were too weak or too interested in currying favor in the clubby world of Washington to adequately battle Democrats. Later that summer, after analysts panned Trump's performance in the first Republican debate, a Limbaugh caller named Chris epitomized this sentiment, explaining that pundits underestimated the anger of Republicans like him toward their party. These voters felt 'almost betrayed.' To Chris, instead of two parties arrayed against each other, 'like Republican versus Democrat,' it was 'almost like two versions of one party, and the other side is the outsiders that aren't part of it.'
This belief created fertile ground for Trump: His blunt calls to build a border wall, his willingness to sneer at norms dictating what he couldn't say or do, and his instinct to punch back at critics thrilled conservatives who had been looking for a pugilistic politician who sounded like their favorite warriors on the airwaves.
And far from becoming more presidential after winning office, Trump has continued to shred norms, sticking to the sort of rhetoric more commonly found on talk radio than in the White House " especially on his Twitter feed. A New York Times analysis last month revealed that between Inauguration Day in 2017 and early this November, Trump had attacked someone or something in 5,889 tweets, while 1,710 tweets promoted conspiracy theories, also common on conservative airwaves. The impeachment inquiry has turned the president's Twitter feed positively molten: He has labeled Schiff 'sick' and suggested that the chairman be arrested for treason. He has dubbed Democrats a 'disgrace' and questioned their sanity. Like the radio hosts, he has called impeachment 'bulls---,' a 'coup' intended to take away people's 'freedoms.' He has demanded that lawmakers such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) be impeached (which isn't constitutionally possible) and even endorsed the theory that his removal might lead to a 'Civil War like fracture.'
To Trump's base, rather than being unpresidential or dangerous, this rhetoric proves he's a fighter willing to tell inconvenient truths and take on their burden,-just as hosts like Limbaugh, Levin and Ingraham have for decades. Listeners think that their values " such as a belief in traditional nuclear families and gender roles, patriotism, religiosity, and economic freedom from government intrusion " which they see as crucial to American greatness, are under attack. And Trump has the power, the megaphone and the willingness to battle back against a cruel and intolerant liberal establishment that increasingly dominates society, no matter the firestorm he creates. As long as he's doing that, his base isn't going to let him be destroyed by the forces seeking to cripple the country they love.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s almost inevitable acquittal doesn’t mean impeachment wasn’t worthwhile.
Trump, and Trump alone, will be the central issue of the coming election — the core concern for most voters. He’s the reason pollsters are predicting high turnout; he’s the reason voters on both sides are deeply engaged and ready to take action. In that environment, impeachment is the loudest, clearest message Democrats could send to the electorate. They don’t just oppose him because he is a Republican and a conservative; they oppose him because he is unfit. They oppose him because he is a threat to the values and aspirations of the republic.
Yes, this has been a partisan impeachment. But that’s the norm. Democrats weren’t eager to impeach Andrew Johnson; Republicans drove the case against Bill Clinton. By making this case now — by sanctioning Trump in the strongest, most consequential manner available to them — congressional Democrats have set the terms for the next election. Will voters affirm shameless corruption and lawlessness or will they reject Trump’s open attempt to subvert the Constitution?
Arguably, this impeachment is less partisan than it could have been. Democrats could have pressed their advantage to shape the entire terrain of the presidential election. I’ve argued before that they should have embraced a more leisurely process. They should have taken their time to build the most comprehensive case against Trump, calling as many witnesses as needed and pursuing contempt of Congress if they refused. With majority support for an inquiry, Democrats could have cataloged his criminality and covered the full scope of his wrongdoing.
It would have been a risk. A monthslong impeachment might definitively demonstrate the president’s corruption and illegal behavior, or it might undermine the Democratic majority and threaten the fight for the White House. But if the public is at least open to the idea of removing the president for his actions, then a slow impeachment would have given Democrats the time and space to make the best version of that argument.
Democrats did the opposite. Initially, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn’t want to impeach. She was forced into the process by Trump’s egregious behavior. Once committed, she went with a narrow but dramatic investigation centered on the president’s attempt to coerce Ukraine into damaging a political rival. It produced two articles of impeachment — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On Wednesday, the president was impeached, with nearly every Democrat voting in favor and every Republican voting against.
Whenever this process reaches the Senate — Democrats intend to hold on to the articles until the beginning of next year — Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, has said he would end it as quickly as possible. “I’m not an impartial juror,” he told reporters Tuesday. “This is a political process. There’s not anything judicial about it. The House made a partisan political decision to impeach. I would anticipate we will have a largely partisan outcome in the Senate. I’m not impartial about this at all.” McConnell followed up with a speech on the Senate floor Thursday in which he blasted Democrats for delaying the articles. “Some House Democrats imply they are withholding the articles for some kind of ‘leverage’ so they can dictate the Senate process to senators. I admit I’m not sure what ‘leverage’ there is in refraining from sending us something we do not want.”
If and when the trial happens, McConnell’s goal is to acquit the president and end the process as quickly as possible. This means no additional evidence or witnesses — no attempt to judge the charges against the president. The Senate will prejudge only.
Because we may never get a real trial, it’s tempting to think this process was a waste of time. But that’s a mistake. Impeachment is rare. Impeachment is historic. Even with acquittal, impeachment leaves a mark. That’s why the president has complained about the process every chance he has gotten.
“I think it’s a horrible thing to be using the tool of impeachment, which is supposed to be used in an emergency,” Trump grumbled in the midst of a meeting with President Mario Abdo Benítez of Paraguay. “It’s a scam. It’s something that shouldn’t be allowed. And it’s a very bad thing for our country.”
On the eve of the House vote, he sent hundreds of tweets raging against Pelosi, Rep. Adam Schiff and the Democratic Party as a whole.
“READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!,” Trump said on Twitter. “The Impeachment Hoax is the greatest con job in the history of American politics! The Fake News Media, and their partner, the Democrat Party, are working overtime to make life for the United Republican Party, and all it stands for, as difficult as possible!”
And Tuesday the president sent a rambling six-page letter to Pelosi condemning impeachment as an “unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers.” He wrote, “By proceeding with your invalid impeachment, you are violating your oaths of office, you are breaking your allegiance to the Constitution, and you are declaring open war on American Democracy.” Attacking the process as an “election-nullification scheme,” Trump insists that it’s actually unconstitutional for the House to exercise its constitutional prerogative.
A president who wants to be impeached — a president who thinks he benefits from impeachment — does not behave this way. If Trump is unhinged, it’s because he sees that impeachment hurts , that it harms him in the eyes of the public and undermines his case for reelection. Acquittal won’t change that.
This isn’t a statement about the polls, which show a divided public. An average of 47.3% of Americans support impeachment and removal, versus 46.2% who don’t. Compare this with his job approval numbers — 43.3% who approve versus 51.9% who disapprove — and there’s a clear group of voters who disapprove of the president but don’t want to remove him from office before the election.
This is a statement about the way impeachment promises to loom over the next year of American politics. Just because Trump will almost certainly be acquitted doesn’t mean he is unaffected. We can already see how his reactions — his anger, his rage, his furious denunciations — are counterproductive. They undermine his case for himself, bolstering the Democratic charge that he’s fundamentally unfit for the office. A slower impeachment would have made this dynamic stronger, with Trump responding to new revelations in ever more damaging ways, but that’s not on the table.
What is on the table is a narrative that Democratic presidential candidates can incorporate into their overall message. You can already see this happening. “Today is a sad but necessary day for democracy,” Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in a video statement for his presidential campaign. “The president of the United States is being impeached, and that is the right thing to do because we have got to never forget that no individual in this country, certainly not the president of the United States, is above the law, is above the Constitution.”
This isn’t the relentless focus on personality that undermined the previous campaign against Trump. It’s an important point of information to tie into a larger political case. Sanders makes that completely clear in his conclusion: “I am running for president not just to develop and work on a set of policies that represent working families in this country, not just to take on the greed and corruption of the 1% but also to change the way the presidency functions. And that is, we cannot continue having a pathological liar in the White House.”
Sanders is using impeachment to underscore the themes of his campaign. He’s tying Trump to a broader narrative of corruption and elite impunity, reinforcing the message of impeachment without naming the president or making him the subject of his remarks. He’s showing voters that he’s attentive to the central issue of this election without letting it consume his message. It’s a deft move, and a strong one for an election where many voters will want someone to stand against Trump and make a comprehensive case for a new direction.
On the night of his impeachment, Trump held a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan. Echoing his Twitter feed, his speech was angry and bitter. He called himself “the first person to ever get impeached and there’s no crime.” He attacked Schiff as a “pathological liar.” Bewildered, he told his audience, “It doesn’t really feel like we’re being impeached.”
It’s possible that impeachment is a wash — that acquittal will leave Trump unblemished and energize his supporters instead of benefiting Democrats. It’s possible that he relishes the chaos — that he wanted this fight. His words and behavior, however, tell a different story. And for once, I’m inclined to believe what he says.

The Sackler Family is Angry About Their Name Being Removed from the Walls of Tufts

Texto completo: It’s famously been a bad year for the Sackler family, a group of people who became enormously wealthy through the Connecticut-based company Purdue Pharma, which profited hugely via the widespread sale and marketing of fatally addictive painkillers. Due to the connection between the Sackler family and unimaginable pain and suffering, a number of institutions recently elected to stop taking money from them, including but not limited to: London’s National Portrait Gallery, the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You’d think the Sacklers would be used to being shunned by now, but it turns out that’s not the case. Two weeks ago, Tufts became the first major university to remove the Sackler name from its buildings and campus literature, and the family is apparently so incensed about this they had their lawyer send a letter to the school in protest.
According to a lawyer named Robert Cordy who specifically represents Raymond Sackler and Mortimer Sackler, the removal of their name from the walls of Tufts represents a violation of the contract the family and the university entered into decades ago; the contract being that the latter could secure fiduciary support from the former. Cordy’s letter characterizes the removal as “a breach of the many binding commitments made by the University dating back to 1980 in order to secure the family’s support, including millions of dollars in donations for facilities and critical medical research.” Michael Rodman, a spokesperson for Tufts, responded with a statement that expressed the university’s belief in its decision. “We considered a number of factors in making the decision to remove the Sackler name and ultimately decided that the association with Tufts University was untenable and in opposition with the values and mission of the medical school and the university,” Rodman said in his statement, which was acquired by the New York Times . “Since the announcement we have received incredible support from faculty, students, alumni and the public. We at Tufts stand by our decision, we know that it is the right thing to do, and we are prepared to vigorously defend our position.”
Interestingly, the Sacker family didn’t respond so indignantly when the Louvre removed their name from its walls, perhaps because the Paris museum denied that they did so because of the bad press garnered by the opioid crisis. One could speculate the Sacklers are anticipating that many other American academic institutions will fall in line with Tufts and reconsider whether they want the Sackler name on their walls, and the long, slow process of a family legacy’s dissolution is a grim prospect. However, it’s definitely not a prospect as grim as the injury or overdose of a beloved relative who got over-prescribed OxyContin, so the Sacklers should be able to tough this one out.

Shaped by Vietnam War reporting, Ward Just, who died at 84, became a deft political novelist

Texto completo: Ward Just had only been a Washington Post reporter for a few months in 1965 when he was offered the opportunity to cover the Vietnam War.
“It was as if some voice said to me, 'This is something you'd better do,' " he recalled in a 2004 Globe interview.
The following 18 months as a war correspondent shaped him into the fiction writer he had hoped to become. “I was watching people, for the first time in my life, in extreme situations," he said, “the way people in that environment dealt with one another, while all the time there was this thundering war going on in the jungles."
Leaving newspaper reporting behind a couple of years after returning home in 1967, he wrote a shelf full of novels — fiction that drew more admiration than awards, to the consternation of his fans.
Mr. Just, who had Lewy body dementia, died Thursday in Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Plymouth. He was 84 and had lived on Martha's Vineyard full time since the early 1990s.
“I can't imagine what my life would have been without Vietnam," he told the Globe in 1982. “It's present in the memory, it moves around with me wherever I am."
Vietnam and the swirling politics in Washington, D.C., often figured in his novels and short stories, and in the magazine and newspaper articles he wrote less often after turning to fiction.
“Echo House," which chronicles three generations of political powerbrokers, was set in Washington — a city “that is his uncontested literary turf," John Hough Jr. wrote in a 1997 Globe review of Mr. Just's novel, which was a National Book Award finalist.
“Surely no living novelist knows Washington better, or brings to it such penetrating intelligence," Hough added.
Mr. Just “is not merely America's best political novelist. He is America's greatest living novelist. To our discredit, he's also America's Greatest Unknown Novelist," Susan Zakin wrote for the LitHub website last year.
His writing reached beyond the battlefields and political campaigns he had once covered as a reporter, however.
“He is equally at home in Chicago, Boston, and Washington," Herbert Mitgangwrote in a 1990 New York Times review of Mr. Just's collection “Twenty-One: Selected Stories."
In the story “About Boston," an O Henry Award finalist, a character says of the Hub: “I like collapsing civilizations. I'm a connoisseur of collapse and systems breakdown and bankruptcy — moral, ethical and financial. So Boston is perfect."
Still, Mr. Just's precise observations had a particular resonance when his subject was a battlefield where he witnessed combatants at close range.
One day in 1966, in a Vietnam rice field, Mr. Just had “settled under a palm tree to make endless notes — a reporter's woolgathering — and then dropped flat at the sound of shots, five of them in very rapid succession," he recalled in a 1982 Washington Post essay.
When the shooting stopped, he spotted a soldier nearby on his back, “and amid all that drab — the green of his fatigues, the black stock of his M16, the sweaty gray of his T-shirt — a small red hole in his heart," Mr. Just wrote.
“My journalist's eye — this is the eye they pay you for and that, in turn, you pay for too, sometimes, in some coin — registered that his cigarette was burning on the ground beside him, a Lucky Strike," he wrote, adding that the soldier had “died before the cigarette did, and I find that now a cheap irony, though I didn't then. From details such as these, according to the canons of journalism, I knew, you could make something larger."
Born in Michigan City, Ind., on Sept. 5, 1935, Ward Swift Just was the son of Franklin Ward Just and Elizabeth Swift.
Mr. Just's grandfather and father served successively as publisher of the Waukegan News-Sun, and he grew up in that Chicago suburb, and in nearby Lake Forest.
“From my earliest moments, my dream was to write fiction," Mr. Just said in 2004. “I wrote a play when I was in the fourth grade and wrote short stories all the way through grade school, prep school, and most of the way through college."
After graduating from Cranbrook, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., boarding school, Mr. Just went to Trinity College in Hartford, “from which I never graduated but attended more or less faithfully for four years," he recalled in 1982. “I didn't graduate because academe was never my long suit. The only thing I ever wanted to do was write, so I either failed or got D's in everything besides history and courses in creative writing."
Upon his return to Illinois, he found working for his father at the family newspaper an ill fit.
“We fought about how the paper should be organized, what I ought to be doing on the paper, what I was doing, what he should be doing, what he was doing. The problem, essentially, was his shadow. He cast a long one, and I don't like shadows a whole lot," Mr. Just said in 1982, and added: “The only way out was to leave."
He ended up writing for Newsweek magazine, eventually under Ben Bradlee in the Washington bureau. When Bradlee went to The Washington Post, he hired Mr. Just.
After returning from Vietnam, where he had been injured by shrapnel from a grenade, Mr. Just wrote his first book, “To What End: Report From Vietnam."
Then he covered the 1968 presidential bids of Eugene McCarthy and Richard M. Nixon (“a campaign of oceanic tedium," he told the Globe) and wrote editorials for the Post, but “I knew I was finished," he said in 2004. “I was a pretty good war correspondent, but I had absolutely no desire to go back to that war or any other war. With newspaper reporting, you've got to have a lust for news if you're going to do it well. I had lost it."
He wrote his first novel — “A Soldier of the Revolution" (1970) — and was principally a fiction writer ever after. His other novels included “An Unfinished Season" (2004), which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.
“He should have won the Pulitzer half a dozen times," the writer Frederick Busch, who died in 2006, told the Globe in 2004.
Mr. Just's first two marriages, Jean Ramsay and Anne Burling, ended in divorce.
In 1983, he married Sarah Catchpole, with whom he lived in Paris for several years before settling permanently on Martha's Vineyard, where they had lived part time.
In addition to Catchpole, Mr. Just's survivors include his children from his previous marriages, Jennifer of Woodbridge, Conn., Julia of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Ian of Arlington; and six grandchildren.
Information about a memorial service was not immediately available.
Describing his writing process, Mr. Just said his novels emerged from the writing itself — “I draft and redraft."
“I'm not one to outline," he said in 1982. “I start with the first sentence and never know where I am going to end up. I never know the first sentence until I know the last. That changes."
And switching from journalism to fiction required a realignment of his approach, including paring down the details he included in his prose.
“Factual material can overwhelm the vessel," he said in 2004. “I do think that what is going on behind the eyelids is more important than the eyelids. If you spend a lot of time on descriptive details, that detracts from what is going on inside a character, which you know by gesture and language."

Texto completo: Being with people you love becomes more important than small digs and even arguing about Donald Trump.
Anyone desperate enough to Google the term "holiday stress" will be rewarded (or become more overwhelmed) with about 395,000,000 results. Limit the search to "holiday stress statistics 2019" and the results come down to a measly 28,100,000 or so. There are even specific memes and GIFs on how to handle the financial, social and emotional stresses of the season, including my current favorite, the article that ran in this newspaper by a Buddhist teacher who advises practicing "acceptance," an activity that even on nonholidays can often seem as challenging as climbing Mount Everest in an ice storm.
Still, the alternative can be worse. As the Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute's newsletter put it, "Because the holiday season often requires us to keep track of and pay attention to a greater number of responsibilities than usual, the brain's prefrontal cortex goes into overdrive. Over time, a high level of demand can decrease memory, halt production of new brain cells and cause existing brain cells to die."
I know all about holiday stress. For years I've hosted a Thanksgiving buffet for around 30 people and a Christmas Eve dinner for a somewhat smaller group, both of which started as a buffer against my own parents' poor showing on holidays. (In the Dysfunctional Parents Olympics, mine wouldn't even qualify for bronze medals, though my mother in particular had her moments, as when she routinely looked around my quite comfortable home and announced that she wished she had the money to "help us to fix the place up." Never mind that she had the money, and the place didn't need fixing up.)
As these events became traditions, they, too, became more stressful, what with food prep, snapping at my husband over when and how he intended to pitch in and, as the years went by, trying to keep my aging father from doing just that. (We failed seven years ago when he missed a step and broke his hip a few hours before guests were to arrive. I ate my turkey in the emergency room.)
Then, in early October this year, I tripped and landed in the hospital myself, with a broken femur. After some debate, my husband and I called off Thanksgiving, which was in itself semi-stressful because I hated to disappoint our holiday regulars. Instead, we left Houston and headed to my brother's place in Brooklyn, where I ordered a catered dinner in advance and, for the first time in about 25 years, sat down to a quiet meal with just five other people. My only stressful moments came when I discovered my brother had no ice, no cloth napkins and no appetizers, which said a lot more about me than him.
"Mom, this was the best Thanksgiving we've ever had," my son said later, opening the next era of intergenerational stress.
Still, I knew what he meant. I missed my Thanksgiving extravaganza, but my injury had forced me into practicing acceptance in the form of a no-stress holiday.
As I've moved toward Christmas in the last few weeks, I see I am facing the same, and without noticing it, have been moving in that direction for quite some time. My mother has been gone since 2013, and my dad died two years ago; my husband's parents, too, have been lost to us. My brothers and sisters-in-law live far away with families of their own, and our son, a nurse, will be working Christmas Day and isn't yet at the point of gracing us with grandchildren. My gift list has grown smaller and more affordable with each passing year, and so has my job in the kitchen. At some point I learned to go martyrless by taking friends up on their offers to bring a dish or a bottle of wine.
If time and circumstance have eliminated a lot of stress, it's been replaced with something else. Whatever my parents' failings were, their absence on holidays is impossible to ignore. When one of my best friends has occasionally opted to accept another invitation, my party has seemed incomplete. I crave sameness because the alternative isn't always so great: Two years ago, another regular guest lost her husband between Christmas and New Year's Day; another had a stroke earlier this year.
None of the stories on holiday anxiety talk about these kinds of transitions, maybe because they clash with the overall spirit of the season or because their importance is too hard to understand in the abstract. But at a certain point in life, being with people you love does become more important than small digs and paper towel napkins and even arguing about Donald Trump. The reality of loss and the inevitability of more loss is, maybe, the most powerful destresser of all.
Which is why I am up-stressing Christmas. I'm down from two crutches to one, which still gave me the option of canceling the second round of annual holiday dinners. I couldn't do it. I tried to keep the guest list small -- around six or so -- but am now up to 15. I don't know how I will scrub the house on just one leg, but I'll just have to accept that I can. Google lists 114,000,000 Christmas housecleaning tips. That should help.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The day after the House cast historic votes to impeach President Trump, Democrats grappled Thursday with when to send the charges to the Republican-led Senate, hoping to gain leverage in a bicameral clash over the contours of an election-year trial.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted Thursday that Senate Republicans must provide details on witnesses and testimony before she would send over the charges for Trump's trial. No deal, replied Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell after meeting with his Senate Democratic counterpart.
“We remain at an impasse," he said.
It became increasingly likely that the limbo could persist until the new year. The House is poised to leave town Friday for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, possibly without taking the votes that would be required to start the process in the Senate.
“We are ready," said Pelosi, who said Wednesday night that she was reluctant to send the charges or name the lawmakers who would prosecute the case against Trump until she was certain of a fair process for a Senate trial. “When we see what they have, we will know who and how many we will send over."
McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has complicated the picture for Democrats by asserting that he has no intention of acting as an impartial juror in a Senate trial of Trump but would instead do everything in his power, working in concert with the White House, to quickly acquit the president.
But if Pelosi was angling for an upper hand in negotiations about how the trial would proceed, McConnell quickly squashed the notion Thursday in a scathing speech in which he denounced her and Democrats for impeaching Trump.
“The vote did not reflect what had been proven; it only reflects how they feel about the president," McConnell said from the Senate floor. “The Senate must put this right. We must rise to this occasion. There is only one outcome that is suited to the paucity of evidence, the failed inquiry, the slapdash case."
And in comments that underscored the risks Pelosi faces in withholding the articles, McConnell effectively argued that the delay reflected a weak case against Trump, a blink by the Democrats in their standoff with the president.
“The prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country and second-guessing whether they even want to go to trial," McConnell said. “They said impeachment was so urgent that it could not even wait for due process, but now they're content to sit on their hands. This is comical."
Trump, echoing McConnell's remarks, took to Twitter to attack what he called a “pathetic" case.
“Pelosi feels her phony impeachment HOAX is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the Senate, which can set a date and put this whole SCAM into default if they refuse to show up!" Trump wrote. “The Do Nothings are so bad for our Country!"
The angry tone of the comments reflected what people close to the president have said is a keen desire by Trump to be publicly vindicated in a Senate trial, a prospect that Pelosi appears to be placing in jeopardy.
Meanwhile, the fallout from the impeachment of Trump continued.
The Nielsen company reported Thursday that at least 15 million television viewers watched the House of Representatives vote to impeach Trump.
Both Fox News Channel and NBC had roughly 5 million viewers during the hour, starting at 8 p.m. Eastern, when the House took separate votes Wednesday on two articles of impeachment, Nielsen said. MSNBC had 3.2 million viewers and CNN had 2.84 million.
In another development, a magazine for evangelical Christians, whose support for Trump has been ardent and unshakable, called for his removal from office.
Christianity Today, which was founded by the late Rev. Billy Graham, said in an editorial published on Thursday that “the president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president's political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral."
“The reason many are not shocked about this," the editorial added, “is that this president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration."
Meanwhile, in Washington, nerves were raw on both sides of the aisle the morning after the House voted to impeach Trump. He was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his campaign to pressure Ukraine to smear Democratic rivals, making him only the third president to be impeached.
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the Democratic leader, called McConnell's speech a “30-minute partisan screed." Later, he met with Pelosi behind closed doors to plan strategy.
In the House, Pelosi shot back at McConnell: “I don't think anybody expected that we would have a rogue president and a rogue leader in the Senate at the same time."
And even as the next step in the process remained murky, she said Democrats had been receiving accolades from people across the country who were buoyed by the House action to charge Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors.
“Seems like people have a spring in their step because the president was held accountable for his reckless behavior," Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. “No one is above the law, and the president has been held accountable."
Some leading Democrats have cast doubt on whether a Senate trial will happen at all.
On Thursday morning, Representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, said he was willing to wait “as long as it takes" to transmit the two impeachment articles approved Wednesday night.
“Until we can get some assurances from the majority leader that he is going to allow for a fair and impartial trial to take place, we would be crazy to walk in there knowing he has set up a kangaroo court," Clyburn said Thursday morning on CNN.
In her own news conference in the House Thursday, Pelosi played down the delay over pressing charges in the Senate but declined repeatedly to offer a timeline for when the House might file its case. Pelosi has indicated she will work with House chairmen and Schumer to determine when the articles should be submitted and what meets her standard for fairness.
Schumer has already set forth his own detailed plan for a trial. In a letter sent Sunday night to McConnell, Schumer proposed a trial beginning Jan. 7 that would give each side a fixed amount of time to present its case, and called for four top White House officials who have not testified — including Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff; and John Bolton, the president's former national security adviser — to appear as witnesses.
McConnell quickly rejected the plan.
“Is the president's case so weak that none of the president's men can defend him under oath?" Schumer asked in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning.
A top ally of Trump's, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called the possibility that the House could hold back the articles a “constitutional extortion mechanism that is dangerous for the country."
Graham, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he spoke Thursday morning with Trump, who asked him, “What's happening?"
“He's puzzled," Graham said. “I tried the best I could to explain it. I'm puzzled, too."

Texto completo: As cold nights add starlight to towns already glimmering with festive illumination, and homes fill with the scent of evergreens and freshly-baked cookies, there's no better time to curl up on the couch and enjoy a good book.
If you like your fantasy escapes just a little closer to home, authors from across the world have written stories set right here in Wisconsin. From the peninsula of Door County to Culver's ButterBurgers, readers can find familiar touches in these books, nestled alongside suspense, romance, magic and bloody marys.
In no particular order, here is a list of Wisconsin-inspired books with picks for readers of differing ages to enjoy — and gift — this holiday season and the whole year through. Books are available online, at bookstores and at the local libraries.
"Black House" by Stephen King and Peter Straub In the mood for a tale of horror? Stephen King and Peter Straub offer readers just that on a Wisconsin-shaped platter in "Black House."
The sequel to "The Talisman," Black House follows Jack Sawyer, a retired Los Angeles Police Department detective, who lives Tamarack, a small village on the state's west side — the same area where Wisconsin native Straub spent time as a child, according to the La Crosse Tribune.
When in nearby French Landing, a person called "The Fisherman" begins to kill children in the style of serial killer Albert Fish, local law enforcement friends reach out to Jack for help. During the investigation, Jack is called back to the same parallel universe he entered as 12-year-old, where he must explore his past and seek for answers to the present, according to the book's description.
The book ties into the King's "Dark Tower" series, a body of work which is referenced in several of the master of horror's novels, such as "The Shining," and places them in the same universe, according to CinemaBlend.
"Shotgun Lovesongs" by Nikolas Butler Small-town Wisconsin life and deeply rooted relationships are at the heart of Wisconsin author Nikolas Butler's debut novel "Shotgun Lovesongs."
Henry, Lee, Kipp and Ronny have been friends since childhood. Despite moves, marriages, ailments and fame, their relationships endured into adulthood — some remaining stronger than others.
As the book begins, readers find the quartet — with the addition of Henry's wife Beth — reuniting for Kipp's wedding. But, while they are together once more, the town and the relationships don't feel the same for each person. What follows is a test a lifelong friendships and marriage, shaking even the strongest of foundations.
Although its setting of Little Wing — a small town on Wisconsin's western side — is fictional, the small-town feel it emulates is known to readers who lived in the state. Readers will recognize familiar sites: the large expanses of farm land, the water tower which offered views high above buildings, and the watering hole where everyone gathers, too.
"Wisconsin Death Trip" by Michael Lesy Published in the early 1970s, Michael Lesy's "Wisconsin Death Trip" became a cult classic with its chilling real-life account of a small Wisconsin town mired in tragedy.
The book profiles Black River Falls from 1890 to 1910, a time when the town began to spiral down after the mines — its lifeblood — shut down. Using photos from the town photographer, Charles Van Schaik, Lesy pieces together a narrative of residents' lives as they confront business closures, suicide, murder, diphtheria, mental illness and, in one account, a woman being buried alive, according to Artful Living.
Although not the most lighthearted of books, "Wisconsin Death Trip" gives an eye-opening account of what it was like to live in a time of much uncertainty. For those who want more, the book was turned into a documentary of the same name in 1999.
"Seventeenth Summer" by Maureen Daly Considered to be the start of the modern young adult genre, "Seventeenth Summer" takes place in early 1940s Fond du Lac — the city Author Maureen Daly grew up in — and follows teens Angie Morrow and Jack Duluth.
In the summer before Angie leaves for college, she catches the eye of Jack, the high school basketball player, who too plans to leave the city to move to Oklahoma. Despite what may come, a relationship between the two slowly blossoms into love.
Along with capturing Fond du Lac landmarks, like Lakeside Park and Pete Mengl's, the story captures the time period as well — an era of courtships, strict propriety and soda drinking at the drug store.
"Better off Friends" by Elizabeth Eulberg For those who love a will-they-won't-they story, the young adult novel "Better off Friends" serves one up with Wisconsin touches.
The story begins when California native Levi moves with his family to Wisconsin, where, at his middle school, he meets Macallan. While she first is only tasked with showing him around, Macallan and Levi quickly bond and become best friends.
Through both Macallan's and Levi's perspectives, readers follows the friends into high school where they must figure out if their relationship should remain just platonic — all while enjoying Packer games and trips to Culvers for ButterBurgers.
"The Bloody Trail: In Quest of the Best Wisconsin Bloody Marys" by Susan Fiebig Readers looking to take a tour of the state's bloody mary offerings will find a guide in "The Bloody Trail: In Quest of the Best Wisconsin Bloody Marys."
For the past 15 years, Fond du Lac resident Susan Fiebig has traveled across the United States in search of the best bloody marys. In the interactive 46-page book, Fiebig focuses on her Wisconsin travels — the state which she said has the best — and profiles the 11 best stops, while giving a history on the drink itself.
Those in search of more bloody marys across the state can read Fiebig's sequel "Adventures on the Bloody Trail: The Quest Continues" created with the help of readers. The book includes a map of 20 restaurants and bars that make the drink, as well as bloody mary trivia.
"American Gods" by Neil Gaiman Deities new and old walk in Wisconsin in "American Gods" a novel by Neil Gaiman, a British author with a residence in Wisconsin.
Days after Shadow's wife and best friend are killed in a car accident, he is recruited to work for businessman Mr. Wednesday. What follows is a road trip across America as legendary and modern gods fight for power in America, according to the book description.
Multiple chapters take place in the state, such as in a Northwoods town called Lakeside, and the House on the Rock, what, in the novel, is the "one of the holiest places in the United States," according to Neil Gaiman.
The television network Starz recently adapted the book into a TV series and, in March 2019, renewed it for a third season, according to Entertainment Weekly.
"The Women" by T.C. Boyle "The Women" shares the story of famed Wisconsin architect Frank Lloyd Wright's relationship with four women throughout his life.
Told from the perspective of a fictional Japanese architect writing a biography of Wright's life, the book looks at his first wife and mother to six children Catherine "Kitty" Tobin; Mamah Borthwick, his lover who was murdered; his second wife Maude Noel; and third and final wife Olgivanna Lazovich Milanoff, according to The New York Times.
While architecture is not the main focus of the story, part of the story takes place at Taliesen, the home south of Spring Green Wright built to protect he and Borthwick from the press. It is also where a servant murdered Borthwick and her children, according to The New York Times. The other women also spend time at the rebuilt home, including wives Milanoff and Noel.
"Little House in the Big Woods" by Laura Ingalls Wilder A staple of childhood literature, "Little House in the Big Woods" chronicles part of the life of author Laura Ingalls Wilder near Pepin, Wisconsin.
In the Big Woods of Northwest Wisconsin, Ingalls Wilder lived with Ma and Pa, and her sisters Mary and Carrie in a log cabin surrounded only by trees and wild animals, like the wolves that howled at night. Days were filled with a mix of hard work and fun — salting and smoking venison for the winter, picking up wood chips, harvesting sap for maple syrup and on cold nights listening to Pa play the fiddle.
The book was the first in the "Little House on the Prairie" series and survey conducted by School Library Journal in 2012 placed it as number 19 in the Top 100 Children's Novels of All Time. However, the series is not without criticism.
With its depiction of Native Americans and minstrel shows, the series portrays "dated cultural attitudes towards Indigenous people and people of color that contradict modern acceptance, celebration, and understanding of diverse communities," according to a statement from the Association for Library Service. For this reason, critics recommend reading the books with the historical context in mind, according to The Atlantic.
"Crymost" by Dean H. Wild A Wisconsin resident, author Dean H. Wild pulled on the small towns surrounding him for inspiration as he wrote his tale of horror and the paranormal in "Crymost."
"Crymost" is set in Knoll, Wisconsin, a somewhat-segregated fictional town which, if placed on a map, would be found between Dodge and Fond du Lac counties, Wild told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in January 2019. On the edge of town is a place which residents called the Crymost.
Back in the early 19th century, residents noticed a feeling of sadness hanging over them at cliff. Decades later, they bring their suffering and offer mementos to it. As the supernatural awakens at Crymost, small town secrets begin to be spilled, and the town is put in jeopardy.
While the story calls on fictional forces, the story is grounded in real-world settings and gives shout outs to towns and cities Wisconsin readers will recognize, like Fond du Lac, Oshkosh, and Milwaukee, Wild told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in January.
"What the Moon Said" by Gayle Rosengren Readers will take a step back in-time and see the world through youthful eyes as they delve into Gayle Rosengren's Great-Depression-era novel, "What the Moon Said."
The child of Russian immigrants, Esther Vogel's life is filled with superstitions of her mother, who spends more time searching for signs than showing affection to her daughter. But when her father loses his job in Chicago, Esther's day-to-day is upended as the family moves to a Wisconsin farm and makes a deteriorating house with no electricity their home, according to Publisher's Weekly.
Geared towards middle-grade readers, the book gives readers a look at Wisconsin life in the 1930s as Esther finds adventure in the farm land and its animals, school and new friendship. All the while, she seeks to show her mother how much she can do, and see life for more than just the possibility that comes with superstitious signs, according to Penguin Random House.
"A Reliable Wife" by Robert Goolrick Wisconsin-based historical fiction comes wrapped in a suspenseful and romantic package with Robert Goolrick's "A Reliable Wife."
In the early 1900s, a train from Chicago brings Catherine Land to rural Wisconsin. She is there for one purpose: to meet the man who placed a newspaper ad "for a reliable wife."
However, she doesn't intend to be the "simple, honest woman" she described herself to be. Catherine plans to slowly poison Ralph, and profit off his death, according to Workman Publishing. Little does she know, the businessman waiting on the platform for her, Ralph Truitt, has plans of his own.
These plans and later plot twists play out in a small Wisconsin town against the backdrop of the frigid Wisconsin winter landscape, which serves to keep the characters close and build tension.
"Death Stalks Door County" by Patricia Skalka One of Wisconsin's most popular vacation destinations becomes the site of a series of summer murders in "Death Stalks Door County" by Patricia Skalka.
After the deaths of his wife and daughter, former Homicide Detective Dave Cubiak leaves Chicago and moves to Door County, where he takes a position as a park ranger. Although in a different place, Dave isn't able to outrun death. In the days leading up to the Fourth of July Festival, six people die in Door County, according to Publisher's Weekly.
With pressure from a Peninsula State Park citizens advisory board member to figure out what is going on as the festival approaches, Dave begins to dig into the deaths and see if they are only just accidents or more sinister murders.
For those who can't get enough of the Door County landscapes Skalka writes about, the book is the first of five books in the Dave Cubiak Door County Mystery series.

Texto completo: "Bombshell" exploded into the awards race last week, leading the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations with four nods, including best ensemble, actress (Charlize Theron) and supporting actress (Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman).
The drama goes behind the scenes at Fox News in 2016. It chronicles the efforts of a group of women – including on-the-outs host Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and star anchor Megyn Kelly – to expose a culture of misogyny, leading to the ouster of Machiavellian CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women.
Fox News spokesperson Caley Cronin declined to comment to USA TODAY beyond confirming that "Bombshell" producers "never reached out to Fox News during any part of the production."
The film was directed by Jay Roach ("Trumbo") and written by Charles Randolph ("The Big Short"), who breaks down what's fact, fiction and somewhere in between.
Is Robbie's character real? Robbie plays an ambitious, wide-eyed staffer named Kayla Pospisil. A lifelong Fox News fanatic and young evangelical ("I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space," she says), Pospisil soon catches the eye of Ailes, who promises to promote her to on-air talent in exchange for sexual favors.
Although Pospisil is a fictional character, her experiences of harassment are drawn from interviews Randolph and Roach conducted with ex-Fox News staffers.
"What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to," Randolph says.
"Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life."
Is McKinnon's character fictional? The "Saturday Night Live" favorite is a scene-stealer as Pospisil's savvy co-worker Jess Carr, a closeted lesbian and liberal who has complicated feelings about working at a network that preaches against her values and lifestyle.
Carr was "all made up," Randolph says.
"I wanted to show the bystander narrative. Megyn's story is the story of someone who comes to discover she is complicit by virtue of the institutional norms and her ability to manipulate them in the predation of a younger generation of women. Likewise with Kayla: Her willingness to look the other way creates this dynamic, and she realizes at the end that it affects herself."
Did someone poison Kelly? The film begins with an anxious but steely Kelly en route to moderate the first debate of the Republican primary campaign. She accepts coffee offered by her driver, only to fall violently ill before the debate is about to begin. Rattled, she later relays the incident to Ailes, wondering aloud whether it was nerves or if the man tampered with her drink.
The scene is lifted directly from Kelly's 2016 memoir "Settle for More," although the journalist refuted inferences by the New York Times and others that she was poisoned. Yet "Bombshell" leaves the circumstances around her mystery illness intentionally vague.
Did Ailes consult Rudy Giuliani? "Bombshell" is a who's who of famous faces, including Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal counsel Susan Estrich, and Connie Britton as Ailes' wife, Beth. Then there's Richard Kind, who portrays Ailes' friend Rudy Giuliani. The embattled Ailes asks the politician/attorney how to handle the fallout of his sexual harassment allegations.
"Ailes had three different lawyers who we let Giuliani stand in for," Randolph says. "If you wanted to be a Republican public intellectual, all avenues went through Roger Ailes' office, and that mattered in terms of his ability to prey on young people who had aspirations."
Was Ailes known as 'the legs man'? The film shows a competitive work environment at Fox News for female anchors and producers, many of whom rarely spoke or befriended each other. (Kelly and Carlson, for instance, only share the screen once in passing in an elevator – true to real life, where they worked different shifts and "almost never interacted," Randolph says.)
"Bombshell" also illustrates Ailes' predatory behavior: asking women to spin in front of him during meetings, and demanding that on-air talent wear short skirts to show off their legs. Such scenes were drawn from Kelly's book, as well as Gabriel Sherman's 2014 Ailes biography, "The Loudest Voice in the Room," and Sarah Ellison's 2016 expose for Vanity Fair, Randolph says.
The film's most chilling scene is a private meeting between Ailes and Pospisil when he pressures her to lift her skirt. The camera lingers on Pospisil, near tears, as he orders her to inch it higher and higher, revealing her underwear. By letting the abuse play out in real time, Randolph hopes male viewers, in particular, will feel uncomfortable but also feel greater empathy for victims.
Kayla (Margot Robbie, left) and Jess (Kate McKinnon) are Fox friends and confidantes in "Bombshell."

Texto completo: Our reporters followed all of the exchanges and fact-checked the candidates, providing context and explanation on the policy debates.
Seven candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination took the debate stage Thursday night in Los Angeles for the sixth round of debates.
Here is how the candidates' remarks stacked up against the truth.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., correctly noted his low net worth compared with Senator Elizabeth Warren's.
"Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine."
According to Forbes, Ms. Warren has a net worth of $ 12 million, or 120 times Mr. Buttigieg's net worth of $ 100,000.
Ms. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, were both professors at Harvard University and added to their wealth through retirement funds available to teachers. Forbes reported that their home, bought in 1995 for $ 447,000, is now worth an estimated $ 3 million.
Mr. Buttigieg is the least wealthy Democratic contender. The disparity between their net worths reflects a generational wealth gap between millennials and boomers.
Mr. Buttigieg said that Ms. Warren was hypocritical for criticizing him for accepting money from big donors because she did so during her Senate campaign and transferred some of that money to her presidential campaign.
"Senator, your presidential campaign right now as we speak is funded in part by money you transferred, having raised it at those exact same big ticket fund-raisers you now denounce. Did it corrupt you, Senator? Of course not."
As The New York Times reported in September, Ms. Warren transferred $ 10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to underwrite her 2020 presidential run. Some of that money was raised under the same guidelines she is now running against.
However, The Times noted that there was no way to say exactly how much of the $ 10.4 million Ms. Warren transferred from 2018 was attributable to large donations. Records show about $ 6 million of her Senate funds also came from donors who gave at least $ 1,000.
Still, Ms. Warren's criticism of Mr. Buttigieg for holding a fund-raiser in a Napa Valley "wine cave" could leave her open to some cries of hypocrisy. Last year, Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania, recruited donors to attend a fund-raising dinner for Ms. Warren at Barclay Prime in Philadelphia. The steakhouse serves a $ 120 cheesesteak that includes Wagyu rib-eye, foie gras, truffled cheese whiz and a half-bottle of champagne.
Mr. Rendell said that Ms. Warren sent him a "glowing" thank-you letter.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he advocated a reduction in troop numbers in Afghanistan, a proposal that he said put him at odds with senior Pentagon officials.
"I got in a big fight for a long time with the Pentagon because I strongly opposed the nation-building notion we set about. Rebuilding that country as a whole nation is beyond our capacity. I argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an antiterrorism policy with a very small footprint that in fact only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the United States of America."
This is true. In 2009, he did propose this, during a period of reassessment of Afghanistan strategy, but President Barack Obama at the time sided with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, choosing to add to the American troop presence.
Later, in 2011, Mr. Obama supported Mr. Biden's proposal for a drawdown and ordered the departure of 30,000 troops by the summer of 2012.
Senator Bernie Sanders was largely accurate about childhood poverty.
"Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth."
This is mostly true. The United States has a childhood poverty rate of 21.2 percent. That is high among peer nations -- the rate in Finland is 3.6 percent -- but lower than that of six other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: Chile (21.5 percent), Spain (22.2 percent), Israel (23.7 percent), Turkey (25.3 percent), Costa Rica (28.4 percent) and South Africa (32 percent).
Ms. Warren claimed that her 2 percent wealth tax on households worth more than $ 50 million would pay for a sweeping expansion of the nation's social safety net, providing free child care and college tuition.
"For 2 cents, what can we do? We can invest in the rest of America. We can provide universal child care, early childhood education, for every baby in this country age 0 to 5. Universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old. And raise the wages of every child-care worker and preschool teacher. We can do even more for our public schools, for college graduates. We can cancel student loan debt."
Ms. Warren made a similar claim during the debate last month. Here is what we said about it then: The revenue that Ms. Warren would raise from her tax proposal is a subject of intense debate and it is not clear that her wealth tax could pay for the plans she listed. According to a New York Times analysis, the total cost of Ms. Warren's plans for universal child care, increased spending on public schools, student debt cancellation and free college would be about $ 2.9 trillion over a decade. The two Berkeley economists advising her campaign, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, estimate that her wealth tax would generate $ 2.75 trillion over that period of time. If that is correct, then Ms. Warren would be close to being able to pay for those proposals. (Ms. Warren has recently revised her wealth tax proposal, and Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman have refined their calculations but the general conclusions are the same.)
But other economists disagree, arguing that a wealth tax would spur waves of new loopholes and tax evasion efforts. Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Natasha Sarin, a law and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, estimated that Ms. Warren's wealth tax would raise just 40 percent of what her campaign claims.
If Ms. Warren's tax proposals raise less revenue than she projects, it will be difficult to pay for her grand plans without adding to the deficit.
Mr. Sanders accurately counted the number of billionaires donating to his rivals.
"My good friend Joe, and he is a good friend, he's received contributions from 44 billionaires. Pete on the other hand, is trailing, Pete. You only got 39 billionaires contributing."
This is true. Mr. Sanders is referring to a Forbes analysis of each Democratic campaign's billionaire donors. The magazine did count 44 billionaires for Mr. Biden to 40 for Mr. Buttigieg (so he has caught up a bit more than Mr. Sanders said). Both men lag behind Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has 45 billionaire contributors. The Forbes analysis was of contributions to the candidates' campaign committees by the billionaires or their spouses. Contributions to campaigns are limited to $ 2,800 per person.
Ms. Warren has six billionaire contributors, while Mr. Sanders himself had one -- though his campaign told Forbes it would return the check.

'Solemn and somber': Media parrot Democrats’ ludicrous impeachment descriptions

Texto completo: Democrats say the impeachment of a U.S. president is a very “solemn” and “somber” business. Normally, it would be. But even they don't believe this when it comes to the impeachment of President Trump.
For Democrats, there is nothing "solemn" or “somber” about it, as the gloating and giddy members of their caucus keep revealing. It is as big a game to them as it is to the Trump campaign, which is now fundraising off impeachment, and to the Republican National Committee, which raised an astonishing $20.6 million in November.
Yet somehow, journalists keep describing the proceedings with the exact terms used by Democrats, perfectly parroting the political talking point that the opposition party finds no joy in pursuing articles of impeachment against Trump.
"Not any of us came to Congress to impeach a president,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in October. It's a lie — many freshmen Democrats, most notably Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, would beg to differ. “This is a very sad time for our country. It's a very somber time for our country."
Later, on Dec. 13, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland said of the House Judiciary Committee’s vote to approve articles of impeachment against President Trump that “this is a solemn and somber day for our country.” The chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, called it a “somber moment.”
On Wednesday, as the House prepared to vote to impeach Trump, the speaker said again, “I solemnly and sadly open the debate on the impeachment of the President of the United States.”
Yes, an event so “solemn” that House Democrats rushed to get there, not bothering to barrel forward through committee hearings with a ham-handedness that revealed this entire episode for the political exercise that it is. An event so “somber” that Pelosi had to issue a general reminder this week to members of her party warning them not to cheer or applaud when they vote to impeach the president.
Only a dupe or an activist would use words like “somber” or "solemn” to describe an event that has been anything but.
“A somber Pelosi wields her impeachment power in 'sadness' — and with ferocity,” reads the headline to a CNN article about the House’s vote this week to impeach.
The Daily News reported, “Black-clad Nancy Pelosi invokes spirit of late Rep. Elijah Cummings in somber final debate on impeachment of Trump.”
“Legacy moment: Pelosi leads 'somber' Trump impeachment,” the Associated Press reported.
The Hill called it, “A solemn impeachment day on Capitol Hill.”
“House Democrats strike 'sad,' 'solemn' tone in marathon debate over impeaching Trump,” reported CBS News.
The New York Times filed a story Wednesday that used the words “somber” and “solemn” twice apiece to describe Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues.
I understand why Democrats use these words to describe their efforts. They need Americans to believe that they are serious about fighting executive corruption and abuses of power and that this is not about one party trying to wrest power from another.
But what is the news media’s excuse?

Texto completo: Solo siete de los 15 precandidatos demócratas participarán esta noche en el sexto y último debate de 2019, que se celebrará un día después de que Congreso aprobara la noche del miércoles el juicio político en contra del presidente Donald Trump.
En el encuentro, que se llevará a cabo en la Universidad de Loyola Marymount en Los Ángeles, se enfrentarán nuevamente los tres precandidatos que lideran las encuestas: el exvicepresidente Joe Biden encabeza las preferencias con un 28%, seguido por el senador Bernie Sanders (19%) y por la senadora Elizabeth Warren (14,8%), según el compilado de encuestas RealClearPolitics (RCP).
Se espera Warren protagonice una de la confrontaciones de la jornada junto a Pete Buttigieg, quien aparece en el cuarto lugar (8,2%) de las encuestas. La senadora y el alcalde de South Bend han incrementado el intercambio de ataques, especialmente en temas relacionados con transparencia, como los orígenes de sus fondos de campaña o la información sobre devoluciones de los impuestos, según detalla The New York Times.
En el debate participarán también Andrew Yang, exejecutivo de la industria de la Tecnología; Amy Klobuchar, senadora demócrata por Minnesota, y Tom Steyer, multimillonario y activista por el cambio climático.
Biden llega fortalecido
Biden, de 77 años, ocupará por primera vez en los debates de este año, la posición central en el escenario. El exvicepresidente llega a la cita fortalecido por el apoyo recibido de John Kerry, que fue jefe de la diplomacia en el segundo mandato de Barack Obama, pero como en cada debate surgen los miedos por su propensión a salirse del libreto y sus lapsus.
A principios de diciembre, Biden se exasperó con un votante que cuestionó el rol de su hijo en la compañía de energía ucraniana Burisma, que está en el centro del escándalo que desató el proceso de juicio político contra Trump. El compañero de fórmula de Obama en sus dos mandatos le respondió aireado descalificándolo como un “maldito mentiroso” y además lo llamó “gordo”.
Para hacer frente a las críticas, Biden publicó el martes un parte médico sobre su salud.
El principal capital de Biden es su experiencia y su promesa de que si es electo el país va a volver a la normalidad, dejando atrás la polarización de la era Trump. Con estas credenciales, Biden se ha labrado el preciado apoyo de los obreros y de las comunidades negras.
Además, ha prometido ha prometido abrir un camino a la ciudadanía a todos los inmigrantes indocumentados actualmente en el país, entregando una serie de propuestas para sus primeros 100 días de gobierno, para, según dijo, revertir la “dañina” política migratoria de Trump.
El debate se desarrollará bajo la sombra de Bloomberg, que pese a su avance en las encuestas no logró clasificarse ya que no tiene el mínimo de 200,000 donantes individuales. El millonario, que financia su propia campaña, sabe que llegó tarde a la contienda por lo que se concentrará en los estados que votarán a partir de marzo, entre ellos Texas y California.
El camino a la nominación
Tras el debate, solo faltarán 46 días para que empiecen, en Iowa, las votaciones para las primarias, en un largo camino que terminará a mediados de año con la Convención del Partido Demócrata y la definición del candidato que participará en las elecciones de noviembre de 2020.
En este proceso, en el que a medida que van votando los estados los distintos candidatos van sumando delegados, son muy importantes los resultados en los primeros en votar. En Iowa, Buttigieg – que está rezagado a nivel nacional – lleva la delantera con 22,5%, seguido de Sanders con 19,3% y de Biden con 18%.
En el siguiente estado en votar, New Hampshire, la tendencia se invierte y Sanders es el favorito con 19%, seguido por Buttigieg con 17,7% y de Biden con 14%.

Feral Pigs Roam The South. Now Even Northern States Aren’t Safe.

Texto completo: HELENA, Mont. - Ranchers and government officials here are keeping watch on an enemy army gathering to the north, along the border with Canada. The invaders are big, testy, tenacious - and they will eat absolutely anything.
Feral pigs are widely considered to be the most destructive invasive species in the United States. They can do remarkable damage to the ecosystem, wrecking crops and hunting animals like birds and amphibians to near extinction.
They have wrecked military planes on runways. And although attacks on people are extremely rare, in November feral hogs killed a woman in Texas who was arriving for work in the early morning hours.
“Generally an invasive species is detrimental to one crop, or are introduced into waterways and hurt the fish,” said Dale Nolte, manager of the feral swine program at the Department of Agriculture. “But feral swine are destructive across the board and impact all sectors.”
Wild pigs occupy the “largest global range of any nondomesticated terrestrial mammal on earth,” researchers in Canada recently concluded. They have roamed parts of North America for centuries.
But in recent decades, the pigs have been expanding their range - or more accurately, people have been expanding it for them.
“It’s not natural dispersion,” Nolte said. “We have every reason to believe they are being moved in the backs of pickup trucks and released to create hunting opportunities.”
In the U.S., their stronghold is the South - about half of the nation’s 6 million feral pigs live in Texas. But in the past 30 years, the hogs have expanded their range to 38 states from 17.
Eurasian boar first arrived in Canada in the 1980s and 1990s, imported as livestock or for hunting. They escaped or were released, and sometimes mated with domestic pigs. Their descendants have become common across the Canadian prairie.
Many experts thought the pigs couldn’t thrive in cold climates. But they burrow into the snow in winter, creating so-called pigloos - a tunnel or cave with a foot or two of snow on top for insulation. Many have developed thick coats of fur.
Now they are poised to invade states along the border, threatening to establish a new beachhead in this country.
“It’s concerning that Canada isn’t doing anything about it,” said Maggie Nutter, one of 80 concerned ranchers and farmers who met recently near Sweet Grass, Montana, to discuss the potential swine invasion. “What do you do to get them to control their wild hog population?”
States and federal agencies are monitoring the border. Should the pigs advance, wildlife officials plan an air assault, hunting the pigs from planes with high-tech equipment like night-vision goggles and thermal-imaging scopes. They’re testing waterways for pig DNA, and turning to more traditional approaches - hunting dogs and shotguns.
Why the worry? The harm caused by snuffling, gobbling wild hogs is the stuff of legend. The damage in the U.S. is estimated to be $1.5 billion annually, but likely closer to $2.5 billion, Nolte said.
They are very smart and can be very big - a Georgia pig called Hogzilla is believed to have weighed at least 800 pounds - and populations grow rapidly. Each female is capable of birthing at least two litters a year of six or more piglets.
“Nature’s rototillers,” experts have said. Feral pigs don’t browse the landscape; they dig out plants by the root, and lots of them. Big hogs can chew up acres of crops in a single night, destroying pastures, tearing out fences, digging up irrigation systems, polluting water supplies.
“Pigs will literally eat anything,” said Ryan Brook, a professor of animal science at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.
The swine are also reservoirs for at least 32 diseases, including bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis and leptospirosis. Outbreaks of E. coli in spinach and lettuce have been blamed on feral hogs defecating in farm fields.
There are reports that people have contracted hepatitis and brucellosis from butchering the animals after hunting.
“If an animal disease like African swine fever or hoof-and-mouth gets into these animals, it will be almost impossible to stop,” said Dr. William Karesh, a veterinarian who works for EcoHealth Alliance, an organization that studies animal disease. “It will shut down our livestock industry.”
Many countries are frantically trying to contain a global outbreak of African swine fever, which may necessitate the slaughter of a quarter of the world’s domestic pigs. Denmark has built a pig-proof fence along its border with Germany to keep wild boar from entering and infecting domestic pigs.
In the U.S., pig hunting is a popular sport, but biologists caution that it is not always the solution to the nation’s feral pig problem.
In states where populations are not established, hunting creates an incentive for people to distribute feral pigs for sport. Hunting makes the animals warier and scatters sounders, or family groups, which go on to multiply in new family groups.
But where pigs are already well established, hunting can reduce their numbers. Gunning feral pigs from helicopters with semi-automatic weapons is a popular sport in Texas. (There are no hunting seasons for feral swine in the state; the animals, which cause $400 million in crop damage in the state annually, can be shot year round.)
Feral hogs are the descendants of swine brought by European explorers in the 16th century; Hernando de Soto, the Spanish explorer, is credited with introducing them to the New World.
Explorers released pigs as they traveled, and then hunted them for food when they returned to the area. Later, Eurasian wild boar were imported to North America for hunting. In many places the boar and the feral domestic hogs interbred.
This crossbreeding has resulted in a well-adapted animal, Brook said: “It’s created a super pig.”

Texto completo: Green Bay landed a spot on The New York Times' year-end list of the "Best of 2019 Culture" — yes, you read that right — and Kelly Clarkson is to thank.
The singer's cover of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's "Shallow" at the Resch Center on Feb. 15 is featured as one of the year's best performances under the headline "Who Stole the Show?"
Clarkson performed the Grammy and Oscar-winning smash from "A Star Is Born" for the first time during the Green Bay stop on her Meaning of Life Tour. It quickly went viral, with Rolling Stone, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, People and Vogue posting Clarkson's video of the performance before a crowd of 7,000.
The New York Times story by critic-at-large Wesley Morris listed "Kelly Clarkson doing 'Shallow' live in Green Bay" among such memorable performances as the acting of Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Andrew Scott on Amazon comedy "Fleabag" and Gayle King's one-on-one interview with R. Kelly on "CBS This Morning."
Wesley wrote of Clarkson's performance: "In February, before she laid her soaring stank on Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's mega hit, Clarkson apologized for any perceivable disservice. But this murder was premeditated: She was barefoot. Anybody who plans to put a hurtin' on a song does it shoelessly."
Clarkson performed the song during an extended version of her "A Minute and a Glass of Wine" webisode and shared the performance on Facebook Live.
"I hope I don't suck, and if I do, I hope she (Lady Gaga) doesn't see it," Clarkson told the Resch crowd before she sang it.

Recalling a Toxic Divide, but From Two Decades Ago

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The House is expected to vote on Wednesday on two articles of impeachment against President Trump, most likely making him the third president in the nation's history to be impeached. Four of the current New York Times journalists who covered President Bill Clinton's impeachment reminisce about that time and how it echoes in today's coverage.
PETER BAKER, currently the chief White House correspondent: We thought it was the most partisan, most divisive era we could ever imagine. Today, that seems almost quaint.
After his re-election, President Bill Clinton had talked in his inaugural address about using his second term to become the "repairer of the breach," quoting Isaiah, and he had told John Harris (my partner on the White House beat) and me a couple of days earlier that he wanted to "flush the poison from the atmosphere." Instead, the breach became wider than ever before and the poisons more toxic. Little did we realize how much more so it could become.
ALISON MITCHELL, currently an assistant managing editor for The New York Times: I also remember being shocked by the intense partisanship -- that Clinton's sex life had been investigated in such detail. Then so many Republicans found their sex lives investigated by the press and opposition researchers. It felt like the two parties were practicing mutually assured destruction. It was brutal and so far from governing.
There was a breathtaking moment when, right in the middle of the House impeachment debate, the incoming speaker, Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who had also been revealed to have had an affair, called on Clinton to resign. Some Democrats on the House floor started shouting, "You resign." And then he did. And the debate went on.
ERIC SCHMITT, currently a terrorism and national security correspondent: It accelerated what was already clearly becoming a much more partisan environment on the Hill.
MITCHELL: I was the lead congressional correspondent during impeachment. We worked in the Senate press gallery, where you sit virtually on top of each other and in earshot of competitors. It was loud and there was little privacy.
CARL HULSE, currently the chief Washington correspondent: I was the Washington bureau chief for The New York Times Regional Newspaper Group, a collection of three dozen medium-size and smaller newspapers scattered around the South, plus two in California -- all of which The Times eventually sold to focus on its core business.
I was headquartered in The Times's Washington bureau, but I spent almost all my time on Capitol Hill. My job was to report on the issues and members of Congress important to readers of those papers, and to find broader stories that could appeal to a very diverse readership.
SCHMITT: I was one of three congressional reporters for The Times -- along with Alison Mitchell and Lizette Alvarez -- responsible for covering the Clinton impeachment hearings in the House and then the Senate trial. Alison took the lead, but we would divvy things up so everyone got a chance to write the big story of the day or week at some point, as well as chase down story leads.
It was the early days of 24/7 cable news, so there was competitive pressure from that, in addition to the fierce competition from traditional rivals like The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times and the main networks.
BAKER: I was a White House correspondent for The Washington Post. My colleagues Susan Schmidt, Toni Locy and I wrote the story that first broke the news that Ken Starr was investigating Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice in covering up his affair with Monica Lewinsky. For the next 13 months, I covered the Starr investigation and was the lead writer on the House impeachment and Senate trial.
The days were endless. They started early, and many nights we did not finish until around midnight. We became experts in which restaurants still served until 1 a.m.
SCHMITT: During the House hearings phase, our schedule followed the hearing schedule. That meant getting into our congressional office around 8:30 or 9 a.m. and staying until 6 or 7 p.m. Once the Senate trial started, the hours were even longer, starting as early as 7 a.m. and sometimes ending around 9 p.m. -- after we spent a couple of hours chasing down senators in their Capitol hideaway offices for any tips or strategy updates.
It was still very much an old-fashioned print cycle, in which we geared up for the evening print editions, went home and then started all over again in the morning. There was no social media. We barely had cellphones, which were in their infancy. I remember carrying a pager so the desk could reach me.
MITCHELL: The House vote on impeaching President Clinton took place on a Saturday, which I remember because the first deadline for our Sunday papers was at noon. This was before most news organizations were thinking about minute-by-minute digital competition. So that deadline seemed difficult.
HULSE: I recall writing multiple versions of the impeachment story on the Saturday of the House vote to highlight how a certain state delegation voted and what lawmakers were saying.
BAKER: I vividly remember the night we were about to break the first story. We were sitting in Bill Hamilton's office (Mr. Hamilton is now The Times's Washington editor), about a dozen reporters and editors, and what struck me was that there was no question we were going to run the story. No one blinked, even though we were about to publish allegations that the president of the United States had sex with a former White House intern and was under criminal investigation. It boggled the mind.
I remember walking home at 2 in the morning through empty, dark streets wondering what had just been unleashed. "It doesn't seem real," I wrote in a journal when I got home. By the next morning, "the I-word," as people were calling impeachment, was being bandied about, starting, oddly enough, with George Stephanopoulos, who had been Clinton's senior adviser and had since moved to ABC News. Today we run so many sensational stories with hard-to-believe facts in them that it's difficult to convey just how extraordinary it was back then.
MITCHELL: At the time it all felt so distasteful to me. It was a different era, though. I lately have thought it would all have played extremely differently in the #MeToo era.
The Starr report was almost pornographic in its sordid detail. I actually think the detail ended up backfiring on the G.O.P. since it seemed so designed to humiliate. It also posed a challenge for The New York Times and our standards. We did refer to the semen-stained dress.
I remember the consternation caused by the Starr report. We were printing and posting it in full.
BAKER: Writing about the president's lies and sexual adventurism did not make one popular with the Clinton White House, that's for sure. I remember one day having a White House aide yell at me over a story he thought was wrong. He got so angry that he finally shouted, "If you don't get that, we have nothing to talk about!" And then he stormed out of the room. The problem was we were in his office. (The story later turned out to be 100 percent accurate, by the way, but in fairness to the aide, the president was deceiving all of them too.)
But we had White House briefings every working day. As heated and hostile as it got, it would never have occurred to the White House in that era to shut down news briefings. It would have looked weak and gone against the notion that there was still an obligation to answer questions, or at least allow questions to be asked, no matter how uncomfortable it was.
HULSE: There is much more hostility now toward the media on the part of some lawmakers. And I don't think lawmakers and journalists have the same deep relationships that we were able to have in the past.
BAKER: The competition was ferocious. Beyond The Times and The Post and the networks, this was the first time that Fox was really a major player, and MSNBC was trying to be one. It was the beginning of the internet era, with unconventional outlets like the Drudge Report playing a profound role in driving the story. All kinds of information was out in the public space that had never been vetted by the professional editors who used to be the filters for the American media, and we had to decide what to trust and what not to trust.
I remember once driving several hours outside Washington to meet a secret source and not being able to tell even my editors where I was going or when I would be back. Everything was super sensitive. A lot of us feared that our phones might be tapped, that we might be followed, that private investigators might be looking into us. In the end, that was probably exaggerated, but at the time it didn't feel that way.
HULSE: I had decent access and could keep up with what was happening with impeachment while keeping local readers apprised of what their members of Congress were doing.
It was endlessly fascinating since I covered everyone from congressional leaders such as Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, a key player in impeachment and a big name from a state where we had newspapers, to lowly backbenchers most people had never heard of. And because I was focused so closely on key individuals, I got to know many of them quite well.
This paid dividends when people like Charles Canady, a relatively junior House member from central Florida, became one of the impeachment managers, along with Bill McCollum, another Republican House member from Florida.
MITCHELL: So many figures from then come to mind. Lindsey Graham was a new House member who came to prominence as one of the impeachment managers and an aggressive proponent of impeaching President Clinton. It was well before he became a senator who is omnipresent on cable television, and he seemed at the time to be almost surprised at all the attention.
BAKER: He talked a lot about the importance of the rule of law and about accountability for a president who crossed the line.
MITCHELL: Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who headed the Judiciary Committee, was the lead prosecutor. He was erudite, quotable and known as an anti-abortion warrior. He saw his own reputation tarnished when it emerged that he had had an affair three decades earlier. He acknowledged it, saying, "The statute of limitations has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions."
SCHMITT: He was a big man with a huge shock of white hair. He had a commanding presence.
MITCHELL: Representative Richard Gephardt and Senator Tom Daschle were the Democratic minority leaders who were setting strategy for defending President Clinton. Yet each seemed deeply uncomfortable with the president's behavior and recklessness. Gephardt made a plea on the House floor: "We need to stop destroying imperfect people at the altar of an unobtainable morality." I remember watching Daschle slumped in his chair during the Senate trial looking disgusted by it all.
HULSE: I still laugh at the late Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican and a very wily politician, invoking "Scottish law" and saying the charges against President Clinton were "not proven." A moderate Republican who needed Democratic votes around Philadelphia to survive, Mr. Specter didn't want to vote either guilty or not guilty for political reasons. His vote, however, was recorded as not guilty.
BAKER: The Watergate case hovered over that moment the way the Clinton impeachment hovers over this one. The House Republicans used the word "RODINO" as the password on their computer system, after the congressman who led the House impeachment effort in 1974, Peter Rodino. At that time, a number of people who had been involved in the Nixon impeachment were still on the scene and involved in this one -- including Hillary Clinton, who had been on the House Democratic staff at the time.
HULSE: I still have my impeachment ticket from the day of the vote to acquit the president. Standing room, and I was lucky to get that.
MITCHELL: I didn't have any keepsakes of impeachment until years later when our beloved colleague Robert Pear sent me the four-volume bound set of the proceedings of the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. It was a very Robert-like gift, if you knew Robert's fondness for the Congressional Record. I must admit I've never cracked the plastic wrapping. But I cherish it.
BAKER: My direct editor was a remarkable young woman named Susan Glasser, who now happens to be my wife. We met during the investigation, and date nights consisted of poring over the Starr report. I still have my original dog-eared copy of the report. We always say that our marriage is the one good thing that came out of that whole episode.

Texto completo: It can take a dozen times of trying a vegetable before a child learns to like it. That's not a risk some lower-income parents can take, no matter how many vitamins are in beets.
"That's one thing schools can be useful for," said Jennifer Gaddis. Parents "maybe knew over time their kids would like something. But in the immediate term, they couldn't afford their kids not eating.
"Schools can play an important role in helping to mitigate that risk, making sure a wide range of foods are on offer."
Gaddis earned her Ph.D. in environmental studies at Yale University and moved to Madison in 2014. She's now an assistant professor of civil society and community studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Gaddis' new book, published in November by the University of California Press, is "The Labor of Lunch: Why We Need Real Food and Real Jobs in American Public Schools." In it, she talks to cafeteria workers, explores the benefits of universal free school lunch, argues for letting youth lead the way and encourages parents to stop packing lunches.
For the past decade, she has studied the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), founded in 1946. Under the NSLP, students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches based on family income relative to the federal poverty level. Some 30 million kids participate, while 20 million "opt out" - go off campus or pack a lunch. In her book, Gaddis calls these "the missing millions."
Lately Gaddis has been expanding her work, both globally and locally. She spent part of the summer in China and Japan, exploring their national school lunch programs. Next semester, she'll teach a food studies class at UW. She wants to build in a project-based learning component that involves Madison-area schools and school lunch activists.
At the same time, Gaddis has been adjusting to her role as a public scholar. Earlier this year, she talked about school lunch in Minneapolis on comedian Wyatt Cenac's HBO show "Problem Areas." She's working on an op-ed for the New York Times. On Dec. 9, she had a piece published in the Washington Post.
"It's long past time to give every child free lunch at school," the headline read. "Only this will end lunch shaming." She called the national lunch program "a flawed model that relies on children's payments to supplement federal funding."
Gaddis stopped by the Cap Times on a recent morning to talk about how "good food" for school kids goes well beyond what's on the plate - and is more than ready for reform.
In your book, you frame the reformation of school lunch as a feminist act. Why?
The School of Human Ecology at UW-Madison used to be the School of Home Economics in the early 1900s. I got interested in the political and economic strand of home economics that was about how, before women had access to electoral power, they could build power through forming their own collectives.
They could use their wealth strategically. Like, if we're in charge of shopping, how can we use our purchasing decisions, individually and collectively, to reward business with good ethical practices and punish those that don't?
A lot of the same things that are talked about today on mommy blogs are the things that were talked about in ladies' magazines. How do I know this food is nutritious? How do I know that it's pure? There were issues with food safety, not knowing what was in the food.
There was a push to say: If we were to create nonprofit school lunch programs, it would not only benefit our own children, it could also improve the lives of children from poor households and make things easier for working class women.
We have this national school lunch program that costs like $14 billion a year. Almost every community around the country participates in this program, and it's important to own the fact that it's women who created it.
You argue that, in order to improve school lunch for everyone, parents who pack their kids' lunches need to opt back in.
There's an example I like from Austin Public Schools. They're already a leader in the real food movement - getting clean label foods, phasing out foods with "ingredients of concern" like high fructose corn syrup, colors, additives. They have a robust farm-to-school program.
They've expanded access to free school breakfasts and lunches. The school district is moving beyond thinking about nutrition and local economies, and starting to also think about animal welfare and worker rights, environmental sustainability.
But only 50% of kids participate in the school lunch program. So their food service director went on local news and said, "I have these ideas for what I want to do. But in order to move things forward I need for you parents who are sending your kids with packed lunches to let your kids eat school lunch."
She said specifically, I could afford to serve grass-fed beef in all the cafeterias if you let your kids eat school lunch one time per week. I could serve organic produce if you were to let them eat two times per week, and organic milk if you were to let them eat three times a week.
It's an economy of scale thing.
Meals become cheaper to produce per meal. The higher the participation, the meal cost is lower, so schools have more money to devote to higher quality ingredients.
A big thing parents can do, even if they don't want to spend time on direct action or getting involved in national level advocacy, is to let their kids eat school lunch a couple times per week.
Couple that with a discussion with people working on school food reform. Participation matters a lot more when you're using it as a way to build the budget. You need to have a vision, and you need to have enough people willing to buy into that vision.
There was a New Yorker story recently that said when food is good for babies, babies don't like it. How can we make school lunch healthier and build in choice to reduce waste, all while being efficient?
Menu planners recognize that kids tend to have more sophisticated tastes as they get older. They might have roughly the same meal at elementary, middle and high school, but it might be spicier or have stronger flavors as you scale up.
Another thing I've seen schools use are flavor stations. Instead of having kids think everything's supposed to be salty and fatty, they'll have herbs and seasoning and hot sauce, so kids can adjust their meal however they want.
Sometimes things just take time, for kids to become used to new recipes. After the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act (of 2010), there were reports of kids chucking trays in the trash. Part of it was, "You can't tell me what to do." Part of it was national manufacturers saying, "How do we make something taste good without more salt?"
Some high schoolers were more reactionary. But for kids who were acculturated into a lower sodium, fruit and vegetable rich environment, it became their normal. Taste education through literal repetition in the cafeteria is something we have to recognize. You're not always going to have the same group of students in front of you.
There's a lot of resistance to change around school lunch. Why do you think that is?
It's easier to say we're just going to serve the same meals, nothing that challenges kids' palates. Or we can say no, we want to use the school lunch program to transition tastes in ways we know we need to.
You have to understand the group that you're serving and involve them in talking about what your goals are. Make them feel like they're part of the process. If things don't work out once, that doesn't mean you shouldn't ever try it again.

Texto completo: The latest installment of "Star Wars" films is almost here.
But if you can't wait for "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," here's some reviews from around the web, ranging from disappointment to satisfaction.
• Gizmodo's Germain Lussier writes that "the film plays like a 150-minute checklist of cool stuff and surprises designed to please as many fans as possible."
• A.O. Scott of The New York Times says it's one of the best and also one of the worst "Star Wars" films, "perfect middling," the review reads.
• NPR's Glen Weldon claims director J.J. Abrams nails the 42-year-old "Star Wars" recipe "dutifully," "but the flavoring's off."
• Peters Travers of Rolling Stone writes that Abrams effort to make the film everything you want and need it to be results often in chaos, "but it's also a euphoric blast of pulse-quickening adventure, laced with humor and heart."
• Scott Mendelson of Forbes says it's genuinely bad movie, one that repeats the fatal mistakes of the likes of "Spectre," "Spider-Man 3" and "The Crimes of Grindelwald" to end the Skywalker Saga on an all-time low.
• The A.V. Club's A.A. Dowd offers that the movie "is a space opera animated not by joy but insecurity -- the anxiety, evident in almost every moment."
• "The Rise of Skywalker," according to David Sims of The Atlantic, is "for want of a better word, completely manic: It leaps from plot point to plot point, from location to location, with little regard for logic or mood."
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 57% Tomatometer from critics with about 160 ratings as of Wednesday afternoon.
"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," set for release Dec. 19, features Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill, among others.

Is this basketball season an unusually crazy one?

Texto completo: We say it every single year.
"Man, this is a crazy college basketball season, isn't it?"
It always seems like there's something we've never seen before. At this point last year, a Duke national championship seemed a certainty to some, as Zion Williamson began an unprecedented season.
At this point two years ago, undefeated Arizona State was receiving votes as the No. 1 team in the country, and Trae Young and Oklahoma had the look of a Final Four contender.
But just as crazy as the season often begins, the craziness continues. Duke missed the Final Four despite appearing unbeatable at full strength, and those Arizona State and Oklahoma teams barely snuck into the NCAA Tournament field as No. 10 and 11 seeds.
Point being: The craziness is constant. Every year there are drastic upsets, poll shuffling, teams rising and falling.
But, man, this is a crazy college basketball season, isn't it?
The season started off startling, with a number of upsets and rankings in flux. Then, last week — the same week that the New York Times ran the headline, "Louisville and Ohio State Start to Rise Above Other Teams," — No. 1 Louisville lost, and Ohio State, the apparent incumbent top team, followed suit.
The dust hasn't settled, but here's where we stand.
For the first time ever, there have been five teams rated No. 1 before the new year. For the first time this millennium, there is only one remaining undefeated high-major this early in the season (Auburn).
There have been 13 Big Ten games played thus far, and the home team has won each one.
No one is dominating, and a look at the USA TODAY coaches poll reveals what is apparent: nobody's perfect.
No. 1 Kansas lost to No. 3 Duke, which lost at home to one Stephen F. Austin. No. 2 Gonzaga lost to No. 15 Michigan — which had a meteoric rise in the rankings, but has now lost three of four. No. 4 OSU, No. 5 U of L, No. 6 UK and No. 7 Virginia all lost to unranked teams, with UK's loss to Evansville by far the most dubious.
No. 9 Auburn hasn't lost, but their best win is probably against Richmond, and some of their narrow victories don't inspire much confidence.
There is no truly terrific college basketball team as of yet, no complete team that is so supreme, it is already the Team To Beat. There is no 2011-12 Kentucky, no 2012-13 Louisville.
As of now, Kansas is Westgate's odds-on favorite to win it all at 6 to 1, which even seems a bit stingy. Six other teams, including U of L and UK, have 14 to 1 odds to win or better.
That doesn't mean that there aren't any great teams in college basketball — it just means there haven't been any standouts yet.
Three-loss Michigan State could run through Big Ten play and become the 1-seed we initially anticipated. Louisville's loss to the defensive nightmare that is Texas Tech could prove to be just a one-time blip as they put together an ACC title-team. The same goes for so many other teams, including Kentucky.
Each college basketball season is remarkable in a unique way. Sometimes it's outstanding singular seasons — like Zion or Trae Young or Anthony Davis in 2012 or Jimmer Fredette in 2011. Sometimes it's Cinderella teams, like George Mason in 2006 or Steph Curry's Davidson. Sometimes it's purely dominant teams, like Villanova in 2018. Or sometimes, like apparently this year, it's a revolving door at the top of the polls and uncertainty around which teams are to be labeled as great.
Yes, this year has been particularly crazy — just like every other college basketball season.

Texto completo: "The Masked Singer" wraps up its second season on Fox. And a Norwegian noir series with Carrie-Anne Moss debuts on Sundance Now.
What's on TV
THE MASKED SINGER 8 p.m. on Fox. Heavy is the head that wears the pink flamingo mask: After episodes that have seen contestants like Kelly Osbourne, Paul Shaffer and Seal voted off, the second season of this bizarre singing competition show comes to a close Wednesday night with a two-part finale, during which the identities of three more masked singers will be revealed -- and one will be crowned winner.
What's Streaming
WISTING Stream on Sundance Now. Early in this new Norwegian noir series, an F.B.I. agent played by Carrie-Anne Moss makes a suggestion to a local investigator: It would be foolish to approach a person suspected of being a serial killer, she says, without toting guns. His response: "This is Stavern, not Texas." That would be Stavern, Norway. Moss's character is an outsider flown in from New York to help track down the person behind a string of murders (Texas has nothing to do with it). Heading up that investigation is William Wisting (Sven Nordin), a career homicide detective whose daughter, Line (Thea Green Lundberg), is a journalist -- one whose coverage eventually overlaps with her father's case. The series is based on crime novels by the Norwegian author Jorn Lier Horst, who was a police investigator before he turned to books.
ALL IS TRUE (2019) Stream on Starz platforms. "I used to think that I don't really have religion," Kenneth Branagh told the pop culture website The Beat earlier this year, "but I do have Shakespeare." Branagh plays Shakespeare in this historical drama, which also stars Judi Dench (as Shakespeare's wife) and Ian McKellen (the Earl of Southampton). Directed by Branagh, the film gives a heavily fictionalized account of Shakespeare's later life, following the playwright as he returns to Stratford-upon-Avon after success in London. In her review for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis called it "a slow and soothing tale of family secrets and festering resentments."
WILD ROSE (2019) Stream on Hulu. In the music-driven drama "Wild Rose," a young woman seeks to trade Scottish pubs for Nashville honky tonks. The film tells the story of Rose-Lynn (Jessie Buckley), a budding Scottish country singer who, after finishing up a prison sentence, moves back in with her mother (played by Julie Walters), who has been looking after Rose-Lynn's two children. "First and foremost, the movie, written by Nicole Taylor and directed by Tom Harper, is a superb showcase for Jessie Buckley," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The Times. "Doing her own singing, Buckley is a rich, startling vocalist who if anything seems to under-excite the crowds she performs for. Yet she is also persuasive as a reluctant, unreliable parent."
CATS Stream on BroadwayHD. A fresh version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical "Cats" hits theaters this weekend, complete with "digital fur technology." Those who want to refamiliarize themselves with the show (or who prefer old-fashioned, kitschy costumes and makeup) can see this 1998 filmed version, with Elaine Paige, John Mills and Ken Page.

To the Editor:
Re "Key Moderate Democrats Commit to Impeachment" (front page, Dec. 17):
I am getting tired of picking up my newspaper every day and seeing the stories about impeachment pitting Democrats against Republicans.
The issues that the House is raising in its articles of impeachment are about right versus wrong. The case that the House has built is about a man who has no regard for honesty or for the people of America. He cares only about himself.
The issues raised have to do with the future of this country, the lessons we teach our children and with the truth. The men and women in Congress who support this egotistical man should not be classified according to their party affiliation but according to their belief in the truth.
I can only hope that the members of Congress will act responsibly instead of politically. The honest people in the House are doing their job. Now we must wait to see if the Senate will follow. I am not optimistic.

To the Editor:
Re "The Rule of Law Still Matters," by William Webster, the former director of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. (Op-Ed, Dec. 17):
Mr. Webster, nearly 96 years old, makes more sense than many members of the House and the Senate, the White House and the cabinet. And as an 80-year-old, I am almost in tears and sick at heart. How could we have gone so wrong?
I used to think that the next election would solve the problem, that once Donald Trump was gone, we would revert to past practices. But I don't believe that anymore.
The damage was done before he entered the White House. He is only a symptom, not the agent of change.

To the Editor:
I've heard Democrats say that Republicans are putting party before country, but that interpretation befuddles the truth. The G.O.P. has decided to put President Trump over a party that bears little resemblance to its former self.
Trumpism, unlike the Republican Party I remember, does not advocate free trade, deficit reduction, internationalism, and fidelity to law and the Constitution. Trumpism supports neo-mercantilist tariffs, huge deficits, abandonment of international treaties and alliances, and attacks on its own intelligence agencies while conjuring alternative facts to protect criminals.
Even those privately appalled by this administration's unethical and illegal conduct and its abandonment of G.O.P. values have withered and fallen silent under pressure from Mr. Trump and his rabid base. This is Trumpism over the G.O.P., and Trumpism before country.

To the Editor:
Re "Prodded by the Right, Graham Joins the Impeachment Battle" (front page, Nov. 30):
Senator Lindsey Graham has performed a remarkable feat: He has rivaled Donald Trump in self-serving abuse of his office. Indeed, Mr. Graham's conduct is even more reprehensible because he once had a moral compass that told him right from wrong, while it is doubtful that our president was ever so equipped. Mr. Graham's mentor was once John McCain, but he has now adopted the tactics of Mr. Trump's mentor, Roy Cohn. Can he really be so desperate to cling to his Senate seat?
Mr. Graham's embrace of Mr. Trump and his betrayal of Joe Biden, a longtime friend, is a bargain that would be enough to make Faust blush. As a lifelong Republican who served in two Republican administrations, I find the descent of Mr. Graham and his ilk into the swamp of Trumpism difficult to fathom and impossible to accept.

Texto completo: The "Crown" duo will portray a couple at a crossroads in Duncan Macmillan's "Lungs," which will have a limited New York run after selling out in London.
Where do royals go once they've passed the baton to new heads of state in Buckingham Palace? Brooklyn, apparently.
Claire Foy and Matt Smith, who played Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip on Netflix's "The Crown" before a new cast took over for Season 3, will appear opposite each other once again in March -- this time, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
In Duncan Macmillan's "Lungs," they portray a couple who debate the merits of having a child as the world seems to inch closer and closer to doomsday. The New York production will have a limited run, from March 25 to April 19.
The two-character show, which had its debut in 2011, earned positive notices for its actors during a sold-out engagement this fall at the Old Vic in London. "The pair lend shape and dimension to a work that might seem piecemeal in lesser hands," according to the New York Times review.
Matthew Warchus, the artistic director at the Old Vic, oversaw "Lungs." Warchus is also the director of "A Christmas Carol," which originated at the Old Vic and is now on Broadway.
Macmillan's "Every Brilliant Thing" has been presented in many American theaters, including Off Broadway in 2014.
Foy and Smith starred in the first two seasons of "The Crown," through the queen's coronation and the early years of her reign. Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies have taken over the roles this season, when the series heads into the mid-1960s and '70s.

Campaign finance limits take choices away from voters

Texto completo: It happens every presidential election. A promising candidate joins the race, makes a splash, and surges in the polls. But they can’t sustain the momentum, and their popularity dips. With diminished media exposure, fundraising stalls and the campaign shuts down. All before a single vote has been cast.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California is the latest candidate to suffer from our misguided campaign finance laws. She ended her campaign for president on Dec. 3. “Ms. Harris said she would have needed to raise $5 million in two weeks," the New York Times reported, "a goal she described as impossible. ‘I just don’t want to bullshit you,’ she said.”
While she was lamenting the inability to raise that much money now, consider what happened 52 years ago before contribution limits were imposed.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy, a Democrat from Minnesota, entered the race for president in November 1967, considered impossibly late today, and against an incumbent president in the Democratic primary. He raised about $10 million in today’s dollars from a handful of donors who opposed Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War. Thanks to that support, McCarthy quickly built a campaign. He capitalized on growing anti-war and anti-Johnson sentiments and performed so strongly in March’s New Hampshire Democratic primary that Johnson withdrew from the campaign.
No one has forced an incumbent president from the race since then.
Unfortunately for Harris, she can’t restart her campaign by raising money like McCarthy did and letting Democratic voters decide who they want as their nominee. Political campaigns are famous for the large amounts of money needed to advertise to the millions who vote in presidential elections. It was impossible for Harris to raise $5 million in two weeks when she was at a political low, and no one could give more than $2,800 for the race.
In other parts of our political system, money flows freely. The First Amendment prevents the government from limiting the speech of individuals, independent organizations, and self-funding candidates. As a result, some candidates labor under tight restrictions, while others do not.
Billionaires such as Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer can put their own money behind their campaigns. People who pool their funds independently of the candidates can also raise and spend without limit to persuade your vote. But direct support for candidates is tightly restricted.
Rival candidates often accuse the biggest spender in the race of “buying” the election or drowning out other voices. But when a candidate spends big, voters are often unmoved. Just ask Jeb Bush about that.
Bush’s supporters raised so much money for the 2016 race that they didn’t know what to do with it. Their lavish spending went so far, they even paid for video players with a digital mailer touting Bush to be sent to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Bush finished 6th in Iowa and 4th in New Hampshire. He withdrew from the race after another spending blitz failed to make an impact in South Carolina.
Bush was no anomaly. The most expensive Senate race in history was won by the candidate who was outspent, as incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz fended off Beto O’Rourke’s challenge in 2018. Rising Democratic star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unseated Rep. Joe Crowley after being outspent 18-to-1.
The fear of money buying votes is misplaced. Voters have no trouble casting votes against big-spending candidates they don’t like or that they disagree with. We should be more concerned about candidates who drop out before the primaries even begin. Only then are voters deprived of a choice.
Many candidates have it much worse than Harris. She was able to raise enough money to at least get started. An incumbent senator from one of the largest and wealthiest states who rose to prominence during the confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Harris had more opportunities than most to introduce herself to voters. Yet even these advantages were not enough to make it to the first caucus or primary.
Fewer restrictions on campaign fundraising would give more candidates a chance to compete. That will give more choices to the people who need them: voters.
Every year, credible candidates are forced to drop out simply because they can’t keep the lights on. Many more people never even run for office. This is not an inevitability. It’s a product of our misguided campaign finance laws.

Nicholas Kristof: What’s different about this impeachment

Texto completo: Republicans argue that the present impeachment process is nothing like Watergate. At that time there was growing bipartisan alarm at President Richard Nixon’s conduct, while the impeachment votes Friday in the House Judiciary Committee were strictly along party lines.
Indeed, some Democrats may vote against impeachment in the full House while Republicans will be united, practically smothering President Donald Trump in their embrace. Some will argue that the opposition to impeaching Trump is more bipartisan than the effort to oust him.
“This is the fastest, weakest, thinnest, MOST PARTISAN impeachment in American presidential history,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, promptly retweeted by the president.
Yet that is, I think, a misreading of history. The essential difference between Nixon and Trump lies not in their misconduct or in their unsuitability for office but in the grim refusal of today’s Republican Party to notice wrongdoing and its determination to stand by Trump come what may.
What’s different today is not the abuse of power by a rogue president but his party leaders’ shortage of principle. That in turn flows partly from the pernicious influence of Fox News, which enables a Trumpian ecosystem that is largely impervious to facts.
In a narrow sense, this blinkered approach may succeed politically for the Republicans. I suspect that to some swing voters, this may look like nothing more than one more Democrat vs. Republican food fight and a distraction from substantive issues.
Democrats dominated the impeachment process until now and unearthed important new information implicating Trump — yet the polls barely budged. Indeed, one new poll (by a Republican-affiliated firm) shows Trump improving in the crucial states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And when the impeachment effort reaches the Senate, it will be Republicans in the driver’s seat.
In 2016, the Brexit vote in Britain was a harbinger of Trump’s election as president. There are many differences, but Boris Johnson’s ability as a deeply flawed conservative to win a solid majority in Thursday’s British elections, including many working-class voters, is sobering for Democrats.
Yet back in the United States, put aside the politics and look at the merits of the impeachment cases, and everything looks different.
Republicans said that the impeachment of President Bill Clinton was different because he committed the crime of perjury, even if only about sex. But that’s not clear: A 33-page article in 2004 in the Chicago-Kent Law Review concluded that Clinton misled a grand jury but may have managed through brilliant lawyering to avoid the technical offense of perjury.
Republicans at the time made much of the argument that Clinton’s misconduct made him morally unfit for the presidency. But if that’s the standard for impeachment, then what do we make of a president who is a serial liar, apparently committed tax fraud, has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 25 women, and paid a porn star $130,000 in hush money to keep their affair from voters? Or who just this month was forced to pay $2 million after “a shocking pattern of illegality” involving the use of his charity to promote his own interests?
As for Watergate, it is easier for the public to grasp a burglary than diplomatic extortion involving Ukraine. But Nixon apparently did not order the break-in; his offense was a cover-up and a systematic effort to manipulate the instruments of federal power to hurt his rivals. Sound familiar?
The big difference is that Trump, shielded by congressional Republicans, has been more successful than Nixon in his stonewalling of investigators. The verb “to stonewall” was popularized in the Nixon era, but in the end he did not go as far as Trump in refusing to cooperate with investigators.
The famous quote that everyone remembers from Watergate (said by a Republican!) is, “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” That was never asked this time around, as Rep. Eric Swalwell has noted, because we largely agree that Trump knew everything from the start. It was Trump himself who pressured Ukraine and, in a rough transcript we have all seen, who asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
Another difference from Watergate is that Nixon’s abuses did not directly damage national security or cost lives. In contrast, Trump’s suspension of vital military assistance may have added to the Ukrainian death toll and certainly helped Russia.
After the Watergate break-in, there was no immediate epiphany about its seriousness. Nixon was reelected that fall by a huge margin. A year later, more Americans said they were more concerned by Chappaquiddick (where a young woman in Edward Kennedy’s car drowned) than by Watergate. It wasn’t until just before Nixon’s resignation that a majority favored his removal from office.
Yet now we regard Nixon’s behavior with widespread revulsion, and someday I believe we will feel similarly about Trump’s. I worry about the political consequences of impeachment but still favor it as a way to create accountability and establish norms against abuses of power to interfere in elections.
What’s different from Watergate is not the nature of the misconduct but the shamelessness of the defense.

Texto completo: El próximo debate presidencial demócrata se realizará según lo programado el jueves, después de que l os negociadores alcanzaron el martes un acuerdo tentativo sobre un contrato de tres años , finalizando así una disputa laboral que había amenazado con evitar que el evento tuviera lugar en la Universidad Loyola Marymount .
La disputa laboral entre un sindicato de trabajadores de cafetería y una empresa de servicios de alimentos en la universidad involucró solo a unos 150 trabajadores, pero amenazó con suspender un debate televisado a nivel nacional después de que los siete demócratas participantes dijeron que no cruzarían una línea de piquete.
El presidente del Comité Nacional Demócrata (DNC), Tom Pérez , pasó el fin de semana hablando por teléfono con el sindicato, Unite Here Local 11, su empleador, el proveedor de servicios de alimentos Sodexo; y otros funcionarios locales, informó The New York Times.
Luego de un largo fin de semana de discusiones, y una maratón de sesiones de negociación el lunes por la noche, el sindicato UNITE HERE Local 11 y la compañía de servicios de alimentos, Sodexo, anunciaron el martes que se había alcanzado el acuerdo tentativo.
El debate reunirá a Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang y Tom Steyer.

Texto completo: He won theater's top prize for his performance in "The Invention of Love," one of numerous Broadway roles.
Richard Easton, whose frequent appearances on Broadway across 50 years included a Tony-winning turn as the poet A.E. Housman in Tom Stoppard's "The Invention of Love," died on Dec. 2 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
Jonathan Walker, executor of his estate, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
Mr. Easton also appeared on television and in films; his movie credits included "Henry V" (1989) and "Dead Again" (1991), both directed by Kenneth Branagh, with whom he had acted on the stage in England. But he was first and foremost a stage actor, turning in memorable performances in both classical and modern fare, aided by a vocal dexterity that might find him booming in one scene, comically sputtering in another.
"He was a wonder," Ethan Hawke, who was cast with him in several plays, said by email, "and like many other young actors, I quickly became a disciple. His intelligence, wit, experience, honesty -- and his voice -- rendered him a commanding presence in our lives."
One of Mr. Easton's most famous moments onstage, though, was of a kind no actor wants. During a preview performance of Part 1 of Mr. Stoppard's "The Coast of Utopia" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center in October 2006, he collapsed in midperformance, the result of an arrhythmia. Mr. Hawke and Martha Plimpton were onstage, their characters having just received a tongue-lashing from Mr. Easton, who was playing their father.
"I said, 'This is my last word,' and I took two steps towards the wings, one, two, and crashed like a tree in the forest," Mr. Easton recalled in a 2010 video made for Lincoln Center Theater.
"Ethan has always been grateful to me because he had the opportunity to say the immortal line 'Is there a doctor in the house?,"' Mr. Easton continued. "And I said to him afterwards: 'Are you kidding? On the Upper West Side of New York City, is there a doctor in the house? Of course there's a doctor in the house."'
Several audience members did indeed step forward, Mr. Hawke recalled, although he said it was a member of the stage crew who initially administered crucial CPR.
The play's formal opening was delayed three weeks, until Nov. 27. The production was the first part of "The Coast of Utopia" trilogy. Parts 2 and 3 opened soon after, and the plays ran in repertory. Mr. Easton, newly fitted with a pacemaker, was in all three.
Jack O'Brien, who directed Mr. Easton in "The Coast of Utopia" and many other productions, including "The Invention of Love" in 2001, shared a list of practical advice for young actors that Mr. Easton had drawn up years ago when they worked together at the Old Globe in San Diego and Mr. Easton taught at the University of San Diego.
One Easton rule advised, "When it comes to a coin-toss (which it does, most of the time!) to decide casting between one actor and another, 'Very good actor but rather difficult' will lose out, nine-point-six times out of ten, to 'Pretty good and really very, very nice!"'
Mr. O'Brien, in a telephone interview, added, "There's a generation of young men and women indebted to Richard, not only for his friendship but for professional specifics."

John Richard Easton was born on March 22, 1933, in Montreal. His father, Leonard, was an engineer, and his mother, Mary Louisa (Withington) Easton, was a homemaker.
No immediate family members survive.
Mr. Easton began acting as a teenager, working with a children's theater and the semiprofessional Montreal Repertory Theater, commanding attention despite his youth.
One play he was cast in was "The Rivals" by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, in which he played the squire Bob Acres. (Christopher Plummer, another young actor working his way toward stardom, was also in that production.) Some 55 years later, in 2004, Mr. Easton would be in "The Rivals" again, in a different role, that of Sir Anthony Absolute; this time the production was on Broadway.
"Mr. Easton's alternately blustery and delicate rendering of Sir Anthony's outraged dignity and wounded pride is priceless," Charles Isherwood wrote in his review in The New York Times.
But Broadway was still a ways in the future. At 17 he moved to Ottawa to work in a repertory company that put on 33 plays in 35 weeks, a crash course in all things theatrical. In 1953 he performed with the company of the newly created Stratford Festival in Ontario, then won a scholarship to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. He worked in England for two years, at one point playing opposite one of his heroes, John Gielgud, in "King Lear."
He returned to Canada, then signed on with the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., where John Houseman was artistic director. (Mr. Easton was later able to say that he had worked at all three Stratfords: in Ontario and Connecticut and at Stratford-upon-Avon in England.) In 1957 Mr. Houseman took "Measure for Measure," "The Taming of the Shrew" and "The Duchess of Malfi" to Broadway; Mr. Easton was in all three, his first Broadway credits.
He appeared regularly on Broadway for the rest of the 1950s, throughout the '60s and into the early '70s, in plays that included "Pantagleize" (1967), "The Misanthrope" (1968) and "Hamlet" (1969). He spent much of the '70s back in England, where he was part of the cast of "The Brothers," a BBC drama that ran from 1972 to 1976.
He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in the mid-1980s and stayed for four years before joining Mr. Branagh's breakaway theatrical troupe, Renaissance Theater. Then came a decade in San Diego, working with Mr. O'Brien.
It was Mr. O'Brien who lured Mr. Easton back to Broadway after an absence of almost 30 years for "The Invention of Love." And it was Mr. O'Brien who gave him his final Broadway credit, in a 2013 "Macbeth" that starred Mr. Hawke.
Mr. O'Brien said that Mr. Easton's health was in decline at that point and that he had envisioned him in a tiny part, just enough to give him a token final Broadway appearance. He remembered offering Mr. Easton the role over the phone.
"There was a long pause," Mr. O'Brien said, "and then he said, 'I should think Duncan, wouldn't you?"'
Duncan is a much bigger part, and it was the one Mr. Easton went on to play.

Alexander: What if the Raiders had gotten first shot at L.A.?

Texto completo: The thought first occurred to me five weeks ago, while watching the Oakland Raiders’ pass rush treat Philip Rivers like one of those inflatable pop-up dolls – you know, you keep knocking it down, and it keeps bouncing right back up – on the field at whatever they’re calling the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum these days.
It continued to nag at me during all of these weeks the Chargers have been on the road. It kept coming to mind Sunday, when they returned home to play before what would be conservatively estimated as 70 percent Minnesota Vikings fans, at the same time the Raiders were making their own melancholy farewell appearance in Oakland.
Today then, a few days before the Raiders and a chunk of their immense SoCal fan base play the Chargers in Carson, it’s time for some alternate history.
What would have happened, at that fateful NFL league meeting in January 2016 when Stan Kroenke’s fellow owners approved the Rams’ move to L.A. and his Inglewood stadium project, if those owners had given the Raiders the first option to become Kroenke’s tenant, rather than the Chargers?
We start this musing with an opinion that I’d maintained throughout the two decades of the league’s absence from L.A., when the city was no more than a stalking horse for other owners seeking stadium deals in their own cities: If and when a team finally set up shop here, it would have to deal with that huge segment of fans who refused to abandon the Silver and Black even after Al Davis moved the Raiders back to their ancestral home in 1995.
Those are the people you’ve seen in the Southwest Airlines terminals of area airports on Saturdays (or Sunday mornings) of Raiders home game weekends the last 25 seasons, flying up to the games and flying back afterward. Some are clad in their Black Hole costumes, and I’m guessing TSA employees have to remind themselves: These aren’t security risks, these are Raider fans.
(Feel free to insert your own one-liner here.)
Their commutes will be shorter beginning next season when the Raiders move into the $2 billion Allegiant Stadium near the Las Vegas strip.
But stay with me here: What if the Raiders had wound up in L.A. … and the Chargers had wound up in Vegas, a virgin territory with no previous NFL allegiances beyond monetary ones? It’s not that far-fetched.
From the Raiders’ standpoint, I’m guessing they would have found an immediate home somewhere in SoCal. Probably not the Coliseum, likely not the Rose Bowl, but possibly Dodger or Angel Stadium as a short-term abode. They would have had no trouble filling it with their own loyal (and eccentrically costumed) fans, while the Rams would still have been able to rebuild their SoCal fan base in much the same manner they have. There would be less snark about L.A. as an NFL town, and when the Inglewood stadium was ready the new occupants would be on relatively equal footing.
(You think the Raiders aren’t still strong here? There are still Raider Image stores at Universal Citywalk and in Moreno Valley, and the team’s fan club directory lists nine different booster clubs in SoCal, from Fillmore to Hesperia and including two in San Diego.)
But what of the Chargers?
Before I continue, I am fully aware that this column will likely draw a call or a text from the Chargers’ sharp vice president of public relations, Josh Rupprecht, asking what his franchise did to deserve this, and is it really a bad thing that the Chargers are here? We realize this is considered a long-term project to build a fan base. But three years in, you have to wonder if this market – the most diverse, and fickle, in North America – just might be too tough to crack.
Certainly, people in the NFL offices in New York are noticing. And the reports of friction between the Chargers and Rams involving the new stadium, now a $5 billion (and rising) project, don’t help the optics.
The Las Vegas component will not thrill our friends in San Diego, but consider the history of these moves.
When Mark Davis and the Raiders romanced Las Vegas early in 2016, no more than a couple of weeks after (a) their joint project with the Chargers on a new Carson stadium was shot down and (b) the Chargers got the first option to join Kroenke’s project with a year to exercise it, the man who arranged the Raiders-Vegas talks was Mark Fabiani. That is the same Fabiani who is still listed in the Chargers’ organizational chart as a special counsel to controlling owner Dean Spanos, and the same Fabiani who was in charge of the team’s stadium quest in San Diego.
Also, in many eyes – including these two – it’s the same Fabiani who torpedoed any chance of cooperation between Spanos’ organization and the politicians of San Diego with an uncompromising, hardball negotiating style that ultimately led to a total breakdown of relationships with city officials and the fans themselves. The moment the Chargers began openly seeking other alternatives was the moment the San Diego public began to turn away from Spanos and his team.
Fabiani later signed on as an advisor to Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and it was through that relationship that Mark Davis was introduced to Adelson and the wheels began to turn toward the Raiders’ move to Nevada.
So, in our alternate history, it is entirely reasonable that having been shut out of L.A., Spanos turns his attention north on I-15, with Fabiani smoothing the way for the Chargers in the same way he made things happen for the Raiders.
Those bridge years might still have been spent in San Diego, and it’s possible the composition of crowds in that city would resemble what they are now in Carson. But Las Vegas would ultimately have been a far more hospitable destination for the Chargers, as a one-team town hungry for football. Spanos would have been a hero, rather than an interloper (as he’s considered by many in L.A.) or villain (in San Diego).
Plus it’s a lot closer than London, where reports earlier this season had the Chargers ultimately landing followed by Spanos’ vehement denial.
Instead, back in the real world, this is what we have: Minnesota Vikings fans dominating Dignity Health Sports Park this past Sunday, just like Green Bay Packers fans before them, and Pittsburgh Steelers fans, Denver Broncos fans, Houston Texans fans and Indianapolis Colts fans before that in 2019. It has to be discouraging for players and coaches who never get to play before a true home crowd.
The move to the bigger SoFi Stadium will not be a panacea – it’s more seats available for opposition fans, if anything – and while there will be an attempt to put the teams on equal footing in the shared stadium, it will be hard to forget that Kroenke is the owner and Spanos is the renter.
Meanwhile, SoCal Raiders fans will continue to flock to LAX, Burbank, Ontario, Long Beach and John Wayne airports to catch flights for their favorite team’s home games, or else will make the drive up I-15. As colleague Mark Whicker once observed, it’ll be like eight more championship fights a year in ‘Vegas.
An example: The New York Times quoted Ruben Maya, a law enforcement officer from Riverside who paid $12,000 for two personal seat licenses and $3,000 for 2020 season tickets for Raiders games in Vegas: “I live a six-hour drive from Oakland, but it’s only a 3-1/2 hour drive to Las Vegas. I’m going to come to every home game the first season.”
And, as has been the case for years, the Raiders’ ninth home game will come on the Chargers’ home field. There will be a preview Sunday afternoon.

Reports: Van Drew to become Republican

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, Democrat who was elected in last year's "blue wave" in South Jersey's Second Congressional District, plans to switch parties and become a Republican, according to multiple national news organizations.
The New York Times reported Saturday afternoon that Van Drew, a moderate Democrat who is opposed to the impeachment of President Donald Trump, "told aides on Saturday that he is planning to switch parties and declare himself a Republican as soon as next week, just as the House is casting its historic votes on articles of impeachment."
A former state legislator, Van Drew, 66, of Dennis Township in Cape May, was elected in the November 2018 midterms which resulted in the defeat of every Republican for federal office but U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, who was left as the lone GOP member of New Jersey's congressional delegation earlier this year.
Van Drew's district includes all of Cape May, Atlantic, Cumberland and Salem counties, parts of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester counties and a portion of southern Ocean County. He succeeded U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a Republican who had served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 24 years before he retired with the last election.
Politico reported Saturday afternoon that Van Drew was one of two Democrats who voted against opening the impeachment inquiry and that he remained against the effort, even as the House prepares to vote on articles of impeachment next week.
"The stunning move comes amid new polling that shows Van Drew's approval ratings are under water with Democratic voters in his district," Politico reported. "According to a survey conducted between Dec. 7 and Dec. 10, just 24 percent of respondents think he deserves to be reelected, while 60 percent said they want someone new to represent them."
The New York Times and Politico both reported that Van Drew went to see Trump at the White House on Friday.
The congressman "sought Trump's blessing for the move, which could be critical to his ability to avoid a primary challenge next year, and the president urged him to make the jump, according to two Democrats and one Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the talks," the Times reported.
Gov. Phil Murphy slammed the congressman in a series of tweets on Saturday night, writing that Van Drew "has chosen his political career over our Constitution. Despite knowing full well that the President has abused the powers of his office, he's now willing to enable Donald Trump just to try to salvage his own election."
Ocean County Freeholder Director Virginia E. Haines, who is also a member of the Republican National Committee, said she was not aware of Van Drew's plans to become a Republican, but that she was not surprised.
Haines said that because Van Drew could not support the march of his caucus toward impeachment, as a Democrat, he would have alienated his party's base going into an election year and energized Republican support for a challenger in a congressional district that already leans Republican.

Texto completo: Stop me if you've heard this one before. An Asian guy, two black guys, three white women (one of whom spent much of her life claiming to be Native American), a Pacific Islander woman, a gay guy, a Hispanic guy, two elderly Caucasian Jews (one a billionaire, the other a socialist), a self-styled Irishman and a few nondescript white guys walk into a bar, and the bartender yells, "Get the hell out! We value diversity here!"
I didn't say it was a good joke, but it's kind of funny all the same, because some folks in the press and the Democratic Party are freaking out over the shrinking diversity of the Democratic field.
The diversity panic was set off by the withdrawal of California Sen. Kamala Harris on Dec. 3. In the words of Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, "The famously inclusive party wasn't looking very inclusive anymore."
The real issue is that not many people of color qualified for the Dec. 19 debate in Los Angeles. As New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, an African American, complained, "There are more billionaires than black people who've made the December debate stage - that's a problem."
It's debatable whether it's a problem for anyone other Mr. Booker himself, which is why he's been raising this alarm vociferously. So has former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, who is of Mexican descent.
"What we're staring at is a DNC debate stage with no people of color on it," Mr. Castro complained. "That does not reflect the diversity of our party or our country. We need to do better than that."
Since Mr. Castro made his remarks, Andrew Yang, a Chinese American entrepreneur whose parents immigrated from Taiwan, has qualified for the debate.
Perhaps a broader perspective would help. All of the first 43 presidents were white men. About half were Episcopalian or Presbyterian, most of the rest belonged to other prominent denominations, and three were Christians of no formal affiliation. Then, in 2008, Barack Obama became the first African American president, winning two terms. In 2016, Hillary Clinton became the Democrats' first female nominee.
Given these facts, it's hard for me to see a diversity crisis. The top four candidates right now are Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren. Mr. Biden would be only the second Catholic president. Mr. Sanders would be the first Jewish president and the first socialist one. Mr. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay (and youngest) president. Ms. Warren would be the first female president.
What a devastating blow to diversity!
It got dumber. Partisan supporters of various candidates weaponized the whiteness of white candidates. I think that's gross, but there's at least an internal logic for, say, Booker, Castro or Yang supporters to play that game. But supporters of white candidates attacked other white candidates for their whiteness.
The Twitter hashtag #PrimariesSoWhite started trending. A Warren supporter tweeted "#PrimariesSoWhite because Joe Biden kept a very strong plurality of black support that eliminated the paths for Cory Booker and Kamala Harris."
Huh. Did Mr. Biden force black voters to support him? Did he refuse to tell them to back a black candidate? Are those black people at fault for liking Mr. Biden? If those black voters swung their support to the equally white Ms. Warren, would she suddenly be at fault?
Lots of Democrats are talking about the "structural racism" of the primary system. But none of the nonwhite candidates complained about the rules at the beginning. Is it only structurally racist if Democratic voters support white candidates? Are the black voters who prefer Mr. Biden to Ms. Harris or Mr. Booker complicit in this racism? If Mr. Buttigieg bombed out, would we hear about the structural homophobia of the Democratic Party?
No doubt many of these activists are sincere in their beliefs. But some are just grabbing the most convenient weapon they can to tear down other candidates or get more oxygen for their candidates.
The bigger problem for these activists - and for the journalists who hype them - is that they don't speak for most Democrats. In April, a Monmouth poll found that 87% of likely Democratic voters don't think the race of the nominee matters.
In the historical sweep of America's struggle with racism, that should be cheered as unequivocally great news. But these are strange times.

Texto completo: The Dwayne Johnson vehicle opened to about $ 60.1 million in domestic sales this weekend.
For the second time this year, Dwayne Johnson is in the biggest movie in the United States and Canada.
After leading the summer box-office hit "Hobbs & Shaw," he now stars in "Jumanji: The Next Level," an adventure comedy distributed by Sony that grossed an estimated $ 60.1 million in domestic ticket sales Friday through Sunday. The film unseated "Frozen 2" to claim the top spot at the domestic box office.
In addition to bringing back Johnson, "Next Level" reunited Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black, the bankable cast who appeared in "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle," a 2017 reboot that made about $ 404.5 million during its run in domestic theaters. "Next Level" is off to a good start in replicating that success -- though it will have to compete with the Death Star-sized "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," premiering next week, which might kill its momentum.
In "Next Level," the actors don't exactly reprise their roles from "Welcome to the Jungle": As avatars in a video game, they take on the mannerisms of the people who control them, and the new movie introduces gamers played by Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. (The Rock does a pretty good DeVito.)
Critical response was lukewarm -- "Jumanji: The Next Level" holds a 66 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. "It's got some sweet moments," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times, "and the cast, as it did in the previous picture, enjoys itself at least semi-infectiously. But the action sequences are lifeless; the lessons valid but arguably stale; and the trimmings, mere bloat."
[Read our critic's review of "Jumanji: The Next Level."]
Landing in fourth place was Clint Eastwood's "Richard Jewell." That movie, a drama distributed by Warner Bros., debuted this weekend to a modest estimated $ 5 million in ticket sales.
The other newcomer in the top five is Universal's "Black Christmas," which came in fifth with an estimated $ 4.4 million in sales according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. "Black Christmas," directed by Sophia Takal, is a #MeToo-minded rethink of a 1974 college slasher.
Neither "Richard Jewell" nor "Black Christmas" was able to overtake Lionsgate's "Knives Out," a whodunit from the director Rian Johnson that brought in an estimated $ 9.3 million in ticket sales this weekend, its third in theaters. That movie landed in third place, behind Disney's "Frozen 2," which was in its fourth weekend and sold about $ 19.2 million in tickets.

IT'S THIS CENTURY'S 'FIRESIDE CHAT'

Texto completo: DFL lawmakers looking for a way to cut through the media clutter started a "Minnesota Values Podcast" in February to champion their causes and rally supporters to their legislative agenda.
The Minnesota GOP, frequently critical of the mainstream media, responded in October with "Truth Matters," a podcast designed to give the Republican voting base "information straight from the source."
No longer willing to let others filter their political messages, candidates and elected officials are increasingly turning to podcasts and other social media platforms to communicate directly with voters.
"It seemed like a really good idea for me to be able to share my voice directly, as I want, to communicate with people," said Minnesota Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan.
While the technology is new, the impulse is centuries old.
First came Thomas Paine and the political pamphleteers of the Revolutionary era. The dawn of radio, a century-plus later, brought President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "fireside
chats" into living rooms across the nation. In recent decades, the internet opened the floodgates for a steady stream of updates from politicians delivering their messages directly into e-mail inboxes and social media feeds.
Now, a growing number of politicians are turning to another increasingly popular media platform: podcasting, a communication medium providing narrative depth far beyond the 280-character limit of Twitter.
Streamable audio shows catapulted into the zeitgeist in 2015, thanks in large part to the hit investigative series "Serial." Today, hundreds of thousands of programs, on topics ranging from current events to sports to reality TV, are available at the tap of a phone screen. People are listening. Roughly half of Americans have tuned in at least once, up from 36% in 2016, according to Edison Research. The most popular shows, such as the New York Times' "The Daily," can rack up a billion downloads over time.
Politicians and their messaging gurus have taken note. Governors, senators and presidential candidates are all "friends of the pod," appearing both as guests and hosts. Pod Save America, a chatty political gabfest hosted by a group of former Obama aides, has exploded into a lucrative business. Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, launched a limited-run series of his own in 2018.
Minnesotans aren't sitting out the trend. In addition to the House DFL and state GOP, Attorney General Keith Ellison, who hosted "We the Podcast" while serving in Congress, debuted a new series called "Affording Your Life" this year.
Given the popularity, potential reach and relatively low production costs, the boom in political podcasting shouldn't come as a surprise. Peter Loge, a political communications expert credited with putting the first member of Congress on the internet back in 1993, noted that elected officials often follow trends in technology as it matures.
"It's harder to break through the clutter, and elected officials are trying to do that," said Loge, now an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.
Unlike other emerging mediums, such as Twitter or text messages, podcasts can be consumed passively, while working, walking or sitting in traffic. DFL Rep. Liz Olson, who co-hosts "Minnesota Values," said she binges on podcasts on drives from her Duluth home to the Capitol in St. Paul. Veteran state podcasters cite a similar draw.
"People who are into politics, maybe a little deeper than your average person, they're busy and the podcast format allows them to listen to it in the car, be mobile with it, multi-task," said Brian McDaniel, a GOP strategist who co-hosts "Wrong About Everything," a long-running bipartisan show on Minnesota politics. "It's always there, available to them."
But experts say the platform also offers something harder to capture in a mail piece, e-mail newsletter or even a speech at a rally: a sense of intimacy.
"Podcasts are a way to have a theoretically infinite number of one-on-one conversations," Loge said. "The congressman is talking not [to] all of us, he's talking to you."
For politicians in particular, there may be another appeal: an ability to control the message and speak directly to voters without facing questions from journalists or responses from critics. Former U.S. Sen. Al Franken released an eponymous podcast as he began his return to public life following his 2017 resignation over allegations of inappropriate conduct toward women. At the time, the Washington Post wrote that the Minnesota Democrat "is talking, but only on his terms: into a microphone, in the studio, where he gets to set the agenda during the interviews and exercise editorial discretion afterward."
Franken's return to the recording booth rocketed to the top of the Apple charts. Episodes featuring playful political banter between the "Wrong About Everything" hosts can attract thousands of listeners. Hosts say authenticity and a well-defined voice are crucial.
"There are some elected officials that are doing podcasts because they want to share their work or they want to influence their constituents, and that's really good and really informative, but what we're doing has had success because we're bringing a really rare perspective," said Carin Mrotz, a "Wrong About Everything" co-host and executive director of the progressive group Jewish Community Action.
But gaining a large audience isn't a given, particularly in a crowded market. Each episode of the House DFL podcast appears to get just a few hundred downloads on SoundCloud.
"Call of the Senate," a program hosted by the Senate DFL, has 27 subscribers on the same site.
As podcasting state leaders continue to compete for voters' earbuds, others are already experimenting with other emerging platforms.
State Rep. Tim Miller, a member of the New House Republican Caucus, said he had so much fun appearing on a live YouTube show that he decided to create his own weekly live series, aptly named "Miller Time." The Prinsburg Republican said he was drawn by the low barrier to entry and the opportunity to engage directly with constituents in his rural district.
Reps. Eric Lucero and Mary Franson, both Republicans, decided to do a Facebook show, "The RIGHT View MN," that's part morning show and "Saturday Night Live." In one episode, viewed more than 7,000 times, Franson dresses up in oversize glittered dollar-sign glasses and pretends to be "Big Pharma," a skit intended to offer satirical commentary on the industry's influence in politics. In another, they poke fun at concerns over "global warming and the end of the world" using a rotating green-screen backdrop of snowy forests and a close-up of a blazing sun.
"I know there are some out there with an operating mechanism where anger is their modus operandi ... but the most well received [for us] does include humor," Lucero said.
But he said the need to reach the public on the platforms they use is no laughing matter.
"If elected officials want to stay relevant with voters," Lucero said, "it is critically important that they adopt their methodologies to disseminate information to match the way that it's consumed by voters."

Power struggle fuels 'Virtue and Vengeance'

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

Texto completo: More than a half century ago as a 40-year-old Democratic U.S. senator from Minnesota, Walter Mondale co-authored the landmark Fair Housing Act and stood beside President Lyndon B. Johnson during the bill signing ceremony in the wake of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination.
Today, at 91, Mondale looks back with disappointment at what he sees as widespread failures by government at all levels to enforce the milestone statute.
"You've got the federal and state authorities, local authorities, who've taken an oath to uphold the law, and they're not doing it," said Mondale, who was President Jimmy Carter's vice president from 1977 to 1981.
Mondale spoke after reading Newsday's "Long Island Divided" series, which found evidence of widespread unequal treatment of minority potential homebuyers. The investigation's findings have sparked wide-ranging calls for action and spurred three state Senate committees to hold hearings this week at Hofstra University on housing discrimination on Long Island.
Newsday found evidence that suggested real estate agents subjected minority testers to disparate treatment when compared to their white counterparts in 40% of 86 paired tests. Evidence of disparate treatment was highest for Newsday's black testers, at 49%. For Hispanic testers, it was 39% and for the Asian testers, 19%.
The Fair Housing Act in 1968 outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, familial status, national origin or disability.
"I don't think we've made much progress at all in housing discrimination," Mondale said during a telephone interview from his office in Minneapolis. "I think we've made some progress in employment discrimination, but when it comes to fair housing, I wouldn't use the word flop, because it's something, but it's been a huge disappointment to me."
The path for open housing legislation to become law was anything but certain. Fair housing legislation languished in Congress in 1966 and 1967 under the young senator's stewardship.
A shift in the political landscape occurred on April 4, 1968, when an assassin's bullet felled King in Memphis. Riots broke out in cities across the country.
Johnson seized the moment and pushed for speedy passage of the legislation as a memorial to King's life work, which included leading open housing marches in Chicago.
Every few years, Mondale said, he tries to refocus attention on Fair Housing Act enforcement.
"And then, nothing happens," Mondale said.
In 2018, the 50th anniversary of the bill becoming law, Mondale wrote an opinion article that appeared in The New York Times under the headline "The Civil Rights Law We Ignored."
"We passed this fair housing law, but we're unable to get any energy behind it," said Mondale, who was the Democratic Party's nominee for president in 1984 but lost the general election to President Ronald Reagan. "I don't know what explains it. I guess what explains it is that people don't like fair housing. They don't want some unwanted person showing up in their neighborhood.
"But I don't think we can leave it there," he said. "I think we need to continue to press. If we're a nation of laws, if we are who we say we are, it should be enforced."
As for paired testing, which uses undercover white and minority testers who pose as renters or buyers, Mondale said: "It's probably the way of proving discrimination, which is sort of hard to do."
Public hearings, and any legislation that flows from it, could stimulate fresh enforcement of anti-discrimination laws that regulate the housing market, Mondale said.
"Maybe a new wrinkle, or new amendment, might stir them up a little bit," Mondale said. "It's really a sad thing that this nation of ours, that so prides itself on being a nation of laws and justice, would allow discrimination against citizens, should have this unique record. The other civil rights laws don't have this pathetic nothing going for the

Texto completo: The president and his allies have developed a pattern for politicizing Justice Department inspector general reports.
In his report on the origins of the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation, and in testimony before Congress on Wednesday, the inspector general of the Department of Justice, Michael Horowitz, demolished President Trump's most sensational allegations about the Russia inquiry: He concluded that the opening of the investigation was lawful and legitimate, that there was no improper "spying" on the Trump campaign and that the F.B.I. wasn't part of some "deep state" conspiracy to overthrow the president.
That hardly stopped Mr. Trump and his allies. The report "was far worse than expected," the president asserted -- after already predicting it would be "devastating." "This was an attempted overthrow and a lot of people were in on it and they got caught, they got caught red-handed," Mr. Trump said in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
Attorney General William Barr was quick to pile on, too: "The inspector general's report now makes clear that the F.B.I. launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken," he said in a Justice Department statement.
Media coverage and Senate hearings quickly shifted to the F.B.I.'s procedural failings, which Mr. Horowitz labeled "gross incompetence." By the end of the week, Americans could be forgiven for thinking that the F.B.I. was indeed part of some sinister coup attempt -- precisely the opposite of what Mr. Horowitz had concluded.
So much for the supposedly nonpartisan and independent office of the Department of Justice Inspector General -- which, before the Trump administration, most Americans hardly knew existed. To a striking degree, Mr. Trump and his allies have turned the post into a potent weapon aimed at his supposed enemies in the federal law enforcement agencies.
Their ability to wreak political havoc with the latest Horowitz report is part of what has now become a clear pattern: Call for an investigation of a favorite Trump target; speculate about the likely outcome; seize on any collateral evidence that emerges; spin the results; then move quickly to the next investigation. Repeat.
The White House and Republicans in Congress insisted that the inspector general open an investigation into the origins of the Russia inquiry, even though it was already thoroughly covered in a report from the special counsel Robert Mueller. Investigators armed with virtually unlimited time and budget will nearly always find something (as critics of the special counsel role have long argued).
Mr. Horowitz uncovered some new details, and the irregularities he discovered in the F.B.I.'s FISA application process may well prompt a needed overhaul of the standards for intrusive surveillance of American citizens. But Mr. Horowitz conceded that even if all of those problems had been corrected, he couldn't say the outcome would have been any different. Nor do they fundamentally change our understanding of how and why the Russia investigation began -- already reported in considerable and accurate detail, including in this newspaper and in my recent book, "Deep State."
But no matter how redundant, such investigations can serve as useful fishing expeditions. Six House committees conducted investigations of Hillary Clinton's role in the Benghazi attacks. All of them absolved her of any wrongdoing. But it was in one of those investigations that a committee uncovered her use of a personal server for her email correspondence, which led to the F.B.I.'s Clinton email investigation. That provided candidate Trump with his "Lock her up" chant -- and arguably cost her the presidency.
Mr. Horowitz, citing requests from members of Congress and the public, spent 17 months examining the F.B.I.'s handling of the Clinton email case. His conclusion: There was "no evidence" that the decision not to seek charges against Mrs. Clinton was "affected by bias or other improper conclusions," the opposite of what Mr. Trump had been asserting for months.
But during that investigation Mr. Horowitz uncovered hundreds of texts between an F.B.I. agent, Peter Strzok, and an F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page, that suggested animus toward Mr. Trump and also revealed that the two had in the past engaged in an extramarital affair -- information eagerly disseminated by the Justice Department and Trump allies.
Since then, Mr. Trump has tweeted about Ms. Page over 40 times, caricaturing her and Mr. Strzok as "love birds" conspiring to bring down the president, with Mr. Trump often using the most vulgar terms to whip his supporters into a partisan frenzy. At a rally in October, Mr. Trump simulated an orgasm while saying: "I love you, Peter! I love you, too, Lisa! Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa! Oh God, I love you, Lisa."
Citing that incident as the last straw, this week Ms. Page sued the Department of Justice for unlawfully releasing the texts, which she said had "radically altered" her day-to-day life.
The existence of an investigation provides the president and his allies with unlimited opportunities to speculate about the outcome, while the inspector general is bound by confidentiality restrictions until the report is released. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, confidently predicted the inspector general's report would demonstrate a "system off the rails" before he read it.
This may help explain why Mr. Trump, in his efforts to pressure Ukraine's government to open investigations of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, didn't really care whether the Ukrainians actually conducted such an investigation -- only that one be announced. That would have given him and his allies the opportunity to speculate about what the investigation was finding and to tar the Bidens without any risk that an investigation would exonerate them.
It doesn't matter if the report itself turns out to be something of an anticlimax. To his credit, Mr. Horowitz didn't abandon the objective evidence in an effort to please his overseers. He certainly didn't reach the answers about Russia or the Clinton email investigation for which President Trump and his allies so fervently hoped.
Yet there's just enough in the Horowitz report to fuel "deep state" conspiracy theories. Mr. Trump has seized on reports from the inspector general to excoriate James Comey, Andrew McCabe and other former F.B.I. employees as "traitors." Many media reports have focused on Mr. Horowitz's "scathing" criticism of the F.B.I. rather than his broader conclusions.
Mr. Trump can be confident that few people will actually read the dense, legalistic prose of the Horowitz report -- just as relatively few Americans read the entire Mueller report -- which shows the F.B.I. largely fulfilling its mission in extraordinary circumstances.
The pattern has already started again. Mr. Trump has moved on to the next Russia investigation being conducted at Mr. Barr's behest by United States Attorney John Durham of the District of Connecticut. This week Mr. Durham took the extraordinary step of criticizing the Horowitz report, fueling renewed speculation that this time Mr. Trump will finally get a result he wants.
"I do think the big report to wait for is going to be the Durham report," Mr. Trump said, once again speculating about a report that hasn't been written. "That's the one that people are really waiting for."

Texto completo: Kathryn Julia Cullinane and Daniel Roger Arnold were married Dec. 14 at Tantalus Estate Vineyard on Waiheke Island in Auckland, New Zealand. Madeleine Fay, an independent celebrant, officiated.
Ms. Cullinane, 32, works in New York as a senior product designer at NYT Cooking, the cooking app at The New York Times. Until April, she was a senior visual designer on the Tips app at Apple in Cupertino, Calif. She graduated with first class honors with a bachelor's degree in art and design from Auckland University of Technology, as well as a bachelor of arts in Italian and art history from the University of Auckland.
She is a daughter of Deborah J. Cullinane and Jonothan D. Cullinane of Auckland. The bride's father works there as a postman for New Zealand Post, and is the author of a novel, "Red Herring" (HarperCollins). Her mother is the head of the art department and a design teacher at St. Cuthbert's College, an independent private boarding and day school for girls in Auckland.
Mr. Arnold, 31, is a health economist at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health and a visiting scholar at Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at N.Y.U. He graduated from Cornell and received a master's degree and Ph.D. in economics from University of California, Santa Barbara.
He is a son of Sheila K. Arnold and Roger A. Arnold of San Diego. The groom's father is a professor of economics at California State University, San Marcos. His mother, a stay-at-home parent, worked as an assistant controller at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in the 1980s.
After the couple were introduced in 2017 through the dating app Bumble, they planned to meet at a wine bar in San Francisco. Each showed up early for the date, and decided to hang out at Dog Eared Books across the way until the set time. At the shop Ms. Cullinane recognized Mr. Arnold from his online photo, and walked up to him. They then headed over to the wine bar together.

Texto completo: A painstaking selection process ensures that The Times's annual visual review highlights the biggest news events and strongest images.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Umbrella-wielding protesters engulfed in tear gas in Hong Kong. A severely malnourished baby girl sprawled on a floor in Venezuela. The first-ever image of a black hole.
These are some of the pictures in the seemingly boundless photographic universe that Times editors scrolled through to define the year visually.
At The Times, the Year in Pictures is the result of weeks of near round-the-clock culling and editing. And 2019 marks the most ambitious year yet for the project, led by David Furst, the International photo editor, and Jeffrey Henson Scales, the Op-Ed photo editor. (Mr. Furst and Mr. Henson Scales also oversee the Decade in Photos, which will publish on Dec. 19.)
For the first time since 2008, the project will have its own special section in the paper, on Dec. 15, featuring an introduction by Dean Baquet, The Times's executive editor. At 36 pages, it has almost twice the print real estate that it did last year, when it ran as part of the Sunday Review.
Beyond expanding the project's scale, Mr. Furst wanted to "bring the photographers out from behind their bylines" this year. To that end, Dionne Searcey, a political reporter who recently returned to New York after being The Times's West Africa bureau chief, interviewed about 50 of the photographers. Their quotes and anecdotes -- about covering an Ebola outbreak, being in the center of violent protests, working in arctic temperatures -- help explain what goes into their thinking before they press the shutter button.
"They put you in the photographer's spot," said Umi Syam, a graphics and multimedia editor who designed the project's digital presentation. "Just imagining the situation when it happened is really powerful."
To be as comprehensive as possible, Mr. Furst reached out to every desk in the newsroom and The New York Times Magazine, as well as to photo agencies and wire services, for their best material. He and Mr. Henson Scales also kept a spreadsheet of hundreds of individual photographers, painstakingly reviewing their published and unpublished work from The Times and other assignments, and came up with a list of the most important news events to include.
Doug Mills, a Times photographer who covers the White House, has shot more than 12,000 pictures since January alone, making the task of narrowing those down to 100 initially, and later to just two, a herculean challenge.
"We want it to be definitive," Mr. Furst said.
All told, the editors went through over 500,000 photos.
Mr. Furst described the initial stage as daunting: "When you feel like you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, you're reminded that you missed a dozen different news events or these 20 photographers or these 15 projects in the newsroom."
They pared down the photos and organized them in folders by month. Hundreds of images for each month were narrowed down to dozens and, eventually, to about 10.
The final phase of cutting was grueling. Mr. Furst and Mr. Henson Scales scrutinized photos side by side as they went through each month and then looked at the year as a whole.
"One of the big balances is news value versus craftsmanship and beauty," Mr. Henson Scales said. "We're always having to juggle those kinds of elements."
Getting just the right mix of images was the most challenging part. The editors considered a number of factors, such as the impact of a photo or its ability to delight, and the variety of images in each month. A beautiful, poignant picture could edge out a more newsworthy one, and vice versa.
In the print special section, which features fewer photos than the digital version and a layout that intersperses images of different sizes, the pictures had to work well with others on the page.
The designers avoided jarring juxtapositions, finding ways to balance moments of tragedy and levity. Portraits, landscapes and aerial shots sit comfortably alongside hard news photos. "It's like a Rubik's cube," said Mary Jane Callister, an art director who designed the section.
One photographer who came up repeatedly in discussions of the digital and print presentations was Lam Yik Fei, a photojournalist who has covered the protests in Hong Kong for The Times. His striking image of a police officer standing in front of an exploding firebomb wraps around the print section, and other photos he took, including portraits of the protesters, are featured throughout the project.
"We are always interested in finding images that really represent a particular photographer's unique way of seeing something," said Meaghan Looram, The Times's director of photography, who compiled the Year in Pictures for 10 years with Mr. Henson Scales and now reviews the project as it comes together.
She thinks the coverage by Mr. Lam, who was born and raised in Hong Kong, has been especially notable because he knows the setting and the situation so well.
"He has exceptional access and has been in all the right places at all the right times," Ms. Looram said. "It's very dramatic, but also he's really attempting to show all facets of the story."
While most of the featured photographers are seasoned professionals, there are some fresher faces, too. The month of June includes an image from the Pride Parade in New York by Brittainy Newman, a photography fellow at The Times who shot the event for her first big project. She graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology last year and often drew inspiration from the Year in Pictures as a student.
When she found out she would be among this year's photographers, "I almost cried," she said. "It's really a dream come true."

Texto completo: As the largest protests in weeks rocked Hong Kong last Sunday, with hundreds of thousands filling downtown streets, I was struck by the simple statement from Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher, a protester among the many in the city’s Victoria Park: “We don’t want to become like China.”
That’s it. Well, she also told a New York Times reporter the obvious intertwined truth in what the mostly young constant demonstrators are after: “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong.”
That is, she wants her city-state, the former British colony, to continue being culturally Chinese in the broader sense of the diaspora, in the way that Singapore is Chinese — but not; that vast parts of Kuala Lumpur are Chinese — but not; that, well, Arcadia is Chinese — but not.
A heritage, common tongues, an entrepreneurial bent — but without the snooping authoritarian leadership with which the Communist Party has merely replaced the ancient Chinese landlord class in a political system that is anything but communal.
If the plutocrats in Beijing were smart about it, were able to let go of their manic goal of roping all the billions of Chinese peoples in the world into one system, they would realize letting Hong Kong be Hong Kong — letting Taiwan be Taiwan, for that matter — would be by far the best thing for the Mainland as well. That way they don’t have to move toward systems like those in HK and Taipei and Singapore that are mildly democratic, with a few more civil liberties. They can let the broader Chinese nation let off a little steam of freedom without becoming more open themselves.
Instead, the People’s Republic has to control all things in the territories of its growing empire, even if that means putting a million Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.
I wish I could say that it was remotely possible to foresee a successful end game in the Hong Kong kids’ mass marches. But I can’t. As there’s something in a scorpion’s nature that leads it to sting, there’s something in Beijing’s emperors that won’t broach dissent. Sooner or later they’ll send in the People’s Army to put down the actual people.
But it’s not just Chinese people Beijing wants to control. It’s the rest of us, too.
Pasadena lawyer Rob O’Brien, President Trump’s new national security advisor, came back to town last week to speak at a defense forum.
Outside it, he gave an interview to NPR from which I was very happy to find he’s leading the administration’s anti-China world domination wing by detailing the dangers of other nations allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to build the internet’s new 5G networks:
“So every medical record, every social media post, every email, every financial transaction, and every citizen of the country with cloud computing and artificial intelligence can be sucked up out of Huawei into massive servers in China,” O’Brien told NPR.
Inside the meeting, he kept up the theme, telling defense industry and military officials: “This isn’t a theoretical threat.”
It’s not. And, as if in some over-the-top parody of international bad guys, China’s leaders are coming after your kids, too. TikTok, that latest fad you don’t understand, is the most-downloaded app this year, featuring 15-second videos mostly shared by young people. Here’s how Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, puts it: “A company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they’re watching and what they share with each other.” If that sounds like a real-life “The Man in the High Castle” world, then I suggest we join the HK kids, and protest.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Cory Booker had a simple answer for what he does when he has trouble sleeping.
Watching the TV show "Jane the Virgin."
"When your girlfriend is kissing another person, it's something you have to watch," he said of his partner, Rosario Dawson, who starred in the popular telenovela. Booker was on season five at the time of his October interview with the Des Moines Register's editorial board.
Booker said he and Dawson also read out loud to each other. When they're apart and he can't sleep, the presidential candidate switches on Netflix.
"This is an endurance test, and God bless every candidate that is pushing themselves beyond the limits that they ever knew they had," the New Jersey senator told the Register.
Presidential candidates, after all, are human — just the kind who've chosen to throw themselves into the draining endeavor that is the campaign trail, bopping from one state to the next, giving speeches, shaking hands and answering questions.
The remaining 15 Democratic presidential candidates have held a combined 1,278 election events in Iowa ramping up to the 2020 caucuses.
Over the past five months, as they stopped by the newsroom, the Register asked Democratic presidential candidates how they stay energized.
Their answers ranged from being exercise fanatics to consuming "copious amounts of caffeine," but most, in the end, circled back to the energy they get from their missions and their supporters.
Hitting the gym Last month former U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland — who's known for making time for the gym — posted a video on Twitter of himself doing box jumps.
"Lots of people 'jumping' into the race so I decided to do a few sets of 10 box jumps on the 30 inch platform as a warm-up to my workout!" he tweeted.
Tom Steyer, an activist and billionaire from California, described himself as an exercise "fanatic."
He aims to work out an hour every day. When on the campaign trail, that often means 50 minutes on the elliptical, five minutes of stretching and five minutes of push-ups, Steyer told the Register following his October editorial board meeting.
Former secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro said he tries to hit the treadmill often. It's part of a routine that Castro said he's come to value as he aims to become "one of those people" who go to bed by 10 p.m.
Castro said he also tries to avoid junk food and loves to Facetime his kids when he's away.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn't yet visited the Register newsroom, said that he, too, tries to work out.
"I work out every morning," Biden told the New York Times. "I usually work on the Peloton bike, and I lift."
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he often builds running into his daily regimen.
"I wish I could say it's by riding a bicycle for an hour," U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said when asked how she re-energizes. The Minnesota senator said she tries to exercise as often as she can, but also tends to rejuvenate by taking occasional breaks here and there, and by going to the movies.
When she spoke with the Register in August, Klobuchar had recently watched "The Farewell," a movie she recommended highly. She planned to watch "Where'd You Go, Bernadette," the following weekend.
Coffee versus tea "I don't drink coffee," U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told the Register in November. "Can you imagine me on coffee?"
She joked that she's still working off the half a cup of coffee she had at Dunkin' Donuts several years ago. Warren said she won't even touch decaf coffee, though she does drink very weak tea.
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, also a tea aficionado, said he downs one to three bottles of green tea each day.
During Booker's interview with the Register's editorial board, he accidentally kicked over a drink, which he later admitted was comprised of four shots of espresso over ice from Mars Sidebar coffee shop.
A Mars Sidebar barista later reported that Booker bought another quadruple shot of espresso on his way out, after the meeting.
When asked how many of those he consumes a day, Booker said his diet consists of "copious amounts of caffeine."
Other candidates prefer a noncaffeinated high.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado said he tries to take a few minutes each day on the campaign trail — usually when he's in the car between events — to call his wife and three daughters.
"The calls aren't always long, but they're enough to keep me motivated and recharged," Bennet told the Register. "It beats coffee."
Chasing sleep The New York Times earlier this year asked the candidates how many hours of shut-eye they get a night.
While Bennet and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said they clock in around six, Castro said if he gets more than five, he's "doing well."
Meanwhile, author and candidate Marianne Williamson told the Times she aspires to eight hours of pillow time, but rarely achieves it.
Yang, who has two young children, told the Register he gets "normal amounts of sleep," but acknowledged his kids usually wake him up pretty early.
On average, Warren said she gets seven hours of zzz's, plus she tries to eat every two or three hours to keep up her energy.
Klobuchar said she tries to get five to six hours of sleep each night, but she takes naps sometimes, too.
Steyer said he "sleeps like a baby," adding that it helps not to have anything weighing on his conscience. When his alarm goes off in the morning, he's ready to jump out of bed and throw on one of his 10 plaid ties before hitting the next stop on the campaign trail.
When asked if he sleeps, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said "not enough," but said he's sleeping better "since the incident," referring to his October heart attack.
But really, they have Iowans to thank When asked what gives him energy throughout the day, Sanders turned to a response that many candidates offered.
"I'm going to give you an answer that you think is not truthful, but it is," Sanders said. "I get my energy by meeting fantastic people all over this country."
Booker, in providing a similar answer, pointed to the late-night hospitality of Iowan Nancy Bobo as an example. He stayed at her home while campaigning in Des Moines, and he recalled her putting out his favorite snacks and a T-shirt when he arrived at midnight.
He said her energy at that moment soothed, nurtured and energized him.
"When I am tired, when I'm on my third or fourth flight of the day, it is the kindnesses and energy of the people that come to see you, that bring you vegan food, that do all kinds of nice things," Booker continued.
Yang said that when he launched his campaign two years ago, small crowds turned out. He braced himself for that kind of response for the duration. But now, he's sometimes met by hundreds of members of the Yang Gang, as his supporters call themselves. It's invigorating, he said.
Warren said the inner dialogue that motivates her every day centers on the connections she will make in the coming hours.
"It's one more chance to tell one more person and hope that it will spark a little optimism that we could fix this," she said.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she tries to get seven hours of sleep a night and eats every two to three hours to keep her energy up.

Kamala Harris flames out: Black people didn't trust her, and they were wise not to

Texto completo: What happened to Kamala Harris? The once-celebrated presidential candidate recently called it quits, and mainstream pundits struggled to explain why.
Some argued Harris never articulated a clear and consistent message distinguishing her from competitors. Others believed she irreparably damaged herself by supporting “Medicare for All” (albeit offering several confusing iterations), which many see as a political non-starter. Some said Harris’ campaign was simply poorly run.
Others opined she was the victim of a racially stacked primary deck. Even though Barack Obama surprisingly won Iowa in 2008, Harris struggled to gain support in the small, mostly white state whose African American population is a whopping 3. 8%.
All that may be true, but it misses the most important part of the story.
It was one thing for Harris to receive little to no support from whites in Iowa, but how could the fact that blacks in South Carolina (and beyond) weren’t excited about her either be explained?
Looking past her racial bona fides
Indeed, Harris was quick to showcase her racial bona fides early in her candidacy. She is a graduate of Howard University, a legendary historically black school that has yielded American icons from Thurgood Marshall to Toni Morrison to Chadwick Bozeman. She is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a blue blood black sorority with a socio-political network supposedly so extensive that CNN’s Maeve Reston called it Harris’ “secret weapon. ”
Harris even announced her candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2019. That and her blindside of Joe Biden on his busing record made it clear she was attempting to lure African American votes by wrapping herself in the cloak of black struggle.
It didn’t sell.
Are we too nice to pick Trump's challenger?: As an Iowa Democratic caucus voter, even I think we might have too much power in elections
While some members of the self-involved black bourgeoisie nauseatingly praised her, younger blacks and black progressives were taking deeper, dispassionate dives into Harris’ real-world record. They didn’t like what they found.
To the chagrin of her supporters, close examinations of the woman who took pride in the title of California’s “top cop” by writers like Lara Bazelon, C. J. Ciaramella, Sarah Lustbader, Vaidya Gullapalli, Joe Garafoli and others revealed that Harris had been nothing close to the civil rights warrior she claimed to be. In actuality, she had spent much of her professional life prosecuting and persecuting poor people and minorities.
Bazelon wrote that Harris “opposed or stayed silent” on multiple aspects of criminal justice reform. She “laughed” when a reporter asked her about decriminalizing marijuana before reversing course years later as public opinion changed. She opposed a bill requiring her office to investigate police shootings. She also opposed statewide police officer body-camera regulations.
Her record on police reform was so troubling for many that Garafoli cited former Harris supporter and California activist Phelicia Jones lamenting, “How many more people need to die before she steps in?”
Harris didn’t stop there. She even fought for a law that would prosecute parents of “habitually truant” elementary schoolers, “despite concerns that it would disproportionately affect low-income people of color. ”
'Progressive prosecutor' myth
When Harris released her memoir, “The Truths We Hold,” Ciaramella reviewed it and wrote, “Kamala Harris’ new book tries to massage her record as a prosecutor, but the facts aren’t pretty. ”
In the book, Harris claims, “America has a deep and dark history of people using the power of the prosecutor as an instrument of injustice. ” She goes on, “I know this history well — of innocent men framed, of charges brought against people without sufficient evidence, of prosecutors hiding information that would exonerate defendants, of the disproportionate application of the law. ”
White people can fight for racial equality too: Pete Buttigieg's real 'black problem': He has been convicted of white privilege
Bazelon retorts with the damning condemnation, “All too often, she (Harris) was on the wrong side of that history. ” In reality, she “fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors. ”
To top it all off, Harris never wavered in her support of the death penalty.
To be sure, there are still some blacks anxious to celebrate the “first black” this and the “only black” that. For that matter, they will genuflect for any blacks in high places. Importantly, others aren’t so easily bamboozled anymore by black people who will say and do anything to get ahead, only claim concern for black folk when it’s convenient, and then abandon them when they get what they want.
Shockingly, some black people are even beginning to reevaluate Barack Obama, who was once seen as almost divine and untouchable. One black voter from Atlanta said of Obama types to reporter Astead Herndon, “I’m not falling for that again. ” Hmm.
In the end, Kamala Harris left the race largely because she couldn’t secure the critical black support any black presidential candidate must have. Contrary to arguments centering on pragmatism, most black folk didn’t reject her because they thought she couldn’t win. They didn’t support her because they didn’t trust her. And they were wise not to.
Other milquetoast black candidates like Deval Patrick should take Harris’ fall as a lesson. Herndon reported in the New York Times that Patrick was recently forced to cancel a speaking event at my alma mater, Morehouse College. . . after only two people showed up. It’s a new day!

Professor’s experience spurs a debate in Denmark

Texto completo: Bloomberg
Two years ago, Brooke Harrington was caught in a surreal immigration trap in Denmark.
The American academic was working at the Copenhagen Business School. As a tax law expert, she was invited by the Danish parliament to give a talk. Harrington obliged — and by doing so, broke laws that restrict activity by non-European nationals.
Harrington’s ensuing immigration nightmare, chronicled in a recent op-ed for The New York Times, included hiding from the police to ensure she wasn’t separated from her young son. While the law eventually was amended and the charges dropped, the episode and others like it sullied Denmark’s image as a friendly and tolerant society.
“Because I had the wrong passport, I was at risk of losing my career and my life savings in a court fight,” wrote Harrington, now a professor of sociology at Dartmouth College.
There are signs that Denmark, keen to attract people with Harrington’s skills, is reflecting on some of its draconian immigration rules.
Rasmus Stoklund, who sits on the parliament’s integration committee for the ruling Social Democrats, says the case was an example of overreach by the law. “I completely understand why she feels frustrated about the treatment and I’m sorry she was treated so unfairly,” he said.
The Social Democrat government of which Stoklund is part has ruled since June after ousting a coalition backed by the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party. The new government, led by 42-year-old Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, says it wants to add nuance to the immigration debate. That means pursuing “tight, but not crazy” immigration laws, she says.
Frederiksen is walking a fine line, however. Her victory was helped by a decision to adopt many of the previous government’s strict policies, for which there is broad parliamentary backing. At the same time, Frederiksen’s government relies on the support of three left-leaning parties that want more lenient rules.
While the Social Democrats have jettisoned some emblems of anti-immigration sentiment (like plans to create a Danish Alcatraz for illegal aliens who break the law), in practice, little has changed.
The previous administration’s infamous jewelry law, allowing police to confiscate valuables from asylum seekers, is still in place. The United Nations has criticized Denmark’s unusually harsh family reunification laws. And before the change of government, an immigration minister offered cake to employees who tightened the screws on migrants.
People are still caught out by laws designed to exclude foreigners. The Berlingske newspaper wrote recently of a Danish man whose Vietnamese wife was repatriated by officials. The authorities said their 105-square-meter (1,130-square-foot) home was too small for a family with three children, Berlingske reported.
For now, Frederiksen’s government has promised to cut back on the anti-immigration rhetoric. But she also says she wants to maintain strict policies. In particular, she has emphasized the need to ensure blue-collar workers aren’t undercut by cheaper imported labor.
Stoklund says that for all this, Denmark still can attract many foreign professionals.
“Actually, there’s never been more foreign labor in Denmark,” he said. “If people want to come and work here and contribute in a positive way, they are very welcome.” To be sure, the report Stoklund cites — by industry group Dansk Metal — shows that most of those workers are from Europe.
Nor are there any guarantees that others won’t face Harrington’s experience.
“We want to bring nuances by making it clear that we’ll change legislation if it’s not working,” Stoklund said. Ultimately, though, Denmark “will continue to have a tight immigration policy.”
Bloomberg’s Christian Wienberg and Nick Rigillo contributed to this report.

THE YEAR IN PICTURES
An article on Page 4 about a New York Times project to photograph the record number of women in the 116th Congress misstates how many participated. Most female representatives and senators took part, not all of them.
NATIONAL
An article on Friday about the Culinary Workers Local 226, a union in Nevada, misquoted former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. He described the "incredible pain" caused by deportations during the Obama administration. He did not say, "I understand the pain that comes from those deportations." And he started a sentence by saying "If I end up being your president." He did not say "If I am your president."
An article on Friday about a divide in Jewish communities following President Trump's executive order to combat anti-Semitism misstated the location of the Jewish Community Center of Harrison. It is in New York, not Connecticut.
ARTS
A film review on Friday about Richard Jewell, using information provided by publicists, misidentified the source material for the movie "Richard Jewell." It is based on a Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner, not on the article and the book "The Suspect" by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen. The article also misstated the name of a character played by Sam Rockwell. The character's name is Watson Bryant, not Winston.
An article about the absence of women nominated in Hollywood's award season referred incorrectly to Bong Joon Ho's "Parasite" co-writer. Jin Won Han is a man.

Texto completo: Stream Bob Clark's 1974 holiday slasher movie, or catch an animated journey to the North Pole by rail.
What's Streaming
BLACK CHRISTMAS (1974) Stream on Tubi and Vudu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. Before Bob Clark made "A Christmas Story," the gift of holiday programming that keeps on giving, he directed this slasher film that has a decidedly deadlier take on the holiday. It follows a group of sorority sisters who start to receive disturbing phone calls at their house as they prepare to head home for the Christmas break. The caller then starts to stalk each of the girls, picking them off one by one in a bloody killing spree. Although A.H. Weiler dismissed the film as "a whodunit that begs the question of why it was made" in his New York Times review, the movie went on to become a horror classic. The film became influential in the genre for its use of first-person camera shots and its decision not to unmask the killer, serving as a flash point for other slasher movies like John Carpenter's "Halloween." It has also inspired a few remakes, including a version out in theaters now.
HOLIDAY SECRETS Stream on Netflix. The holiday season seems to be a time when unspoken family tensions run their hottest. That's certainly the case for the family at the center of this German holiday series, whose secrets have both eroded and strengthened their familial bonds. It follows three generations of women -- the reliable matriarch Eva, her free-spirited daughter Sonja and Sonja's estranged daughters, Vivi and Lara -- and the events that transpire over three Christmases that shape their understandings of one another. Over three episodes, the series explores the sorts of lies that mothers and daughters tell out of shame or for their own protection. But when all four women reunite for the holiday in their seaside hometown, former flames return, old wounds reopen and the truth is finally revealed.
What's on TV
THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004) 5 p.m. on AMC. Tom Hanks lends his likeness to five different characters in this animated holiday movie directed by Robert Zemeckis, which was pioneering at the time for relying entirely on motion capture technology. Based on the children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, the film follows a young Santa skeptic who boards the titular train bound for the North Pole one Christmas Eve. But the trip isn't without its hazards. "In this wonderland, danger lurks around every bend," Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review. "Kids nearly fly off the train, which in turn slides across ice and hurtles down inclines." It's a rocky ride that tests the protagonist's faith and ultimately leaves the audience with a cozy holiday lesson.
A CHRISTMAS WINTER SONG 8 p.m. on Lifetime. The R&B artist Ashanti brings her singing and acting chops to Lifetime's slate of holiday programming. In this film, she stars as Clio, a young woman mourning the death of her father, who befriends a homeless former jazz singer and convinces him to perform for the customers at her store. Together, they bond over music and Clio encourages him to reconnect with his estranged daughter as the Christmas holiday approaches.

Texto completo: A memorable character actor on both stage and screen, Mr. Aiello won an Academy Award nomination for his role in Spike Lee's 1989 film.
Danny Aiello, the burly New York-born film and stage actor who was 40 when he made his movie debut and 16 years later earned an Academy Award nomination for his role as a pizzeria owner in Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," died on Thursday. He was 86.
His death was confirmed by Jennifer De Chiara, his literary agent, in an email. No other details were provided.
In "Do the Right Thing," Mr. Lee's 1989 film about a white business in the predominantly black Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, Mr. Aiello was a morally complicated racist villain, willing to wield a baseball bat but sentimental about the young people in the neighborhood who had grown up on his food.
He won the role after establishing himself as a memorable character actor in films like "Moonstruck" (1987), in which he played Cher's kind but clueless fiancé; "Fort Apache: The Bronx" (1981), as a ruthless police officer who throws a young man off a rooftop; Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America" (1984), also as a police officer; and three films involving Woody Allen.
In one, in which Mr. Allen starred, Mr. Aiello was cast as a bookie in the 1950s blacklist drama "The Front" (1976). He went on to play Mia Farrow's short-tempered husband in "The Purple Rose of Cairo" (1985) and a Mafia hit man in "Radio Days" (1987), both of which were directed by Mr. Allen. He also played a frustrated 1940s waiter and family man, opposite Bea Arthur, in Mr. Allen's 1981 play, "The Floating Light Bulb."
In "Do the Right Thing," Mr. Aiello's character, Sal, has owned his pizzeria in the neighborhood for 25 years and refuses to leave, even as tensions rise over the wall of fame in his restaurant that includes no photos of black celebrities. The pizzeria is set on fire during a riot, but in the end, he and Mr. Lee's character, an employee, cautiously reconcile.
His performance brought him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Though he lost to Denzel Washington (for "Glory"), Mr. Aiello established his stardom when he was named best supporting actor by the Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston film critics' associations that same year.
Many of his fans never knew that he had begun his acting career on the New York stage, appearing in seven Broadway productions in 11 years. His roles included the macho South Philadelphia father in the hit comedy "Gemini" (1977), for which he had already won an Obie Award for the play's Off Broadway run; a violent tough guy in "Hurlyburly," in which he replaced Harvey Keitel in 1985; and a Hollywood director clinging to his past in "The House of Blue Leaves" (1986).
He also appeared as himself in "Home for the Holidays," a songs-and-stories revue that had a limited run during the 2017 Christmas season.
Mr. Aiello never studied acting and was often described by critics as a natural -- a description, he said in a 2015 NPR interview, that he considered "some sort of insult."
"To me," he said, "it meant I was unlearned."
In a 1990 interview with The New York Times Magazine, he appeared to dismiss Method techniques and preparation. "You know what I do backstage?" he said. "One minute before I go on, I look up at heaven and say, 'Mama, don't let me make a fool of myself."'
Daniel Louis Aiello Jr. was born on June 20, 1933, in Manhattan, the sixth of seven children of Daniel and Frances (Pietrocova) Aiello. Danny, known as Junior until adulthood, grew up on West 68th Street, before gentrification, and then in the South Bronx. His father, whose occupational experience included driving trucks for the bootlegger Dutch Schultz and who served time in prison, was largely absent. His mother worked as a seamstress, an envelope stuffer and a toy-factory supervisor.
Junior was a wage earner from the age of 9 -- first shining shoes at Grand Central Terminal during World War II (10 cents for regular shoes, 25 cents for combat boots), then delivering magazines and laundry and, by his own admission, running numbers for the local mob. He dropped out of high school to join the Army in 1951 and was based in Germany during the Korean War.
Mr. Aiello was a blue-collar worker until his mid-30s. He worked on an assembly line at an aircraft plant in New Jersey, was a baggage handler for Greyhound in Manhattan and gave the public its first taste of his raspy voice when he started his job there as public address announcer, calling out the names of the stops for departing buses. He also became a union official but lost his job after a wildcat strike, reducing him to pool-hall hustling and eventually to burglary to feed his growing family.
In a way, he owed his show business career to his baseball talent. Doing occasional work for an uncle unloading trucks at the Coliseum convention center on Columbus Circle, he wandered into an amateur softball group, the Broadway Show League, just across the way in Central Park. One player, Budd Friedman, who owned the Midtown nightclub the Improv, offered him a job as a bouncer.
Soon he was filling in as M.C. at the Improv, singing backup for unknowns like Bette Midler and the comedian Robert Klein and doing late-late-night readings from "The Godfather" (the book, that is; the movie hadn't been made yet). A playwright patron from Hoboken, N.J., Louis La Russo, persuaded Mr. Aiello to be in a showcase production of his play "Lamppost Reunion," about a Sinatra-like singer.
The play opened Off Broadway in 1970, with Mr. Aiello making his New York stage debut at the age of 37 as a Hoboken bar owner. When the play finally made it to Broadway, in 1975, he was back in the role.
His first film role was in the baseball drama "Bang the Drum Slowly" (1973), with the young Robert De Niro. His last was in "Making a Deal With the Devil," a 2019 F.B.I. drama.
Mr. Aiello married Sandy Cohen, a girl from his Bronx neighborhood, in 1955. She survives him. His other survivors include two sons, Rick and Jaime; a daughter, Stacey; and 10 grandchildren. His son Daniel III, a stunt coordinator, died in 2010.
Mr. Aiello often told the story of his very brief appearance in "The Godfather: Part II" (1974), when he improvised a remark as his character strangled a rival mobster: "Michael Corleone says hello." The director, Francis Ford Coppola, liked the line and left it in the movie.
Mr. Aiello never claimed to have inspired the signature line in "Taxi Driver" (1976), but, according to his 2014 memoir, "I Only Know Who I Am When I Am Somebody Else," he could have. When he and his wife saw the film and Mr. De Niro's character first said, "You talking to me?," he recalled, she turned to him and said, "Danny, he's doing you."

The breach widens as Congress nears a partisan impeachment

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — It was the rarest of moments in the nation's capital, a seemingly sincere attempt at persuasion across the partisan breach by the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee on the eve of the panel's vote to impeach President Trump.
“I know this moment must be difficult, but you still have a choice," Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York told his Republican colleagues at the start of more than 17 hours of debate on whether to remove Trump from office. “I hope that we are able to work together to hold this president — or any president — accountable for breaking his most basic obligations to the country and to its citizens."
A short time later, the former Republican chairman of the committee responded with a plea to Democrats to abandon impeachment: “Put aside your partisan politics," Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin implored, “because the future of our country and the viability of our Constitution as the framers decided it, are at stake."
But the appeals to rise above the tribalism of the moment from the two veteran lawmakers fell on deaf ears. They persuaded no one, and only served to contrast with the rancorous, sometimes personally vindictive debate that unfolded over the next two days in the Ways and Means Committee Room not far from the Capitol.
This was the very divisive impeachment debate that Democrats had always hoped to avoid.
In March, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her new Democratic majority that barring “something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should" try to impeach Trump. “It divides the country," she said then. “And he's just not worth it."
But now, less than three months after the allegations in a whistleblower complaint catapulted Democrats into an investigation of whether the president pressured Ukraine for political gain, the country is exactly where Pelosi worried it would be — on the brink of an intensely partisan impeachment with deep consequences for both parties and the country.
When she gave the green light for impeachment articles to be drafted this month, Pelosi said, “the president leaves us no choice but to act," arguing that to do nothing in the face of Trump's transgressions would invite lasting damage to the Constitution and the institutions of government.
But by Friday morning, as the committee formally paved the way for the House to impeach Trump next week, both sides seemed to sense that political vandalism had already taken place. Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, predicted “irreparable damage to our country" and closed his final argument with a lament: “God help us."
It wasn't just that the committee eventually voted to approve two articles of impeachment, charging Trump with abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress. Throughout the committee's debate, the lawmakers from the two parties couldn't even agree on a basic set of facts in front of them.
They called each other liars and demagogues and accused each other of being desperate and unfair. At one point, Republicans all but abandoned their pursuit of trying to persuade their Democratic colleagues, instead making a motion to strike the most critical lines out of the articles — essentially taking the “impeach" out of impeachment.
“It is silly," Nadler complained about the proposed amendment not long before his Democratic majority rejected it on a 23-17 vote, the same party-line margin that emerged throughout the day, time after time, no matter the argument or the issue.
Lawmakers of both parties appeared to feel the weight of history as they delivered impassioned arguments over and over again, in five-minute chunks, alternating between Democrats and Republicans well into the night on Wednesday, and again on Thursday.
But if the passion was similar, the substance was not. Even for members of a profession who are used to talking past each other, it was striking how unwilling both Republicans and Democrats on the committee were to concede even an inch to the other side.
“Ukraine was not aware of the aid," Johnson insisted Thursday, referring to the $391 million in security assistance that Trump had ordered withheld. If they didn't know the money had been frozen, he explained, Ukraine couldn't have been on the receiving end of a pressure campaign by the president.
When it was his turn, Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, asserted exactly the opposite, alluding to email evidence and testimony that disproved Johnson's argument. “They knew it on July the 25th," Cohen said of the Ukranians. “There were communications from the embassy that have been released that they knew the aid was being held up. They knew it was being held up."
It was an example of the different impeachment realities that the two parties are living in. But it was hardly the only one.
Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, described Trump's July 25 call with the President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine one way, saying it “shows that the president tried to get President Zelensky to interfere in the upcoming presidential election." His Republican colleague, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, saw it differently: “We saw the call transcript, and there is no conditionality."
And after Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, said it was “clear" that Trump cared about rooting out corruption in Ukraine, Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, scoffed: “The president never brings up corruption."
There's a long way to go before knowing which party benefits and which pays for impeachment in the 2020 elections, let alone which fares better in the eyes of history. But trust — by Americans toward Congress — seems to be suffering. And it's not clear the proceedings are changing minds. Recent polling shows that about half the country supports impeaching and removing Trump from office, fitting the pattern of a deeply polarized nation.
The poll also found that about 6 in 10 Americans said Democrats in Congress are more interested in bringing down Trump than pursuing the facts. Likewise, about 6 in 10 said Republicans in Congress are more interested in defending Trump than pursuing the facts.
In the House Judiciary Committee, Thursday night's lengthy session ended with predictable rancor when Nadler abruptly called a recess right before taking a final vote, saying he wanted “the members on both sides of the aisle to think about what has happened over these last two days and to search their consciences."
Instead, his decision — made without any warning and without the kind of bipartisan consultation that is common on the Judiciary Committee — added to the sense of mounting tension inside the grand room, where nerves were already frayed.
It was clear that despite Nadler's advice, nothing had changed by 10 the next morning.
Nadler moved swiftly to call for the final votes on the two articles of impeachment, and both passed with all 23 Democrats in favor of impeaching Trump and all 17 Republicans opposed.
In just 7 minutes, the work was over, and Nadler banged his gavel.
“Without objection," he said, as some Republicans in the room scowled, “this meeting is adjourned."

Texto completo: The argument in favor of arbitrarily revoking the Second Amendment rights of college students, as is done in dozens of states, has ostensibly been rooted in safety concerns.
And it just got a lot weaker.
Two anti-gun professors wrote in the Washington Post that “campus-carry laws will invite tragedies on college campuses, not end them.” Another liberal professor, writing for the New York Times, warned that “when there are more guns around, there is more risk – it’s as simple as that.”
The trouble with such predictions is that they tend to be tested as time goes by. And as it turns out, they simply weren’t true. Students just aren't waging the gun battles that anti-gun activists expected. A new report from the College Fix looked into this narrative, and it came up empty.
When a reporter reached out to numerous universities that permit campus carry, “all of the schools that responded confirmed that they have seen no uptick in violence since their respective policies were put in place.” Responding colleges included Emporia State University, Dixie State University, and Valdosta State University. Separately, the Texas Tribune has reported that after the Lone Star State implemented campus carry at four-year colleges state-wide, it resulted in “no sharp increase in violence or intimidation,” and in fact, the following year was “quiet” and “uneventful.”
These are just a few examples, but even studies cited favorably by gun control advocates admit that “results certainly do not prove that campus carry causes more crime.” Essentially, it's now clear that conservatives and libertarians had this one right. Allowing American adults aged 18 to 22 to exercise their Second Amendment rights on public college campuses is a no-brainer, as there are few rights more fundamental than the right to self-defense. Plus, the inconsistent nature of current “gun-free campus” rules already makes little sense.
The current system in many states bans college students from carrying guns but would allow adults of the same age who do not attend college to carry firearms. This is an arbitrary inconsistency that makes little sense, as there's nothing to suggest that college students are more violent or less responsible than their noncollege peers. So, too, guns are often allowed at high-risk off-campus sites such as fraternity houses, yet barred from the actual campus — a glaring inconsistency that makes little sense. And now it’s officially confirmed that arbitrarily revoking college students’ Second Amendment rights doesn’t even make anyone safer.
It’s impossible for blue-state legislators and liberal college administrators to keep justifying their harsh anti-gun policies. That is, unless they’re willing to admit that they just hate the idea of gun rights.

Texto completo: William Roy, the man who commanded the Vermont National Guard during their 2010 deployment to Afghanistan, said he felt no pressure to "whitewash" reports to higher-ups.
That conflicts with a Washington Post analysis of more than 2,000 pages of documents on the war in Afghanistan obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.
John Sopko – head the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which conducted the interviews – told the Post that the documents show "the American people have constantly been lied to" since U.S. troops first arrived there 18 years ago.
But even during his time at the Pentagon after Vermont's deployment, then Maj. Gen. William F. Roy disagrees that there was a systemic policy to hide the truth, at least on the military side.
"During my time (in Afghanistan), what was being relayed from the field is what was being reported," Roy said in a phone interview Monday night.
When asked if he ever felt pressure to fashion favorable reports while in Afghanistan or at the Pentagon, Roy replied, "Never."
2010 Afghanistan War deployment was Vermont's largest since WWII Roy retired in 2016, after serving two years as commanding general of the Joint Task Force-Civil Support under the Department of Defense's National Guard Bureau in Fort Eustis, Virginia. Before that, he served as deputy director of Army operations for nearly three years at the Pentagon.
In 2010, he commanded the 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Mountain) in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom, the first time a national guard and was put in control of a territory in a foreign country.
That deployment, part of the "surge" under President Obama, was Vermont's largest mobilization of guard soldiers since World War II.
Roy also stressed that Afghanistan as a whole is a massive place and, at the height of the surge, was a very complicated situation with both successes and failures spread all over the country.
Depending on where you were, he said, reports could range from very favorable to the complete opposite.
When at the Pentagon, Roy worked under Gen. John F. Campbell whose last assignment was in Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
"You could not get a straighter shooter than he," Roy said, adding that Campbell had concerns about the challenges facing the U.S. military in Afghanistan and made those concerns clear.
Commander cites early success of training Afghanistan police Prior to 2010, Roy also worked under then Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, who was serving as U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan during the Vermont National Guard's 2010 deployment. Roy characterized Eikenberry's reports at that time as accurate as well.
Between his time on the ground in Afghanistan and at the Pentagon, Roy said he didn't see a policy of white-washing information that was coming out of Afghanistan.
Roy and the Vermont National Guard's history in Afghanistan started shortly after 2001. He cites early successes in training the Afghan Army and the police, efforts that continued through the 2010 deployment.
One of the documents obtained by the Washington Post was a 2015 interview with the special inspector general for Afghan reconstruction.
In that interview, Peter Galbraith — United Nations' Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan in 2009 — outlined everything from massive election fraud, fundamental flaws in the surge strategy, to burnout of State Department staff.
Galbraith served as a Vermont state senator from 2011 to 2015 and ran for governor in 2016.
After helping to uncover fraud in the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Galbraith was later fired after claiming that the UN was concealing that fraud which benefited incumbent president, Hamid Karzai, according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: He won't be on the debate stage next week. But he says his campaign continues, "debate or not."
In less than six hours, we will know who's officially made the cut for next week's Democratic primary debate.
O.K., we basically already know the seven candidates who will participate, barring the release of a bunch of new polls by the deadline late tonight. (Unlikely!) And one candidate who will not be on the stage is Cory Booker.
The New Jersey senator has been trying to turn a crisis into an opportunity, grabbing media attention for campaigning through Iowa cornfields, collecting unexpected endorsements and criticizing the Democratic National Committee's debate qualifying process. (Candidates must show enough support in national or state polls from D.N.C.-selected polling firms, and Mr. Booker has said billionaires can "juice their polling" through television advertising.)
I talked to Mr. Booker about his support, the debate rules and whether his failure to make the December stage spells the end of his campaign. (Spoiler: He says no.)
Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.
Hi, Senator. Thanks for chatting with us today. You've said in the past that not qualifying for the next debate would force some "difficult decisions" about your campaign. Is that still how you feel?
We've actually had a tremendous surge in support these last few weeks since the last debate. We've broken records in our campaign for online fund-raising. The response from the American people since our last debate has been the best of the campaign. So we're really enjoying the best month of momentum we've had yet.
We still see, even without this one debate, a wide pathway to make it to the January debate stage depending on what the criteria is. But we're pretty confident, with the same criteria as this, we can make it.
And it's still seven weeks and six days from the Iowa caucuses. And, according to local media in Iowa, we're still one of the top competitive campaigns that can actually win in Iowa.
So why hasn't that energy shown up in the polling, which would help you qualify for the stage?
Since the last debate, there has not been a poll in Iowa or South Carolina. And that is really unfair.
The D.N.C. has farmed out their qualifying criteria. No. 1, they've picked inferior criteria that does advantage billionaire candidates. But then they outsource it to people that actually weren't going to do any polls between the time I was on the last debate stage going to this one. So we didn't even get to see if there was a bounce for us where we see it: on the ground in places like Iowa and South Carolina and New Hampshire.
How much do you think these debates matter in the race?
They've been material for us in the sense that every debate has led to a surge in donations. And again, if you're not self-financing your election, those surges really help you to apply resources to your campaign.
That said, again, we're seeing an incredible response from the nation right now, getting contributions, tens of thousands of new and unique contributors contributing to our campaign, as well as people doubling and tripling down in their donations. So we sort of insulated ourselves from the lack of this opportunity.
So, it's not going to be an all-white debate stage because Andrew Yang qualified. But are there issues that you worry are going to be missing, given that Senator Kamala Harris dropped out of the race and you're not going to be there?
Clearly, there are many issues that were brought up by the diverse voices. But that does not exclude my colleagues on the stage next week from bringing them up. Walking my streets or going to my bodega, what I've heard more from people is a sense of hurt, that they feel like the people that they felt shared their lived experiences have been unfairly excluded. And it's from the very party that is going to rely on their votes to win Senate seats, congressional seats and governor's seats. And obviously the presidency.
We should not be a party heading into a national election with a feeling among key members of our constituency that this was not a fair process.
Are there changes that you're encouraging the D.N.C. to make to have a more inclusive stage?
We have made no formal proposal to the D.N.C. whatsoever. Clearly, the criteria they're using right now is working against the voters in the early primary states. What the D.N.C. is doing right now is excluding viable campaigns and advantaging other campaigns over ones that have a fair, if not equal or better chance of winning.
What's your big message to voters on this whole December debate?
The debates are not definitive and they haven't been. Our campaign continues, debate or not.

The week in impeachment
With the impeachment inquiry racing ahead, it can be hard to keep track of the daily stream of new developments. So my colleague Noah Weiland , who writes our Impeachment Briefing newsletter , has generously volunteered to catch us up every Thursday on what has happened during the week.

-
The House announced formal articles of impeachment. On Tuesday, Democrats released draft versions of two articles of impeachment, the first accusing President Trump of abusing his power by having solicited election help from Ukraine, and the second accusing him of obstructing Congress in its inquiry. On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee was debating and considering amendments to the drafts ahead of what was expected to be an evening vote on final versions, which will be sent to the full House for a vote.
- There was almost a third article. Hoping to keep the case focused on Ukraine, House Democrats decided against an additional article of impeachment related to Mr. Trump's alleged obstruction of the Mueller investigation, after a dramatic, last-minute debate. They also opted not to charge Mr. Trump with "bribery" or "extortion," as they had contemplated in recent weeks. Those terms could have invited a complicated argument about judicial precedents.
-
The Judiciary Committee and its staff kept long, odd hours. They worked out of a loose web of offices littered with empty soda cans and files from past impeachment proceedings. They held a late-night hearing Wednesday to begin debating impeachment articles. And they even let a New York Times photographer in to document the behind-the-scenes activity.
- The stage is set for a full House vote, tentatively planned for the middle of next week, before lawmakers leave for Christmas break. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that she is not asking Democrats to vote to impeach Mr. Trump and will allow them to follow their conscience. If the House votes to impeach, that sets up a Senate trial for early 2020, which Republican senators hinted this week could be brief.

Bitter Election Dispute Sends Afghanistan Back to the Brink

Texto completo: Abdullah Abdullah, a three-time contender for the presidency, is again at the center of an electoral crisis. This time, he insists he won't compromise.
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Three months after Afghanistan's presidential vote, the entire electoral process is stalled in a dispute that Afghan and Western officials say could pose an even greater threat to stability than the last such crisis, five years ago.
Supporters of opposition candidates have besieged half a dozen election offices around the country for weeks, vowing to fight rather than accept another United States-brokered compromise like the one that resolved the 2014 dispute. Security officials worry that one wrong move could tip the protests into bloodshed. And election officials say a biometric verification process that was supposed to prevent voter fraud may have been compromised by human error.
In the middle of it all -- again -- is Abdullah Abdullah, making his third attempt to become president, and for the third time falling into a bitter standoff with election officials.
This one is likely to play out differently. With American diplomacy focused on negotiating an end to the long war with the Taliban, Western officials say the United States has made it clear that it will not be stepping in as it did five years ago. Then, Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated a power-sharing deal between Mr. Abdullah, now Afghanistan's chief executive, and Ashraf Ghani, now the president, that Mr. Kerry said averted a civil war.
Since Mr. Abdullah and his supporters forced the American intervention in 2014, he has tried to project an image of unity, playing his part in a "power sharing" government in which Mr. Ghani, in reality, has kept a lock on the power.
But Mr. Abdullah's supporters are warier of him this time, though they say they are firm in rejecting what they see as fraud perpetrated to keep Mr. Ghani in office.
Even as Mr. Abdullah insists he will not give in, the strongmen who have rallied around him are worried, according to interviews with advisers and political brokers. In private, they have repeatedly raised their concern about Mr. Abdullah, often to his face: Will the man who has challenged two previous votes before compromising stick to the fight this time, or will he again strike a deal for his own political survival?
"One's own survival as a politician, if that is the aim of somebody -- he is misleading and he is misled," Mr. Abdullah said during an interview with The New York Times, acknowledging his allies' concerns and saying he was determined to fight.
"Ghani is a challenge for the country, not for me," he said. "The point is how to replace him through circumstances in which the country is not lost."
The truth is that the hodgepodge coalition of political leaders around the chief executive has little choice: They came at the last minute to Mr. Abdullah, who says he had been thinking of sitting out this race, because they couldn't agree on another candidate.
For many of these former warlords and commanders, this is an ultimate fight of sorts. Mr. Ghani marginalized them, some to the point of repeated humiliation, and has promised to do so even more if he wins a second term.
Among those fighting for relevance is Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the erratic Uzbek commander whom Mr. Ghani made his vice president in 2014 to gain the support of his constituency, then stripped of much of his authority.
General Dostum has been camped out in his northern stronghold in support of Mr. Abdullah, warning of a blood bath if soldiers use force against protesters. At closed-door meetings of Mr. Abdullah's political circle, another bullish northern commander repeatedly offered to take over a couple of provinces, kicking out the governors and police chiefs to send a message.
Mr. Abdullah frequently meets with Western ambassadors and generals to try to leverage the street demonstrations, officials say. Where the United States and NATO stand on the election is still seen as crucial, given Afghanistan's dependence on their aid and support.
After Mr. Ghani appeared with President Trump during his Thanksgiving Day visit to American troops in Afghanistan, Mr. Abdullah's advisers were angry and confused, demanding to know why their candidate was being undermined by the Americans in the middle of an election dispute. Officials said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later called Mr. Abdullah in what appeared to be an attempt to placate him.
At the heart of the dispute is 300,000 questionable votes that Mr. Abdullah's supporters say the election authorities have counted without transparency, which could favor Mr. Ghani. The ballot verification system has indicated that about 100,000 of those votes were cast outside voting hours -- in some cases, by months.
The election commission attributes that to human error in setting the time on devices that collect voters' biometric data and register the time of their votes. Mr. Abdullah's team accuses election officials of trying to belatedly alter the rules in Mr. Ghani's favor.
"Any game has predetermined rules, and you can't change those rules after the game," said Enayatullah Babur Farahmand, Mr. Abdullah's running mate. "Even in football, when the ball is out of bounds, it's out; you can't make up excuses and explanations to count it in after it's out."
Mr. Ghani's team has portrayed Mr. Abdullah as a master of obstruction, accusing him of purposely muddying the waters until he can get a share of power.
Friends and diplomats say Mr. Abdullah's political endurance has as much to do with circumstance and luck as with his ability to play the long game. His skill lies in forging consensus in the toughest circumstances, and it has kept him relevant in Afghan politics.
An ophthalmologist by training, Mr. Abdullah was a low-level liaison officer in the anti-Soviet guerrilla campaign, one of a group of fighters that years later would be central in supporting the United States invasion in 2001. After the Taliban were ousted, he became foreign minister and then leader of the opposition.
He has risen above many other senior figures from Afghanistan's north by balancing a narrative of guerrilla resistance with a modern outlook, dressing in expensive business suits and carrying himself with ease at receptions in Western capitals.
The first time Mr. Abdullah ran for president -- in 2009, against the incumbent Hamid Karzai -- he claimed foul when Mr. Karzai was declared the winner. When international pressure forced that vote to a runoff, Mr. Abdullah pulled out of the race, to his supporters' dismay.
In 2014, Mr. Abdullah believed he had won the election in the first round, but he agreed to a runoff with Mr. Ghani, thinking his opponent had no chance. When the election commission said Mr. Ghani had won, Mr. Abdullah immediately alleged widespread fraud.
His supporters, much like today, wanted to declare a parallel government, block highways and take over provinces. Mr. Abdullah instead urged them to stay calm, and he agreed to the power-sharing deal that the United States brokered after months of stalemate.
How Mr. Ghani treated Mr. Abdullah and his supporters during the ensuing five years is what is shaping the current dispute into a more dangerous fight.
The Afghan president showed little regard for the 50-50 deal once he took office, sidelining Mr. Abdullah and his allies -- so much so that the allies turned on Mr. Abdullah, sometimes in messy public outbursts in which they ridiculed their own leader as soft. On one occasion, Mr. Ghani even sent his elite bodyguards to kick out a minister appointed by Mr. Abdullah and lock up his office.
In the interview, Mr. Abdullah said his allies were urging the kind of head-on clash with Mr. Ghani that could have brought down the state. Whether out of political convenience or a deep fear of chaos, Mr. Abdullah has repeatedly told his advisers that pushing too far could tilt the country into anarchy that people like him would not be able to control.
He now seems faced once again with similar choices. At his pristine mansion, a stone's throw from Mr. Ghani's palace, Mr. Abdullah repeatedly pointed his finger in the president's direction as he gave reasons why this time he would fight to the end.
"If he wins fairly, I have the courage to congratulate him. Don't worry about my friends; I will go to each and every one of them. I am not here to create problems for the country," Mr. Abdullah said. "But what I am talking about is not winning based on votes -- that's not acceptable."

Texto completo: President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said that he believes there is an internal effort in the State Department to have Trump removed from office.
In a Thursday interview with Sinclair’s Eric Bolling, the 75-year-old former New York City mayor was asked if he believes in the existence of a “deep state” conspiracy.
“Is there a deep state? Is there a concerted effort within the organization, within the [State] Department and or the FBI to take down President Trump?” Bolling asked.
“Oh yes,” Giuliani responded. “State Department is filled with them.”
“It isn’t that they disagree with his policies, and even that they try to undermine his policies a bit. That’s been going on for years,” he continued. “They want to get him out of office. Any way they can. How you can miss that this is a coup attempt is beyond being intelligent.”
Giuliani went on to say that he believes Democrats are leading “the coup.” He said that the FBI and law enforcement has “become intimidated by the press.”
“Unless I’m a courageous prosecutor, I know that if I investigate Rudy Giuliani, the New York Times are going to love it,” he said. “But if I would open an investigation into Joe Biden for a bribe that he admitted on tape … If I were to prosecute Biden, I’d get attacked as, ‘You’re doing it to help Trump,’ ‘You’re interfering in the election.’”

House Democrats introduced articles of impeachment against President Trump last week relating to his July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. During the call he asked the foreign leader to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.
Giuliani was recently in Ukraine to collect information. While in Ukraine, he met with Andriy Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker who wants to form a bilateral investigation between the two countries to look into corruption in Ukraine. Derkach is also looking to build a corruption case against Hunter Biden.
Giuliani is under federal investigation by prosecutors in New York and is being investigated along with two of his recently indicted associates over his consulting business.

Gail Collins: Let Trump have a miserable little Christmas

Texto completo: Hey, it looks like we’ll have impeachment before Christmas. Talk about the holiday spirit.
“They said these two things — they’re not even a crime!” Donald Trump shrieked after Democratic leaders announced the House was going to vote on whether he should be impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. This was at one of his trademark rallies during which he also referred to FBI agents as “scum” and claimed that Elizabeth Warren’s marriage was a “phony, disgusting deal.”
Ho, ho, ho.
Truly we live in not-boring times. Fifty years from now, kids who’ve been watching all this action from their college dorms will be able to answer their grandchildren’s questions about Trump’s bad hair and worse values. Advanced placement high school students might be writing profiles of Jerry Nadler.
There’s been so much action that almost nobody noticed this week when the New York attorney general announced Trump has coughed up $2 million to repay money he stole from his foundation. OK, “stole” is pretty harsh. What would you call it if somebody established a charity and then used a large chunk of other people’s donations to buy portraits of himself — one 6 feet tall — purchase sports memorabilia and pay off legal settlements for his private businesses?
Still waiting for the word …
The Trump charity scandal is an old story, but the impeachment process puts it in a new light. Particularly if you combine it with the money he’s piling up from his Scottish golf resort (thank you Air Force visitors), the Washington hotel (welcome, Saudi officials) and from what the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington estimated were more than 2,300 conflicts of interest between his personal finances and his day job.
A dreadful leader plus a greedy crook: It really does give us a leg up in the drive to make sure Trump goes down in history as the worst president ever. That honor’s traditionally gone to James Buchanan, who floundered in the run-up to the Civil War.
“Unlike Trump, Buchanan was a generous man,” said Robert Strauss, who happens to be the author of a biography of Buchanan titled “Worst. President. Ever.” Buchanan “took in college students who couldn’t afford their room and board,” Strauss added. He never reneged on a debt.
It was published in October 2016. Strauss is still sticking with Buchanan, whom he calls “a nice guy put in the wrong job.” Obviously, secession tops being laughed at by leaders of other democratic powers at a cocktail party. But Trump could qualify for the bottom of the barrel if you throw in personal behavior and presume it’s better to be a nice guy in the wrong job than an awful guy in the wrong job.
Andrew Johnson was another awful president and history’s impeachment star until now, but he was praised for his financial integrity. “After becoming president, when prominent New York merchants tried to give him a magnificent carriage and span of horses he refused the gift,” noted Brenda Wineapple, the author of a history of the Johnson impeachment. “‘Those occupying high official positions,’ he politely said, must ‘decline the offerings of kind and loyal friends.’”
Money always comes up somewhere in this story. “To Impeach a President who has proved through results, to have one of the most successful presidencies ever, and most importantly, who has done NOTHING wrong, is sheer Political Madness! ” Trump himself wrote in an email to his supporters this week, adding quickly that he was activating “Emergency Double-Match on All Contributions.”
The House is expected to vote on impeachment sometime next week, before everybody goes home for the holidays. There have been some delays — you can’t keep members of Congress from going off to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. Or, um, weekends.
While everybody’s waiting, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been moving some other stuff along. That trade deal with Mexico and Canada, and the Democrats’ plan to control the price of prescription drugs.
Do you think that’s a good plan? Some people don’t like the idea of distracting attention from the president’s evildoing. Take your pick:
A) Nobody should talk about anything but the terribleness of Donald Trump. I sculpted his head out of mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving and squished gravy all over it.
B) I started listening to the Judiciary debate the other day, fell asleep and missed my dinner date. Give these poor people a change of subject for a few hours.
C) Anything Nancy Pelosi does is a good idea. I never thought about her at all until a few months ago, but now I believe she’s a combination of Eleanor Roosevelt, Madame Curie and Meryl Streep.
Amazing times, huh? Of course, watching the impeachment drama loses a little zip when you remember that the Senate Republicans are never actually going to toss the president out of office. But that’s a story for 2020. Meanwhile, the holidays have to be a little bit brighter when you contemplate the fact that Donald Trump is definitely not having his best Christmas ever.

Charles M. Blow: Impeachment in the House is the victory

Texto completo: It is hard for me to be out in public or on social media without being peppered with questions by people with strained faces about whether there is any chance that the Senate will vote to convict Donald Trump if the House of Representatives impeaches him.
I have to constantly remind people that impeachment in the House is the victory. The Senate is a lost cause and has been on this issue since Trump rose to office.
The Senate has considered articles of impeachment against two other presidents and refused to convict and remove both times. This time is not likely to be any different. In that sense, impeachment by the House is the strongest rebuke America has ever been willing to give a president.
Trump deserves at least that.
The Republicans will not defect from Trump in any significant numbers, if at all. It’s nearly impossible to call them to virtue when they are in the midst of their depravity. They stayed silent so long, refusing to challenge him when they could, when he was weaker, that he has grown so strong among their voters that now their silence in their only safety.
The threat of Trump’s wrath hangs over them like the sword of Damocles.
History will not only record Trump as a corrupt, tyrannical demagogue, it will also record his staggering success: How one man with no political experience hijacked a major American political party and its tens of millions of loyalists.
It is as extraordinary as it is horrifying.
These people are now devoted to Trump, lost in his lies. Trumpism is their religion and Trump is their God, which has relegated Republicans in Congress to Trump’s devoted cherubim.
Trump will not be convicted and removed. Even if he were convicted, we don’t even have a precedent for how removal would work. An honorable president who cared about the country and its institutions who was convicted might be expected to gracefully depart. But none of that is Trump. He is not honorable. He has done everything in his power to weaken and destroy our institutions.
There is nothing that suggests Trump would willingly depart. Then what? The Constitution doesn’t exactly outline the serving of an eviction notice from the White House or the calling of moving vans. What if Trump rejected a Senate conviction as invalid? What if he accepted it and said he was leaving in a year, only after his term ended? Would we send marshals into the White House to drag him, his wife and son out?
Then there is the other migraine-inducing dilemma: Do you really want a President Mike Pence? Pence sold his soul long ago for a ticket on the Trump train, and he has defended Trump at every turn and without reservation.
Impeaching Trump in the House is the whole point of this exercise, because a line has to be drawn and a precedent has to be set: No one is above the law. You can’t be as openly, brazenly corrupt as Trump has been and continues to be with absolutely no consequences.
You can request that another country interfere in our elections on your behalf and then attempt to bribe them to ensure that they follow through. You can resist all subpoenas from Congress for documents and testimony, and claim it is your right.
A lawless president is no longer a president. He is an autocrat.
Impeachment is not just a matter of justice in politics, this is a matter of justice writ large. There are so many poor and powerless men and women, who every day are destroyed by a zealous and voracious criminal justice system. Trump needs to be rebuked to demonstrate to the country that the rich and powerful are not completely immune to the whims of justice.
There are so many men and women who spend years or even decades wasting away in prisons — sometimes on death row — for crimes that they didn’t commit. How can we look those people in the face if we let this man who has committed his offense walk away out in the open without rebuke?
Trump must be impeached not only for the history books but also for the here and now, for the honor of justice, for the balancing of scales.
Trump won’t be removed, and his remaining days in office will mean that the threat to the country will remain. We know about Trump’s entreaty to have Ukraine interfere in our upcoming election only because of the whistleblower.
But, there is no way to know how much other corruption may exist between Trump and leaders of other countries, how much may well have been effectively communicated with a mere wink and a nod.
Our elections are again at risk, from outside agitators and by the man whose last election benefited from the intrusion and who now wants to repeat that success with the same pattern.
That is a risk Republicans in the Senate will most likely force us to take.
But, if the House impeaches Trump, and it most likely will, we can all stand tall in the truth that the right thing was done there, that the Constitution was defended there, that justice was not completely embarrassed there.
Impeachment in the House is the victory.

Earliest Known Figurative Cave Drawings Uncovered in Indonesia

Cave artwork discovered in a cave system in Sulawesi, an island in central Indonesia, has been officially dated by a group of scientists who’ve determined that it is over 43,900 years old, making the drawings the oldest examples of pictorial storytelling in human history. The drawings in question are sometimes visually unclear, but they depict creatures like wild pigs and dwarf buffaloes as well as therianthropes, which is an archeological term that describes figures that consist of fused human and animal characteristics. The scene rendered by these drawings was uncovered in a cave system that’s been known to researchers for decades, but the narrative element of the combined creations and the ritualistic patterns they suggest have astonished experts in the field. In essence, these drawings seem to evoke a myth or story that hasn’t yet been recorded in human history.
In the scene itself, human hunters and human-animal hybrid hunters appear to be chasing their prey, as evidenced by thin lines drawn in the direction of the dwarf buffaloes that evoke spears being thrown. Before this discovery was made, the oldest verified examples of figurative cave art were determined to be approximately 35,000 years old.

What the newly-uncovered drawings (which were found in 2017 and have been the subject of studies since) suggest is that complex human communication techniques are perhaps even more foundational to our species than experts had previously imagined. The scientific study published on Wednesday that brought these discoveries to the fore reveals that the pertinent Sulawesi cave art has been dated earlier than earlier than previously recorded cave drawings, using “uranium-series analysis of overlying speleothems.”
“This finding is very significant because it was previously thought that figurative painting dated to a time shortly after modern humans arrived in Europe, perhaps circa 40,000 years ago, but this result shows it has an origin outside Europe,” Alistair Pike, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton in England who wasn’t personally involved with the study, told the New York Times . What’s even more exciting about these striking paintings is that translating what they actually mean will be a whole other endeavor entirely.

Judge rejects inmate claims

Texto completo: TAMPA  The same judge who effectively canceled James Daileys execution six weeks ago appears unconvinced by claims that the death row inmate might be innocent of a 1985 Pinellas County murder.

U.S. District Judge William Jung, who in October granted Dailey a temporary stay of execution to give his lawyers more time to research and present their appeals, rejected a number of Daileys new appeals in the past week. In his most recent opinion, published late Tuesday, Jung expressed skepticism of some of the key defense claims, noting that he took time to read the entire record of the 34-year-old case.

A thorough review shows the states trial case against James Dailey was not strong, but it was sufficient, Jung wrote.

Dailey, 73, was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of 14-year-old Shelly Boggio, whose nude body was found one morning in May 1985 in the Intracoastal Waterway in Indian Rocks Beach. She had been beaten, choked, stabbed 31 times and held under water until she drowned.

One of the last people seen with

the teen was Jack Pearcy, who was Daileys roommate. When questioned, Pearcy ultimately admitted participating in the killing, but also implicated Dailey.

Pearcy is serving a life sentence for the crime.

No physical evidence or eyewitness testimony linked Dailey to the murder. His conviction relied heavily on the use of jailhouse informants.

One of them was Paul Skalnik, who testified that Dailey confessed to him while they were housed near each other in the Pinellas County Jail. Skalniks questionable history as an informant in numerous criminal cases was the subject of a lengthy investigative report published last week by ProPublica and the New York Times Magazine.

The judges most recent order did not directly address concerns about Skalniks reliability. Jung did note that jailhouse informant testimony is often problematic and opined that prosecutors use such testimony too frequently.

But in Daileys case, the judge noted testimony from two other jailhouse informants who worked in the prison law library and helped Dailey exchange notes with Pearcy. The text of the notes bolstered the informant testimony, the judge said, and supported the notion that Dailey and Pearcy were accomplices in the same crime.

Jung was also critical of claims, touted by Daileys defense, that Pearcy has since claimed sole responsibility for the murder. Such claims are inaccurate, the judge wrote. He noted that Pearcy signed an affidavit to that effect, but later testified in court that statements in the document were inaccurate.

The judge also pointed to a lengthy statement Pearcy gave in 1985 in which he offered a detailed description of the murder consistent with evidence at the crime scene.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a death warrant in September, setting Daileys execution for Nov. 7.

But on Oct. 23, Jung granted a stay to give Daileys newly appointed federal attorneys more time to research and present their claims.

The judges recent orders leave no appeals pending in the local federal court. But Daileys team still has another appeal pending in the Tallahassee-based Northern District of Florida. It is also likely that they will launch a new appeal in the Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.

Josh Dubin, a member of Daileys defense team, said in a statement Wednesday that courts have repeatedly denied Daileys appeals on procedural grounds rather than judging them on their merits.

We are pleading with Gov. DeSantis to give James Dailey a clemency hearing and are hopeful that he will indeed give us that forum so that all of the facts surrounding the unreliability of Mr. Daileys conviction will be brought to light, the statement read.

The stay of execution that Jung imposed in October remains in place until Dec. 30.

Texto completo: Huckleberries
Bette Ammon, the head Book Worm at the Coeur d'Alene Library, tells Huckleberries that the outbreak of intentionally misplaced books has slowed.
For those who have been living in a cave this fall, Bette and her library "shelvers" have been looking for a self-appointed censor who has been hiding books critical of President Trump or supporting liberal politicians and ideas.
The antics of the vigilante have gained worldwide attention.
The New York Times ran a story. Author Rick Reilly visited. Talk-show host Stephen Colbert sent the library an oversized version of the children's book, "Whose Boat Is This Boat: Comments That Don't Help in the Aftermath of a Hurricane."
Patrons and other visitors have lined up daily to take photos with the giant book that can't be hidden.
Ammon tells Huckleberries that there has been one misplaced book since the backlash began, a tome about the attempted impeachment of Trump. She hasn't been able to find it.
Ninety-five percent of the reaction to the caper has been positive, she said. But there are some conspiracy theorists who believe that the library conjured the Case of the Missing Books to raise its profile. And one female patron was incensed that the library would highlight "Whose Boat Is This Boat," denigrating a great president like Trump.
The hubbub at the Coeur d'Alene Library brings to mind this quote by author Neil Gaiman: "Libraries are the thin red line between civilization and barbarism."
So tired of waitin'
Ray and Lisa Oliveria, of Coeur d'Alene, were prepared for that wreck on Lookout Pass last Thursday.
They had a blanket, water, bananas and granola bars in the car. And taffy, from St. Regis, Montana. If they hadn't stopped for the taffy, of course, they might have been the last to clear the crash scene on westbound Interstate 90 at Mullan. Instead, they were first in line for a 14-hour wait that would stretch to 5:30 Friday morning.
Ray, my youngest brother, has seen his share of wrecks and blocked highways during his 33 years as a truck driver. The one Thursday evening was a doozy. A Canadian trucker lost a 60-ton load at milepost 63. For a while, flaggers let traffic go around the wreckage via an open lane.
The Oliverias and a 200,000-pound crane arrived at the same time, about 5:30 p.m. The Oliverias were stopped. Then, they waited. And waited. Occasionally, Ray started his car for heat. But he had to stop that near midnight when the gauge showed only one-eighth of a tank left.
That's when Ray used an offramp that circled onto the eastbound lanes. He headed back to St. Regis and rented a Super 8 room for the night. Others weren't as lucky. Many slept in their cars without food, water, blankets or toilet paper.
P'haps we should listen to those public safety officials who nag us about being prepared for winter driving emergencies.
Huckleberries
Poet's Corner: Décor designed to be relaxing/ but nonetheless the place is taxing - Tom Wobker, The Bard of Sherman Avenue ("Dentist office")  Imagine the surprise of Ed and Donna Aycock when they emerged from a celebration of their 52nd anniversary to find a homemade sign that read, "Just Married" taped to the back of their car. And cans on strings attached to their bumper. Surprisingly, good friend Bob Kesson, of Coeur d'Alene, had an ironclad alibi  Yesteryear: In the Coeur d'Alene School District 50 years ago, news that the trustees had approved a nickel raise for school lunches, from 25 cents to 30 cents, was so startling that it made the front page of the Press  Do you know what the gendarmes of Kellogg, Idaho, call a "hat trick"? That's when they stop a vehicle, like the one recently at Oregon Street and West Cameron Avenue, that has no plates, no insurance, and the driver has no valid license.
Parting shot
Speaking of the Kellogg PD, Sgt. Paul Twidt reports on an incident that Huckleberries hasn't encountered in 50 years of newspapering. On the 600 block of Bunker Avenue, an unhappy man on a second-floor balcony, took matters, and a poopy diaper, in his own hands when partiers in the hot tub below wouldn't quiet down. The Party Pooper got the celebrants attention by throwing the soiled diaper at them. The Hot Tubbers were en route to return the diaper when the cops showed up and restored the peace. Sgt. Twidt summed up his report by offering words to live by: "Be happy. Be safe. Don't throw poop diapers. It's not nice."

Texto completo: French government raises age to retire as strikes grind on
PARIS - France's prime minister said Wednesday that the full retirement age will be increased for the country's youngest, but offered concessions in an ill-fated effort to calm a nationwide protest against pension reforms that critics say will erode the nation's way of life.
The government says it wants to make the pensions system sustainable and simpler but is facing public pressure, including a week of the most debilitating transport strikes in decades.
Major unions were quick to reject the proposals and vowed to strike on.
The day after more than 300,000 people protested across France, metro lines in Paris but two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dig in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, whom they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension changes in a speech Wednesday, saying bluntly that the French "will need to work longer."
People born after 1974 will have to work until age 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected, he said.
The new scheme is aimed at replacing a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules.
Philippe said the changes ensure the pension system is "fair and sustainable" for a growing population with a record number of people over 90.
For people entering the workforce, the reforms will only start to apply in 2022, which happens to be the last year of Macron's term.

Nobel laureate Suu Kyi defends Myanmar army in UN court
THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Nobel Peace Prize winner and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi denied Wednesday that Myanmar's armed forces committed genocide, telling the United Nation's top court that the mass exodus of Rohingya people from the country she leads was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents.
The image of the former pro-democracy icon appearing before the International Court of Justice to defend the army that kept her under house arrest for 15 years was striking.
Myanmar's accusers have described a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh.
Suu Kyi calmly rebuffed allegations that army personnel killed civilians, raped women and torched houses in 2017.

Leaders scramble for votes as UK's ugly campaigning ends
LONDON - Britain's election has been like the country's late-autumn weather: chilly and dull, with blustery outbursts.
On the last day of the campaign, political leaders dashed around the U.K. on Wednesday trying to win over millions of undecided voters who will likely determine the outcome.
Opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a lead over the main opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn ahead of Thursday's election.
Britain's first December vote since 1923 for all 650 seats in the House of Commons has been dubbed the Brexit Election. It comes more than two years early in hopes of breaking the political deadlock over the country's stalled departure from the European Union.

Report: Giuliani settles long divorce from his third wife
NEW YORK - Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his third wife have reached a settlement in a yearslong court battle that exposed details about their luxurious lifestyle, The New York Times reported.
Giuliani, 75, and his wife, Judith, put an end to their differences and "intend to remain friends in the years to come," Judith Giuliani's divorce attorney, Bernard Clair, told the newspaper.
The couple was married for 15 years.
Throughout the divorce, details about the couple's $230,000 monthly budget became public, including six houses, 11 country club memberships and $12,000 on Rudy Giuliani's cigars.
Giuliani previously was married for 20 years to Donna Hanover. Before that, he was married for 14 years to Regina Peruggi.

YouTube cracks down on racist, sexist insults
SAN FRANCISCO - YouTube is taking another step to curb hateful and violent speech on its site.
The video streaming company said it will now take down videos that lob insults at people based on race, gender expression, sexual orientation or other "protected attributes." The Google-owned company will also prohibit veiled threats of violence, taking a step further into moderating what people can say on the videos they create and upload.
YouTube has been slapped with criticism from politicians, viewers and video creators for the material it allows on - and bans from - the site. The site has been accused of allowing and fostering hate speech and extremism and creating spaces for harassment to linger online, along with other digital sites that allow people to upload their own material, such as Facebook and Twitter.

Chile: Debris found believed to be from missing plane
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile - The Chilean Air Force says it has recovered debris believed to be from a military transport plan carrying 38 people that vanished days earlier en route to Antarctica.
Air Force Gen. Eduardo Mosqueira says "sponge" material was found floating roughly 18 miles from the place the C-130 Hercules last had radio contact.
It had left southern Chile and was flying over Drake Pass, a notoriously turbulent area.
Mosqueira said Wednesday the debris will be analyzed to see if it corresponds to the missing plane. He says the process could take up to two days to confirm.
The C-130 Hercules took off Monday afternoon from a base in far-southern Chile on a regular maintenance flight for an Antarctic base. Radio contact was lost 70 minutes later.

In Niger: About 100 Islamic militants ambushed an army camp in western Niger, a military spokesman said late Wednesday, killing at least 71 soldiers in the deadliest attack on the West African country's forces in years.
The large-scale attack comes amid a surge of assaults on army camps in the Sahel region, which have allowed jihadists to amass weapons and vehicles for their arsenal. Neighboring Mali has seen such an increase in ambushes on its army that it has even closed some of its most remote and vulnerable army outposts.
A Niger army spokesman read the death toll announcement on state TV Wednesday night and said a dozen others had been wounded after the ambush overnight.

Impeachment is not Congress' roadblock The House is passing bills while the Republican-controlled Senate is idle.

Texto completo: As the House of Representative moves towards a vote on Articles of Impeachment, expect President Trump and his supporters to claim that the process has been a huge distraction, which has brought the business of government to a standstill
But if they're looking for a roadblock, they are looking in the wrong place. The House, the site of all the action in the impeachment process so far, has been a model of efficiency, passing 400 pieces of legislation since January that address the nations' most serious needs, including health care, election security, and several measures on climate change (including Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree's bill to rebuild climate-damaged working waterfront infrastructure).But only 70 bills have been passed into law this year, and that includes the renaming of post offices or veterans centers, and extending already existing programs for disaster relief, flood insurance and the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.
There is still a year to go in the session, but, according to an analysis by the online news agency Vox, this Congress is sure to fall far short of the 300 to 500 bills passed in recent sessions, and nowhere near the 700 to 800 bills that were passed by Congress in the 70s and 80s.
The president is right to say that this is a do-nothing Congress, but wrong when he says impeachment is the problem.
The real culprit is the Republican-controlled Senate, and the tight-fisted management style of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Kentucky senator is not only throwing roadblocks against initiatives that have mostly Democratic support, but also bipartisan bills, like universal background checks, reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, and restoring net neutrality.
McConnell has the votes to kill any of these bills, or any parts of them that his caucus doesn't like, but it never gets that far. Instead he just suffocates them, preventing any public debate. Unless he's being called to confirm Trump-appointed judges, McConnell won't move.
The lack of progress has even caught the attention of Maine's Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who told The New York Times' Carl Hulse back in September that "I'm very eager to turn from nominations to legislation."
In contrast, look at the House. On Tuesday, shortly after House leaders detailed two draft articles of impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a deal struck with the president on a modernized North American Free Trade Agreement. If House Democrats can keep talking with a president that they are on the verge of declaring unfit for office, the president's supporters in the Senate ought to be able to send bills to his desk for the good of the country.
And if they don't, there should be no confusion about which side of the U.S. Capitol the do-nothing Congress resides.

New York Police Create Unit to Counter a Rise in Far-Right Extremism

Texto completo: Threats from far-right and neo-Nazi organizations, including groups like The Proud Boys, will be investigated.
For almost two decades, the intelligence bureau of the New York Police Department has built a security apparatus designed to track international terror groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.
Now, the department is aiming those resources at a different target: far-right and extremist hate groups.
Police officials say they have formed a new unit within the department's intelligence bureau, known as "Racially and Ethnically Motivated Extremism," or "R.E.M.E," that will be primarily dedicated to investigating terror threats from far-right and neo-Nazi organizations, including groups like the Atomwaffen Division and The Proud Boys.
The unit became operational early this month, and already has dozens of open investigations, police officials said.
John Miller, the commissioner of the intelligence division, said the far-right extremist groups are not that different in nature from Islamic extremist groups like Al Qaeda. "There's no different recipe except our offenders are likely to be on the ground here," he said in an interview.
Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the unit's creation on Wednesday at City Hall, just a day after a gun battle in Jersey City, during which two people with guns opened fire at two different locations, including a kosher supermarket, killing three bystanders and a Jersey City detective.
"What we saw yesterday was a premeditated, violent, anti-Semitic hate crime," Mr. de Blasio said. "In other words, you can say it was an act of terror."
The two suspects, a man and a woman, were killed in a shootout with police. The man, who has been identified as David N. Anderson, 47, had a history of posting anti-Semitic and anti-police rhetoric online, one law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an open investigation.
The R.E.M.E. unit appears to be one of the first of its kind organized in a local police department, and its creation underscores the urgency with which law enforcement views the threat of far-right inspired attacks. According to the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks such incidents, 50 people were killed by extremists in the United States in 2018, and every one of the incidents was linked to far-right ideologies.
The unit will use the same tools that are applied in other terrorism investigations, said Thomas Galati, the chief of the department's intelligence bureau. In an interview, Mr. Galati declined to go into specific detail. But police officials said those tools could include anything from tracking internet message boards to undercover operations inside far-right groups.
The city's police department had previously investigated threats from such organizations across several different divisions. But one week this summer rattled police officials in New York: A gunman in El Paso, Texas, opened fire in a Walmart and killed 22 people; a separate shooter in Gilroy, Calif. shot and killed three at a Garlic festival; and another shooter in Dayton, Ohio opened fire in a bar and killed nine.
Those three incidents prompted the department to expedite creation of the new unit, the police said.
"You can wait for that terrible thing that has a terrible impact on human life to happen in New York City," Mr. Miller said. "Or you can look at those things that are happening in all those other places and say, 'Let's organize a more focused effort to detect and prevent that now."'
The size of far-right groups in New York City remains unclear. Katherine Sizemore, an intelligence analyst assigned to the new unit, said that while few of them are based in New York, the city is often mentioned as a target for attacks.
"Who do they see as being the threat to the society they want to create -- this white ethnostate?" Ms. Sizemore said. "A city like New York City, where you have all of these races and ethnicities and religions all in one place. That's the threat."
Last October, the Metropolitan Republican Club in Manhattan was the scene of a violent brawl between The Proud Boys, a far-right group that disdains liberals, feminists and Islam, and anti-fascist activists. The violence came shortly after the founder of the Proud Boys, Gavin McInnes, a former Brooklyn hipster and right-wing provocateur, spoke at the club.
Two members of The Proud Boys were convicted on charges of attempted gang assault and rioting in relation to the melee.
Not far outside the city's boundaries, far-right militias operate in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, law enforcement officials said. Long Island has an active chapter of Oathkeepers, a right-wing militia group, and another militia group, the Three Percenters, has had a presence in New York State for years.
Police officials said they had seen groups like The Proud Boys and Patriot Front, a white supremacist group, put posters at college campuses in the city.
"There are people we're definitely concerned with in the tristate area," Chief Galati said. "It's our job to identify them and make sure they're not acting out."
The R.E.M.E. unit will include representatives from New Jersey and Pennsylvania state police, and agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
How to deal with threats from far-right groups has been a subject of debate at the highest levels of law enforcement. While supporters of groups like the Islamic State or Al Qaeda can be charged in federal court for supporting an overseas terror organization, critics say there is no comparable charge when someone supports a domestic group that endorses violence.
But the police department's new unit will likely test how far state and local prosecutors can push local laws to fill gaps in federal statutes. New York State has its own terrorism charges, including a material support charge that could be used against proponents of domestic, far-right groups, Mr. Miller said.
"We're essentially legally all set for our state charge," Mr. Miller said. "Our state charge makes no differentiation between domestic terrorism and foreign terrorism, and there is a material support charge."
The New York Police Department has drawn fire from civil liberties lawyers in the past for its monitoring of political groups. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the police department helped launch a secret surveillance program targeting the city's Muslim population. In more recent history, the department has kept tabs on groups that protest police brutality, like Black Lives Matter.
Mr. Miller said that is within the intelligence bureau's purview to monitor far-right groups.
"Well, we're authorized to do that," Mr. Miller said. "We're the only entity in the N.Y.P.D. designated in the patrol guide to investigate quote-unquote political activity, meaning political activity that could lead to illegal activity."

Texto completo: Less than a month before his New York trial on sex-crime charges, Harvey Weinstein is reported to be close to a $25 million settlement deal over civil suits with some of his accusers – under terms in which he won't have to pay nor admit to wrongdoing.
According to reporting by the New York Times and Variety on Wednesday, teams of civil lawyers for Weinstein, as well as lawyers from the New York Attorney General's office, and for more than 30 accusers have reached a tentative agreement that would resolve most of the civil litigation against the fallen movie mogul, including a broad class-action case accusing him and his board of directors of The Weinstein Company of a systemic pattern of sexual misconduct.
A representative of Weinstein's legal team, Juda Engelmayer, had no comment on the reports about the proposed settlement.
The publications quoted anonymous lawyers involved in on-going negotiations over two years who said the proposed settlement's terms would not require Weinstein to admit wrongdoing or pay anything to his accusers himself.
Instead, it would be paid by insurance companies representing The Weinstein Company, which is in bankruptcy proceedings and has other creditors. The $25 million payout to the accusers would be part of an overall $47 million settlement intended to close out the company’s obligations.
But the proposed settlement is not a done deal: It still has to be approved by at least two judges, one from the federal court in Delaware overseeing the bankruptcy case, and the other from a federal court in New York.
Moreover, at least two accusers, and possibly more, plan to challenge the proposed settlement as not good enough to compensate them and not strong enough to punish Weinstein.
Douglas Wigdor, who represents two objectors, told the Times and Variety that his clients most resent a clause that says for every accuser who does not accept the deal, the insurers will give $500,000 to Weinstein as a way to avoid any further obligations to defend him.
“What’s most offensive is that they’re trying to force our client to settle,” Wigdor said.
The payout formula is complicated; among a mix of payments to various parties, a chunk of the settlement money, about $12 million, would go to the attorneys who defended Weinstein, his brother Bob Weinstein, and the Weinstein Co. directors in the civil cases.
The Times interviewed some of the accusers who said they weren't entirely pleased about the proposal but thought it might be the best they and their fellow plaintiffs could get.
“While this settlement is flawed, we know it represents the hard work of several survivors of Harvey Weinstein," said Rebecca Goldman, chief operating officer of TIME’S UP Foundation, in a statement emailed to USA TODAY. "We hope it brings them, and perhaps others, some small measure of justice and relief that is long overdue. "
“We support survivors, and that includes supporting survivors to make their own decisions to make deals with their abusers," added Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of the anti-rape group UltraViolet, in a statement emailed to USA TODAY. "But it’s hardly lost on us that these brave women made the only choice that was available to them under our flawed and disempowering judicial system. Survivors of sexual abuse deserve better. ”
This is not the potential end to all civil lawsuits against Weinstein: It doesn't include one famous accuser of Weinstein, Ashley Judd, who's filed a separate sexual harassment and retaliation suit against him in California. She has said she wants a trial in her case.
Generally speaking, civil litigation against a criminal defendant can be placed on hold while his criminal case is pending so as to avoid infringing on his Fifth Amendment rights during depositions and other civil proceedings.
A number of Bill Cosby's accusers also sued him in civil court. Those cases were either dismissed or were settled by his insurance company (over his objections) after he was convicted of sex crimes in 2018.
Late Wednesday, Elizabeth Fegan, the lead attorney who represents the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit, issued a statement emphasizing that the proposed settlement is not yet final.
"It would be inappropriate for me, or for anyone involved in the litigation, to talk about specifics" now, she said in the statement emailed to USA TODAY. “What I can say is that the women who brought this suit forward and persevered against long odds are the heroes of this case, especially considering that the defendant went to every extreme to discredit them. "
She added that prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office who are prosecuting Weinstein "can benefit from what we’ve uncovered in our 24 months of litigation. "
Weinstein will be tried starting Jan. 6 on five sex-crime charges, including rape and sexual assault and involving two accusers. He was in court Wednesday in Manhattan for a bail hearing – his bail was hiked to $5 million from $1 million – and he is scheduled to undergo back surgery on Thursday after he was injured in a car accident this summer.
The proposed settlement would cover only about a third of the total number of women, named and anonymous, who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from groping and sexual harassment to sexual assault and rape in episodes dating back decades. They came to light in the fall of 2017 when the New York Times and the New Yorker published exposés in which women, some of them famous actresses, came forward for the first time to accuse him on the record.

Weinstein reaches tentative settlement with accusers

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film company reached a tentative $25-million settlement agreement with dozens of women who accused him of various counts of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment, according to several people with direct knowledge of the deal.
The proposed settlement would not require Weinstein, the embattled movie mogul whose alleged behavior propelled the #MeToo movement, to admit fault or personally pay the accusers.
If the deal, which was first reported Wednesday by the New York Times, moves forward, it must be formally approved by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in Delaware and a federal judge in New York.
The payout for the accusers who choose to participate would come from insurance companies representing the Weinstein Co. as part of bankruptcy proceedings resulting in an overall $47 million settlement. Of this, more than $12-million would be paid to cover a portion of the legal costs of Weinstein and his associates.
Caitlin Dulany, an actress who alleged Weinstein sexually assaulted and harassed her in the 1990s, said even though the tentative settlement wasn't 'perfect,' she hoped it might help set a precedent for victims of sexual assault 'going up against predators and the companies they work for.'
'It's mixed feelings,' Dulany said. 'I'm very sad that it's not more for these victims, and there are so many. . . . But I'm also really, really happy that it's happening, both for the women and the potential it holds for the future.'
It is unclear how many alleged victims would ultimately participate in the settlement. But at least four are not taking part, and some may oppose the deal in court. These include Alexandra Canosa, a television producer who has accused Weinstein of raping, threatening and sexually abusing her several times over the course of five years. Her attorney Thomas Giuffra said in a statement that there is 'nothing fair or just' about the proposed deal.
Douglas Wigdor, who represents Wedil David, another accuser who turned down the terms of the deal, said in a statement, 'We reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims.' He called the approximately $12-million to cover legal fees 'shameful.'
Representatives for Weinstein did not return The Washington Post's request for comment. Weinstein, who faces a criminal trial in New York in January on sex-crime charges, has long maintained his innocence.
Two years ago, an investor group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet almost bought the assets of the Weinstein Co., then near bankruptcy, in a deal that would have included a victims' compensation fund worth up to $90 million. The deal fell through when a civil rights lawsuit was filed by New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman against Weinstein, his brother and his company for 'vicious and exploitative' treatment of their employees and for failing to protect accusers.
The tentative settlement reached Wednesday is a fraction of what the victims could have received had the 2017 deal gone through.
'There isn't enough money we'd like to see made available to the victims. He truly harmed people and wrecked people's lives through sexual predation,' said Debra Katz, who was not involved with the settlement but represents Irwin Reiter, a longtime Weinstein Co. executive who has said he flagged company executives about Weinstein's alleged behavior. 'That said, the lawyers who have been involved with this have worked very hard for two years to try and get as much money as is available for the victims.'
Rebecca Goldman, chief operating officer of the Time's Up Foundation, released a statement that called the tentative settlement 'flawed.' 'This settlement is more than a math problem,' she wrote. 'It's a symptom of a problematic, broken system that privileges powerful abusers at the expense of survivors.'
Goldman added: 'We know [the settlement] represents the hard work of several survivors of Harvey Weinstein. 'We hope it brings them, and perhaps others, some small measure of justice and relief that is long overdue.'
While the settlement would bring one aspect of the ongoing saga to a possible close, Weinstein would still face criminal charges that could result in a sentence of life in prison.
The disgraced producer, who has denied all accusations since his arrest last year, had been free on $1-million bail as he awaited trial; the court had also restricted his travel to the United States and required he wear an electronic ankle monitor.
On Wednesday, Judge James M. Burke in Manhattan increased Weinstein's bail after a two-day hearing. The former film producer put up a $2 million insurance bond, secured by stocks, bonds and cash.
Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told the court that Weinstein had dozens of monitoring violations, arising from moments when a device was either out of cell service range or left at home.
'It defies logic to believe he cannot navigate taking his device with him when he travels outside of his home,' she said Friday, the first day of the hearing, adding 'the people's position is none of the bracelet violations were accidental.'
Citing his use of private jets, a multi-firm defense team and the sale of five New York properties, Illuzzi-Orbon said Weinstein has 'almost unlimited resources' and her request was 'not overly burdensome on the defendant.'
Donna A. Rotunno, a member of Weinstein's defense team, disagreed, calling the violations 'technical glitches.'

What did the U.S. get for $2 trillion in Afghanistan?

Texto completo: All told, the cost of nearly 18 years of war in Afghanistan will amount to more than $2 trillion. Was the money well spent?
There is little to show for it. The Taliban control much of the country. Afghanistan remains one of the world’s largest sources of refugees and migrants. More than 2,400 U.S. soldiers and more than 38,000 Afghan civilians have died.
Still, life has improved, particularly in the country’s cities, where opportunities for education have grown. Many more girls are now in school. And democratic institutions have been built — although they are shaky at best.
Drawing on estimates from Brown University’s Costs of War Project, we assessed how much the U.S. spent on different aspects of the war and whether that spending achieved its aims.
$1.5 trillion waging war
The Taliban control or contest much of the country.
When President George W. Bush announced the first military action in Afghanistan in the wake of terrorist attacks by al-Qaida in 2001, he said the goal was to disrupt terrorist operations and attack the Taliban.
Eighteen years later, the Taliban are steadily getting stronger. They kill Afghan security force members — sometimes hundreds in a week — and defeat government forces in almost every major engagement, except when significant American air support is used against them.
Al-Qaida’s senior leadership moved to Pakistan, but the group has maintained a presence in Afghanistan and expanded to branches in Yemen, northern Africa, Somalia and Syria.
The $1.5 trillion in war spending remains opaque, but the Defense Department declassified breakdowns of some of the three most recent years of spending.
Most of the money detailed in those breakdowns — about 60% each year — went to things like training, fuel, armored vehicles and facilities. Transportation, such as air and sea lifts, took up about 8%, or $3 billion to $4 billion a year.
$10 billion on counternarcotics
Afghanistan supplies 80% of the world’s heroin.
In a report last year, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction described counternarcotics efforts as a “failure.” Despite billions of dollars to fight opium poppy cultivation, Afghanistan is the source of 80% of global illicit opium production.
Before the war, Afghanistan had almost completely eradicated opium, according to United Nations data from 1996 to 2001, when the Taliban were in power.
Today, opium cultivation is a major source of income and jobs, as well as revenue for the Taliban. Other than war expenditures, it is Afghanistan’s biggest economic activity.
$87 billion to train Afghan military and police forces
Afghan forces can’t support themselves.
One of the major goals of the U.S. effort has been to train thousands of Afghan troops. Most of U.S. spending on reconstruction has gone to a fund that supports the Afghan Army and police forces through equipment, training and funding.
But nobody in Afghanistan — not the U.S. military, and not President Ashraf Ghani’s top advisers — thinks Afghan military forces could support themselves.
The Afghan Army in particular suffers from increasing casualty rates and desertion, which means they have to train new recruits totaling at least a third of their entire force every year.
President Barack Obama had planned to hand over total responsibility for security to the Afghans by the end of 2014 and to draw down all U.S. forces by 2016. That plan faltered when the Taliban took quick advantage and gained ground.
The U.S. military had to persuade first Obama, and then President Donald Trump, to ramp up forces. Some 14,000 U.S. troops remained in the country as of this month.
$24 billion on economic development
Most Afghans still live in poverty.
War-related spending has roughly doubled the size of Afghanistan’s economy since 2007. But it has not translated into a healthy economy.
A quarter or more of Afghans are unemployed and the economic gains have trailed off since 2015, when the international military presence began to draw down.
Overseas investors still balk at Afghanistan’s corruption — among the worst in the world, according to Transparency International, an anticorruption group — and even Afghan companies look for cheaper labor from India and Pakistan.
Hopes of self-sufficiency in the mineral sector, which the Pentagon boasted could be worth $1 trillion, have been dashed. A few companies from China and elsewhere began investing in mining, but poor security and infrastructure have prevented any significant payout.
$30 billion on other reconstruction programs
Much of that money was lost to corruption and failed projects.
U.S. taxpayers have supported reconstruction efforts that include peacekeeping, refugee assistance and aid for chronic flooding, avalanches and earthquakes.
Much of that money, the inspector general found, was wasted on programs that were poorly conceived or riddled with corruption.
American dollars went to build hospitals that treated no patients, to schools that taught no students (and sometimes never existed at all) and to military bases the Afghans found useless and later shuttered.
The inspector general documented $15.5 billion in waste, fraud and abuse in reconstruction efforts from 2008 through 2017.
Thanks to U.S. spending, Afghanistan has seen improvements in health and education — but they are scant compared with international norms.
Afghan maternal mortality remains among the highest in the world, while life expectancy is among the lowest. Most girls still receive little or no schooling, and education for boys is generally poor.
$500 billion on interest
The war has been funded with borrowed money.
To finance war spending, the U.S. borrowed heavily and will pay more than $600 billion in interest on those loans through 2023. The rest of the debt will take years to repay.
$1.4 trillion on veterans that have fought in post-9/11 wars by 2059
Medical and disability costs will continue for decades.
More than $350 billion has already gone to medical and disability care for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. Experts say that more than half of that spending belongs to the Afghanistan effort.
The final total is unknown, but experts project another trillion dollars in costs over the next 40 years as wounded and disabled veterans age and need more services.

Texto completo: Donald Trump famously said that he could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not “lose any voters.” I don’t know about that. But I’m confident that he wouldn’t lose Bill Barr.
Execution privilege, Barr would probably call it. He’d release a statement or hold a news conference to say that Trump had a spastic trigger finger or was triggered by Adam Schiff or was set up by those dastardly Ukrainians, who are never up to any good. Such is the magnitude of Barr’s servility, the doggedness of his deference. He’s the president’s moral launderer. Trump does evil, and Barr washes him clean.
As attorney general, he’s supposed to be the nation’s lawyer. But he has bought into the autocratic delusion that Trump equals America, that national interest and presidential prerogative are inextricably intertwined. So he’s Trump’s advocate, come hell or high crimes, as surely as Pat Cipollone or Rudy Giuliani is.
On Monday, showing fresh contempt for the people who work under him in the Justice Department, Barr renounced a determination by the department’s inspector general that the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia was legitimate and that anti-Trump bias was not its animating force. He did this instantly.
And then, on Tuesday, did it again, with even less subtlety and more sanctimony. “It was a travesty,” he said of the investigation, and he was speaking not just of the sloppiness and haste of some of the FBI’s actions, with which the inspector general also took issue. He was dismissing the whole effort as rotten.
It was an eerie echo of his efforts last spring, when he sought to neuter Robert Mueller’s findings about the Trump campaign’s openness to Russian help and the president’s attempts to obstruct justice. Give Barr points for consistency. He has bought fully into the idea that the zeal of Trump’s detractors matters more than the presidents’ abuses of power.
But what of the Constitution? What of common decency? Barr isn’t concerning himself with those. To do so would call into question the honor of serving in this administration, the compliment of holding the job that Trump gave him. And he wants that compliment. That pedestal. He prefers to see himself as a holy warrior than as an unholy dupe.
To appreciate his perspective, you must travel back two months, to the University of Notre Dame, where he delivered a speech that garnered some headlines but not nearly enough of them.
You should read it. You should savor its grandiosity — it has references to the dawn of homo sapiens, the twilight of the Judeo-Christian order, Edmund Burke, James Madison — so that you can understand his current overreach, born of his certainty that he knows better than the rest of the body politic and is called to heal us.
You should note his remarks’ obsession with morality and you should try not to laugh, the same way you stifle chuckles when you’re reminded that Mike Pompeo is a putatively worshipful Christian and you try to square that with how he abetted the persecution of Marie Yovanovitch, leaves his State Department charges twisting in the wind and genuflects before a false prophet. In Trump he trusts.
You should dwell on the part of Barr’s jeremiad where he says that “men are subject to powerful passions and appetites and, if unrestrained, are capable of ruthlessly riding roughshod over their neighbors and the community.” Ruthless? Roughshod? That’s Trump in an alliterative nutshell, but Barr seemed to be perversely oblivious to that. He was making a case for Trump’s presidency.
The wonder of this wretched moment has never been the existence and stench of a bad egg in the Oval Office. That’s hardly strange, given how ably shamelessness serves ambition. The wonder is how many other bad eggs the current president has assembled or hatched. The wonder is this fluffy, funky omelet of unscrupulousness.
All these supposedly godly men — Barr, Pompeo, Mike Pence, Ben Carson, Rick Perry and more — cluster around such a demonstrably godless one. They rationalize that Trump’s indulgence of certain religious factions absolves him of his sins. Barr is the principal agent of that absolution.
He’s also a paragon of hypocrisy, telling Pete Williams of NBC News that the FBI investigation of Trump’s campaign was an ominous abuse of government power for partisan aims. That description better suits the conduct for which Trump is about to be impeached. I don’t know how Barr kept a straight face.
Actually, I do. Since betrothing himself to Trump, he has had ample practice. In the Notre Dame speech, without any palpable sense of irony, he urged a “moral renaissance” and delivered this priceless line: “No society can exist without some means for restraining individual rapacity.” I agree.
In our society, impeachment is one of those means. The law is another. And if Barr could dig out his conscience from under all those layers of ego, he’d see that the rapacious individual in direst need of restraint is the one he’s letting roam free.

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) - Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his third wife - the former Judith Stish, a Hazleton native - have reached a settlement in a yearslong court battle that exposed details about their luxurious lifestyle, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.
Giuliani, 75, and his wife, Judith, put an end to their differences and “intend to remain friends in the years to come,” Judith Giuliani's divorce attorney, Bernard E. Clair, told the newspaper.
An email and phone call left for Clair was not returned. It was not immediately clear who represented Rudy Giuliani.
The settlement comes more than year after Judith Giuliani filed divorce papers against her now former husband, the personal attorney to President Donald Trump.
The couple was married for 15 years. Their divorce settlement will remain confidential, the Times said.
Throughout the divorce, details about the couple's $230,000 monthly budget became public, including six houses, 11 country club memberships and $12,000 on Rudy Giuliani's cigars.
Giuliani previously was married for 20 years to Donna Hanover. Before that, he was married for 14 years to his second cousin, Regina Peruggi. That marriage was later annulled.
Giulianí's legal woes might not be over. Two of his close associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested in October at Dulles International Airport outside Washington while trying to board a flight to Europe with one-way tickets. They were indicted on charges of conspiracy, making false statements and falsification of records.

Giuliani Divorce Settled With Hazleton Native

Texto completo: The acrimonious divorce case of Rudy Giuliani and his estranged wife - the former Judith Stish, a Hazleton native - a battle that had played out in court and across tabloid headlines for more than a year and a half, came to an abrupt and harmonious end Tuesday evening, according to her lawyer.
The couple have resolved all their differences and financial squabbles, according to an emailed statement from Bernard E. Clair, Judith Giuliani’s lawyer, and they “intend to remain friends in the years to come.”
The Giulianis, who had been married since 2003, were to begin their divorce trial in Manhattan early next year.
The details of the settlement will remain confidential, Clair added.
One of the key stumbling blocks in the public and heated divorce battle was Judith Giuliani’s belief that her husband, the former New York City mayor who made millions of dollars a year after leaving office, owed her far more than the $42,000 monthly in support he was providing her during their separation.
Prior media reports last year had Judith Giuliani wanting Rudy Giuliani to foot a $63,000-per-month bill while maintaining personal expenses including the cost of the homes, insurance policies, her mother’s assisted-living home and her personal assistant.
Judith Giuliani asserted that Rudy Giuliani had deliberately taken on pro bono work as President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer to claim penury in an effort to reduce future alimony payments.
The often caustic proceedings revealed their lavish lifestyle, including a $230,000 monthly spending habit, and their six houses and 11 country club memberships.
“It seems both parties spend money on certain expenses that are beyond what most Americans spend for clothing, for instance. That was their lifestyle,” Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Michael Katz said last year. “It is beyond me why either party in this case would have an interest in having all of this done publicly.”
He advised them to settle privately, as doing so “would treat their relationship and marriage with more respect than divulging all our dirty laundry out for public consumption.”
They seem to have listened, at last.
“The parties resolved their divorce today, along with all issues concerning support, assets and any other claims,” Clair wrote. “They wish each other the best of luck in the future.”

Yang Qualifies, Increasing Field For Debate to 7

Texto completo: He cleared a final polling hurdle to join six other candidates, ensuring there won't be an all-white debate.
The entrepreneur Andrew Yang has qualified for next week's Democratic debate, bringing the lineup to seven and ensuring that the candidates onstage will not all be white, though the lineup still does not include any black or Latino candidates.
A national Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday showed Mr. Yang at 4 percent. He needed to reach or exceed that mark in four polls to qualify for the debate, and this was his fourth. He had long since met the Democratic National Committee's other qualification requirement of 200,000 unique donors.
Mr. Yang will join, in alphabetical order, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the investor Tom Steyer and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on the debate stage on Dec. 19. The debate will take place at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
Senator Kamala Harris of California had also qualified for the debate but ended her campaign last week. She had been the only candidate of color in the lineup. Now that distinction falls to Mr. Yang, who is Asian-American.
"I am proud to be the only person of color who's going to be on that stage," Mr. Yang told supporters in Des Moines on Tuesday.
Other candidates still have two days to qualify -- the deadline is 11:59 p.m. on Thursday -- but the lineup is unlikely to change. The only candidate within striking distance, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, has three qualifying polls and the requisite 200,000 donors, but she said on Monday that she would not participate in the debate even if she made the cut.
"I instead choose to spend that precious time directly meeting with and hearing from the people of New Hampshire and South Carolina," Ms. Gabbard tweeted. She has clashed with the Democratic Party's leadership and criticized the debate qualification criteria, and previously raised the possibility of boycotting a debate in October before deciding to participate.
Nobody else is close to qualifying. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and the former housing secretary Julián Castro have met the donor threshold but have no qualifying polls. They each had 1 percent support in the Quinnipiac poll. In a national Monmouth University poll released earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Booker had 2 percent support and Mr. Castro had 1 percent.
In terms of the overall contours of the race, the polls showed little change. Mr. Biden retained a clear lead, with Mr. Sanders in second place, Ms. Warren in third and Mr. Buttigieg in fourth. (In the Quinnipiac poll, the difference between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren was within the margin of error.)
Notably, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who entered the race less than three weeks ago, had 5 percent support in both polls. Mr. Bloomberg has already spent tens of millions of dollars of his own money on advertising and has not been seeking donors, a decision that will exclude him from debates regardless of his poll numbers unless the D.N.C. drops its donor requirement.
Also working against Mr. Bloomberg: Voters who know of him tend not to like him. In both polls released Tuesday, he had the worst favorability to unfavorability ratio of any Democratic candidate for whom that question was asked.

Who's afraid of McKinsey - Co.?

Texto completo: Now that Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has received permission from McKinsey - Co. to disclose details of his work at the big consulting firm, it seems likely that the 'questions' (veiled accusations) about his job there will die down. Buttigieg, now the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., worked at McKinsey from 2007 to 2010, when he was in his late 20s; he would have been a very junior consultant doing grunt work for the people who had actual authority over the company's recommendations to clients. It only sounded interesting because the nondisclosure agreement he signed upon leaving conferred an entirely undeserved air of mystery.
Why did this become such a problem for Buttigieg that he had to beg McKinsey to break its normally ironclad customer confidentiality? Look no further than a question tweeted last week by Graeme Wood of the Atlantic: 'why, when you are a Rhodes Scholar and all-around privileged smartypants who can do ANYTHING, would you opt to work as a management consultant?'
You can sort of understand why people go into investment banking, that other default choice of America's educational elite: If you can hang on for a few years, you will be paid large multiples of any conceivable social value you create. But consultants aren't nearly as lavishly overpaid. Why do so many people with elite degrees make their living telling other people how to run their businesses, rather than, say, just cutting out the middleman and running a business?
As it happens, I have an answer for that. In 2001, on the verge of completing an MBA, I accepted a job with a boutique strategy consulting firm. I never actually started work " the dot-com bubble collapsed, and they started laying off instead of bringing on new hires " but I remember well why I wanted to work there so badly.
For one thing, the hiring process soothingly replicates the process of admission to an elite school. You slide down a well-greased chute from informational mixers to on-campus interviews, through second- and third-round interviews, and smoothly to a job offer, sometimes more than one. After a brief period of agonizing, you choose a firm " generally the highest-status destination, for they have a known hierarchy, as colleges do. And just like that, your future is settled for the next few years, without the arduous labor of figuring out what industry you'd like to work in and finding a company that will hire you.
Nor are you going to be asked to run a call center, as a friend who went into a management training program was. You'll spend most of your time around other people just like you, doing pleasant and at least moderately interesting work. After a few years of that, you can pick a likely industry and slip into a middle-management position on the strength of your résumé, without the tedium of learning a business from the ground up.
In other words, these jobs are custom-designed for maximal appeal to the upper-middlebrow conformists who excel at navigating elite education. I suspect that Buttigieg's consulting experience stirred up so much antagonism because he and McKinsey were standing in for that whole class of people whose lives revolve not around any particular competency but simply around 'being smart' " with 'smart' defined as having leaped a certain number of educational hurdles in the prescribed manner, after which you earn the right to tell everyone else their business.
New York Times columnist Ross Douthat identifies this as a weariness with experts who don't deliver, but I think this slightly misses the mark. For one thing, for all the flak they take, consultants actually do often deliver for their clients, just not necessarily what critics want them to.
I think of a consultant friend who assisted with a complex analysis for a commodity producer. The analysis calculated that the client's best return on investment came from lobbying the government " which was probably correct but arguably immoral.
More prosaically, there are the consultants so often called in when something is badly wrong. Often management understands how to fix the problem but needs an 'objective' outside voice to say aloud what everyone already kinda knows but would stir fierce internal resistance, such as 'shut down this badly underutilized facility.'
The problem isn't necessarily that these self-appointed experts are wrong; often they're right about something we'd rather not hear. And one can understand why the more rooted and less high-flying resent hearing it from the very folks who refuse to make the binding commitments to one place or one business that might leave them vulnerable to exactly the kind of economic disruption they're paid to deliver.

Lori Loughlin spends holidays prepping for next big role: Testifying at her own trial

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

Hating the word 'hate'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - When people ask me about my work or comment on it, there is one word that always makes me bristle.
"Hate."
When I wrote about George W. Bush relying on souped-up intelligence to invade Iraq, people would ask, "Why do you hate W.?"
When I wrote about how Barack Obama was hampered as president by his disdain for politicking, people would ask, "Why do you hate Obama?"
When I wrote about Hillary Clinton's flaws as a candidate, people would ask, "Why do you hate Hillary?"
I hid my irritation by making a joke: "I don't hate politicians. I save strong emotions like that for my ex-boyfriends."
But I've thought about the word "hate" a lot. Not, as Nancy Pelosi said, in relation to being Catholic. But in relation to being a woman.
The reason it upset me was that it seemed like a way to undercut legitimate concerns I had about the behavior of a president or would-be president by suggesting that strong emotions were clouding my judgment. It's not that they are doing something wrong; it's that you are an overwrought female.
It evoked the old trope that women are vengeful and hysterical - a word derived from the Greek word for womb.
So I understood why reporter James Rosen got under the speaker's skin when he asked if her declaration that the House would draw up impeachment articles was inspired by the irrational rather than the rational.
She wore white but she saw red.
When Rosen asked, "Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker?" Pelosi wagged her finger and retorted, "I don't hate anybody."
With more to say, she strode back to the microphones: "As a Catholic, I resent your using the word hate' in a sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president." Before walking off, she delivered the coup de grâce to a chastened Rosen: "So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that."
Within the hour, the president had predictably tweet-trashed her, saying she had "a nervous fit," returning to the threadbare canard of women as hysterics. He said he did not believe that Pelosi prayed for him.
But she does. I talked to her about it in August, when she was still keeping impeachment at bay, after we visited the chapel at Trinity Washington University, where she went to college.
She said that she prays for the president at night in her apartment in Georgetown and in church on Sunday. "The prayer," she said, "is that God will open his heart to meet the needs of the American people."
She said that she even complained to her pastor that her prayers were not working.
"Maybe you're not praying hard enough," the priest replied.
The last week was a tale of three tantrums: one justified, one unjustified and one just what we expect.
Pelosi's upbraiding was effective because it wasn't someone whining or feeling sorry for herself. It was someone laying down the law - without worrying that a man would label her a virago or harridan or termagant. Nervous Nancy? Hardly. She was more like John Wayne, minus the racism and colonialism.
In Iowa, meanwhile, surly Joe Biden erupted at an 83-year-old retired farmer who brought up Hunter Biden's nepotistic payday from a Ukrainian energy company. The farmer had his facts twisted, mistakenly claiming that Biden had "sent" his son to work in Ukraine to sell "access" to the president.
Biden's friend John McCain had a blazing temper, but he set the template for how to handle an older Midwestern voter who has the facts bollixed up - firmly but politely.
Biden's outburst - "You're a damn liar, man," he snapped - showed that he still thinks any questions about his son's windfalls while he was vice president are out of line - even though Hunter Biden himself has acknowledged using "poor judgment."
It also showed that he has no answer for something that's bound to be a big part of the general campaign, since it is at the heart of the crazy Rudy-Donny conspiracy theory that provoked the impeachment drive. If Biden can't handle an 83-year-old retired farmer without losing his cool, how can he handle a 73-year-old piranha?
Withholding $400 million in military aid to a fledging democracy under attack from Russia is in a different universe than making a quick buck off the Washington influence machine. But that farmer is not the only voter who feels a little queasy about Biden not stopping his son from making a money grab in Ukraine while the vice president was pushing the Ukrainians to be less corrupt.
Trump's trans-Atlantic pout after learning that the other world leaders were caught on tape mocking him as prolix was typical but still pathetic.
He brings to mind the paradox of Cassandra. Her gift was that she could see into the future, but her curse was that no one believed her. Trump's triumph is that he has sought attention his whole life, and now he can command all the attention in the world. But his curse is that the attention he attracts is largely ridicule and repulsion.
Fortunately for the president, one person in Washington is praying for him.
Maureen Dowd writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Gov. DeSantis is wrong. Impeachment inquiry not 'typical Washington stuff' Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: On the day that the House Intelligence Committee accused Donald Trump of conduct befitting a dictator, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis gushed over the money the president would haul in at the Republican Party of Florida's annual "statesman's dinner" Saturday night.
"I think it's going to raise way, way more than they've been able to do on this in the most recent years," DeSantis said. The event, closed to the media, reportedly raised a record $3.5 million.
DeSantis wasn't disappointed. But every Floridian who truly honors America should be.
The president used the event to trot out two soldiers accused of war crimes whom he pardoned over the Pentagon's objections. The safety of our uniformed men and women depends on respecting the laws of war. Taking photos with the head of a dead ISIS fighter damages America's moral standing. And for a president to disparage military leaders who expect better undermines our professional armed forces.
DeSantis could not have foreseen that aspect of the event, but his anticipatory enthusiasm was grossly misplaced.
Like virtually all of his Republican colleagues, the governor sounds heedless of what's at stake in the impeachment inquiry.
"My sense, just talking to people, is I think the public generally views it as typical Washington stuff," he said.
If he is right, then the great American experiment is over, 222 years after Benjamin Franklin, asked what the Constitutional Convention had produced, replied: "A republic, Madam, if you can keep it."
We don't agree with the governor's analysis of public opinion. Neither does the public. A New York Times op-ed Thursday reported on an exhaustive national study of more than 110,000 people since July. The conclusion:
"Most people would give up their preferred outcomes on health care, the environment or taxes if it meant getting what they want on impeachment. It is an important issue for almost everyone."
For most Democrats, that means impeaching the president. For most Republicans, it means ignoring or excusing his conduct. But for everyone, it clearly means that what's going on is anything but "typical Washington stuff."
What the Intelligence Committee charged against Trump has no precedents, even in the Watergate scandal that led President Richard Nixon to resign in the face of certain impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate.
It is not "typical Washington stuff" to withhold a White House meeting and desperately needed military aid to persuade a country's president to help our president against his perceived political rival. That's extortion - a grotesque misuse of our nation's highest office.
It's not "typical Washington stuff" for a president to stonewall every legitimate congressional request for witnesses and documents bearing on the investigation. That's obstruction of justice, the core issue that took Nixon down.
It's not "typical Washington stuff" for a president to slander career public servants for their inconvenient testimony to Congressional committees. That's called witness intimidation.
It's not "typical Washington stuff" for a president to invite foreign interference in our elections, which Trump has now done at least twice.
It's not "typical Washington stuff" for a president to demand personal loyalty from the director of the FBI, let alone to fire him after he refuses.
It's not "typical Washington stuff" for a president to try on at least 10 occasions - as Robert Mueller, the special counsel, found - to thwart investigation of a hostile nation's massive subversion of our election. Trump's attempt to enlist Ukraine into committing dirty tricks against Joe Biden reveals that the 45th president finds nothing illegal or immoral about foreign meddling in U.S. elections.
If all that isn't impeachable, nothing is impeachable. And there is nothing to keep this president - and his successors - from assuming dictatorial powers.
In formally instructing three House committees Thursday to proceed with impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked American history to illustrate the danger that Trump's conduct poses to our democracy.
The Founders, she said, "having just fought a war of independence ... specifically feared the prospect of a king-president corrupted by foreign influence ... and if we allow a president to be above the law, we do so sadly at the peril of our republic. In America, no one is above the law."
The people who flocked to Saturday's dinner to flatter Trump and pad the pockets of the Florida GOP are not fools. They know what Trump is and what danger he represents. But they have made the calculation that nothing matters but their personal interests, as in tax cuts, right-wing judges, and hostility to the Democratic Party and the entire social contract.
Pelosi succinctly defined what's at stake.
"His wrongdoing strikes at the very heart of our Constitution."

SALE PENDING HISTORIC GRANITE BUILDING COULD SOON BE CHANGING HANDS

Texto completo: Fourteen years after buying an ornate 19th-century Downtown building with hopes of converting it into condominiums or a hotel, Holly Brubach could be on the verge of selling the property to someone with a similar vision.
After fielding about seven offers for the historic Granite Building, situated at the corner of Wood Street and Sixth Avenue, Ms. Brubach said she hopes to select a buyer within the next week, with plans to finalize the sale by the end of March.
"It's really a question of evaluating the offers we got, comparing the terms, and figuring out who is in a position to close," she said.
Ms. Brubach, a former New York Times style editor, put the slender but elegant real estate - designed in the same Richardsonian Romanesque style as the Allegheny County Courthouse - up for sale last summer after failing in her bids to turn the building into either condos or a boutique hotel.
Located next to the tony Duquesne Club, the nine-story structure attracted a mix of local and out-of-town suitors.
The two primary reuses expressed by potential buyers involved either condos or a hotel, she said. Others suggested office space or did not commit to any particular plan.
"I feel good about the interest it attracted," she said.
John Jackson, the Cushman&Wakefield/Grant Street Associates senior vice president handling the sale, said in August that the property had attracted potential buyers from as far away as New York and Vancouver, Canada, with residential, hospitality and office uses all on the table.
Mr. Jackson could not be reached for comment Monday.
Ms. Brubach purchased the Granite Building, built in 1889-90 to house the German National Bank and to serve immigrants, in December 2005 for $925,000.
She had hoped to leave her mark on her hometown by converting it into condominiums during the first wave of residential building in Downtown.
But after the recession hit and two buyers backed out, Ms. Brubach dropped the condo plan in favor of a 104-room boutique hotel with three bars and a brasserie-style restaurant.
She ended up abandoning that $38 million project after failing to convince banks to finance it during a hotel-building boom in Downtown. In both cases, she poured some of her own money into the endeavors.
Ms. Brubach said some of the offers for the Granite Building include plans to reuse an adjacent structure, which also is for sale.
One developer also has talked to her about possibly partnering on a project. That does not appear to be in the cards at this point. "That's not my objective," she said. "My objective at this point is really to sell."
Ms. Brubach declined to discuss the prices being offered for the property.
"Do I wish that there was twice as much money in it? Of course I do," she said. "The people who have made offers I would say for the most part are experienced developers, and I think they know what they're doing."

Trump to rally in battleground Pennsylvania after Democrats unveil impeachment articles

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump will head to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to make a pitch to one of the most critical states on his 2020 itinerary hours after Democrats formally make their case against him with articles of impeachment.
Returning to a battleground after months of campaigning this fall for other candidates in Republican strongholds, the president will take the stage in a deeply conservative corner of the Keystone State, where polls show Democrats enjoy a thin advantage overall.
Noting that polls have been largely frozen for weeks as Democrats probed Trump's interactions with Ukraine, political analysts said Trump is likely to use the latest development to fire up supporters and frame impeachment as overzealous partisanship.
"Trump is going to use this politically far more than the Democrats," predicted Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, who said the timing of the rally creates an opportunity for him.
"Trump is going to use it because it’s important to motivate his base," he said.
Democrats are upping the ante in the impeachment drive at the same time Trump is returning to presidential battleground states after months of rallying in GOP strongholds like Louisiana, Kentucky and Mississippi for candidates in competitive governors races.
After the Pennsylvania rally, at which he'll be joined by Vice President Mike Pence, Trump travels to Michigan, his first visit to that swing state in nine months. He rallied in Florida, another critically important state, just before Thanksgiving.
Those three states – all of which Trump flipped from blue to red in 2016 – will be central to the president's reelection effort, along with Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona.
Democrats plan to announce the articles in a morning news conference, a senior Democratic aide told USA TODAY on Monday. The aide would not detail what the specific articles contain, only that there are "less than five" articles in total.
The articles are expected to revolve around Trump requesting Ukraine to investigate matters that would help him politically, including the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden, a top 2020 rival.
Trump will take the stage at 7 p. m. ET in a rally that will be closely watched for how he characterizes the latest move by Democrats.
Trump country vs. suburbs
Trump lost the battleground Philadelphia suburbs in 2016 but nevertheless carried Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes, racking up huge margins in rural and central parts of the state and converting western areas that were once Democratic strongholds. By rallying in Hershey, Trump appears to be trying to recapture some of that same strategy.
Whether the impeachment will help or hurt remains be to seen.
Home to the nation's best known chocolate maker, Hershey sits in a county that narrowly went for Hillary Clinton in 2016 but is politically more in tune with nearby Lebanon County, which backed Trump by a better than two-to-one margin.
In other words, Trump will be in friendly territory – one of the first places he returned to for a victory rally after winning the election three years ago.
Just like in 2016, Trump's rally on Tuesday will take place in the 10,500-seat Giant Center.
More: ‘It's a disgrace, it's a hoax’: Trump says of impeachment hearings
The rally will also mark one of the first opportunities for Trump to pounce on a report from the Justice Department's inspector general that members of both parties are using to frame the origins of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The report found the controversial surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser was riddled with errors but also said the FBI was justified in launching its inquiry into Russia’s interference.
Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump said the nearly 500-page report demonstrated an "attempted overthrow" of the government.
The campaign touted Pennsylvania's economy and vowed to be organized in the Keystone State "in a way that no campaign has ever been before. "
"Pennsylvania voters know that President Trump's policies are fueling the strong and still-growing economy and bringing back jobs, including in the manufacturing sector," campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh told USA TODAY.
High stakes rallies
Even before Democrats said they would unveil the impeachment articles, the Pennsylvania rally would have been closely watched.
Trump trailed Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders by single digits in a Muhlenberg College/Morning Call poll last month. That poll put Trump underwater with 56% of Pennsylvania voters saying they disapprove of his presidency – slightly worse than than the RealClearPolitics national average.
The president fared better in a New York Times/Siena College poll taken in October, besting Warren and Sanders and trailing Biden within the margin of error.
A week later, Trump will hold a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, a state he won by less than 11,000 votes. His campaign described it as a "Merry Christmas rally," though it could come just as House Democrats are voting to impeach him and as Congress scrambles to avoid a government shutdown by week's end.
And just before heading to his Mar-a-Lago resort for Thanksgiving, Trump held a 90-minute rally in Sunrise, about 50 miles southwest of Palm Beach.
By comparison, Trump spent much of the fall campaigning in off-cycle elections in states where he has significant support. Trump's past six rallies – three in Louisiana and one each in Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas – were in states he won with wide margins.
Those efforts had mixed results. Gov. John Bel Edwards, the Democratic incumbent in Louisiana, held on to his seat in an election last month despite an aggressive challenge from Republican Eddie Rispone. Weeks earlier, in Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear upset Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. Both races have been touted by Democrats as a sign that their party is more energized heading into the 2020 presidential election.
"The Louisiana governor's race was the demarcation point," said GOP consultant John Brabender, noting Trump held three rallies there in an unsuccessful effort to unseat the Democratic incumbent this fall. "They are now fully committed to the 2020 election. "
Brabender, a longtime political guru to former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, speculated that the Trump campaign will likely take a different approach and message to the Philadelphia suburbs, which have become increasingly more blue with time.
"You can't ignore the southeast, but a Trump rally is not necessarily the ideal mechanism for doing that," Brabender said.
Trump also campaigned last fall in Mississippi, a GOP stronghold where Republican Tate Reeves beat Democrat Jim Hood for governor on Nov. 5.
Trump rallied in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin once each this year. He held rallies in Florida three times, including one last last month. He also held rallies in several Clinton-won states that Republicans hope will be winnable in 2020, including Minnesota, New Mexico and New Hampshire.
"It's seemingly impossible for him to win reelection if he loses three of the four," Madonna said. "He needs these white, working class voters in these old mining and mill towns in my state and Michigan and Wisconsin, in particular. "

Texto completo: Uncouth he may be, but he's not unfamiliar.
Like more than a few Americans, I used to read President Donald Trump's tweets with trepidation. No modern president had ever expressed himself publicly in this manner, and the universal reaction seemed to be a mixture of horror and consternation.
Now I find that the tweets I see tend to make me laugh rather than wince. Unlike his stately predecessor's feed, which read as if drafted by a lucky intern, Mr. Trump's tweets could not possibly have been composed by anyone but Mr. Trump himself, or by someone with a good ear for Trumpspeak. Best of all, the fury and indignation they inspire are very nearly as entertaining as their memorable content. Like the old New Yorker cartoons of plutocrats listening in silent rage to F.D.R. on the radio, or inviting their friends to join them at "the Trans-Lux to hiss Roosevelt," Mr. Trump seems to have the chattering -- or in this case, sputtering -- classes where he wants them.
Moreover, the president has a genuine gift for this sort of thing. Even his famous nicknames -- "Crooked Hillary" Clinton, "Sleepy Joe" Biden, Stormy "Horseface" Daniels -- while occasionally puerile and sometimes cruel, deftly capture something essential in their subjects. And the fact that Mr. Trump takes such evident pleasure in the torment, and his critics respond like Pavlov's dogs, seems to fortify the bond between Mr. Trump and his enthusiasts. When Franklin Roosevelt exclaimed that his political enemies were "unanimous in their hate for me, and I welcome their hatred," admirers swooned. Mr. Trump's admirers are equally enchanted when he declares that Representative Adam "Pencil-Neck" Schiff's impeachment proceedings are "illegal, invalid and unconstitutional."
What's the difference? Less than you might think.
There is no question, of course, that Mr. Trump is a dramatically unconventional commander in chief. He is not our first divorced president (Ronald Reagan) nor the first to have been harried by allegations of a sex scandal (Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, et al.). He is a "reality-TV star" just as Reagan was a "B-movie actor" and Harry Truman a "failed haberdasher." Still, he is the only president to have arrived in the White House without experience of public service or political office -- the last comparable major-party nominee was Wendell Willkie (1940) -- and his manner is a striking departure from one English journalist's rule that the public prefers its politicians to resemble either clergymen or undertakers.
None of this is altogether a bad thing. The increasingly monarchical trappings of the presidency are some distance from the founders' ideal of republican simplicity. We might wish, at times, that Mr. Trump were a little less juvenile, or insensitive, or hypersensitive; but we might also wish that every president achieves perfection. Even the tweets are more likely to be remembered as mastery of new technology -- akin to F.D.R.'s "fireside chats" -- than the outrage and embarrassment journalists deplore.
Indeed, one of the intriguing things about Mr. Trump is that, in certain significant ways, many of his attitudes and actions are reliably conventional. He wavers between American exceptionalism (Make America Great Again) and skeptical realism ("You think our country's so innocent?"). Like Calvin Coolidge, he believes that "the business of America is business," in the sense that a healthy market economy is the guarantor of inclusive prosperity. He presides at ceremonial occasions -- memorials, commemorative rituals, official receptions -- with a measure of solemnity and switches gears for the lighthearted trappings of office. (See his pardon last month of a Thanksgiving turkey.)
His instincts in domestic and foreign affairs are identifiably conservative, with certain exceptions. It's not difficult to imagine a President Jeb Bush appointing Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, or a President Marco Rubio recruiting Elliott Abrams for duty on Venezuela. In his suspicion of foreign entanglements Mr. Trump is more like a Taft than an Eisenhower Republican -- or more like George Washington, for that matter. His weakness for protectionism, while regrettable in my view, harkens back to an older G.O.P. orthodoxy and, in any case, is consistent with his pledge to speak for industrial workers left behind by decades of free-trade agreements. His approach to reform and refreshment of the Atlantic alliance, while bumptious at times, is a louder, more insistent and, not least, more successful version of what policymakers of both parties have been whispering for years.
It's useful, as well, to consider Mr. Trump's opprobrium -- as racist, proto-fascist and aspiring dictator -- in light of the history of partisan rhetoric. It's essentially forgotten now, but the standard enlightened view of Reagan in the Oval Office was as an "amiable dunce" (in Clark Clifford's memorable phrase) and frontman for a handful of sinister Los Angeles millionaires, whose presidential passion was provoking nuclear war with the Soviet Union. George W. Bush was once considered vulnerable to impeachment for his habit of issuing lengthy "signing statements" when rendering a bill into law. When Franklin Roosevelt ran for re-election in 1936 his most vehement opponent was not the Republican nominee Alf Landon but Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic nominee who considered parts of the New Deal to be as dangerous as Bolshevism and antithetical to his party's historic values.
Nor is Mr. Trump's turbulent personality unprecedented. His impulsiveness is very nearly as habitual as Theodore Roosevelt's, who was never happier than when picking fights with adversaries great (J. Pierpont Morgan) and small (sentimental author-naturalists he called "nature fakers") and whose disappointment with his handpicked successor, William Howard Taft, prompted him to split his party, run for a third term on a third-party ticket and deliver the presidency to Woodrow Wilson.
Mr. Trump's affinity for Andrew Jackson is based on Jackson's status as our first populist chief executive. But their ways of doing business are equally indistinguishable. Jackson's determination to destroy the Bank of the United States prompted him to fire his first two Treasury secretaries. He presided over a contentious and ever-changing cabinet, and once lamented that his twin regrets in life were that he had not shot Senator Henry Clay or hanged his own vice president, John C. Calhoun. He was also the only president to have been censured by the Senate, dismissing it as "unauthorized, unprecedented, unconstitutional conduct."
While unique in his way, Mr. Trump is not a president like no other, nor a threat to democracy or the constitutional order. He has roots in the American civic tradition, which is considerably more complex, and more fractious in tone, than we care to remember. He's a politician with a thin skin and a fondness for the limelight and the music of his own voice -- sound familiar? -- and his political success drives his political adversaries to political apoplexy. That, too, sounds familiar.

HBO Is Keeping ‘Succession’ Creator Jesse Armstrong Around With a Big New Deal

Texto completo: Under AT&T, the re-titled WarnerMedia division is growing upwards and outwards. The entertainment company is launching its own standalone streaming service, HBO Max, which is being positioned as an integral component of the conglomerate’s future. To differentiate the platform from the plethora of streaming services on the market, WarnerMedia is using premium cable network HBO as the foundational building block. To that end, WarnerMedia has added an additional $500 million to HBO’s budget and is pushing to ramp up original development by as much as 50 percent. In order to meet those lofty goals, the network will need to further incubate top-tier creative talent to deliver stories worthy of the brand.
Succession , a tragicomic skewering of the 1 percent through the squabbling and jockeying of the Murdoch-adjacent Roy family, emerged as HBO’s best series in its sophomore season. It landed on numerous lists of 2019’s best TV shows, including those from Vulture , Rotten Tomatoes, The Atlantic , The New York Times and The Ringer, among other notable outlets. Now, HBO is looking to capitalize on the momentum by locking down creator Jesse Armstrong to a new three-year overall deal, TheWrap reports.

The Emmy-winning writer will continue as Succession ‘s showrunner while also creating and developing new projects for HBO, per the outlet. Financial details of the deal have not been made public, but HBO does not typically hand out market-setting deals. Still, Armstrong is a good name to keep in-house as HBO develops a handful of hopeful replacements for Game of Thrones. Succession may not be a ratings juggernaut in the same vein as the flagship fantasy series, but it is a conversation-generating force among TV fans that lives up to HBO’s reputation as a curator of quality.
Armstrong is also the co-creator and writer of U.K. comedy Peep Show , co-writer of the dramedy Fresh Meat and has earned credits on HBO’s Veep and Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror (“The Entire History of You”). WarnerMedia is hungry for new ideas that can help it grow. Locking in Armstrong to HBO is a sound step in support of that mission.

Someone Ate A $120,000 Banana That An Artist Had Taped To A Wall In Miami

Texto completo: MIAMI - In plain sight of art aficionados and influencers, a prankster removed a $120,000 banana from an Art Basel exhibition in Miami Beach, Florida, on Saturday, peeled it and then ate it.
It happened on the second-to-last day of the art show, where much fuss and head scratching this week has been over a solitary banana - an overripe one - duct-taped to a wall.
Three buyers paid between $120,000 and $150,000 for this week for limited-edition pieces featuring a single banana, created by artist Maurizio Cattelan and titled “Comedian.” Each came with a certificate of authenticity and replacement instructions, which perhaps should have included a disclaimer: for display only. The bananas were bought at a local grocery store. No instructions were given on what to do as the banana ages.
Shortly before 2 p.m. Saturday, a New York City-based performance artist, David Datuna, peeled the taped banana from the wall and devoured it, an Instagram video posted by Datuna showed.
He grinned and raised the half-eaten banana as if making a toast.
Another video posted on Twitter showed Datuna appearing to be escorted out of the Galerie Perrotin space as bemused and stupefied art patrons watched.
But a spokeswoman for Galerie Perrotin, which represents Cattelan, said in an interview Saturday that the gallery was not taking any action against Datuna.
“It’s all in good spirits,” the spokeswoman said. “Perrotin is not pressing any legal charges.”
Gallery officials replaced the banana with another one, saying that the artwork was not destroyed and that the banana was simply an “idea.”
3D-printed cocktails, a traffic jam sculpture made of hundreds of tons of sand and more celebrity sightings than a Kardashian Christmas party were all part of over-the-top festivities during the week in Miami, but it was a banana that stole the show.
On Friday night, art collector Wayne Boich hosted a lavish dinner at his home that included Dan Marino, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. The after-party crowd, including Floyd Mayweather, Hannah Bronfman, and Alesso, watched a performance by Wyclef Jean, who did a throwback to the Fugees with “Ready or Not,” and later brought dozens of girls onstage to dance with him before passing the mic to “Country Grammar” singer Nelly. Rapper 2 Chainz closed out the night.
Across town, rapper Travis Scott didn’t take the stage until 3:30 a.m. at a sold-out performance at 24-hour nightclub E11even. Scott stood on top of the DJ booth tossing dollar bills into the crowd and yelling at partygoers to put away their phones and enjoy the moment.
The city of Miami Beach commissioned a million-dollar traffic jam by artist Leandro Erlich. It took 330 tons of sand to construct 66 life-sized sculptures of cars and trucks stuck in an imaginary traffic jam on the oceanfront of popular Lincoln Road. The installation alludes to Florida’s fragile position in the large universal canvas, touching on climate crisis and rising sea levels.
The Shore Club South Beach also focused on global warming where a 36-foot-long floating ice sculpture inside the pool spelled out the words “HOW DARE YOU.” The piece, titled “Climate Meltdown” by artist Rubem Robierb, lasted approximately eight hours.
Photographer David Yarrow’s picture of real-life “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort sold for $200,000. The piece was signed by director Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.
Bulleit’s novel 3D-printed bar also drew a curious crowd, where guests watched a robotic arm disperse microscopic drops of liquid into drinks in a pre-set pattern. The whiskey maker has printed more than 7,800 cocktails since partnering with a robotics engineer.
On Saturday, G-Eazy performed poolside at the Maxim magazine party, surprising guests when he brought rapper Wale onstage to perform their song, “Fashion Week,” together.
Haute Living hosted a party for Fat Joe’s new album “Family Ties.” Wearing a baby blue track suit, the rapper entertained guests including DJ Khaled, Fabolous, Jeezy and Too Short.
“We grew up in the projects and now we in a 100 million dollar house rapping about our history,” he told the crowd before pulling Swizz Beatz onstage to perform.
At various clubs over the weekend, Lil Wayne, A$AP Rocky, Rick Ross and 2 Chainz performed. Sean Penn and DiCaprio partied late night at Rockwell x 1 Oak, where Gucci Mane took the stage. Brody Jenner, Meek Mill and Too Short hung out at LIV to hear Alesso play.
And “Cats” actor Idris Elba, who performs under the name DJ Big Driis, spun tracks along with Diplo at an extremely packed club Basement on Saturday night.

One mans battle

Texto completo: For nearly two decades, John Richards dedicated his life to protecting an endangered species: the correctly placed apostrophe.

As the founder of the Apostrophe Protection Society, he waged war against signs advertising "ladies fashions" or claiming that "Diamond's are forever." But last month, the 96-year-old admitted defeat.

"The ignorance and laziness present in modern times have won!" Richards wrote on the Apostrophe Protection Society's website. Given the lack of interest in correct apostrophe usage and his own advancing age, Richards recently announced that he is shutting down the group.

"When I first set it up I would get about 40 emails or letters a week from people all over the world," Richards told the BBC on Friday. "But then two years ago it started to tail off and nowadays I hardly get anything."

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Richards previously worked as a copy editor. For years, he was bedeviled by public messages that lacked necessary apostrophes or added gratuitous ones. In 2001, after retiring from his job at a newspaper in eastern England, he founded the Apostrophe Protection Society "with the specific aim of preserving the correct use of this currently much abused punctuation mark," as the group's website puts it.

To kick off his campaign, Richards created a form letter that could be customized and sent to offending businesses, alerting them to their misdeeds. "Dear Sir or Madam," it began. "Because there seems to be some doubt about the use of the apostrophe, we are taking the liberty of drawing your attention to an incorrect use."

Initially, the society counted just two members: Richards and his son, Stephen. The response to the form letters was lackluster, and one butcher summed up the prevailing ethos when he told the New York Times, "Sounds to me like this man wants a bleeding job." Richards told the paper that in its first few weeks of existence, the group claimed only one victory, which was getting a local library to correct its sign for "CD's."

But after the Daily Telegraph published an

article about his quixotic crusade, Richards developed a small but devoted following. Several hundred people signed up to join the Apostrophe Protection Society, he told the Times in 2001, and others sent letters of support or unsolicited donations of cash.

Many were waging their own ineffectual campaigns against grammatical atrocities, and one man even admitted to carrying around tape and printed-out apostrophes to correct signs on the fly. A seventh-grade English teacher in America who grew apoplectic at the sight of errors on billboards founded her own offshoot, the Apostrophe Protection Society of Southwest Montana.

"Why did the Apostrophe Protection Society not have a militant wing?" grammarian Lynne Truss wrote in her 2004 bestseller, "Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation." "Could I start one? Where do you get balaclavas?"

After achieving some mild level of celebrity -- he was once featured as "Mr. October" in a calendar that purported to celebrate the most boring men in Britain -- Richards began taking on larger targets. He unsuccessfully protested retailers like Harrods, Selfridges and Waterstones that dropped apostrophes from their names, as well as government bodies that followed suit.

In 2013, Richards and the Apostrophe Protection Society scored a major coup when the Mid Devon District Council reversed its decision to ban apostrophes from all street signs. The government body had claimed that GPS devices would melt down when confronted by the punctuation mark, an argument that Richards deemed "appalling."

"It set a bad example for local children who were being taught about apostrophes in local schools," he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

For the most part, though, officials tended to ignore the society's complaints, saying that they had more pressing matters to deal with than a missing apostrophe here or there. And experts in language and cognition concurred, pointing out that a misplaced apostrophe was unlikely to confuse anybody, and, in fact, apostrophes could likely be eliminated from written English altogether with no ill effect.

But for years, Richards remained dedicated to defending the humble punctuation mark's honor.

"People do tend to look on me as a little bit pedantic but I don't mind -- I think we need pedants," he told the Sunday Express in 2012. "The apostrophe is a vital piece of punctuation and grammar. To do without it would be confusing, as well as inelegant."

Though his days of lobbying on behalf of the apostrophe are over, Richards wrote last month that he plans to keep the society's website up "for reference and interest." In addition to a defunct message board and helpful guidelines about the correct use of apostrophes, it hosts a hall of fame of sorts, dedicated to some of the most egregious offenders. Over the years, fans have submitted examples such a cafe advertising "light bite's," a warehouse offering storage for "boat's" and "car's," and a restaurant selling "snow pea's."

And Richards told the BBC that he might once again return to campaigning, though this time for a different cause.

"The use of the comma is appalling," he said. "When I read some newspaper websites they just don't understand what it is used for."

Texto completo: There is much Nikki Haley could learn from a true heroine of the South Carolina Confederate flag removal: Bree Newsome Bass.
There was a moment in which people thought -- and many liberals feared -- that Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and former United States ambassador to the United Nations, would be the post-Donald Trump face of the Republican Party as a political candidate.
She was somewhat respected, had crafted an image of competence and seemed to have more of a moral center than many Republicans now toeing the line in support of Trump. Also, she would solve, or at least challenge, two of the issues that continue to dog Republicans: racism and misogyny. She is an Indian-American woman.
But, Haley burned all that to the ground when she engaged in an astounding bit of revisionist racial history about the Confederate battle flag and its relationship to Dylann Roof, the then 21-year-old white supremacist who in 2015 gunned down nine black worshipers in the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
In an interview for Glenn Beck's podcast, Haley said:
"Here is this guy that comes out with his manifesto, holding the Confederate flag and had just hijacked everything that people thought of. We don't have hateful people in South Carolina. There's always the small minority that's always going to be there, but people saw it as service and sacrifice and heritage. But once he did that, there was no way to overcome it."
This is such an astonishing statement for the very brazenness of its erasure of history and its bowing to a racist narrative. Any image of morality and unity Haley had cultivated vanished when those words left her lips.
Even the idea that Haley is a heroine of the taking down of the flag in South Carolina is a myth, like the idea that Roof suddenly altered the reality and meaning of the flag.
So, I reached out to Bree Newsome Bass, the young activist who scaled a flagpole in the wake of the shooting and removed the Confederate battle flag by hand. Bass is a true heroine of the flag's removal.
Bass quite correctly saw Haley's response "as part of the ongoing revisionist history that people continue to engage in around Confederate symbology."
The N.A.A.C.P. had been boycotting the state for 15 years, including under Haley's tenure as governor, before the state finally took it down. In 2011, Ben Jealous, then the N.A.A.C.P. president, issued this scathing assessment of Haley on the flag: "Perhaps one of the most perplexing examples of the contradictions of this moment in history is that Nikki Haley, South Carolina's first governor of color, continues to fly the Confederate flag in front of her state's Capitol."
Indeed, just eight months before Roof executed his horrific act of white-supremacist terror, she deflected from the issue of removing the flag in a gubernatorial debate, instead saying of the "sensitive issue" surrounding it, "We really kind of fixed all that when we elected the first Indian-American female governor."
Be clear, Haley: The Indian-American journey in this country is special and important, but that journey has absolutely nothing to do with adjusting or erasing the journey of enslaved Africans and their descendants in this country.
Haley used her status as a racial minority to shield her party's racial animus.
The people who want to recast this racist emblem of a flag as "Southern pride" are the white Republicans in the South that Haley had to court to win her seat. A CNN poll conducted in 2015 found that 75 percent of Southern whites describe the flag as a symbol of pride.
Let's be clear: The Confederate battle flag we know today is an emblem of oppression, white supremacy and the fight to maintain slavery. That is its heritage.
William T. Thompson wrote in an 1863 editorial about the "Stainless Banner," the second national flag of the Confederacy, "Our idea is simply to combine the present battle flag with a pure white standard sheet." He continued, "As a people, we are fighting to maintain the heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematic of our cause."
In South Carolina, the Confederate battle flag made a slow march to greater prominence as civil rights for black people were asserted or attained, beginning by being displayed in the State House in 1938 "after angry Southerners in Congress managed to defeat a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime" and reaching the top of the dome on the Capitol in 1962 "after President John F. Kennedy called on Congress to end poll taxes and literacy tests for voting and the Supreme Court struck down segregation in public transportation," as The New York Times wrote in 2015.
Whereas Roof's killings had shocked the state, and President Barack Obama's eulogy at the funeral of one of the slain had moved it, Bass's radical action had embarrassed it.
As she put it, when Roof displayed the Confederate flag, "He was coming in the tradition of that racism and that violence."
Bass makes a piercing point: The N.A.A.C.P. and the Ku Klux Klan "are in agreement about what the Confederate flag is." There is no true ambiguity.

Texto completo: Susan Spungen, multihyphenate cookie whiz, spent months conceiving and developing unique recipes for a special section.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
"Who is the Babe Ruth of cookies?"
This is the question Fred Bierman, The New York Times's design director for print news, posed to editors on the Food desk one day over the summer. They were planning a special print section of holiday cookie recipes that would be similar to a section of pies that was produced for Thanksgiving last year. Like the pie section, it would be printed on a continuous, four-foot piece of newsprint known as a pano-8.
The cookie-recipe developer had to be able to fill all that space with treats that were visually dazzling and delicious -- but also approachable so that readers would take the section to their kitchens and get baking. That meant finding an extraordinary cook, baker and writer with the sensibilities of a food stylist.
"It's like trying to find someone who can both write the novel and design the jacket," said Emily Weinstein, a deputy food editor at The Times.
Kim Gougenheim, the desk's photo editor, had a name in mind: Susan Spungen.
Ms. Spungen has developed recipes, published cookbooks, styled food for photo shoots and written about cooking and entertaining for decades, including for The Times and as the founding food editor of Martha Stewart Living. She has consulted on and styled food for movies including "Julia & Julia," "Eat, Pray, Love" and "Labor Day" (in which the script explicitly called for the "greatest pie-making scene in cinema history").
Ms. Spungen, Ms. Gougenheim and Ms. Weinstein determined, was the Babe Ruth of cookies.
When they pitched her on the idea of a supersized cookie section, she went for it. She created "Cookies for the Modern Era," as the project is titled and themed, incorporating flavors and concepts familiar to longtime holiday bakers while aiming beyond the traditional cookie plate. It runs in newspapers this weekend.
"We definitely wanted to offer things that felt familiar," Ms. Spungen said, "but not too familiar."
There are peppermint sugar cookies in candy-cane colors, adorned with white royal icing and painted with brush strokes of red, one of two designs inspired by the American abstract artist Ellsworth Kelly. There is a cakey, dirty chai earthquake cookie full of warm, evocative spices like cinnamon, ginger and cloves. And there are endlessly customizable Pocky-like sticks and a peanut shortbread topped with honeycomb candy and drizzled with chocolate and sea salt.
"They're all delicious," Ms. Weinstein said. "Truly, to me, that's the crazy part."
Ms. Spungen began creating the recipes in July. For her, that process began, as it always does, on paper, jotting ideas down as they came to mind.
"I just find the more I scribble, the more ideas I have," she said.
She refined those handwritten notes into a long pitch laying out something like two dozen ideas. It served as a point of discussion for a group brainstorming session, along with a Pinterest board.
From there, Ms. Spungen started baking, focusing methodically on one or two cookies at a time. In some cases, recipes turned out just right the first time. For those that didn't, she made tweaks one by one, as a scientist would, until she got the result she was looking for. The gingery brownie crinkle cookies, for example, took about 10 tries to perfect. As she worked, she sent pictures to Ms. Weinstein and Ms. Gougenheim, getting feedback, tweaking her concepts and editing down the list. For a time, developing these recipes took over the kitchen in Ms. Spungen's home in East Hampton, N.Y., dusting counters with flour and filling the air with the smells of brown sugar, vanilla and caramel.
"I worked almost exclusively on it from August until October," she said. "It's really quite a process of trial and error."
After all that, there was plenty of work left to do: The 12 recipes were edited, made by a tester working for The Times in a home kitchen, tweaked some more and edited again.
Recipes are "as rigorously executed and as reported" as other Times journalism, Ms. Weinstein said. "It's just sort of a different discipline."
Ms. Spungen said she used her range of experience to do it, from the first time she cooked as a child (using a New York Times recipe).
"Everything I've done prepared me for this," she said.

The weak case for impeachment and why it might backfire

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library. A sign next to the letter reads, “Despite the State Department’s many attempts to change it, the President finally demanded that his own personal draft be sent to Brezhnev accompanied by the State Department’s thoughts in a separate document.”
Imagine the news headlines that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s leaky crew could have made from that.
They certainly puffed up the importance of government workers who were never elected by anybody. “NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy,” the Intelligence Committee report states in a section titled, “The President’s Misconduct.” The talking points “included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” which was “a pillar of American foreign policy in the country” going all the way back to “the 1990s” but — cue the dramatic music — “this call would deviate significantly from that script.”
Of course, the president has a perfect right to deviate from the staff’s script and to make changes in the policy, but House Democrats, most of them, contend that Trump was motivated by the desire for personal political advantage.
Here’s what Trump said to the president of Ukraine: “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
And also, “I would like [Rudy Giuliani] to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
And also, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
In all three of those excerpts, Trump is asking Zelensky to work with the attorney general of the United States, William Barr. The AG is heading up an investigation into the suspicious origins of the Trump-Russia story that was used to justify a secret counter-intelligence investigation, then a secret warrant to spy on an American who was an adviser to the Trump campaign and then a two-year investigation by a special prosecutor that ultimately found nothing that linked Trump to Russia.
Barr’s investigation follows a narrower investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG has jurisdiction to investigate current employees of the government, but lacks wider authority. Still, Horowitz’s report is expected to shed light on the actions of FBI employees and others who made questionable decisions to investigate Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The report is set for release on Monday, Dec. 9.
Is it possible that the Democrats’ noisy rush to impeachment is a massive misdirection to neutralize the damage from coming reports about the actions of officials during the Obama administration?
We’ll see. Meanwhile, the signs of political damage are beginning to appear.
On Thursday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a one-hour televised town-hall meeting on CNN. Thirty-four minutes in, she was pleading with the audience, “Could we not have any more questions about impeachment?”
By November, that may be the Democrats’ campaign slogan.

Texto completo: Not many people think of the Ten Commandments these days, unless some group is trying to fight a legal battle to place them on public property.
Still, these laws of God, which may be familiar to some only through the Cecil B. De Mille classic film starring Charlton Heston as Moses, contain worthy guidelines that are applicable to today.
When considering the "wealth tax" proposed by presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the 10th Commandment is particularly relevant: "Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's."
One definition of "covet" is: "to desire wrongfully, inordinately, or without due regard for the rights of others: to covet another's property."
Warren, Sanders and others intent on soaking the rich might argue their proposals to massively increase government power and reach is not wrong, or inordinate, or without due regard for the rights of others, because they believe health care for all is a right. But at the heart of their health care and other plans they claim would be paid for by additional taxes on the wealthy and successful is a failure to understand basic economic principles.
One principle is that money is not a limited resource. If billionaires were depriving others of earning money then these politicians would have a credible argument, but the money pot is bottomless. There was a time when my income was so low that by today's standards, I would have been considered poor. But I graduated from college, started in journalism at entry level and worked my way up (or down, depending on your view of journalists).
A Survey Monkey poll for The New York Times shows that Sen. Warren's plan to tax wealthy individuals "continues to draw broad support from voters, across party, gender and educational lines." Sure, everyone likes "free stuff" until they realize that nothing is free and that someone must pay for it. Several analyses of Warren's plan say it is impossible to achieve without tax increases on the middle class. There simply isn't enough money that can be taken from earners to underwrite the left's multi-trillion-dollar spending plans.
Then there's the notion that government will run health care better than the private sector. All one has to do is look at the often inferior "care" offered by the Veterans Administration to see this as a bogus argument.
Perhaps the best line I have heard on the subject is from our 30th president. Calvin Coolidge: "Don't expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong."
Much of this is driven by our modern education system in which some professors teach theories of economics, along with envy, greed and entitlement, that are the opposite of what once was called the Puritan ethic, an ethic of personal responsibility and accountability with government as last resort. This belief helped build and sustain America through many economic and societal challenges.
Instead of celebrating and promoting the greatness of America, liberals and socialists spend their time denigrating the country and apologizing for its success. Instead of encouraging the poor and middle class to make decisions and adopt attitudes that will enhance their chances for success, they promote the belief that the rich and successful achieved by robbing others.
If America becomes a socialist nation it will be difficult to go back, even when the mistake is realized. The time to stop it is now, or more precisely with a decisive defeat of socialism in the next election.

Texto completo: Washington • When people ask me about my work or comment on it, there is one word that always makes me bristle.
“Hate.”
When I wrote about George W. Bush relying on souped-up intelligence to invade Iraq, people would ask, “Why do you hate W.?”
When I wrote about how Barack Obama was hampered as president by his disdain for politicking, people would ask, “Why do you hate Obama?”
When I wrote about Hillary Clinton’s flaws as a candidate, people would ask, “Why do you hate Hillary?”
I hid my irritation by making a joke: “I don’t hate politicians. I save strong emotions like that for my ex-boyfriends.”
But I’ve thought about the word “hate” a lot. Not, as Nancy Pelosi said, in relation to being Catholic. But in relation to being a woman.
The reason it upset me was that it seemed like a way to undercut legitimate concerns I had about the behavior of a president or would-be president by suggesting that strong emotions were clouding my judgment. It’s not that they are doing something wrong; it’s that you are an overwrought female.
It evoked the old trope that women are vengeful and hysterical — a word derived from the Greek word for womb. (This is the same sexist trope Donald Trump played into when he rebutted my criticisms of him during the 2016 campaign by tweeting that I was “wacky” and “neurotic.”)
So I understood why reporter James Rosen got under the speaker’s skin when he asked if her declaration that the House would draw up impeachment articles was inspired by the irrational rather than the rational.
She wore white but she saw red.
When Rosen asked, “Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker?” Pelosi wagged her finger and retorted, “I don’t hate anybody.”
With more to say, she strode back to the microphones: “As a Catholic, I resent your using the word ‘hate’ in a sentence that addresses me. I don’t hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president.” Before walking off, she delivered the coup de grâce to a chastened Rosen: “So don’t mess with me when it comes to words like that.”
Within the hour, the president had predictably tweet-trashed her, saying she had “a nervous fit,” returning to the threadbare canard of women as hysterics. He said he did not believe that Pelosi prayed for him.
But she does. I talked to her about it in August, when she was still keeping impeachment at bay, after we visited the chapel at Trinity Washington University, where she went to college.
She said that she prays for the president at night in her apartment in Georgetown and in church on Sunday. “The prayer,” she said, “is that God will open his heart to meet the needs of the American people.”
She said that she even complained to her pastor that her prayers were not working.
“Maybe you’re not praying hard enough,” the priest replied.
The last week was a tale of three tantrums: one justified, one unjustified and one just what we expect.
Pelosi’s upbraiding was effective because it wasn’t someone whining or feeling sorry for herself. It was someone laying down the law — without worrying that a man would label her a virago or harridan or termagant. Nervous Nancy? Hardly. She was more like John Wayne, minus the racism and colonialism.
In Iowa, meanwhile, surly Joe Biden erupted at an 83-year-old retired farmer who brought up Hunter Biden’s nepotistic payday from a Ukrainian energy company. The farmer had his facts twisted, mistakenly claiming that Biden had “sent” his son to work in Ukraine to sell “access” to the president.
Biden’s friend John McCain had a blazing temper, but he set the template for how to handle an older Midwestern voter who has the facts bollixed up — firmly but politely.
Biden’s outburst — “You’re a damn liar, man,” he snapped — showed that he still thinks any questions about his son’s windfalls while he was vice president are out of line — even though Hunter Biden himself has acknowledged using “poor judgment.”
It also showed that he has no answer for something that’s bound to be a big part of the general campaign, since it is at the heart of the crazy Rudy-Donny conspiracy theory that provoked the impeachment drive. If Biden can’t handle an 83-year-old retired farmer without losing his cool, how can he handle a 73-year-old piranha?
Withholding $400 million in military aid to a fledging democracy under attack from Russia is in a different universe than making a quick buck off the Washington influence machine. But that farmer is not the only voter who feels a little queasy about Biden not stopping his son from making a money grab in Ukraine while the vice president was pushing the Ukrainians to be less corrupt.
Trump’s trans-Atlantic pout after learning that the other world leaders were caught on tape mocking him as prolix was typical but still pathetic.
He brings to mind the paradox of Cassandra. Her gift was that she could see into the future, but her curse was that no one believed her. Trump’s triumph is that he has sought attention his whole life, and now he can command all the attention in the world. But his curse is that the attention he attracts is largely ridicule and repulsion.
Fortunately for the president, one person in Washington is praying for him.

Texto completo: MIAMI – La policía investiga este sábado si el saudí que mató a tres personas la víspera, en un tiroteo en una base militar de Florida donde recibía formación, actuó solo o contó con cómplices.
“Vamos a esclarecer esto”, afirmó el presidente Donald Trump, desde los jardines de la Casa Blanca. “Intentamos averiguar qué pasó, si se trata de una persona o de varias”.
The FBI has dedicated resources from both our Joint Terrorism Task Force and our criminal investigative programs to the NAS Pensacola shooting investigation. The shooter's motivaton is still being determined. pic.twitter.com/Miwjt5Yhk6
— FBI Jacksonville (@FBIJacksonville) December 7, 2019
Según el diario The New York Times, que cita a una fuente anónima, seis ciudadanos saudíes fueron interrogados en el lugar del ataque, entre ellos dos que habían lo filmado.
El periódico añade que el tirador había enseñado videos de tiroteos masivos durante una fiesta celebrada el jueves por la noche, según una fuente conocedora de la investigación.
“Los motivos del tirador todavía se desconocen”, indicó en Twitter la oficina de Jacksonville de la policía federal estadounidense (FBI), que investiga el caso junto con una unidad especializada en antiterrorismo.
Un miembro del Ejército del Aire saudí mató a tres personas e hirió a siete el viernes cuando abrió fuego con un arma corta en una sala de clase de la base de Pensacola, antes de que la policía lo abatiera.
Antes de su ataque había tuiteado mensajes hostiles hacia Estados Unidos, informó el grupo de vigilancia de movimientos yihadistas SITE.
“Estoy contra el mal, y Estados Unidos se convirtió en su conjunto en nación del mal”, escribió el asaltante, que SITE identificó como Mohamed al Shamrani.
Según medios estadounidenses, los investigadores tratan de comprobar si el autor del ataque publicó realmente aquellos mensajes, en los que se citaba al saudí Osama bin Laden, exdirigente del grupo yihadista Al Qaida muerto a manos de militares estadounidenses en 2011.
Quince de los 19 pilotos que desviaron aviones y provocaron la muerte de unas 3,000 personas en los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001 en Estados Unidos eran saudíes.
Tras condenar ese tiroteo “atroz”, Riad intentó el sábado distanciarse de su ciudadano.
“Como muchos miembros del Ejército saudita, he sido formado en una base militar estadounidense y nos hemos beneficiado de ese entrenamiento (…) para combatir el terrorismo y otras amenazas, junto a nuestro aliados estadounidenses”, afirmó el sábado en Twitter el viceministro de Defensa, el príncipe Jaled bin Salmán.
Trump, que habló por teléfono con el rey Salmán sobre lo ocurrido, afirmó este sábado que los dirigentes saudíes estaban “muy afectados” por los hechos de la víspera.
“Creo que [los saudíes] ayudarán mucho a las familias”, dijo el presidente estadounidense.
El gobernador de Florida Ron DeSantis sugirió el viernes que el reino saudí debería ofrecer una indemnización a las víctimas.
“Obviamente, el gobierno de Arabia Saudita necesita aliviar a estas víctimas. Y pienso que tendrán una deuda aquí puesto que [el atacante] es uno de sus ciudadanos”, dijo.

Pelosi may have doomed moderates

Texto completo: With her announcement that Democrats will move forward and vote on articles of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may have signed a political death warrant for dozens of moderate Democrats elected in Trump districts.
Pelosi is speaker today because in 2018 Democrats were able to convince voters in 31 House districts Trump carried two years before to defect and vote for them. Democrats need these voters to stay in their column in 2020 if they are to hold on to the House and win back the White House.
But in key swing states, large majorities of these 2018 defectors now say they plan to back Trump again in 2020. The New York Times reported that "nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 - but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 - say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals." The Times also reported that in 2018, voters in these states cast their ballots "for Democratic congressional candidates by an average of six points, all but identical to their actual winning margins." That means these freshman Democrats already face an uphill battle to hold on to their seats.
Now, Pelosi is adding to their woes by forcing them to vote to recommend the removal of a president whom voters in their districts say they plan to re-elect. Already, she forced them to vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, and all but two did so. But there is a world of difference between backing an impeachment inquiry and voting to impeach. Before the hearings began, swing-state voters said they supported the impeachment inquiry by a margin of 50% to 45%, but opposed impeaching and removing Trump by 53% to 43%. After weeks of wall-to-wall hearings, polls show that Democrats failed to move the needle in favor of impeachment and removal. Indeed, in Wisconsin, opposition to removal has nearly doubled. In other words, Democrats have failed to make their case.
By moving forward with impeachment anyway, Pelosi is putting her most vulnerable members in a terrible position. Split-ticket voting is already rare. The Washington Post reported in 2016 that that election "saw the highest percentage of STRAIGHT-ticket voters in more than a century." And according to FiveThirtyEight, split-ticket voting hit a new low in 2018. Impeachment makes it even less likely that swing-state voters will split their tickets. Are voters really going cast ballots to give Trump four more years and also to re-elect the Democratic House members who tried to take that decision out of their hands by impeaching him?
Voters in these Trump districts are already frustrated with their Democratic representatives. They won on promises to work with the president to address issues like health care, prescription drug prices, infrastructure and trade. None of that is getting done, thanks to Democrats' focus on impeachment. Indeed, there is speculation in the White House that the reason Pelosi has been slow-rolling the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement Trump negotiated is not out of reluctance to give Trump a win, but because she needs it as leverage with her moderate members to get their votes for impeachment. "She's using USMCA to get the impeachment vote," Trump has said.
Pelosi isn't stupid. She would not have announced a vote on articles of impeachment if she didn't believe she had the votes. But while she can strong-arm the moderates in her caucus, she can't strong-arm the voters in their districts. Her decision to move forward with impeachment means that many of those 31 Democrats seem destined to lose in November. Apparently, that is a price she is willing to pay to placate her party's virulent anti-Trump base.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will host a "Merry Christmas" rally at Kellogg Arena in Battle Creek later this month.
"Michigan is booming thanks to President Trump, and jobs are coming back to the state," Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a press release. "President Trump is delivering on his promises, and he looks forward to celebrating those successes with the great men and women of Michigan this Christmas season."
Chairman of the Calhoun County Republican Committee Jeannie Burchfield said the local Republican party was beyond thrilled" to have Trump visit.
"Calhoun County is Trump country, for sure..." she said. "This will be a fantastic way for us to show support for the president."
Burchfield said the news about the rally was particularly exciting after having Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump campaign, speak at the committee's annual dinner on Tuesday and seeing Vice President Mike Pence in Portage on Wednesday.
"This has been a crazy, wonderful week," she said.
Calhoun County Commissioner Jake Smith, a Democrat, said he hoped other presidential candidates would make Battle Creek a campaign stop.
"The Cereal City is where it's at, and I hope the Democratic candidate will come on through, too," he said. "I'm glad Battle Creek is getting the attention."
Despite the Trump administration's claim that Michigan's economy is booming, job growth has slowed considerably since the state's rebound from the Great Recession and has been essentially flat this year, said Charles Ballard, a Michigan State University economics professor and an expert on the state's economy.
That's true for the Upper Midwest, as a whole, according to the latest federal data, he said.
"It doesn't sound to me that our economy is booming," Ballard said. "I don't think we're in a recession, but we're kind of on the edge of a recession. The number of jobs is still well below what it was at its peak in 2000."
Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, less than 1% of the 4.8 million votes cast, but recent Sienna College / New York Times Upshot polls show him trailing Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders here in head-to-head matchups but ahead of Elizabeth Warren.
Trump has visited Michigan several times since the 2016 election, including a rally in December, 2016 in Walker and a visit to the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run in Ypsilanti in March of 2017. His last visit to the state was April 2018, when he held a rally in Macomb County's Washington Township.
The rally will be held at 7 p.m. on Dec. 18. Tickets are available online at www.donaldjtrump.com/events/battle-creek-mi-dec-christmas-rally. They will be given out on a first-come, first served basis and are limited to two per mobile phone number.

Texto completo: Asiye Abdulaheb said she had helped spread documents exposing China's detentions of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.
LONDON -- A Uighur woman living in the Netherlands said on Saturday that she helped publicize secret Chinese government documents that shed light on how Beijing runs mass detention camps holding Muslim ethnic minorities.
She recounted how she lived in fear after she and her former husband received death threats and were contacted by Chinese security officers while journalists were preparing to report on the documents.
Asiye Abdulaheb, 46, said in a telephone interview that she was involved in the release of 24 pages of documents published by Western news outlets last month, and was speaking out now to protect herself and her family from retaliation.
The documents, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and examined by journalists around the world, followed an earlier leak of 403 pages of internal papers to The New York Times that described how the authorities created, managed and justified the continuing crackdown on one million or more ethnic Uighurs and Kazakhs.
A Dutch newspaper, De Volkskrant, first reported on Ms. Abdulaheb's role in the dissemination of that second set of documents, based on interviews with her and her ex-husband, Jasur Abibula. Both are Dutch citizens who have lived in the Netherlands since 2009, and they have a 6-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son.
Ms. Abdulaheb said in an hourlong interview in Mandarin Chinese with The Times that she had decided to speak out in the hopes that the publicity would dissuade the Chinese authorities from seeking to harm her or her family.
She said they already knew she had the documents, and she had told Dutch police officers about her situation. She added that the danger of her situation became evident after her husband returned from a trip to Dubai in mid-September during which Chinese security officers told him about the documents, interrogated him about Ms. Abdulaheb and tried to recruit him to spy on her.
"I thought that this thing has to be made public," she said. "The Chinese police would definitely find us. The people in Dubai had told my ex-husband, 'We know about all your matters. We have a lot of people in the Netherlands."'
Ms. Abdulaheb said she had worked in government offices in Xinjiang, a vast northwestern region of China where the official crackdown on Muslims has taken place, but declined to go into detail.
In the interview Saturday, she confirmed that she received and helped leak the 24 pages, but she declined to explain who had sent her the documents. She said Chinese officers had told Mr. Abibula they wanted to find out who had passed her the material.
The Times was part of the group coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, an independent nonprofit based in Washington, that reported on the second set of leaked documents on Xinjiang.
Ms. Abdulaheb said someone electronically sent her the 24 pages of internal Chinese documents in June.
"When I got the documents and looked at them, I concluded this was very important," she said. "I thought the best thing to do was to put them out publicly."
After she posted a screenshot of one page of the documents on Twitter, hoping to draw attention, a German researcher on Xinjiang, Adrian Zenz, and another expert on the region reached out to her. They then put her in touch with a journalist, she said.
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists later partnered with 17 other organizations, including The Times, to publish revelations on internment camps based on the 24-page set of documents.
That article came a week after The Times published a report based on 403 leaked pages that shed light on the origins and expansion of the crackdown in Xinjiang. The Times report said the source of its documents was a member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity.
In a statement Saturday, the consortium declined to say whether Ms. Abdulaheb was the source for its report. "ICIJ does not comment on its sources," it said. It also reported that Mr. Zenz said Saturday that he did not give the documents to ICIJ.
The two exposés sharpened international debate over the Chinese government's intense crackdown across the region. Since 2017, the Chinese Communist Party has overseen a wave of mass detentions in Xinjiang, driving one million or more members of largely Muslim minority groups, especially Uighurs, into indoctrination camps intended to drastically weaken their Islamic beliefs and their attachment to the Uighur language, and make them loyal to the party.
Initially, Chinese officials brushed away questions and reports about the detentions. But late last year, Beijing shifted its response: The Chinese authorities have since acknowledged the existence of the program, but defended the camps as job-training centers that teach the Mandarin Chinese language and practical skills, and that also warn people of the dangers of religious extremism.
In past decades, tensions between largely Muslim ethnic minorities and China's Han ethnic majority in Xinjiang have occasionally erupted in violence. About half the region's population is made up of minority groups, including 11.7 million Uighurs and 1.6 million Kazakhs. Both groups' languages and cultures set them apart from Han people.
In 2009, the year Ms. Abdulaheb left China, ethnic rioting erupted in Urumqi, the regional capital of Xinjiang, and nearly 200 people were killed, most of them Han, according to government reports. China has cited that bloodshed and a succession of subsequent attacks on Han targets to defend its tough policies in Xinjiang.
The leaks have challenged the official Chinese position by revealing the coercive underpinnings of the camps, and by hinting at dissent within the Chinese political system over the harsh policies in Xinjiang. Chinese government spokesmen and official media outlets have denounced the reports, calling them "fake news" and claiming they were part of a conspiracy to undermine stability in the region.
In the Netherlands, Ms. Abdulaheb discovered that several of her social media accounts and a Hotmail account were hacked after she posted the tweet in June with the excerpt from the documents.
She said she also got a message written in Uighur on Facebook Messenger that said, "If you don't stop, you'll end up cut into pieces in the black trash can in front of your doorway."
"That made me scared," she said.
Then in early September, an old friend of her ex-husband, someone who worked in a court in Xinjiang, contacted him after a long period of silence, Ms. Abdulaheb said. The friend invited Mr. Abibula to Dubai and offered to pay his expenses. He flew to Dubai on Sept. 9 and was met by his friend and several Chinese security officers who were ethnic Han, she said.
After days of questioning Mr. Abibula, the officers handed him a USB stick and told him to put it into his ex-wife's laptop, which would give them access to the computer's contents, she said.
Ms. Abdulaheb's description of harassment and threats could not be independently verified. Still, her account fit a pattern that other Uighurs abroad have described. They have also recounted threats and pressure coming from China to remain silent or provide information to agents.
Despite such threats, growing numbers of Uighurs and Kazakhs have spoken out, often using Twitter and Facebook to publicize family members in Xinjiang who have disappeared, possibly into re-education camps or prisons. A Uighur-American woman in the Washington area, Rushan Abbas, told The Times about family members who had gone missing after she had spoken publicly about the camps.
In an interview Saturday, Mr. Zenz, the researcher, said that for Ms. Abdulaheb, "going public makes her safer" from potential retaliation.
"So if something happens to her now, it will become a new story," Mr. Zenz said. "Silence would have been so much worse."
Ms. Abdulaheb said she felt relieved to have revealed her identity.
"I have told everything," she said. "My mind is calm now."

Texto completo: If you're tired of running around in circles to find a Christmas gift for the dog lovers on your list, I know just the thing for you to fetch.
The charming softcover book "It's A Dog's Life: Tales from A Dog Named Max," by Max, with help from Nina Hershberger, is now available from Amazon.
For the sake of full disclosure, besides working at a farmers cooperative and writing this syndicated column, I have had a freelance business relationship with Hershberger (founder of MegaBucks Marketing) for the past decade.
For most of that time, Hershberger's adorable pet Schnauzer, Max, has written a widely circulated monthly blog showcasing his hopes, dreams, opinions ("Why is Big Pharma dragging its feet with that CHOCOLATE vaccine?") and (sometimes wildly exaggerated) misadventures. One of my assignments has been to act as a sounding board/coach/muse/editor for the precocious pooch. I've tried my best to translate his lofty canine thoughts into something comprehensible by mere homo sapiens.
Max is quick with a one-liner, but I have labored mightily to clean up his grammar. He's far less concerned with split infinitives than with "Here, let me split that ROADKILL with you."
I also enforce deadlines and shield Max from distractions. I'm proud to have had a small role in helping him keep his nose to the grindstone instead of to a Chihuahua's hindquarters.
Hershberger recently asked me to help select 52 of the best essays that she and Max have collaborated on, so she could self-publish them in book form to satisfy requests from his legion of fans.
So, there is now a convenient way to read dozens of punchy 500-word essays about Max at the North Pole, Max at Dollywood, Max at the Olympics, Max's love for Notre Dame's Fighting Irish, Max's status as the Indianapolis area's most eligible bachelor, Max's presidential aspirations ("Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what kind of MONSTER is impersonating a tree limb rubbing against the window. Woof! Woof! Woof!") and more.
To be sure, Max sometimes bumps up against the Recommended Daily Allowance of jokes about pooper-scoopers, kibble, toilet water and chasing cars; but he's so sincere with his desire to please. Even Mark Twain could get in a rut, although not necessarily one he wallowed out in the sofa.
Max hopes to make the New York Times "Best Smellers" list. Seeing fans line up for his first autograph session had him wagging his tail and purring – until the cultural appropriation activists picketed him. He got no credit for being an honor roll CSL (Cat as a Second Language) student
He is excited to have this shot at immortality, although his excitement was muted by the sudden realization that it would be immortality in dog years.
Acquaintances have asked me, "When are you going to write a book?" — so I must admit I'm envious of Max for beating me to the bookshelves. But at least Max's book is something you can sink your teeth into, whereas one by me would probably be something to bury in the back yard.
I've presented my case for Max's family-friendly volume. I won't beg (unless there's a Scooby Snack involved).
But I truly feel "It's A Dog's Life: Tales from A Dog Named Max," available from Amazon, deserves a "forever home" with you, a loved one or your local library.

Texto completo: Readers discuss how giant online stores like Amazon and rising rents have forced small entrepreneurs out of business.
To the Editor:
Re "Better, Cheaper and Faster Than Amazon" (Sunday Review, Nov. 24), in which Tim Wu laments the imminent closing of his neighborhood hardware store:
In 1987 my family and I moved into an older rental duplex near the center of Ridgewood, N.J. And, of course, there were many small "fixes" that needed to be done that involved hardware such as steam valves for the radiators, rubber washers for leaky faucets, etc.
Fortunately, Village Hardware was only a short walk away. The two-story store had myriad items stored on shelves or in bins and drawers. The owner, Cliff, was a walking encyclopedia of home repairs. All you needed to do was to describe your problem and he would know exactly what you needed and how to fix the problem.
Sadly, Home Depot had recently opened a town away, and it eventually forced the store to close. Every time I found myself traipsing up and down the endless aisles of Home Depot in search of a small item, I found myself wishing that a local hometown store like Village Hardware were still in business. Stores like that are a local treasure that are becoming harder and harder to find.

To the Editor:
Tim Wu tells yet another sad story about the demise of New York City's mom-and-pop stores, even though local stores can be cheaper and more efficient than ordering from Amazon. Rent gouging during lease renewal is a major reason so many small businesses are in crisis and closing in record numbers, resulting in the annual loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Small entrepreneurs are at the mercy of money-grubbing landlords and property speculators.
A fundamental change in American capitalism is not why thousands of New York City small businesses are shutting down. They are disappearing because the Real Estate Board of New York, for 33 years, has stymied passage of the Small Business Jobs Survival Act, which would provide small businesses rights to negotiate fair lease terms and an arbitration process to end rent gouging. Such legislation will lead to billions of dollars staying in the pockets of small businesses, their employees and the local economy.

To the Editor:
This is an all too familiar tale to us, the former owner of Radio Clinic, a now defunct appliance store on the Upper West Side, and the daughter who wrote a book that chronicled the store's 80-year history. As the rents started rising in the 1980s, continued to rise through the 1990s and escalated through the 2000s, the small family-owned businesses that have played a vital role in the fabric of communities have continued to close. We know exactly how it tears a neighborhood's fabric every time another longstanding business goes under.
Yet for decades the city never took action to protect small shop owners from runaway rents. Here we still are, with stores like Chelsea Convenience closing. The question is whether and when will the city take action on storefront rents before it's too late.

To the Editor:
Tim Wu's article on the demise of the local hardware store certainly speaks to my heart. Our local hardware store, Young Hardware in Staunton, Va., closed its doors several months ago. I have been mourning it like the death of a family member ever since. For three decades since I moved to town, Young's was my trusted and reliable neighbor, holding my life together with every nut and bolt.
The good news, I guess, was that it was Mr. Young's retirement, rather than the forces of big business, that led to its closure. I still don't know whether to congratulate him for retiring, or hate him for taking away a piece of my life.

To the Editor:
As a boomer, I mourn the loss of the local hardware store's parent, where almost nothing was prepackaged. Back in the 1960s, even casual D.I.Y.-ers bought nails by the pound, which they scooped up from thousands displayed openly in barrels -- yes, real barrels.

To the Editor:
Re "Retailers Strike Back Against Amazon, but Can They Weather Counterpunches?" (front page, Nov. 26):
I shop both ways: Amazon when I need something I'm not sure where else to find it, local when I know exactly what I want and where to find it, or I want to look at options or try on clothing. Sometimes I buy books on Kindle when traveling. I also buy books in bookstores, because bookstores and books have made a huge impact in my life, not only the ideas in books, but the process of discovery in touching and skimming real books in a store. My brain lights up in a way not possible when ordering books on Amazon.
I actively shop local because I don't want department stores or bookstores or retail to die simply because Amazon can afford, and is allowed to pursue, aggressive predatory pricing and "free" shipping (paid by my $ 120 annual Prime fee). I have knowingly paid more at Walgreens for toiletries.
My point? While I cannot boycott Amazon, I will not give in to, or over to, it. It is becoming a monopoly, and we as a culture are so bedazzled by billionaires that our legislators seem incapable of creating regulations to curb aspiring monopolies' worst practices.
I do not have answers.
Sigh ...
Suzanne Brisendine
San Francisco
To the Editor:
Interestingly, I did not see any reference to the reason our independent bookstore sees thousands of customers every year: the personal relationships, the unique nature of our store and the integrated relationship with our community.
Our downtown book shop, with its compassionate and activist staff, acts as a safe space for the many locals and travelers who need to deliver a good rant about the stresses of life under the Trump regime or a place to nurse a baby, or those who have health problems and know they will find a sympathetic ear.
While Amazon is always a presence in retail at this time, we do not compete with Amazon. What we offer is something we will never cede to an algorithm -- commitment to making the world a more just and compassionate place.

The writer is the owner/manager of Everyone's Books.
To the Editor:
This is a classic doubled-edged sword situation. Brick-and-mortars cannot compete with the vast variety, price point and convenience of Amazon, yet for certain purchases an in-store experience is preferred. Some things need to be touched and seen for the full experience -- think towels and large appliances.
So what is the answer? Perhaps a brick-and-mortar tied to a larger curator/supplier like Amazon in some sort of networking deal? Only time will tell. Best that we all make a concerted effort to support the little guys. It matters.
Patricia McMillan
Camp Hill, Pa.
To the Editor:
Re "The Amazon Behemoth and Its Would-Be David" (Business, Nov. 26), about a coalition that is encouraging resistance to Amazon:
I am suspicious of any organization whose seed funding comes partly from George Soros. First of all, Amazon was not "forced to begin paying a $ 15 hourly minimum wage nationwide." It chose to do so. And the political forces that managed to keep the company from building a warehouse in Queens did no favor for the residents of that area.
Enormous success, such as that achieved by Amazon, will always create a backlash from the disgruntled groups who trade in, well, disgruntlement. If only all our companies could be run as well as Amazon, we would have nothing to fear from our economic adversaries. No, I have no personal interest in Amazon other than to be continually impressed by its unfailing efficiency and superb customer service.
Joseph Gagen
Albany, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Here's how I use Amazon while supporting vendors' own supply-chain and shipper: I shop first on Amazon to find the manufacturer and a sample (low) price. Then I go to the manufacturer's website and see if I can either buy the product directly, or find an alternative supplier or even a local store. If the total price is within 15 percent or so of Amazon's, I'll opt to buy that way instead.
I did this recently for a thermal camera costing about $ 200, and the manufacturer charged no more than Amazon, shipped quickly and free, and even threw in a mobile charging pack. And its packaging was minimal, unlike Amazon's.

In many states, marriage still a rape defense

Texto completo: Is it worse to sexually assault a stranger than it is to sexually assault your wife?
In many states, the law says yes, imposing lesser charges or lighter sentences for violations within marriage — a disparity that women's rights activists find galling and are trying to change.
The issue has gained attention in recent weeks, as former governor Deval Patrick's entry into the Democratic presidential race revived questions about his involvement in a controversial case regarding spousal rape. Patrick's former brother-in-law was convicted of that offense in California, but after moving to Massachusetts, he was not required to register as a sex offender. A hearing officer determined California's spousal rape charge to be legally less severe and the man to be at no risk of reoffending.
Eleven years later, Massachusetts case law has evolved to erase confusion about discrepancies between states' criminal codes so that the same decision wouldn't be made today. Marriage has not been a defense against rape charges in Massachusetts courts since 1981, and marital rape has been illegal in all 50 states since 1993, at least to some degree.
But many states, including California, continue to treat sexual assault differently when it occurs within a marriage, according to AEquitas, a nonprofit training and technical assistance provider that works with prosecutors on their response to gender-based violence and human trafficking.
“I think that all California voters would be shocked if they knew that California still maintains a spousal rape law," said Michele Dauber, a Stanford University law professor and sociologist who is advocating for the change. “Obviously, it's time to remove this law from our books because rape is rape regardless of the relationship or lack of a relationship between the perpetrator and the victim."
Spousal rape in California does not carry a mandatory prison sentence. Someone convicted of spousal rape there is required to register as a sex offender only if he used force or violence — not if he violated his wife in her sleep or while she was unconscious — and if he was sentenced to prison.
That distinction is troubling to Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen, who is developing legislation to eliminate it.
“We have recently encountered a horrific spousal rape case and it was very disheartening to realize that he's not looking at mandatory state prison," said Terry Harman, an assistant district attorney who oversees the Santa Clara County sexual assault unit.
The notion that a man can't rape his wife can be traced back to Matthew Hale, father of British common law, said Raquel Kennedy Bergen, a sociology professor and a fellow in the Institute for Violence Research and Prevention at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia.
“People like Hale argued that with marriage, you are giving your consent forever and it can't be revoked," Bergen said.
In the 1970s, feminists began pushing back against that idea but discovered it was baked into law: State statutes defined rape as forcible intercourse with a woman who is not your wife.
“By virtue of the definition, you could not rape your wife," Bergen said.
In many states, though spousal rape is illegal, spousal exemptions remain — including those based on the age of the victim (when sexual conduct might otherwise be statutory rape), their custodial or supervisory relationship (when sexual conduct might otherwise be illegal), or the victim's capacity to consent, according to AEquitas.
For instance, Maryland offers a spousal defense that says a person can be prosecuted for raping a spouse only while using force or threatening to use force; or the couple is living separately for at least three months or pursuant to a written separation agreement.
In 20 states, spouses are exempt from prosecution in cases that would otherwise be considered rape because the victim was asleep, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated and unable to give consent.
“To my mind, at least, that's when you're most vulnerable — when you can't give your consent, whenever you're incapacitated," Bergen said.
Until this year, Minnesota had a “voluntary relationship" defense that would exempt a perpetrator from prosecution for sexually assaulting someone who's physically helpless if married or living together. The campaign to change that law was led by a woman who found video of her now ex-husband penetrating her with an object as she slept in their bed beside their 4-year-old son, according to The New York Times. Under the prior law, the ex-husband could only be charged with a misdemeanor, rather than a felony.
So is a perpetrator less of a public danger if the only person he assaults is his wife?
Statistically, yes. Individually, not necessarily. That's why sex offender registration should be based on individual assessments of behavior and risk, not just broad classifications, said Dr. Laurie Guidry, a member of the board of the Massachusetts Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers.
Generally speaking, she said, “The research tells us that when a person targets a stranger victim, that kind of an offender tends to be a higher risk for recidivism than the person who targets someone who is known to them or related to them."
But individual spousal offenders can sometimes be more dangerous than those who assault strangers. Some go on to commit other violent or sexual offenses, said Gina Scaramella, executive director of the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center.
“I think it's incredibly important that we understand that people who are sexually violent toward people they know are not better than people who do that toward a stranger," she said.
The case of Patrick's former brother-in-law, Bernard Sigh, began with Sigh's 1993 conviction of spousal rape of Patrick's sister, his jail time, and his probation. The couple reconciled before moving to Massachusetts, where he had not registered as a sex offender, when Patrick was running for governor, the Boston Herald revealed. The Sex Offender Registry Board ordered Sigh to register, and he appealed.
A hearing officer determined that Sigh “does not present a risk to reoffend or a danger to others," noting that he had stopped drinking, accepted responsibility, and shown sincere remorse. The hearing officer was persuaded by the victim's testimony that Sigh had been a loving husband and father in the ensuing 14 years and that the rape had been an isolated incident.
But board employees continued to resist his findings, insisting that spousal rape should be treated as rape. Years later, Patrick fired the chairwoman of the board, whom he accused of inappropriately trying to change the opinion. In a suit that is still ongoing, the former chairwoman, Saundra Edwards, claims she was unjustly fired in retaliation.
When the issue came up in his new campaign for president, Patrick defended his actions, maintaining he asked Edwards to resign “in part because of her unlawful interference" in the case, which triggered a prior lawsuit and financial settlement with the hearing officer.
He also said, “Bernie Sigh's impact on my family has been complex and painful for all of us."
In 2017, Sigh was charged with raping Patrick's sister again, as well as trying to have her kidnapped. He was convicted in June and sentenced to six to eight years in prison.
Dauber, the Stanford professor, has called Patrick's involvement in the case of his former brother-in-law “disqualifying" for a presidential candidate. However, she noted that it has drawn attention to California's antiquated law.
“I think that the Deval Patrick incident is probably the first time that many Californians even knew that we had a spousal rape law, or a spousal rape exception," Dauber said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — With her announcement that Democrats will move forward and vote on articles of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may have signed a political death warrant for dozens of moderate Democrats elected in Trump districts.
Pelosi is speaker today because in 2018 Democrats were able to convince voters in 31 House districts Trump carried two years before to defect and vote for them. Democrats need these voters to stay in their column in 2020 if they are to hold onto the House and win back the White House.
But in key swing states, large majorities of these 2018 defectors now say they plan to back Trump again in 2020. The New York Times reported that “nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals.” The Times also reported that in 2018, voters in these states cast their ballots “for Democratic congressional candidates by an average of six points, all but identical to their actual winning margins.” That means these freshman Democrats already face an uphill battle to hold onto their seats.
Now, Pelosi is adding to their woes by forcing them to vote to recommend the removal of a president that voters in their districts say they plan to reelect. Already, she forced them to vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, and all but two did so. But there is a world of difference between backing an impeachment inquiry and voting to impeach. Before the hearings began, swing-state voters said they supported the impeachment inquiry by a margin of 50% to 45%, but opposed impeaching and removing Trump by 53% to 43%. After weeks of wall-to-wall hearings, polls show that Democrats failed to move the needle in favor of impeachment and removal. Indeed, in Wisconsin, opposition to removal has nearly doubled. In other words, Democrats have failed to make their case.
By moving forward with impeachment anyway, Pelosi is putting her most vulnerable members in a terrible position. Split-ticket voting is already rare. The Washington Post reported in 2016 that that election “saw the highest percentage of STRAIGHT-ticket voters in more than a century.” And according to FiveThirtyEight, split-ticket voting hit a new low in 2018. Impeachment makes it even less likely that swing-state voters will split their tickets. Are voters really going cast ballots to give Trump four more years and also to reelect the Democratic House members who tried to take that decision out of their hands by impeaching him?
Voters in these Trump districts are already frustrated with their Democratic representatives. They won on promises to work with the president to address issues like health care, prescription drug prices, infrastructure and trade. None of that is getting done, thanks to Democrats’ focus on impeachment. Indeed, there is speculation in the White House that the reason Pelosi has been slow-rolling the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement Trump negotiated is not out of reluctance to give Trump a win, but because she needs it as leverage with her moderate members to get their votes for impeachment. “She’s using USMCA to get the impeachment vote,” Trump has said.
Pelosi isn’t stupid. She would not have announced a vote on articles of impeachment if she didn’t believe she had the votes. But while she can strong-arm the moderates in her caucus, she can’t strong-arm the voters in their districts. Her decision to move forward with impeachment means that many of those 31 Democrats seem destined to lose in November. Apparently, that is a price she is willing to pay to placate her party’s virulent anti-Trump base.

Beethoven Meets a Minimalist

Texto completo: Steve Reich, one of the avatars of musical Minimalism, has written barely at all for the traditional symphony. He gained fame with his compositions for the ensemble he founded, Steve Reich and Musicians.
Before "Music for Ensemble and Orchestra," which had its New York premiere with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday at David Geffen Hall, his last piece for orchestra had come more than 30 years ago. "I'm someone who writes for ensemble," he declared in an interview with The New York Times last year, when the work was new.
And in a program note for the Philharmonic (which co-commissioned it), he sounded a cautious note. By restricting the most virtuosic material in the 20-minute "Music for Ensemble and Orchestra" to a select group of strings, woodwinds, pianos and vibraphones, he noted that he was hewing rather closely to the intimate forces employed by his usual groups. To the supporting strings and trumpets -- the orchestra, in other words -- he had assigned "a simpler, more harmonically supportive role."
This humility is charming. But Mr. Reich, 83, needn't have downplayed his achievement. As melodically winning as his "Radio Rewrite" (2012, inspired by Radiohead) and more structurally intriguing than "Pulse," from 2015 (which, like "Music for Ensemble and Orchestra," features a prominent part for electric bass), this is no ripping up of Mr. Reich's rule book. He still displays his old talent for blitzing, interlocking, mutating melodies, as well as for dramatic shifts in harmony.
But his use of the orchestra reveals a composer confident in his idiom, reaching out for new effects. Those "simpler" strings, while not intrinsically complex, lent moments of piercing harmony to the orchestral textures during the first movement, as the more featured instruments engaged in thrilling volleys of canonic imitation. Occasional eruptions from an electric bass often announced new motifs in the ensemble, and had intense power.
The work is written in arch form, in five movements that keep the tempo the same but change the length of the notes being played to convey the illusion of transition from fast to slower to fast. Around the midpoint there was also room for a sense of reverie, as the churning pianos familiar from some of Mr. Reich's past works were allowed to relent (briefly). In its final moments, the piece took on the feeling of a meditative exhalation, suggesting prior touchstones like "Music for 18 Musicians," without seeming derivative.
The Philharmonic players savored the sounds. Some scintillating passages for trumpets and vibraphones were brimming with a metallic resonance that the orchestra and its music director, Jaap van Zweden, balanced beautifully with the strings and winds. It was a good night for the orchestra, in general, in a program otherwise devoted to Beethoven.
In that composer's Symphony No. 2, Mr. van Zweden suppressed his characteristic impulse toward feverish dynamic intensity, leading a suave and engaging performance that built to a satisfying climax. If the Larghetto was a touch draggy, Mr. van Zweden made up for it during the quiet middle movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4. There, in partnership with the soloist, Yefim Bronfman, this conductor created a chilly sense of mystery. Mr. Bronfman was in touch with the concerto's quick-changing energies throughout -- ramping from naïvely winning melodies to stormy outbursts with reliable command.
This program of classics plus an exciting contemporary work is exactly the kind of eclectic, highly enjoyable evening that an elite orchestra can and should pull off regularly. But as I looked around Geffen Hall on Thursday, I wondered whether the audiences that pack the Brooklyn Academy of Music for Mr. Reich's performances were aware of this major local premiere. This week, the Philharmonic's website has been advertising an evening of "Bronfman and Beethoven." That's true enough, but hardly the whole story. This orchestra has changed its approach to the repertoire in recent years -- but marketing habits die hard.

Amid media's recession panic, US ends decade with robust, booming jobs numbers

Texto completo: The final jobs report released in the 2010s shows the economy is both vibrant and growing.
This may or may not come as an unwelcome surprise to those who have spent the last several months warning that a recession is right around the corner.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that employers added an astounding 266,000 jobs in November, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.5%, its lowest point since the year astronauts first walked on the moon.

The U6 unemployment rate, which is a broader measure of real unemployment, registered at 7.2% in November, which is on par with numbers reported over the summer. The labor force participation rate meanwhile held steady at about 63.2%, while wage growth actually increased by 3.1% over the last year.

In other words, it is an excellent report that “crushes” all earlier expectations, especially in the "jobs added" category. In fact, to put Friday’s numbers in perspective, Bloomberg News's rosiest estimates predicted 180,000 new jobs. The actual number surpasses even those expectations.
This is good news for everyone — everyone, that is, except for the people who have cheered both explicitly and implicitly for a recession as a means to oust President Trump from office.

People such as 2020 Democratic primary candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who wrote a blog post in July titled, “The Coming Economic Crash — And How to Stop It.” Naturally, the solution to the coming recession is to support her and her policy positions.

People such as Bill Dudley, former chair of the New York Federal Reserve, who authored an op-ed in August encouraging the Fed to interfere in the democratic process by working against the president's trade war with China. Dudley reasoned that a major economic downturn would be worth it if it means “making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions.”

Then there are people such as Democratic Party booster Bill Maher and NBC News' chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel, both of whom said they hoped for a Trump-canceling recession.

“I do [want a recession],” Maher said in August. “We have survived many recessions. We can’t survive another Donald Trump term.”

Engel chimed in, “Short-term pain [is] better than long-term destruction of the Constitution."

Lastly, there are the newsrooms that are all too enthusiastic to promote a recession panic.

“A Recession Is Coming (Eventually). Here’s Where You’ll See It First,” the New York Times reported in July.

BuzzFeed wrote in August, “Here’s Some Actually Useful Information To Help You Prepare For A Recession.”

“Here's a list of recession signals that are flashing red,” reads the headline to a CNBC report in September.
CNBC asked later in October, “Is a Recession Inevitable?”

“Is a Recession Coming?” asked Bloomberg News in November.

Sure, something terrible may still happen to the economy. We may still be due for a recession in 2020 or 2021. Anything is possible, and no one has a perfect record predicting the notoriously fickle markets. But after Friday’s jobs report, those who have been hoping that a recession will rescue them from another four years of Trump in the White House should probably look elsewhere for salvation.

Texto completo: These days, playwright David Mamet is best known for such works as "American Buffalo," "Oleanna" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Glengarry Glen Ross." But one of his early works is a play about a couple of actors at different stages in their own careers.
"A Life in the Theater" traces the evolving relationship between veteran thespian Robert and promising newcomer John. The play hits the boards Friday evening at the Gaslight Theater. The St. Louis Actors' Studio production runs through Dec. 22.
William Roth and Ryan Lawson-Maeske star as Robert and John, respectively, under the direction of John Contini. "A Life in the Theater" was first produced in 1977 at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago and made its off-Broadway debut the same year.
Contini says the play "hits on just about every aspect of an actor's life -- good and bad moments onstage and backstage." As the scenes unfold, the audience gets to know Robert and John during what appears to be a season of performing in plays together.
"They do a Chekhov type of piece, they do a Civil War-type piece, they do a World War I-type piece," he says. "They could be two actors anywhere, and we get the feeling that perhaps they're not stars of any kind, or the greatest actors in their field. They're hardworking, everyday actors."
There's not as much of the profanity for which Mamet is known. Still, the dialogue has a certain pizazz that one would expect from the "Glengarry" scribe, says Roth, who is founder and artistic director of St. Louis Actors' Studio.
"My character pontificates a fair amount, and only Mamet could write that pontification," he says.
The New York Times praised the off-Broadway production that starred Ellis Rabb (as Robert) and Peter Evans (as John), noting that "Mamet's language glistens. His writing is a cross between the elegant and the vernacular, an ironic combination that is uniquely his own."
Rabb and Evans reprised their performances in a 1979 television adaptation on PBS. Another TV movie, in 1993 on the TNT network, featured Jack Lemmon as Robert and Matthew Broderick as John.
But the merits of the play come across best in live performance, Roth says: "Hopefully, what will be so much fun for the audience is that you're there with us."
"A Life in the Theater" is part of the Actors' Studio's 13th season, titled "2 to Tango" and featuring plays involving just two actors. That approach works particularly well at the Gaslight Theater, Roth says.
"It's such an intimate space," he says. "For a long time, we tried to prove how big we could get in a small space. This season, we wanted to see how small we could get."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani met Thursday in Ukraine with a key figure working to build a corruption case against Hunter Biden, the Ukraine lawmaker said, after posting Facebook photographs of himself with the former New York mayor.
Andriy Derkach said he pressed Giuliani on the need to set up a joint U.S.-Ukraine investigation into corruption in Ukraine at the meeting in Kyiv. Derkach also vowed to set up an anti-corruption group in the Ukraine parliament.
Giuliani made no immediate public comments on the meetings.
But his presence in Ukraine advances the efforts of Trump allies to create an alternative narrative in the rapidly moving impeachment investigation -- tapping some of Ukraine's most controversial figures who have spread theories of corruption and impropriety around Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.
The New York Times, which first reported Giuliani's travels, said he had meetings this week in Budapest, Hungary and Kyiv to meet current and former Ukrainian officials for a documentary.
Derkach noted that their meeting was filmed by "some kind of American television company" but offered no further details.
"Rudolph Giuliani has arrived in Kyiv. We met up immediately to discuss the establishment of the Friends of Ukraine STOP Corruption interparliamentary group," Derkach said in a Facebook post.
Derkach, an independent lawmaker who was formerly a member of a pro-Russian party in parliament, went to the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow. He is the son of a KGB officer who later served as head of Ukrainian intelligence.
Derkach wrote that Giuliani could help bring experts, journalists and analysts to investigate corruption in Ukraine and "benefit strategic relations between Kyiv and the United States."
Derkach said he had sent letters Tuesday to key Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham, California Rep. Devin Nunes and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, seeking their participation.
He said their involvement would help expose the ineffective use of U.S. tax dollars by Ukrainian authorities. "We sent our proposal. We're waiting for a reaction, an answer. We're waiting to see how much this is something that the congressmen and senators are in need of. If they want to work together, we're ready," Derkach said.
Derkach said he handed Giuliani documents outlining allegations relating to inefficient expenditure of U.S. government money on projects in Ukraine and other matters.
The documents do not specifically mention the Bidens. But Derkach makes reference to the energy company Burisma, which had Hunter Biden as a board member.
Right-wing network One America News announced Tuesday that it was conducting a "special investigation" with Giuliani, flying three Ukrainian officials to the United States and "debunking Schiff's impeachment narrative."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chaired the House Intelligence Committee that handed down a report concluding that Trump sought to undermine U.S. democracy and endangered national security. Derkach did not state whether the TV crew with Giuliani was from One America News.
Derkach and another parliamentary deputy, Oleksandr Dubinsky, called a news conference last month in Kyiv announcing plans to launch an investigative committee of the Ukrainian parliament, claiming corruption by top Ukrainian political figures and Burisma.
The company is at the heart of the impeachment investigation, with allegations Trump withheld military aid to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to open corruption investigations that could have damaged Joe Biden, a potential rival in next year's presidential election.
Analysts have dismissed Derkach as spreading disinformation to support the theory, being promoted by Trump allies, that Biden sought the dismissal of a former Ukraine prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, because he wanted to protect his son.
Ukraine's prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said in early October that he would carry out an audit to review the handling of all previous cases involving Burisma.
No evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens has emerged, and European powers were also seeking Shokin's dismissal, seeing him as corrupt and an obstacle to reform.
Derkach has previously led calls to investigate the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. In 2017, he wrote a letter to the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office, demanding an investigation into alleged interference in the elections by Ukrainian officials to hamper Trump's campaign, claiming this had "seriously damaged Ukraine-American relations."
The July 24, 2017, letter came one day before Trump called on the U.S. attorney general's office in a tweet to investigate "Ukrainian efforts to sabotage the Trump campaign."
Derkach and Dubinsky, however, seem to be experiencing difficulty attracting the support of 150 members of parliament -- the number required to form the investigative group.
Derkach and Dubinsky have "zero" chance of forming an investigative committee, said one parliamentarian Thursday, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and analyst on corruption in Russia and Ukraine, tweeted last month that Derkach and others were spreading "lies" on behalf of Trump and Giuliani.
"Stay away from them! All lies!" he wrote.
He tweeted Wednesday that Giuliani "has chosen Ukrainian interlocutors who are criminals & NEVER say anything true."

Texto completo: LEXINGTON — Kentucky basketball is headed overseas next season.
John Calipari's team has agreed to a three-game series with Michigan, with the first game to be played at the O2 arena in London, England, in December 2020. UK confirmed the news, which was first reported by the New York Times Thursday morning.
The two teams will then play a home-and-home series with games in Michigan on Dec. 4, 2021 and in Lexington on Dec. 3, 2022.
"This series with Michigan checks off a lot of boxes when we're looking at teams to schedule," Calipari said in a UK news release. "The first thing is, to add an opponent like Michigan and to do so at a point in the schedule where we're beginning to find out who we are as a team will be important in our development.
"And then to be able to do something different — to be first, which our fans know we love to do — and play this first game is London will be an unforgettable experience for our players and for our fans. I imagine the home-and-home games the following seasons will be as good as any nonconference games in the country."
The trip overseas will mark a rare in-season journey to another country for Kentucky.
During the Calipari era, the Wildcats have played in a preseason exhibition event every three years as allowed by NCAA rules but have played almost all their in-season games in the United States. The preseason events have been played in Canada and the Bahamas.
Kentucky's last regular-season trip to another country came in a one-game trip to the Bahamas in 2016. During Calipari's first season as coach, Kentucky played in a November 2019 tournament in Cancun, Mexico. The Wildcats' participation in the event had been scheduled before Calipari was hired as coach.
The Wildcats have never played a regular season game outside of North America, but the 1948-49 Kentucky team did win a gold medal as the United States representative at the 1948 Olympics in London.
Michigan has played out of the country before, but never in a setting like this. The Wolverines' previous excursions have involved preseason tournaments in the Caribbean. Just last week, they won the "Battle 4 Atlantis" tournament in the Bahamas.
Michigan has not played Kentucky since 2013-14, when the Wolverines lost to the Wildcats in the Elite Eight round of the NCAA Tournament. And before that, the last time the two teams met was in 1992-93 — when Michigan coach Juwon Howard and the Fab Five beat Kentucky in the Final Four. Now, as a head coach, Howard will take on the Wildcats again.
"When the idea of playing Kentucky came up, we knew it would be an exciting opportunity, not only for ourselves, but for our fans as well," said Howard in a statement. "What a unique three-game series. First, we get to showcase collegiate basketball overseas in London before playing that traditional home-and-home series in front of two of the nation's best basketball environments. We cannot wait."
Calipari has been reluctant to schedule home-and-home series in recent years against programs other than in-state rival Louisville. Kentucky has ended home-and-home series with Indiana and North Carolina in recent years in favor of made-for-television neutral-site events like the Champions Classic and CBS Sports Classic.
The Hall of Fame coach was willing to buck that trend for Michigan, which soared to No. 5 in this week's USA TODAY coaches poll before losing at Louisville, because of his respect for Howard after watching Howard take former Kentucky star Bam Adebayo under his wing while he was an assistant coach with the Miami Heat.
"I said, 'You took care of one of mine, so if I can help you in this...," Calipari said. "Now, I didn't know they'd be this good."

Texto completo: "The Cereal City is where it's at, and I hope the Democratic candidate will come on through, too. I'm glad Battle Creek is getting the attention."
Jake Smith, D-Calhoun County Commissioner
BATTLE CREEK – President Donald Trump will host a "Merry Christmas" rally at Kellogg Arena in Battle Creek later this month.
"Michigan is booming thanks to President Trump, and jobs are coming back to the state," Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a press release. "President Trump is delivering on his promises, and he looks forward to celebrating those successes with the great men and women of Michigan this Christmas season."
Chairman of the Calhoun County Republican Committee Jeannie Burchfield said the local Republican party was beyond thrilled" to have Trump visit.
"Calhoun County is Trump country, for sure..." she said. "This will be a fantastic way for us to show support for the president."
Burchfield said the news about the rally was particularly exciting after having Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump campaign, speak at the committee's annual dinner on Tuesday and seeing Vice President Mike Pence in Portage on Wednesday.
"This has been a crazy, wonderful week," she said.
Calhoun County Commissioner Jake Smith, a Democrat, said he hoped other presidential candidates would make Battle Creek a campaign stop.
"The Cereal City is where it's at, and I hope the Democratic candidate will come on through, too," he said. "I'm glad Battle Creek is getting the attention."
Despite the Trump administration's claim that Michigan's economy is booming, job growth has slowed considerably since the state's rebound from the Great Recession and has been essentially flat this year, said Charles Ballard, a Michigan State University economics professor and an expert on the state's economy.
That's true for the Upper Midwest, as a whole, according to the latest federal data, he said.
"It doesn't sound to me that our economy is booming," Ballard said. "I don't think we're in a recession, but we're kind of on the edge of a recession. The number of jobs is still well below what it was at its peak in 2000."
Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, less than 1% of the 4.8 million votes cast, but recent Sienna College/New York Times Upshot polls show him trailing Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders here in head-to-head matchups but ahead of Elizabeth Warren.
Trump has visited Michigan several times since the 2016 election, including a rally in December, 2016 in Walker and a visit to the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run in Ypsilanti in March of 2017. His last visit to the state was April 2018, when he held a rally in Macomb County's Washington Township.
The rally will be held at 7 p.m. on Dec. 18. Tickets are available online at donaldjtrump.com/events/battle-creek-mi-dec-christmas-rally. They will be given out on a first-come, first served basis and are limited to two per mobile phone number.

Perpetual Laggards Leap Ahead in Reading

Texto completo: The state's reliance on cognitive science explains why.
"Thank God for Mississippi."
That's a phrase people would use when national education rankings came out because no matter how poorly your state performed, you could be sure things were worse in Mississippi.
Not anymore. New results on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a standardized test given every two years to measure fourth- and eighth-grade achievement in reading and math, show that Mississippi made more progress than any other state.
The state's performance in reading was especially notable. Mississippi was the only state in the nation to post significant gains on the fourth-grade reading test. Fourth graders in Mississippi are now on par with the national average, reading as well or better than pupils in California, Texas, Michigan and 18 other states.
What's up in Mississippi? There's no way to know for sure what causes increases in test scores, but Mississippi has been doing something notable: making sure all of its teachers understand the science of reading.
Yes, there is a science to how people read. For the past several decades, in labs and classrooms all over the world, scientists have been studying how skilled reading works, what children need to learn to become skilled readers, and what's going on when students struggle. Reading is probably the most studied aspect of human learning.
But a lot of teachers don't know this science. In 2013, legislators in Mississippi provided funding to start training the state's teachers in the science of reading.
To understand what the science says, a good place to start is with something called the "simple view of reading." It's a model that was first proposed by researchers in 1986 to clarify the role of decoding in reading comprehension. Everyone agrees the goal of reading is to comprehend text, but back in the 1980s there was a big fight going on over whether children should be taught how to decode words -- in other words, phonics.
The simple view says that reading comprehension is the product of two things. One is your ability to decode words: Can you identify the word a string of letters represents? For example, you see the letter string "l-a-s-s" and you are able to sound it out and say the word.
You may have no idea what "lass" means. This is where language comprehension comes in. Language comprehension is your ability to understand spoken language. So, when someone says to you, "Let's have all the lads and lasses line up at the door," you know that's what all the boys and girls are supposed to do.
The simple view is an equation that looks like this:
decoding ability x language comprehension = reading comprehension
Notice that reading comprehension is the product of decoding ability and language comprehension; it's not the sum. In other words, if you have good language comprehension skills but zero decoding skills, your reading comprehension will be zero, because zero times anything is zero. The simple view also says that if you have good decoding skills but poor language comprehension skills, your reading comprehension isn't going to be very good either.
The simple view model was proposed more than 30 years ago and has been confirmed over and over again by research. But a study in Mississippi several years ago showed that teachers were not being trained to use this model and that many professors and deans in colleges of education had never even heard of it. Now, through workshops and coaching paid for by state taxpayers, teachers in Mississippi are learning about the simple view and other key takeaways from the science of reading.
The simple view is critical for understanding how children learn to read. Most children entering school have very little decoding skill. They know the meaning of lots of words, but they don't know how to decode those words. If the goal is to get to reading comprehension, children have to learn how to decode. That's why people who know the science of reading call for an emphasis on phonics instruction in the early grades.
Now, the simple view clearly shows that focusing only on decoding would be a mistake because that's only half the equation. Reading instruction has to include language comprehension, too. This means lessons and activities that expand children's oral vocabularies and knowledge, so they know the meaning of the words they can decode.
In my reporting on the debates about reading, I've found there's a lot of confusion in schools about the role of decoding in learning how to read. Teachers want their students to love reading, and phonics has a reputation for being rote and boring.
So, reading instruction tends to begin with having children focus on making meaning from text while giving short shrift to helping them develop the skills involved in reading words. Some children develop good word reading skills anyway. Research suggests that about 40 percent of children will learn to read no matter how inadequate the instruction.
What about the other 60 percent? The lack of skills instruction can be a disaster for them, especially for pupils from low-income families. When children from higher-income homes struggle to read, their parents will often pay for tutoring or specialized private school. But children from poor families tend to have no backup if schools don't teach them how to read words.
And while children from poor families often enter school at a disadvantage when it comes to language comprehension, if they're taught how to decode they've just been given their best shot at catching up because now they have the means to gain knowledge and expand their vocabulary through reading.
For years, everyone assumed Mississippi was at the bottom in reading because it was the poorest state in the nation. Mississippi is still the poorest state, but fourth graders there now read at the national average. While every other state's fourth graders made no significant progress in reading on this year's test, or lost ground, Mississippi's fourth-grade reading scores are up by 10 points since 2013, when the state began the effort to train its teachers in the science of reading. Correlation isn't causation, but Mississippi has made a huge investment in helping teachers learn the science behind reading.
And when children are taught in ways that line up with the science, they can learn.

Nearly one in three high school students has reported using a tobacco product recently, according to a new federal survey released on Thursday, evidence that concerns over nicotine addiction among teenagers are not limited to e-cigarettes.
"The data released today on youth tobacco product use are deeply troubling and indicate that past progress in reducing youth use of these products has been erased," said Brian King, the deputy director of the Office on Smoking and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "These troubling rates of use are being driven by e-cigarettes, which have no redeeming aspects among youth."
For the sixth year in a row, e-cigarettes dominated the students' choice. Public health officials were concerned that despite wide-scale publicity intended to deter vaping, especially in the wake of recent vaping-related illnesses and even deaths, not only did the practice continue to surge, but students also did not seem to be particularly alarmed about e-cigarettes.
And while e-cigarettes were by far the most popular product, researchers noted that one in three users, or an estimated 2.1 million middle and high school students, also used an additional tobacco product, such as cigars and cigarettes. Those students reported more symptoms of nicotine addiction than those who used one tobacco product.
Indeed, such indications of nicotine dependence were worrisome, researchers said. Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the C.D.C., noted that nicotine could harm the developing brain.
"Youth use of any tobacco product, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe," he said in a statement. "It is incumbent upon public health and health care professionals to educate Americans about the risks resulting from this epidemic among our youth."
The year-over-year increases in teenage vaping as well as the vaping-related illnesses and deaths have intensified calls for a ban on flavored e-cigarette products that have been extremely popular among teenagers.
On Thursday, the C.D.C. released its most recent numbers on the illnesses, saying that 48 deaths and 2,291 vaping-related hospital cases had been reported across the country. (The agency said it was now limiting its tabulation of cases to patients who needed to be hospitalized.) Most of the illnesses have been attributed to vaping THC products, not e-cigarettes alone.
But an imminent ban seems unlikely. President Trump, who said in September that restrictions on flavors, including mint and menthol, would be imposed, has since backed away from that option. Late last month, he held a round table with vaping industry and public health advocates and warned that a ban would spawn counterfeit products.
But according to an analysis of the data published last month in JAMA, high school students who use only e-cigarettes are increasingly turning to menthol or mint-flavored products. In 2016, 16 percent reported using those flavors, but in the latest survey, 57 percent said they used them. In contrast, sweet, candy-like flavors were becoming less popular, dropping to nearly 35 percent in 2019 from 54 percent in 2016.
At a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Mitch Zeller, head of the tobacco control unit of the Food and Drug Administration, noted that new information from a separate federal survey should be considered when weighing which flavors should be removed from the market. That survey, by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, found that far more youths who used Juul flavor pods preferred mint than menthol.
Compared to the use of e-cigarettes, the use of traditional cigarettes or cigars by teenagers remains relatively modest. But this was the first year that cigars were second in popularity behind e-cigarettes. More high school students reported smoking cigars, particularly cigarillos and also little, flavored cigars, than traditional cigarettes, 7.6 percent compared to 5.8 percent.
Many students said they did not consider intermittent smoking of any product to be harmful. The National Youth Tobacco Survey found that despite widespread public health efforts to deter students from vaping or turning to any tobacco product, students still reported being steeped in environments that promote tobacco as alluring.
Some nine out of 10 students said they were routinely exposed to tobacco advertising or promotion. And their interest is being piqued: Even among students who never used e-cigarettes, 39 percent said they were curious about using e-cigarettes and 37 percent were curious about traditional cigarettes.
Students reported struggling to stop vaping or smoking: Nearly 58 percent reported having given serious thought to quitting, while nearly as many said they managed to do so for at least a day.
The survey was administered by the C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration from February through May of this year to 10,097 high school students and 8,837 middle school students, grades six through 12, which is considered a large representative national sample.

Texto completo: Also this week: air pollution in augmented reality, and new climate talks
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
The nights get longer this time of year, but not necessarily darker. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, American suburbs are up to 50 percent brighter than usual, even after midnight. Our holiday lights are so impressive that they can be observed from space.
The Department of Energy estimates that Americans burn 6.6 billion kilowatt-hours annually using holiday lights. That's enough electricity to power more than 800,000 homes for a year. But with a few simple adjustments, you can make your lights a bit greener.
The biggest thing you can do is to switch to LED lights. If you do, you'll use up to 70 percent less energy than you would with traditional incandescent bulbs. Plus, you won't need to replace lights as often. LEDs last about 10 times longer.
"If you want the lights, try to get the most efficient ones," said Shahzeen Attari, an associate professor at Indiana University Bloomington who studies environmental psychology. "And when you're not using them, turn them off."
Eleanor Stokes, a research scientist at the University of Maryland who has worked with NASA to gather satellite data on our lighting habits, agreed. "I'm all about being festive," she said, "but you don't need to be festive at, like, 3 a.m." Putting your lights on a timer can have a "huge benefit," she said.
The Energy Department recommends leaving them on for up to eight hours a day, from dusk to around midnight. Not only will this conserve energy, but it's better for wildlife. Heavy light pollution can be deadly for some animals by disrupting the daily cycle of light and dark.
Another tip: You can use an extension cord in places where you want to connect strings but don't really need lights.
If you're lighting candles this season, try to stay away from petroleum-based paraffin ones and instead opt for candles made from soy, beeswax or natural vegetable-based wax.
And when the holidays are over, don't forget to promptly take the lights down, pack the candles up and store everything properly so you don't need to buy new things next year. Don't throw away light strings just because they're tangled.
Finally, enjoy those holiday lights. If you aim for maximum efficiency, Dr. Attari said, they'll account for only a small fraction of your total energy footprint, just a few dollars a month.
"Unless you're one of those homes that lights up the entire home and the entire home is flooded with lights," she said, "I don't think it's a big-ticket item."
What does it feel like to breathe the world's most polluted air?
It's a timely question. Last month, air pollution in New Delhi made headlines when particulate levels rose to near-record levels. Officials declared a public health emergency and distributed millions of protective face masks to residents.
Around the same time a year ago, pollution was spiking in California. Thick smoke from the Camp Fire blanketed the San Francisco Bay Area for weeks. It prompted officials to close schools and issue health alerts.
Outdoor particulate pollution is a public health hazard worldwide, responsible for millions of deaths each year and many more illnesses. But this kind of pollution -- called PM2.5, for particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 micrometers across, or about 35 times smaller than a grain of fine beach sand -- is often difficult to see with the naked eye. At extreme levels, it casts a haze in the sky, but PM2.5 can imperil health even on clear days.
To give a sense of what that's like, we created a special project that visualizes the damaging, tiny particles that wreak havoc on human health when people breathe them in.
In the project, which published this week, you can see particles fill the page as you scroll between cities -- and imagine them filling your lungs. And if you have the New York Times app installed on your phone, you can go a step further to see particles fill your physical space in augmented reality.
Give it a try and let us know what you think.
Annual United Nations climate negotiations aimed at strengthening the Paris Agreement are underway in Madrid, and even though the United States has moved to formally withdraw from the accord, America is still getting a lot of attention.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived for the opening ceremony on Monday and pledged that America was "still in" the 2015 agreement. And on Tuesday on the sidelines of the talks, William Happer, a longtime climate denialist who once served as Mr. Trump's national security adviser for energy, denounced what he called the "nonexistent climate emergency."
A delegation from the State Department is representing the United States at the talks, officially known as the 25th Conference of the Parties and commonly referred to as COP25, but Mr. Trump has not sent senior White House officials.
American participation in the Paris Agreement will ultimately be determined by the outcome of the 2020 election. If Mr. Trump is not re-elected, the next president could void the current plan to leave the accord with a simple letter to the United Nations Secretary General.
Still, climate analysts say they worry that no matter how the elections go in the United States, valuable time is being lost and momentum for reducing emissions is slowing. My colleague Henry Fountain reported Wednesday on a stark warning from the World Meteorological Organization that climate change is accelerating, and Brad Plumer reported on Tuesday the worrisome news that carbon emissions hit a record high in 2019.
Our global climate reporter, Somini Sengupta, will be in Madrid next week when the talks ramp up, so keep an eye out for her articles, tweets and insights!

SI debunks its own reporting

Texto completo: Stories about USC's Helton show why company's model might not be working
Southern California's Clay Helton hasn't yet coached his last football game for the Trojans.
'I am pleased to let you know Coach Helton will continue to be our head coach,' USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn tweeted Wednesday afternoon. 'His commitment to our student-athletes and to leading with integrity is vital to restoring our championship program, which is the goal for all of our teams.'
But if you were following Helton's status this week, his prospects were either uncertain or incredibly dim, depending on whom you asked at Sports Illustrated.
Adam Maya, a Trojans football 'insider' for SI's USC-based site, reported Sunday that Helton's firing was imminent, citing multiple anonymous sources. 'Clay Helton has coached his last game for the Trojans,' Maya wrote.
But hours later, Pat Forde, an SI senior staff writer, debunked that report, tweeting that multiple unnamed sources told him that 'no decision has been made and it is still possible " maybe even likely " that Helton keeps his job.'
SI's main site ran with Forde's report, publishing a staff report that afternoon that stated, 'Multiple sources are disputing the report that Clay Helton is being fired.' It did not mention that Maya, himself an SI correspondent, originated that story.
Maya retracted his story Wednesday night and apologized to readers for the misstep. He wrote that he also had apologized to Helton.
Maya wrote that he had been relying on the word of multiple people who had been reliable in previous stories and that those people 'confused certain actions by Bohn and their superiors at USC' to mean Helton was set to be terminated.
'As a result, a coaching change was inaccurately characterized to me as being a formality rather than, as was later explained to me, conditional,' Maya wrote. 'If I had known the latter, I would not have filed my report in such terms.'
He said his reporting 'inexcusably missed the mark.'
Representatives from the Maven, the magazine's operator, did not respond to a request for comment, and neither did Ryan Hunt, its managing editor. Neither Forde nor Maya responded to requests for comment.
The mixed signals come in the same year of major management and staffing reorganizations at SI, once the standard-bearer of American sports journalism. SI was acquired by marketing firm Authentic Brands Group in the spring, and its editorial operations were almost immediately handed over to Seattle-based media start-up Maven.
In October, the publication laid off nearly half its editorial staff and launched a tiered model for content. Maven would hire what it calls 'insiders' to cover individual teams and allow them to publish on spinoff websites that carried the SI masthead. SI held on to a number of higher-profile writers, including Chris Ballard and Tom Verducci, and added Forde, an award-winning former Yahoo Sports columnist.
Maya's story and the subsequent apology were published on SI's USC-specific website. Forde's reporting was published on Sports Illustrated's main website.
The internal conflict at SI over Helton's fate offered a peek both at the process of rapid news production and a publication in turmoil, said Galen Clavio, head of the sports media program at Indiana University.
Maven executives have suggested using this tiered system of 'insiders' and reporters is a way to reinvest in resource-rich long-form and investigative journalism, the projects that made SI indispensable to generations of sports fans. Team 'insiders' can take care of smaller daily news stories to give magazine writers the time and financial underwriting to pursue more ambitious articles.
But in doing so, Clavio said, the company is bestowing its recognizable and respected SI brand to two very different workforces: newly hired 'insiders' and industry veterans such as Forde.
'I don't think you can compare someone like Pat Forde with one of these Mavens,' Clavio said. 'They do such different things that the only commonality between them is the brand Sports Illustrated.
'What the Maven [writers] do, they're just meant to churn out content that generates ad revenue that helps the bottom line. They're really not meant to be breaking news.'
But experts say they don't expect SI or the Maven's reputation to suffer a significant blow over the contradictory articles. While other journalists might wag their fingers in disapproval, someone from SI in the end is going to be right, and the online audience will move on.
For a reporter such as Maya, who does not have a significant following, breaking a story " even if it's wrong " may not have many negative consequences, especially if it produces substantial online attention.
'Maybe what we're seeing here is the last whip of the dragon's tail in the struggle between legacy journalism and content journalism at SI,' said Bob Lipsyte, a former New York Times sportswriter and retired ESPN ombudsman. 'And this content journalism isn't worth much. It's speculative, it's not thoroughly reported, but it keeps the fire going.'
Added Clavio: 'It ends up being this weird thing where it's a black eye for the SI brand and this reporter. I just don't know if that black eye sustains or if it's a bump in the road in the age of social media. Even if they get some stuff wrong, it takes getting something right one time for all this damage to be reversed.'

Give America’s greatest gift

Texto completo: During this holiday season, Gov. Chris Sununu has provided New Hampshire communities with an opportunity to give a gift of great humanitarian value. And there’s not a moment to lose.
As the Concord Monitor reported last week, Sununu has cleared the way for New Hampshire cities and towns to resettle refugees if they consent to do so. The action was necessary because the Trump administration issued an executive order earlier this fall requiring both states and localities to explicitly affirm that they are willing to accept refugees into their communities.
This order deviates from longstanding practice, and some human rights groups believe it violates federal law. But there may not be time to test that proposition in court, because the deadline for communities to make a decision is Dec. 20. Selectboards and city councils should treat the matter with a sense of urgency, in consultation with their constituents.
Since the early 1980s, New Hampshire has welcomed more than 7,500 refugees from more than 30 nations who have been forced to flee their homelands because of persecution, or well-grounded fear of persecution, on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. The state assists nonprofit resettlement agencies, which provide, with federal funding, a range of services to help refugees become integrated into their new communities. These include employment counseling; coordination of housing, health care and other types of support; instruction in English as a second language; and similar types of assistance.
Between 2011 and 2018, Concord, Manchester and Nashua resettled the vast majority of refugees who came to New Hampshire, with Laconia, Franklin, Keene, Exeter and Dover taking a handful. No Upper Valley communities are on the list provided by DHHS. We hope that will change, and not only because it is a moral imperative and an American ideal to welcome those who have fled their homelands with only what they can carry with them.
It’s no secret that the Upper Valley and the Twin States more broadly are suffering from a labor shortage, declining school enrollments and a rapidly graying population. Refugee resettlement can help address all three. The state reports that refugees frequently find full-time employment within the first two or three months of their arrival in New Hampshire and generally adjust well to life in the Granite State, including children who start school in their new communities. Moreover, refugees are a source of cultural diversity in a state that needs much more of it.
Another reason to welcome refugees is to make a statement in the face of the Trump administration’s effort to clamp down on refugee resettlement. It plans to accept only 18,000 new arrivals in the current federal fiscal year, the lowest in the history of the program. The actual number of those vetted, accepted and admitted is reported to be far fewer than the cap because of increased security screening.
Among those in limbo are many Iraqis who put their lives on the line helping American forces during the Iraq War, according to The New York Times. This is unconscionable. The nation has always been a beacon of hope lighting the way to a brighter future for the persecuted. When America abandons them, it abandons its claim to moral leadership in the world.

"Frozen" was released on Nov. 27, 2013, and our daughter was born nearly two months later, so, even before my wife and I had a child, "Frozen" hovered on the fringes of our parental consciousness as something to be avoided and vaguely despised. If the term "Disney princess" evokes, for a certain kind of parent, a distasteful ethos of sparkly dresses, impossible wasp-waists and fables of princely rescue, then "Frozen," which centers on not one but two princesses, seemed, sight unseen, to be doubly odious. Yet one day, years later, when preschool was canceled and the rain was unceasing, my wife sent me a text: She'd done it. In case of emergency, she'd broken glass. She'd rented, and they'd watched, "Frozen."
It's hard for me to say now exactly how many times I've watched "Frozen" from beginning to end -- 10, 12, 20? -- but I can say with confidence that I've watched it more times than any other film in my life. I've watched it more than I've watched "Citizen Kane." I've watched it more than all the "Godfather" films combined. I've definitely listened to the "Frozen" soundtrack well over 100 times, based on a rather conservative estimate of at least once a week for 52 weeks over three years. I could sing the entire soundtrack to you right now from memory. "Born of cold and winter air and mountain rain combining ..."
If those lyrics have no resonance for you, I won't bother recapping the plot, which honestly feels at this point like stopping to explain what "weather" is. I also understand that, relatively speaking, my total number of "Frozen" viewings is modest -- some superfans claim to have watched it over 100 times. But given that there was a moment in my life when I strongly felt I would not watch "Frozen" even once, I'm shocked at how familiar I am with it -- and, more than that, by how much affection I feel for it. I live with someone, a tiny someone, who wants to watch and listen to "Frozen" again and again. (And again.) If familiarity breeds contempt, I should hate "Frozen." A lot. So why am I so excited to take my tiny someone to see "Frozen 2?"
Here's one thing I've learned from watching "Frozen" repeatedly: "Frozen" is good. Very good. Once I took my prejudicial aversion to it and, yes, let it go, I realized that beyond the lunchboxes and branded backpacks and Anna and Elsa matching sock sets, the movie itself is an expertly and even ingeniously crafted tale, a nuanced examination of sisterly devotion that features some of the best voice talent in the world, several very catchy songs and a lot of impressively rendered CGI snow. The dialogue is funny. The physical comedy is inspired. The set pieces, like a wolf chase across a mountainside covered in fresh powder or a final mad dash across a frozen harbor, are imaginatively staged and visually inventive. The entire film is especially enjoyable if you have an affinity for classic musical theater, as the lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez and the composer Robert Lopez clearly do. (Fun fact: Lopez, who also composed the music for "The Book of Mormon" and "Avenue Q," is not only the youngest person ever to win an EGOT -- an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony -- but he's the only person to have won each award more than once.) It's not hard, for example, to imagine the number "In Summer," as sung by Olaf the sentient snowman (voiced by Josh Gad), happily wedged into a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, performed by Donald O'Connor or Danny Kaye.
The other thing I've learned from "Frozen" is this: There is value in watching something over and over. One psychological theory contends that repeating a pleasurable experience is more likely to make you feel happy overall than a restless search for constant novelty -- which seems counterintuitive, particularly in a capitalist culture in which a ceaseless churn of newness is an economic imperative, whether it's trading in for a new car every few years or subscribing to a streaming service for a catalog of "content" you'd need several lifetimes to sit through. But as a Harvard psychologist recently told The New York Times in an article about the value of the familiar, "the process of looking for new insights in any repeat experience is fulfilling in and of itself. It's the essence of mindfulness."
And I can report that it's possible, while listening to "Do You Want to Build a Snowman" for the 80th time, to achieve a kind of meditative transcendence, even bliss. Once you've watched a film or heard a song 20 (or 100) times, you're not only noticing all kinds of new and interesting things, but you start to notice everything -- every note, every chord, every facial twitch, every nuance. With repeated exposure, you gain a new respect for Idina Menzel, who voices Elsa, and her superhuman ability to belt out a ballad unerringly while also imbuing it with complex emotional texture. Personally, I had this revelation on my 30th or 40th listen to the duet "For the First Time in Forever (Reprise)" -- and, yes, maybe I was choking up a little at the time. The ability to repeatedly engage with a work of art to the point where you not only experience the initial emotional impact but start to comprehend the framework of craftsmanship beneath it is the essence of cultural appreciation. And, frankly, it's a thrilling experience, no matter what work of art you're engaging with.
It's also a new experience. Of all the differences between my childhood and my daughter's, the one she finds hardest to fathom, the one that confounds her the most, is that when I was a kid, I could not simply flip on the TV and watch my favorite movie whenever I wanted. I'd like to say this led to a childhood of Masterpiece Theater and rereading Dickens, but what it really meant is that I watched whatever terrible cartoon happened to be on at the time my parents allowed me to watch cartoons. My little sister was of a generation that at least got to wear out her VHS tape of "The Little Mermaid," but I was too early even for that. My parents did sit me down on Saturday afternoons to watch "The Music Man" or "Oklahoma!" when they aired on the classic movies channel, but the exercise had the dusty sensation of homework, and I could still only watch each movie once. (This felt like a blessing at the time). Only later was I able to return to them and see the artistry my parents were hoping I'd discover.
When I was close to my daughter's age (she's nearly 6), the film that I would have wanted to watch over and over (and over) again was "Star Wars." But I only saw it once during its initial run. It was a magical experience and in the weeks and months that followed it lingered in my mind like a half-remembered dream. I eventually persuaded my parents to take me back to see it again, at a repertory theater, a year or two later, even though watching a movie in the theater twice felt, to my parents, like an inconceivable extravagance. I should also confess that during a particularly boring high school data-entry job, I listened to a condensed version of the "Star Wars" story on cassette maybe 300 times, maybe 500, maybe more.
So I'm happy my daughter can watch her favorite film as often as she wants, whenever she wants to, at least until it's not her favorite film anymore. We're both looking forward to "Frozen 2," which I'm sure we'll eventually watch at least 20 times. Lately, she's gotten into the animated films of Hayao Miyazaki, including "Spirited Away" and "My Neighbor Totoro" (both acknowledged influences on "Frozen") -- we've watched them together about four times each, and counting.
In fact, I can't think of a better foundation for a lifetime of loving culture than the ability to steep yourself in the art that you love right now. Maybe "Frozen" will vault my daughter toward the discovery of other musical-theater classics -- or not. Maybe musicals won't be her thing at all. But I'm excited for her to continue to discover what her thing is and immerse herself in it joyfully. Right now, "Frozen" is her thing. And we're enjoying it together. A lot.

Texto completo: What a great opportunity Nancy Pelosi just handed to President Trump and Senate Republicans!
Now the country can finally find out what the national media have been so desperately trying to hide.
The House speaker announced Thursday morning that Democrats were moving forward with the impeachment effort by drafting up formal charges against the president. In other words, we’re now getting to the part where we can actually find out why Trump did what he did in that midsummer phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
It's taken for granted that Senate Republicans simply won't convict Trump out of party loyalty. But they can make their decision about so much more than that.
The New York Times on Wednesday reported disapprovingly on Rudy Giuliani’s continued efforts in Ukraine to find evidence that the country interfered in the 2016 election and that Joe Biden, along with his middle-aged son Hunter, were corrupt in their own dealings in Ukraine.
“Even as Democrats intensified their scrutiny this week of Rudolph W. Giuliani’s role in the pressure campaign against the Ukrainian government that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry,” the report said, “Mr. Giuliani has been in Europe continuing his efforts to shift the focus to purported wrongdoing by President Trump’s political rivals.”
Wow, he was doing that even as Democrats intensified their scrutiny?! What a shock.
The media have been denying the clear evidence for months, dismissing Ukraine’s 2016 election meddling as a “conspiracy theory” and accusing anyone who so much as publicly questions their narrative of participating in a “Russian disinformation campaign.”
With regard to the Bidens, journalists and cable news hosts will only allow that maybe there was an “appearance” of impropriety when Joe Biden, as vice president, demanded Ukraine fire a state prosecutor who had been investigating a shady energy company that was paying Biden’s son Hunter for — well, we still don’t know what. But that’s where the story always ends, and the media loses its curiosity. Instead of asking further questions or gathering facts, we are told from there on that there's just no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens, and that questions about it are “baseless.”
This is like a homeless man mumbling on the sidewalk about the $1 million he has in the bank. Just because he says it over and over again and believes it to be true doesn’t make it so.
Ukraine’s interference in the 2016 election for the purpose of harming Trump’s campaign is not a conspiracy theory. It happened. The New York Times broke the story in 2016 that an entire Ukrainian government agency was investigating Paul Manafort, who at the time was serving as Trump's campaign chairman.
Back then, the paper reported that Ukraine’s "newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau," which worked in conjunction with America's FBI, was in possession of a mysterious, handwritten diary that showed Manafort was receiving millions of dollars in payments from one of the country's pro-Russian politicians. "Investigators assert," the Times reported, "that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials."
I’m sure all of that was by coincidence that Ukraine’s most consequential government agency suddenly came into possession of evidence against the head of a major-party U.S. presidential campaign. It was purely a matter of fate that that government agency then went to America’s most important paper to share the details. Surely none of that was a form of retaliation against Trump, who had been saying positive things about Russia, which remains actively engaged in a years-long war with Ukraine.
Yeah, I don’t buy that it's a coincidence, and no one else should, either.
The Times has never said how it got that major scoop or how it learned about the diary, often referred to as “the black ledger.” But in the Times report from Wednesday, the paper did dispute a claim by a conservative reporter that it received the diary from a Democratic operative who was working with Ukrainians in 2016 to push out damaging information on the Trump campaign.
The official story — which is laughable — is that the ledger was found by an unknown source in the ashes of a burned-down building. Okay, stipulate for a moment that one of the few things to survive a raging fire is a bunch of paper bound together in a book. Right. So, then, how did the Times happen upon it?
A spokeswoman for the paper didn’t return an email from me on Thursday asking about it.
The questions about the Bidens aren’t baseless, and there is certainly evidence that there was something corrupt about their connection to Burisma, the seedy Ukrainian energy company.
To its immense credit, the Washington Post gave the situation a gander at least once, reporting in late September:
When he joined, Burisma officials said Biden would oversee its legal affairs. But he did not end up in that role. He said in a statement to The Post that he joined the board “to help reform Burisma’s practices of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility” but did not provide examples of his work. Hunter’s decision entangled him in a country that Transparency International had ranked among the world’s most corrupt, a place where business executives have co-opted prosecutors and manipulated the courts to enhance their financial interests.
While this was going on, Joe Biden, as vice president, was the lead on U.S.-Ukraine relations and he has since bragged about pressuring the government to fire a prosecutor, lest the Obama administration withhold foreign aid the country. (I think there’s a word for that.) That prosecutor was supposedly suspected of corruption but he also happened to be investigating Burisma and he has told the Post that he believes he was fired because of his probe into the energy company.
This is all supposed to amount to “baseless” questions about Biden. They’re not baseless. They very much have a base.
Now that impeachment is about to move to the Senate, Republicans and the White House have the perfect chance to lay it all out for everyone to see for themselves what the media have been refusing to show them.

How to Avoid a Great New Job

Texto completo: I know it seems impossible, but there's a chance that somewhere out there an employer wants to offer you an amazing job.
I didn't say there was a big chance, but when you're stuck in the mud, career-wise, it's good to entertain the thought that there is a teensy-weensy, itsy-bitsy possibility the phone will ring and you will be offered a great new job.
Which raises the question -- what do you do if the call does arrive?
(Assuming you can move past the first reaction of your teensy-weensy, itsy-bitsy brain, which is to say, "I think you have the wrong number.")
Of course, any new job represents a risk. You may despise your current employer, but on the positive side, they know you and seem willing to keep you around.
There's no guarantee that a new employer won't come to their senses when you actually show up.
Don't want to risk it?
You're ready for "How to Gracefully Leverage an Outside Job Offer," a recent article by Anna Goldfarb in The New York Times.
Should you decide to go the leverage route, your first step is to "learn the best outcome anyone has ever received in your position."
"If a superstar in your field was able to leverage a stellar outside offer," Goldfarb writes, "be clear in what ways your achievements are similar or dissimilar."
That's easy. You and the superstar both breath oxygen. Otherwise, the similarities are zero.
And you have an additional liability. The company wants to keep the superstar. You, they can't wait to get rid of.
"Consult mentors" is good advice if you have any. In your case, "consult bartenders" will have to suffice. These wise and caring individuals definitely do not want to see a good customer leave the area and will be sure to provide sage advice for keeping you around.
"Be transparent" is another Goldfarb tip. Tell your boss you are entertaining an offer and promise to keep them up to date. Pay close attention to their reaction. If the idea of your possible exit makes your boss's eyes light up, you know you may be leaving soon, job offer or not.
In this case, a good follow-up is, "But I'm so happy here, I would happily work for much less." See how little you can get your salary reduced and still keep your job.
Now, that's shrewd negotiating!
Another way to leverage an outside offer is to use it to negotiate improved job conditions. For example, ask to work remotely. Or, in your case, ask to not work remotely.
Job experts advise you to "position your personal needs as a benefit to the company." For example, don't frame a telecommuting request around, "Oh, it'll be great to sidestep traffic."
Instead, point out that by working from home you'll be able to sleep later and never miss an episode of "Temptation Island." This won't improve your job performance, but it will make you a lot more fun at the holiday party.
In all phases of the negotiation, be positive. "Ask what kind of prospects you have in your current position and see if your boss can help you get there."
Since the current prospect is being summarily fired, there's no doubt your boss can help you get there. If your best outcome is to stay employed, you may have to turn to the ultimate weapon available to any employee -- flattery.
"I don't care about extra money or lavish perks," you tell your boss. "It is worth much more to me to stay here and learn from you."
If you can say this with a straight face, you deserve a big raise and a career change. You'll definitely do well in politics.
If all these ploys fail and you're forced to take the great new job, Goldfarb strongly recommends that you "don't burn bridges." On the contrary, you should maintain relationships with former colleagues by "keeping in touch and catching up over coffee whenever possible."
One good way to do this is to borrow as much money from as many colleagues as you can before you walk out the door. This will keep you in their minds, trust me, and you can use the extra money to pick up the checks for those delightful "forget-me-not" coffee dates.
This would be a thoughtful move by a considerate person who has been lucky enough to get a great new job, but I wouldn't advise it.
You don't want everyone to think you've changed.

Texto completo: Four officers at the city's notorious Rikers Island jail accused of standing idly by as a teenage inmate tried to hang himself on Thanksgiving have been wrongfully punished, their union boss said Wednesday - and he claims jail surveillance video will prove it.
The unnamed Department of Correction officers got bumped off payroll several days after Nicholas Feliciano, 18, wrapped a piece of garment around his neck Nov. 28 while he was in a cell in an intake room at a Rikers facility.
Feliciano (inset) allegedly stepped off a platform in an apparent suicide attempt and then struggled to regain his footing - all while officers watched and did nothing to intervene for at least seven minutes, according to a report in The New York Times.
But Elias Husamudeen, president of the correction officers' union, refuted that account - and said the jail's own footage from the George R. Vierno Center disproves it.
"There is no video of [officers] standing and watching an inmate trying to kill himself," Husamudeen told the Daily News Wednesday.
"How do you insinuate that four corrections officers were standing there for seven minutes watching this man try to kill himself? That's preposterous, that's almost criminal. That never, ever happened."
Feliciano remains on life support in the prison ward at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens nearly a week after his attempted suicide.
The Legal Aid Society - the public defender organization that represents Feliciano in court - has called on the Correction Department to give his family complete access to his hospital room. Right now, family members must abide by jail visiting hours and restrictions.
Feliciano's grandmother, Madeline Feliciano, felt humiliated by correction officers after visiting Feliciano on Wednesday, a source said. When she asked an officer if she and other family members could be alone with her grandson, the officer said no. The officer then proceeded to search under his pillows, in the closets and other parts of the room while Madeline Feliciano and her daughter were trying to pray.
Mayor de Blasio tweeted the allegations that officers failed to immediately intervene in Feliciano's suicide attempt are "deeply troubling."
"The people in our jails are human beings," de Blasio wrote. "Their well-being is our responsibility."
The teen was being held at Rikers for a state parole violation when he tied a piece of clothing around his neck and the other end around a pipe on the ceiling before stepping off a partition separating a toilet from the rest of the cell, sources said.
Husamudeen - who did not see the video but was been briefed on the surveillance footage - said officers moving around the intake area jumped into action when they realized what Feliciano was doing.
Feliciano - who bought a firearm and tested positive for drug use while on parole - has seven sealed prior arrests, including for public lewdness. He has a long mental health history and has made past suicide attempts, according to Legal Aid.
Husamudeen said the teen should've been housed in a facility that could accommodate his mental health needs.
"The person who made the decision to house this inmate at [the Rikers lockup] should be fired," he said, noting the detention center is not properly equipped to handle inmates like Feliciano. "We're the scapegoat for the incompetency of the department."
Also on Wednesday, the Legal Aid Society hailed a decision by the State Department of Correction and Community Supervision to cancel the parole warrant pending against the teen. But it also lashed out at the Correction Department's "failure to properly screen and address Mr. Feliciano's mental health issues, which were known to the city at the time of his remand."
A spokeswoman for the department's health services states that "addressing the health needs of all patients in custody is our priority, and we provide medical and mental health care regardless of where the individual is housed within the city's jail system."

Texto completo: The House Judiciary Committee took a major step Wednesday toward defining how it could craft articles of impeachment against President Trump, encompassing both the president's alleged abuse of power in the Ukraine scandal and obstruction of justice stemming from the Russia investigation.
In a daylong hearing marked by sharp partisan bickering, Democrats outlined a sweeping array of presidential misconduct that they said could warrant impeachment, including jeopardizing the constitutional balance of powers by stonewalling Congress and damaging the integrity of national elections by asking Ukraine to investigate Democrats.
With Democrats racing to bring impeachment to a vote, possibly before Christmas, Republicans have denounced the process as rushed and unfair.

But the committee chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), suggested the accelerated pace would block Trump from further misbehavior.
"If we do not act to hold him in check now, President Trump will almost certainly try again to solicit interference in the election for his personal political gain," Nadler said.
The panel is responsible for drafting any articles of impeachment, and Wednesday's hearing thus marked a milestone in a fast-tracked inquiry that began in September. It followed two weeks of public hearings in the House Intelligence Committee, and a Democratic report issued on Tuesday that cited "overwhelming" evidence that Trump violated his oath of office.
Trump weighed in from a NATO summit in London, accusing Democrats of being "very unpatriotic" for scheduling the hearing while he was abroad.
"I think it's a disgrace. I think the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves," he said before flying home Wednesday night.
Republicans on the committee staunchly defended Trump, denouncing the Democratic-led proceedings as a "sham" and "a simple railroad job." Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the ranking member, said Democrats were motivated by "a deep-seated hatred of a man who came to the White House and did what he said he was going to do."
Although the hearing produced no new facts about Trump's activities or communications, it gave Democrats an opportunity to preview three potential articles of impeachment.
The first was abuse of power by urging Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to announce investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential opponent in the 2020 election, and a debunked theory about Ukraine's supposed meddling in the 2016 election.
The next was obstruction of Congress by refusing to honor subpoenas and ordering witnesses not to testify in the impeachment inquiry.
The final issue was obstruction of justice for, among other things, instructing his White House counsel to dismiss Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel heading the Russia investigation. Mueller was left in place, and he submitted a lengthy report in March that found no direct coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign, the initial focus of his inquiry.
Four legal scholars testified about whether Trump's actions were impeachable offenses under the Constitution. Only one, who was called by Republicans, said he did not consider Trump's actions impeachable.
"If you rush this impeachment, you're going to leave half the country behind," said Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School. "This is not an impulse buy item."
Although Turley said he considered Trump's actions improper, he said that Democrats had not made an adequate case for impeachment and that moving forward would be a historic mistake. He called the Democrats' case thin compared to the evidence presented against President Nixon in 1974 and President Clinton in 1998.
"What we leave in the wake of this scandal will shape our democracy for generations to come," he said. "I am concerned with lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger."
The three scholars called by Democrats all agreed Trump should be impeached, even suggesting Congress would be derelict in its duty if it failed to do so.
"If we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy. We live in a monarchy, or we live in a dictatorship," said Noah Feldman, a Harvard University law professor.
Pamela Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor, said Trump had tried to "strong-arm a foreign leader into smearing one of the president's opponents in our ongoing election season. That's not politics as usual."
She added, "It is a cardinal reason why the Constitution contains an impeachment power."
Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor who has written a widely respected textbook on impeachment, said the House had no choice but to push forward.
"If Congress fails to impeach here," he said, "then the impeachment process has lost all meaning and, along with that, our Constitution's carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil."
There was little attempt to find common ground or challenge opposing viewpoints. Democrats mostly questioned their own witnesses, while Republicans either delivered speeches or queried their own witness.
At times, Democrats and witnesses struggled to speak without interruption as Republicans called for adjourning the hearing or holding one of their own. They also asked to subpoena the still-unidentified whistleblower who set the scandal in motion by filing a complaint about Trump's July 25 phone call with Zelensky.
Impeachment proceedings are expected to continue in the Judiciary Committee next week, but Democrats will have to quickly finalize articles of impeachment and send them to the House floor if they want a vote before Christmas.
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said Wednesday that while that deadline is possible, Democrats have left open the possibility that the vote will slip into January.
Both chambers are preparing for what appears an inevitable impeachment vote in coming weeks.
Vice President Mike Pence huddled with House Republicans ahead of Wednesday's hearing, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) did the same with Democrats.
Similar meetings took place in the Senate, which would hold a trial to determine whether to remove Trump from office if the House votes to impeach.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) gave a presentation on the mechanics of a trial to familiarize Democrats who weren't in office in 1999, the last time the Senate held an impeachment trial. Clinton was acquitted in that trial.
Senate Republicans released a 2020 calendar with no plans for January, a reminder of the unpredictability of when impeachment articles may arrive from the House.
If the articles are drafted and approved by the full House, Trump would be the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. None was removed from office by the Senate. A fourth, Nixon, resigned when it was clear he would be impeached and convicted.
While the hearing was underway, the New York Times reported that Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, was visiting Ukraine to meet with former prosecutors who have faced allegations of corruption and promoted unfounded claims about Biden and his son Hunter.
"I am defending my client against almost self-evident false charges. Not confirming where I am," he told the Los Angeles Times in a text.
Giuliani has defied a subpoena from impeachment investigators and is under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, who are scrutinizing whether he violated laws regarding lobbying for a foreign government.

Texto completo: Germany's federal prosecutor took over an inquiry into the murder of a former commander of Chechen separatists, and the authorities expelled two Russian diplomats.
BERLIN -- The German authorities declared on Wednesday that Russia was suspected of being behind the daylight assassination in Berlin this summer of a former fighter with Chechen separatists. Berlin also expelled two Russian diplomats, adding new strains to relations with Moscow.
The announcement deepened concerns about Russian contract killings in Europe, after last year's nerve agent poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian spy who was living in Britain. Western countries responded to that by expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats from their countries, and German lawmakers called for a similar joint European response to the killing in Berlin.
Peter Frank, Germany's federal prosecutor, said his office would take over the case, identifying the suspect, who is believed to be a Russian contract killer, only as Vadim K., in keeping with German privacy laws.
The Dossier Center, a London-based research group founded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, a Russian former oil billionaire, and other investigation groups had previously identified the suspect as Vadim N. Krasikov.
The Dossier Center shared with the German authorities what it described as compelling evidence linking the killing to the Russian government, a spokesman said last month. Many of the details cited by the federal prosecutor on Wednesday checked against those previously released by the center.
The German authorities had struggled to identify the suspect since he was taken into police custody in August, after witnesses said they had seen him ride a bicycle up to the victim and shoot him once in the torso and twice in the head before fleeing the scene.
Although the authorities considered Russian involvement virtually from the start, it was only in recent weeks that sufficient evidence was gathered to back those suspicions, Mr. Frank said in a statement.
The additional evidence elevated the killing of the former fighter, a Russian-Georgian citizen identified by prosecutors only as Tornike K., from a simple murder case to a state security threat.
"There are sufficient, real indications that the killing of Tornike K. was carried out either on orders by the officials in the Russian Federation or those in the autonomous Chechen Republic, as part of the Russian Republic," Mr. Frank's office said in a statement.
The victim was previously identified by the German authorities by an alias, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former commander of a Chechen separatist force whom the Russian state news media has depicted as a terrorist.
The prosecutor cited photographs of the suspect that matched images of a Vadim K. who had been sought by the Russian authorities for a 2013 murder in Moscow that was also carried out by an assassin on a bicycle. The Russian authorities later withdrew the warrant, although the investigation remained open, German prosecutors said.
Immediately after the announcement, the Foreign Ministry in Berlin ordered two diplomats stationed at the Russian Embassy expelled, citing Moscow's unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that Russia would take "a little time" to work out its countermeasures, the news agency Interfax reported.
Maria V. Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, denounced what she called Germany's "politicized approach" to the murder investigation. "We view the German claims regarding the expulsion of two employees of the Russian Embassy in Berlin to be groundless and unfriendly," Ms. Zakharova said, according to Russian news agencies. "We will be forced to implement a set of measures in response."
The German authorities' frustration with their Russian counterparts built over three months as investigators in Berlin investigated the case but received no help from Moscow in identifying the man in their custody.
Eventually, the office of Chancellor Angela Merkel became involved and a complaint was made to the Kremlin about the lack of cooperation. On Wednesday, Ms. Merkel defended the decision to expel the Russian diplomats as a consequence of the inaction. "We took this step because we did not see that Russia was supporting our investigation of this murder," she told reporters in Watford, England, where Western leaders are gathered to celebrate NATO's 70th anniversary. According to the prosecutor, the suspect was carrying a Russian passport when arrested on Aug. 23 that the Russian authorities confirmed as authentic. Although the document identified him as Vadim Andreevich Sokolov, investigators said at the time that they believed the name was fake.
The suspect had arrived in Europe on a flight from Moscow to Paris and entered on a visa previously issued by French authorities that allowed him to work and move freely throughout the European Union, the prosecutor added. Three days later, he continued to Warsaw, where he checked into a hotel for a five-night stay. After only three nights, however, he left and did not return. The following day he was arrested in Berlin.
The man's visa said he had been employed as an engineer since 2017 at a company called Zao Rust, based in St. Petersburg. But according to records in Russia, the company was in "reorganization" in 2019 and had only one employee in 2018, according to the prosecutor.
When the German authorities tried to contact the company, they discovered that the fax number listed for it was the same as that of two other companies, both belonging to the Russian Defense Ministry, the prosecutor said.
Mr. Khodorkovsky, the founder of the Dossier Center, said in an interview that, "The Kremlin is no longer ashamed of reasonable suspicions that it carries out murders in Western Europe."
"No democracy can allow this," he added, warning that "indulging" Russia would not pay off in the long term.
Many German lawmakers have said that they believe the evidence implicating Russia from the Dossier Center -- as well as from the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and from Bellingcat, an investigative group -- is strong enough to merit the case being treated as a matter of state security.
"The federal prosecutor taking over is a good sign that should have come weeks ago," said Konstantin von Notz, a lawmaker for the opposition Greens and deputy leader of the parliamentary committee that oversees the country's intelligence services.
Roderich Kiesewetter, a foreign affairs expert for Ms. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party, said the new evidence justified sanctions against Moscow.
"Russia has repeatedly ignored Germany's request, as a partner, for an explanation and to help identify the suspected perpetrator," Mr. Kiesewetter said.
"The evidence we have now points to the involvement of a Russian state actor," he added. "Therefore, it is correct to respond to the lack of cooperation with diplomatic sanctions to make clear our intention for a swift clarification."
The one compelling lead the Germans had early on -- a mysterious email sent shortly after the shooting that identified the killer as a former St. Petersburg police officer imprisoned for murder -- turned out to be a dead end. The German authorities now believe that the officer in question, who was first publicly identified by The New York Times, remains in a Russian prison, 1,500 miles from Berlin.
In a letter sent to The Times, someone claiming to be the St. Petersburg police officer, Vladimir Stepanov, denied that he had anything to do with the killing in Berlin and insisted he was still in prison.
The return address was IK-11, a penal colony in the Russian town of Bor that is said to be reserved for former law enforcement and intelligence officers convicted of serious crimes.
A stamp indicated the letter had been inspected by the prison authorities.
Other countries are watching the Berlin investigation closely.
"We find it sad that a Georgian citizen was killed in the middle of the day in central Berlin and so many questions remain open," said Elguja Khokrishvili, the Georgian ambassador to Germany. "We hope that the German authorities will pursue this case until we know the truth."

Black Scholars Are Not 'Rare Creatures'

Texto completo: When Purdue's president said this, I had to respond because this myth is so pervasive.
This essay has been updated to reflect news developments.
In late November, the president of Purdue University, Mitch Daniels, told students that he will soon "be recruiting one of the rarest creatures in America -- a leading, I mean a really leading, African-American scholar."
"Creatures?" a student asked. "Come on."
"It's a figure of speech. You must have taken some literature," Mr. Daniels said. "One of the rarest, let me say, rarest birds, rarest, rarest, rarest phenomena."
In just a few sentences, Mr. Daniels seemed to question the possibility of sustained black excellence. In response to the uproar that swiftly followed, he complained that he had "never felt so misunderstood" and that he had simply used a "figure of speech." On Wednesday, he apologized and retracted the statement.
When I learned about Mr. Daniels's words from another African-American scholar on my own campus, I felt indignant but also constrained. The standard etiquette for college presidents, like me, is to let the remarks of another leader pass on by.
Even though he apologized, I can't do that. The idea that scholars of color are rare is a damaging fiction. Yet it's pervasive in academia, causing untold damage. It allows some faculty deans to simply throw up their hands and give up on their recruitment efforts. It leads to small recruitment budgets for minority candidates.
It means some disciplines structurally ignore the presence of brilliant candidates of color, believing, contrary to their own eyes, that none exist. It means that another generation of younger scholars may think it's impossible ever to lead. It means lost creativity, delayed discoveries and fewer transformative ideas of the kind our world desperately needs. And for those who want to maintain the status quo, mission accomplished.
It's true that the number of black scholars is smaller than one would like. But they're also suppressed by the fiction that black leadership is an impossible dream -- a rare bird.
After Mr. Daniels's remarks, Purdue faculty members said in a statement that "the idea that there is a scarcity of leading African-American scholars is simply not true." Indeed, one might look to scholarly societies for leading figures: Alondra Nelson, president of the Social Science Research Council; Elizabeth Alexander, president of the Mellon Foundation; Cecilia Conrad, a managing director at the MacArthur Foundation; and Claude Steele, chair of the board of the Russell Sage Foundation. Or leaders at American colleges and universities like Jonathan Holloway, provost of Northwestern; Raynard Kington, president of Grinnell College; and Michael Drake, president of Ohio State University.
Figures of speech matter, because they may shape our thoughts, set our expectations and quickly lead us to dangerous places as a society. When a group is stripped of their humanity through language, they are easier to exclude or hate.
I know my colleague intended only to make a single point. But which point? There are truly leading African-American scholars. There are in fact whole societies of African-American scholars who work on just about every area under the sun. Take Andre Fenton, whose work in neuroscience explores the mechanics of memory; or a rising star like Sanmi Koyejo at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, whose work on neural networks has been recognized by the Kavli Foundation. Political science? Omar Wasow at Princeton. Math? Edray Goins at Pomona. Or on the rise, John Urshel at M.I.T. Literature? Saidiya Hartman, Columbia. Henry Louis Gates Jr., Harvard. Art history? Richard J. Powell, Duke.
This is in no way a comprehensive list of leading African-American scholars, but I have to stop somewhere. The talented scholars leading historically black colleges have underscored this point for nearly 200 years. As colleagues, we must commit to an honest and rigorous review of the evidence before us and, as scholars, we uphold a simple standard: When we don't know, we have the curiosity and humility to ask.
As an English professor, I also know that metaphors are intended to have multiple meanings and that hurt and belittling are among them. Animal metaphors can simultaneously assert the dominance of the declarer while diminishing the declared: Women? Dogs. Black people? Monkeys. Immigrants? Vermin.
Pointing this out is not an exercise in hypersensitivity. Telling the truth -- without hiding ugly realities in polite silence -- is the very thing that some critics of higher education claim to do. However, speaking out is only the beginning of an education. The most insidious metaphors have a way of getting into the walls, corners and attics of our discourse. The least we can do is switch on the lights.

Texto completo: Physicians for Human Rights corroborates claims that Bashar al-Assad's government has criminalized giving care to its enemies, a violation of international law.
The nearly 9-year-old conflict in Syria has been punctuated by repeated violations of what is considered acceptable in war, including the military's use of chemical weapons, torture of prisoners and recurrent bombings of hospitals in rebel-held areas. Less attention has been paid to another outcome: the government's criminalization of medical care.
On Wednesday, Physicians for Human Rights, a group that has documented the collapse of Syria's health care system, released a study asserting that over the course of the war, President Bashar al-Assad has successfully made medical assistance to his enemies a crime.
Whether it is disinfecting a fighter's wound or even supplying painkillers to clinics in an insurgent-held neighborhood, such acts are punishable under a counterterrorism law enacted by Mr. al-Assad's government just over a year after the conflict began in March of 2011. A special court has tried tens of thousands under the law, including many medical workers.
"This report illustrates how the Syrian government has effectively criminalized the provision of nondiscriminatory care to all, regardless of political affiliation," Physicians for Human Rights said in the study. Health workers who provide care in line with their legal and ethical obligations, it said, are branded as "enemies of the state" in Syria.
The study is based on extensive interviews with 21 formerly detained Syrian health care workers who have fled the country, including seven physicians, four pharmacists, three medical volunteers, one paramedic and one psychiatrist. All said they had endured torture and interrogations while imprisoned and did not want to be identified by name, fearing retribution against their families or against themselves if they ever returned.
A majority of them were arrested, the study said, "because of their status as care providers, and their real or perceived involvement in the provision of health services to opposition members and sympathizers."
The New York Times interviewed three of them who said they had been detained and interrogated for months. They described cells so cramped that inmates took turns to rest. Two of them -- a pharmacist and a surgeon -- said they had been arrested at their workplaces.
Most of the former detainees described a similar process of extracting confessions that could be prosecuted under the counterterrorism law, the Physicians for Human Rights study said. "Most had judicial review of their cases by either military field courts, military courts, or counterterrorism court, where due process protections are suspended in practice," it said.
There was no immediate comment by the Syrian authorities to the study. Mr. al-Assad's government has repeatedly defended the counterterrorism law as a necessity for what he contends is his success in retaking and stabilizing most of the country, where by some estimates a half-million people have been killed and roughly half the prewar population of 22 million have fled their homes.
Ibrahim al-Kasem, a Syrian lawyer who used to represent detainees, said that trials in military courts are held in secret, and detainees can be tried in the counterterrorism court without their lawyers. In such settings, he said, "the judges have the ability to do anything."
Mr. al-Kasem is now the executive director of the Caesar-File Group, established after a Syrian military police photographer code-named "Caesar" released 55,000 images in 2014 believed to show evidence of the systematic torture and death of thousands of detainees.
Rights activists and legal scholars say the counterterrorism law itself is exceedingly vague on what constitutes terrorism so that even peaceful acts could be prosecuted. They say the law also violates a precept of the Geneva Conventions that obliges doctors and other health care professionals to treat the wounded and sick, regardless which side they may support.
"The law is problematic," said Mai El-Sadany, legal and judicial director at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, a Washington-based research group. "The reality is that under this law, anyone could be a terrorist."
When and if the Syria war ends, she said, keeping such a law on the books would present an enormous challenge to rebuilding the country. "How can people begin to return to a state where they suffer the risk of prosecution?" she said.
Mr. al-Assad's government was a pioneer in the targeting of health care workers as a battlefield strategy, and has been ignoring criticism of the policy for years. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry, a panel of investigators that has been collecting evidence of human rights violations in Syria, said back in 2013 that government forces had been systematically denying treatment to the sick and wounded in areas controlled by the opposition.
"The denial of medical care as a weapon of war is a distinct and chilling reality of the war in Syria," the panel said.
Michiel Hofman, the senior humanitarian specialist at Doctors Without Borders, a medical charity that operates in insurgent-held areas of northern Syria, traced the targeting of health care workers to the prelude to the war, when peaceful protesters wounded by Mr. al-Assad's security forces sought treatment at hospitals.
"The authorities said, yes you can treat people but you have to report the patients to the police. Patients didn't want to be reported to the police, so health care workers created clinics in homes and underground hospitals," Mr. Hofman said. "The Syrian authorities regarded these hospitals as illegal, right from the start, and a vicious cycle was created early in the conflict."
Asked about the prospects for rebuilding Syria's health care system, Mr. Hofman was pessimistic.
"The reason for the persecution of medical workers has not been removed," he said. "Attacks on health care have become the new normal."
The vast majority of detainees interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights said they would not go back to Syria under the current conditions, said Rayan Koteiche, one of the study's authors. "The continuing threat and persecution of professions including medical professionals is a huge barrier to returning," he said. "To freely practice in accordance with their code of ethics -- they don't see that as possible."

Texto completo: In the immediate aftermath of Kamala Harris dropping out of the 2020 presidential race, fellow contender Julian Castro claimed that the media "held her to a different standard." He's right. The media gave the California senator a deck stacked firmly in her favor, and she spent it all on Twitter points that cost her a fatal polling plummet.
The media didn't just rig the game for Harris this year. It's been going on for nearly a decade.
As early as 2004, the Los Angeles Times fawned over the "striking" then-district attorney of San Francisco, a "rising political star" with a "radiant smile." She was not yet a year on the job.
Six years later, as she ran for state attorney general, The Daily Beast spent plenty of words waxing poetic over her elegant attire and "exotic" ethnicity but very few on her actual record as DA. Once she won the race, Ben Smith, then at Politico, equated Harris with another "eloquent, telegenic big-city lawyer with strong liberal credentials who catapulted from relative obscurity to the national stage": Barack Obama.
Just two years into an attorney general tenure characterized by the aggressive incarceration of nonviolent offenders, Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post mused that Harris would be a "powerful" presidential candidate, not due to her wafer-thin record but because she "could well be the only woman and the only African American candidate in the field."
When she carried a background of criminalizing truancy and vilifying sex workers to a Senate seat, the press debated whether she'd be the next president or vice president. In the chamber, she didn't have any sort of legislative achievements to speak of, but she did manage to launch incoherent diatribes against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The media fawned over her stunt, and buzz for her 2020 run bloomed.
Harris launched her campaign to media fanfare, with coastal institutions from the Los Angeles Times to the New York Times deeming her a front-runner, despite polling at just 6% nationally. She had no answers for her corruption as California's top cop, so instead, she (literally) dangled shiny jackets in front of the press, and they jumped.
TweetTweet
When Harris decided to attack Joe Biden (vice president to the first black occupant of the White House) as racist for not backing federally forced busing integration, the media ran with the attack on Biden for an entire news cycle. Too bad, because, as it turned out, Harris actually held the same exact position.
Harris managed to reverse herself on every issue from "Medicare for all" to marijuana legalization with virtually no media scrutiny. It took Tulsi Gabbard eviscerating her prosecutorial record with the precision of a surgeon for the media to finally discern that a decade of Harris's past was built on the opposite of progressivism.
For once, Democrats need to stop absolving bad candidates of their responsibility for their campaign's failure. Obama managed to win the lily-white early states of the 2008 primary and then the presidency, and Warren has had one of the steepest rises in this primary while Harris has fallen.
The media didn't punish Harris. They helped her, and she threw her advantage away anyway. That's her fault, and her's alone.

Texto completo: El abogado personal de Trump Rudy Giuliani , viajó a Budapest y Kiev esta semana, para r eunirse con fiscales ucranianos y continuar difamando a Joe Biden como parte de una serie documental para un canal de noticias de derecha, informó el New York Times.
Según los informes, Giuliani se reunió con el ex fiscal general Yuriy Lutsenko en Budapest el martes y tendrá reuniones con otro ex fiscal general, Viktor Shokin , y un ex fiscal adjunto llamado Konstantin Kulyk en Kiev, el miércoles.
Estas reuniones tuvieron lugar como parte de una “serie documental” que One America News (OAN), un canal de noticias de derecha, está llevando a cabo.
El documental presentará a Giuliani y otros relatando teorías desacreditadas sobre la supuesta interferencia ucraniana en las elecciones de 2016 e investigaciones sobre el trabajo de Hunter Biden en la gerencia de una compañía de gas ucraniana.
La serie tiene como objetivo contrarrestar la investigación para el juicio político de que el presidente Trump intentó extorsionar a Ucrania para que realizara investigaciones contra Joe Biden, lo cual le daría ventaja en las próximas elecciones, apoyada en el testimonio de docenas de testigos en las audiencias de juicio político llevadas a cabo por el presidente del Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes, Adam Schiff (D-CA).
Giuliani tuiteó sobre el proyecto el martes:
Working on an important project with @OANN, intended to bring before the American people information Schiff (recently disclosed investor in Franklin Templton) “Star chamber” proceedings have covered up. Stay tuned.

Texto completo: I fled from a dictator in Venezuela, only to witness the rise of another one here in the United States.
I moved to the U.S. in 2011 after a dictator forced me to leave my country, my family, my friends, and my whole life. In Venezuela, I fought, marched, protested and voted, but the dictator won the fight.
Coming from Venezuela, I recognize a populist demagogue promising anything at the expense of a country's own people. I will never forget Trump's first campaign speech, it rang an alarm. I saw a man dividing the American people for the sake of his own rise. There is a phrase that summarizes it "Divide y vencerás" (divide and conquer).
When I see a government try to remove judges, destroy democratic institutions, call the media fake news when they expose corruption, a leader trying to punish his political rivals, I remember what I left behind in Venezuela and I see it in the United States with President Trump's disregard for the rule of law.
Not only did I escape from socialism, I, too, am a victim of a corrupt and cruel regime, and won't accept the GOP trying to hide Trump's corruption and failures by distorting what Democrats are doing to help us all. It is outrageous to watch the Republican Party cover their "único líder" (only leader) with excuses for him and leave our democracy in peril.
I remember watching Venezuela's Hugo Chavez harass people who dissented from his views, calling us "fascists" and "piti yankees." (little yankees). Now I see Trump and the Republicans call Democrats "socialists" because we defend voting rights; we want to expand access to health care; and, we are making sure that the president is not above the law - as Venezuela's current president Nicolás Maduro thinks he is.
I will never forget standing in front of our TV in Caracas in 2007, watching in tears the last minutes that Radio Caracas Television - one of the most popular TV channels in Venezuela -was on air before it was shut down by Chávez. He had decided to silence them when months earlier they had exposed the high levels of corruption and the crisis in Venezuela. When a dictator doesn't like the truth being exposed, they call the media "fake news" and they censor it. If Trump had the power to do the same, you could bet he would shut down CNN and the New York Times.
A few months ago in a rally in North Carolina, Trump said "if they don't love it, tell them to leave it," in reference to people who disagree with his point of view. Seven years ago, Diosdado Cabello used similar words against those who didn't like the situation in Venezuela: "Si no les gusta la inseguridad, que se vayan del país" (if you don't like violence, leave the country). This is how dictators rule.
Never would I have thought that I would come to the land of the free and see the same nightmare start to play out again. I know very well that with Trump, the United States' fate may follow that of Venezuela.
I was recently asked how I, as an Hispanic, could be supporting Democrats. The answer is simple. I believe in democracy and democratic values. No matter where I am, no matter how far I am from Venezuela, I will always defend freedom and liberty. I lost democracy once and I am not going to lose it again.
Luisana Pérez Fernández came to the United States from Venezuela in 2011. She is the Hispanic Communications Director for the Florida Democratic Party.

Iran is brutally suppressing dissent

Texto completo: As Iran guns down protesters at home, it's also waging a global campaign of suppression against dissidents in the United States and other countries.
Iran's attacks on critics abroad have been brazen. In recent months, anti-regime activists have been kidnapped, murdered and harassed, according to news reports and interviews with activists. The FBI and security agencies in Europe are monitoring these assaults.
Images from inside Iran of the spreading protests have gone viral on the Internet, including sometimes gruesome pictures of those killed in the streets. Amnesty International counts more than 140 dead since the unrest began Nov. 15 because of public anger over a hike in gas prices. Sources in Iran told the New York Times that more than 200 have been killed, 1,900 injured and 7,000 arrested.
'As the existential threats to the regime grow, it will employ every manner of violence to eliminate their perceived enemies. It is the one skill Iran has successfully mastered,' says Roya Hakakian, whose book 'Assassins of the Turquoise Palace' documented Iranian murder of dissidents abroad.
The uprising is sustained partly by Iranians outside the country, who are exchanging videos of the protests and violent suppression. Masih Alinejad, the U.S.-based activist who in 2014 started a women's protest movement called 'My Stealthy Freedom,' said this week that she had received and reposted more than 2,000 videos from inside the country.
The recent wave of demonstrations against the Iranian regime has been powerful partly because it gathers so many streams of dissent " from Iran and the diaspora; from women's rights activists and working-class Iranians angry about living standards; and from the diverse ethnic groups in Iran.
Iran's economic troubles, which catalyzed protests, stem partly from harsh U.S. economic sanctions imposed by President Trump last year as the United States withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement. The United States has promoted the recent signs of unrest. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Tuesday that U.S. agencies have collected more than 20,000 videos and other protest messages from inside Iran, despite the regime's attempts to block the Internet.
In recent interviews, dissident Iranians in the United States described intimidation by Tehran's operatives, including death threats. Where Saudi Arabia's suppression of dissent, including the brutal murder of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, has rightly been condemned, Iran's assaults have received less attention.
Alinejad, whose #WhiteWednesdays campaign urged women to remove their head covering and wear white scarves in defiance of the clerical leaders, said she had been harassed since she launched this movement. She said Iranian state television initially broadcast a false report that she had been raped by three men to intimidate her, and that a commentator later threatened to cut off her breasts and tongue.
When Alinejad persisted in her social media protests, she received death threats, harassing phone calls and a warning that she would be arrested if she ever entered an Iranian embassy. Alinejad first reported these threats to the FBI five years ago.
'For the regime, my life is not as important as my hair,' Alinejad said in an interview. 'They're scared of me. This gives me power.'
Last year, Iranian security officers interrogated Alinejad's mother in her small village near the Caspian Sea, hoping to force her to denounce her daughter on television. The mother refused. In September, the authorities arrested Alinejad's brother, Alireza; he was prevented from seeing his family after his sister began publicizing the recent protests. Undaunted, Alinejad filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington this week accusing the regime of 'terrorism, torture, hostage taking' and other crimes.
Saeed Ghasseminejad, an activist jailed in Evin prison in 2003 before escaping Iran, said he has received repeated death threats and harassment since joining the Foundation for Defense of Democracies as an analyst in 2014. Like Alinejad, he has told the FBI that some threats appeared to come from people inside the United States. An FBI spokesman wouldn't discuss Iranian activities in the United States.
Iranian dissidents abroad face greater danger. Last month, an activist named Massoud Molavi, who ran a website called Black Box, publishing details about corruption in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was murdered in Istanbul. In October, Ruhollah Zam, a dissenter who ran a news network called Amadnews with 1.4 million followers, was lured from his exile home in Paris and kidnapped to Iran, in what the IRGC boasted was a 'complicated intelligence operation.' In 2017, Saeed Karimian, the chief executive of an independent news channel called Gem TV, was murdered in Istanbul.
These brave Iranian dissidents all convey the same story: Iran is brutally suppressing popular dissent, and the world is watching.

Texto completo: Grass-roots movements in Iran, Iraq and other nations continue to push for rights nonetheless.
Having covered the Middle East my entire adult life, I'm seeing some trends emerging there that I've never seen before.
One is from the streets of Beirut to the streets of Baghdad to streets all across Iran, Middle Easterners are demanding to be treated as citizens with rights, and not just members of a sect or tribe with passions to be manipulated. And they're clamoring for noncorrupt institutions -- a deep state -- and the rule of law, not just the arbitrary rule of militias, thugs or autocrats.
And right when Middle Easterners are demanding to be treated as citizens -- not Sunnis or Shiites -- Americans are devolving into Sunnis and Shiites or, as we call them, Democrats and Republicans, with the same tribal mentality: rule or die.
And worse, the G.O.P. has elevated the exact same kind of autocrat that Middle Easterners are trying to get rid of. Our sultan is just like one of theirs: He shirks the rule of law, nurtures a cult of personality through his own state-directed media, surrounds himself with sycophants, con men and conspiracy buffs, and denounces our professional deep state -- its bureaucrats, diplomats and military officers -- for trying to shackle him with our 230-year-old constitutional checks and balances.
Go figure. We're becoming them right when they want to become us -- or what used to be us.
The other trend I'm seeing is the striking contrast between what Middle East politics has long been about in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen and what average people in these countries are now seeking.
For years, Sunni and Shiite party bosses and militia leaders at the top have manipulated sectarian and tribal identities below to cement themselves in power and make themselves the brokers for who get jobs and contracts. But there's been a stunning shift in the whole flow of politics in some of these countries. It's gone from Sunnis versus Shiites across the board to Sunnis and Shiites at the bottom locking arms together against all their leaders at the top.
You read some amazing stuff coming up from the bottom these days. Here's Christine McCaffray van den Toorn, writing on Al-Monitor.com on Nov. 22, describing the scene in Baghdad's Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the demonstrations there for a nonsectarian, civil state in Iraq:
"Protesters are seizing their country, which was wrenched from them by a corrupt government. In doing so they reaffirm their Iraqiness in the most positive ways. They have even set up reverse checkpoints that welcome citizens but exclude the armed forces. Communities intermingle; different sectors of society stand side by side. Patriotism is on full display. Iraqi flags are everywhere. Women are highly visible. There is a clear rejection of sectarianism, as 'Iraqi' identity is emphasized. Everyone helps each other by whatever means -- money, chaperones, medical care, internet. There is even a laundry service."
Elsewhere, she adds, Iraqi resourcefulness is emerging from the bottom: "Startups, including Iraq's version of Amazon, a grocery-delivery service, co-working spaces and culture cafes, have grown by being outside the purview of the government. There is no shortage of talent or determination to create opportunities in areas where the government has failed. Independent civil society groups, youth and women's organizations have made major headway."
And here's a young Lebanese lawyer friend describing to me what's been happening in Beirut:
"This is Lebanon's 'We the People' moment. The demonstrations are massive, across all regions, across all sects, and against all political parties (no exceptions). They are also overwhelmingly spontaneous, and the protesters are opposed to the entirety of Lebanon's sectarian political establishment, which gives the protests credibility in the eyes of the population. Only Lebanese flags are raised at the demonstrations -- no partisan flags or sectarian symbols. The slogan 'The people want a civil state' is one of the top slogans of the protests."
These movements are authentic and inspiring, but their chances of taking power remain remote, largely because their biggest opponent -- the Islamic republic of Iran -- is ready to arrest and kill as many democracy demonstrators as needed to retain its grip on Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, not to mention at home. Iran's clerical regime has emerged as arguably the biggest enemy of pluralistic democracy in the region today. There are plenty of Arab dictators keeping their own people down, but Iran is doing it at home and in three other countries at once.
Iran has used its Shiite Hezbollah militia in Lebanon and Syria and its Popular Mobilization Forces militia in Iraq to try to snuff out all their bottom-up secular democratic movements -- while also crushing the biggest secular-democracy uprising in Iran itself in 40 years.
The Iranian ayatollahs even had to largely shut down their own internet to prevent the domestic rebellion from spreading. Ever since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2002, Iran has never wanted to see a stable, multisectarian, secular democracy emerge in Baghdad, because then Iranian Shiites would be asking why Iraqi Shiites get to live freely and they don't.
If President Trump really wanted to use Twitter for impact, he'd be tweeting every morning at the supreme leader of Iran: "Hey, Supreme Leader of Iran, which nonsectarian Arab-Muslim democracy movement did you crush today? It's Monday, so it must be Lebanon. It's Tuesday, so Syria. It's Wednesday, Iraq. Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, it must be your own people."
There is no good time for a country like Iran to be suppressing popular movements for pluralistic democracy, but this is a uniquely bad time. We are in an age of acceleration. Technology, globalization and climate change are all accelerating at the same time. The Middle East has got to get its act together if it has any hope of thriving in the 21st century.
For example, Lebanon's protests were sparked when the government proposed taxing WhatsApp and other internet calling services to pay down huge government debts incurred by corrupt politicians. But they were also fueled by the government's inability to deal with massive forest fires spread by high temperatures and prolonged drought. Meanwhile, in places like Libya, Yemen and Syria, kids have missed years of basic schooling. All of this is happening while populations have exploded.
The Arab world and Iran cannot afford to waste another drop of their water, when every climate study shows temperatures rapidly rising in the region; they cannot afford to misspend another dollar of their diminishing oil revenues on guns, civil wars, yachts or corruption, when they need to rebuild so much of their self-destroyed infrastructure that no superpower is going to rebuild for them; they cannot afford to miss another day of school, when lifelong learning is more important than ever to secure and hold a decent job.
If these countries are not able to find a way to break the hold of sectarian misgovernance and find their way to political pluralism, religious pluralism, gender pluralism and education pluralism, their people stand no chance in the 21st century, especially once Mother Nature starts to really hammer them. The entire region could become one giant human development disaster area, with everyone trying to get to Europe.
America, for its part, has to keep looking for ways to collaborate with them on that pluralism project, to the extent that they want our help, with creative diplomacy, and not just wash our hands of the region.
But the bad guys at the top won't go easily, quietly or bloodlessly. And since no outside power will be riding to the rescue, it will take sustained, organized, bottom-up mass movements -- in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran in particular -- to enable the future to bury the past and topple all those at the top who want to use the past to bury the future.
I am so rooting for their success.

$100M proposed to aid drinking water crisis

Texto completo: PARLIER — Rep. TJ Cox unveiled a $100 million "slice of justice" for families in the San Juaquin Valley — and across the nation — suffering contaminated drinking water and crumbling infrastructure.
On Monday, Cox and a smattering of Valley mayors visited a water storage facility in the rural Fresno County community of Pariler, where the congressman announced the Disadvantaged Community Drinking Water Assistance Act.
The proposed bill will help to "close the gap" in funding for impoverished, mid-sized cities that fall through the cracks under current law.
To qualify, communities must have populations numbering fewer than 60,000 people and median household incomes of less than about $65,000. That includes many Tulare County cities, including Porterville and Lindsay.
Tulare just misses the cutoff, counting 63,000 people. Its water system has struggled with 1,2,3 TCP contamination for years and its Matheny Tract neighborhood was ground zero for the state's efforts to legally force smaller water systems to consolidate with larger, neighboring utilities.
Matheny was featured in a New York Times article last week pinning water inequality in rural California to Jim Crow-era laws and racial injustice.
If passed, Cox said his bill will complement California's Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, a landmark $130 million bill passed earlier this year to provide long-term solutions to struggling water systems statewide.
"We provide the world with fruit and vegetables, but if we can't provide the key ingredient of life for our own people, then I think we've really failed the most basic test of governance," said Cox, whose district encompasses all of Kings County and parts of Tulare, Fresno and Kern counties.
"We can't stop until the water coming out of every tap is never in doubt."
Cox worked closely with cities in his district and with environmental justice groups across the Valley to draft the bill that could help dozens of cities achieve safe drinking water standards, he said.
"Ultimately, the goal is to create healthier communities, more affordable communities so that the Valley can continue to thrive as it has for so many years," said Jessi Snider, ...
Self Help has worked to create affordable housing and bring technical assistance to underserved Valley communities and water systems for decades.
Many of the communities Snider works with have water tainted by both agricultural runoff and naturally-occurring chemicals, including arsenic.
Wells in Parlier and Delano are out of production because they exceed the state's minimum contaminant level for 1,2,3 TCP, a toxic byproduct of plastic production that industrial giants Dow Chemical Company and Shell pumped into pesticides and sold to Valley farmers decades ago.
While state aid is available, city leaders say it's not enough to pay for treatment plants that cost millions of dollars annually to build and operate.
Delano Councilwoman Grace Vallejo called Cox's bill a "lifesaver" for her city of about 53,000 — too big to qualify for USDA grants but too small to pay for costly treatment facilities without slamming residents with sky-high utility bills.
"DC needs to hear us: We need clean drinking water if we're going to continue to bring them the fruit and vegetables they need to feed their families," said Alex Garcia, mayor of Wasco, another Kern County ag community plagued by 1,2,3 TCP.
It's time for the federal government to "step up" to solving a drinking water crisis that continues to affect more than 1 million people in California alone, according to the State Water Resources Control Board, Cox said.
"The state is doing their part, now it's time for the federal government to step up to solve this crisis
In Huron, another small Fresno County city, residents pay an average of $119 a month for water they are frequently told is unsafe to drink by state officials.
The city's mayor, Rey León, pointed out that many farmworker families "pay double" for their water in the nation's richest agricultural county.
"That's injustice," he said. "Agriculture depends on farmworkers. The healthier our families are, the healthier our economy is."
Cox is the latest in a litany of legislators to visit the rural Central Valley this year with promises of cleaning up drinking water and aging infrastructure.
In February, newly-elected Gov. Gavin Newsom visited a school in nearby Reedley to sign his first bill into law, $131 million in emergency funding to help alleviate the state's drinking water crisis.
State Senator Melissa Hurtado authored Senate Bill 559, a $400 million package meant to fund repairs to the Friant-Kern Canal, one of the Valley's major irrigation arteries. Her bipartisan bill is languishing at the legislator and will fail if not passed by Jan. 31.
It's unclear if Cox's proposal will suffer a similar fate but overlooked Central Valley residents are hopeful for relief.
"We have nowhere else to turn. No one else has ever reached out to ask," Vallejo said.

President Trump’s reversal on vaping the right call for public health

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

Ross Douthat: The case for Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: The Democratic Party needs a nominee, but right now it has a train wreck instead. The front-runner seems too old for the job and is poised to lose the first two primary season contests. The woman who was supposed to become the front-runner on the basis of her policy chops is sliding in the polls after thoroughly botching her health care strategy. The candidate rising in her place is a 37-year-old mayor of a tiny, not-obviously-thriving city.
Meanwhile several seemingly electable alternatives have failed to catch fire; the party establishment is casting about for other options; and not one but two billionaires are spending millions to try to buy delegates for a brokered convention … which is a not-entirely-unimaginable endgame for the party as it prepares to face down Donald Trump.
The state of the Democratic field reflects the weaknesses of the individual candidates, but it also reflects the heterogenous nature of the Democratic coalition, whose electorate has many more demographic divisions than the mostly white and middle class and aging GOP, and therefore occasionally resembles the 19th-century Hapsburg empire in the challenge it poses to aspiring leaders.
The theory of the Kamala Harris candidacy, whose nose-dive was the subject of a withering pre-mortem from three of my colleagues over Thanksgiving, was that she was well suited to accomplish this unification through the elixir of her female/minority/professional class identities — that she would embody the party’s diversity much as Barack Obama did before her, and subsume the party’s potential tensions under the benevolent stewardship of a multicultural managerialism.
That isn’t happening. But it’s still reasonable for Democratic voters to look for someone who can do a version of what Harris was supposed to do, and build a coalition across the party’s many axes of division.
And there’s an interesting case that the candidate best positioned to do this — the one whose support is most diverse right now — is the candidate whom Obama allegedly promised to intervene against if his nomination seemed likely: the resilient Socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Like other candidates, Sanders’ support has a demographic core: Just as Elizabeth Warren depends on very liberal professionals and Joe Biden on older minorities and moderates, Bernie depends intensely on the young. But his polling also shows an interesting better-than-you-expect pattern, given stereotypes about his support. He does better-than-you-expect with minorities despite having struggled with them in 2016, with moderate voters and $100K-plus earners despite being famously left-wing, and with young women despite all the BernieBro business.
This pattern explains why, in early-state polling, Sanders shows the most strength in very different environments — leading Warren everywhere in the latest FiveThirtyEight average, beating Biden in Iowa and challenging him in more-diverse Nevada, matching Pete Buttigieg in New Hampshire and leading him easily in South Carolina and California.
Now, I have stacked the argument slightly, and left out a crucial axis of division where Sanders does worse than you expect: He struggles badly with his fellow Social Security recipients, the over-65. This weakness and Biden’s strength with these same voters are obvious reasons to doubt the case for Bernie as the unifier, Bernie as the eventual nominee.
Especially since Sanders has thus far ignored my advice (I know, the nerve) that he reassure skeptics by telling them that he has a record as a dealmaker, that he can moderate on certain issues, so they can feel safe supporting him even if they aren’t ready for the revolution.
But still: If you are a wavering Democrat concerned about both party unity and ultimate electability, about exciting all the diverse factions of your base while also competing for the disaffected, both the relative breadth of Bernie’s primary coalition and his decent polling among non-voters and Obama-Trump voters are reasons to give him another look.
That decent polling, I suspect, reflects a sense among voters drawn to populism that Bernie is different from not only the more centrist candidates — latecomers Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick especially, but Buttigieg as well — but also from his fellow left-winger, Warren, who has fully embraced the culture-war breadth of the new progressivism while Sanders remains, fundamentally, an economic-policy monomaniac.
He’s still a social liberal, of course, and he isn’t in the culturally conservative/economic populist quadrant where so many unrepresented voters reside. But for the kind of American who is mostly with the Democrats on economics but wary of progressivism’s zest for culture war, Sanders’ socialism might be strangely reassuring — as a signal of what he actually cares about, and what battles he might eschew for the sake of his anti-plutocratic goals. (At the very least he’s no more radical on an issue like abortion than a studied moderate like Mayor Pete.)
This is why, despite technically preferring a moderate like Biden or Amy Klobuchar, I keep coming back to the conservative’s case for Bernie — which rests on the perhaps-wrong but still attractive supposition that he’s the liberal most likely to spend all his time trying to tax the rich and leave cultural conservatives alone.

Texto completo: A victim of Jeffrey Epstein plans to bring new claims against the perv's famous former personal attorney, Alan Dershowitz, under New York's Child Victims Act.
Virginia Giuffre's attorney Charles Cooper said she would likely take advantage of the new law that allows victims of child sex abuse to sue their alleged abusers. Giuffre has sued Dershowitz (inset) for defamation, charging that the noted Harvard Law professor smeared her name by calling her a liar.
Giuffre claims that Epstein lent her to Dershowitz for sex. Dershowitz adamantly denies he slept with any of Epstein's victims, including Giuffre. He dismissed her plan to sue under the Child Victims Act as a publicity stunt.
"She wasn't a child," Dershowitz said after the hearing in Manhattan Federal Court, adding that she has testified she wasn't underage when Epstein began trafficking her for sex.
"She changes her facts to fit the law," Dershowitz said.
"She has a long record of lying about prominent people."
Giuffre's attorney did not specify when they would file the Child Victims Act claims in an amended lawsuit. Her legal team plans to dig into Dershowitz's representation of Epstein around the time he negotiated a sweetheart plea deal in 2008. Under the agreement, Epstein avoided serious jail time for his alleged international sex trafficking scheme.
"If Mr. Dershowitz was involved with Mr. Epstein in the activities alleged ... his motivations to negotiate the plea deal that has become so controversial will be relevant," Cooper said.
Dershowitz, meanwhile, will dig into into the legal tactics used by Giuffre's famous former attorney, David Boies.
Dershowitz's legal team claimed that a recent New York Times article on a mystery man claiming to have access to surveillance footage from Epstein's many mansions backed up the law professor's claim he is the victim of a conspiracy orchestrated by Boies.

Texto completo: Washington • House Democrats on Tuesday released a 300-page impeachment report asserting that President Donald Trump abused his power by trying to enlist Ukraine to help him in the 2020 presidential election. The report said that Trump “placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States,” seeking to undermine American democracy and endangering national security.
The document, drawn up by the House Intelligence Committee that has led the inquiry into Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, left it to another panel to decide whether to recommend his impeachment and removal. But it laid out in searing fashion what are all but certain to be the grounds on which the Democratic-led House moves to impeach the president.
The lengthy document outlined more than two months of public and private testimony from diplomats and other administration officials who described a campaign by the president and his allies to pressure Ukraine for investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and other Democrats, while withholding nearly $400 million in military assistance and a White House meeting for Ukraine’s president.
“The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a monthslong effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election,” said the report, released ahead of a vote Tuesday evening by the Intelligence Committee to formally approve it. It asserts that Trump’s “scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign.”

The report also lays out what it calls an “unprecedented campaign of obstruction of this impeachment inquiry” by Trump, in light of his move to prevent the release of documents from agencies including the State Department, the Department of Defense and the White House budget office and instructing potential witnesses not to cooperate.
“The damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three branches of government, will be long-lasting and potentially irrevocable if the president’s ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked,” the report concluded. “Any future president will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing, malfeasance, or corruption, and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three.”

The report is a watershed moment for the months-old inquiry. Its delivery sets in motion the next phase in the impeachment of Trump, accelerating a constitutional clash that has happened only three times in the nation’s history. Both parties are poised for a fierce, partisan debate in the House Judiciary Committee over whether the president should be removed from office.
The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin its debate Wednesday with a public hearing that features four constitutional scholars discussing the historical standards for impeachment and their assessment about whether Trump’s actions constitute “high crimes and misdemeanors” that warrant his removal from office.
Lawyers for the Intelligence Committee are expected to formally present the report to the Judiciary panel and answer questions from its members in the coming days, though no hearing has been scheduled. Trump’s Republican allies on Capitol Hill released their own report Monday, condemning the Democratic impeachment effort as illegitimate and asserting that the president was not seeking personal political advantage when he pressed Ukraine’s leaders to investigate his rivals but was instead urging the country to address corruption.
In London for a NATO meeting, Trump accused Democrats of trying to overturn the results of the 2016 elections, saying the impeachment inquiry “turned out to be a hoax.”
“It’s done for purely political gain,” Trump continued. “They’re going to see whether or not they can do something in 2020, because otherwise they’re going to lose.”
The Intelligence Committee is also expected to vote to transmit all the raw evidence it collected to the Judiciary Committee. Though Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the Intelligence panel, has indicated that investigative work could continue, the report largely brings an end his committee’s inquiry, which began after Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally opened the impeachment inquiry in late September.
The Judiciary Committee will also consider potential evidence presented by other investigative committees — and renew an earlier debate among Democrats over whether Trump should be impeached for his attempts to thwart attempts by Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, to investigate Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign.
If a majority of the House voted to approve articles of impeachment, which would be drafted by the Judiciary Committee, the president would be impeached. The proceedings would move to the Senate for a trial. Two-thirds of senators would have to vote to convict Trump to end his presidency.

Boston Camerata covers early America, from marches to Shakers The early music group performed Sunday at Hannaford Hall.

Texto completo: The Boston Camerata, founded in 1954, has outlasted most other early music groups started around the same time, as well as many that have come and gone since, and it has contributed significantly to Boston's reputation as this hemisphere's most vital center of pre-Classical era, period instrument performance.
The ensemble has evolved considerably: Its repertory was once drawn almost entirely from European Medieval through Renaissance works, but during the last couple of decades of lutenist Joel Cohen's directorship, the group began expanding its view with programs that explored the nexus of Christian, Jewish and Muslim music in 15th century Spain, or early American music. Ann AzÃ©ma, the mezzo-soprano who has directed the ensemble since 2009, has maintained, refreshed and expanded on many of those projects, and added productions of her own.
The singers and instrumentalists of the Camerata came to Hannaford Hall on Sunday afternoon, joined by the Middlesex County Volunteers Fifes and Drums, and one of the finer Portland choirs, St. Mary Schola. The program, presented by Portland Ovations, which has brought the group here four times previously, is based largely on "Free America! - Early Songs of Resistance and Rebellion," the ensemble's superb new album (on Harmonia Mundi).
The program offered 34 vocal works and marches, mostly from the decades between the American Revolution and the Civil War. Political broadsides, as well as sacred songs and spirituals - and combinations, in which political aspirations for the then-new country are interwoven among religious sentiments - were grouped into thematic sections. One grouping was built around Shaker songs (the source for pieces in some of the other groupings as well), and there was a pre-concert talk about the Shakers' use of music by Brother Arnold Hadd, of the Sabbathday Lake Shaker community.
Familiar colonial-era composers like William Billings (via "Chester" and "David's Lamentation") and Jeremiah Ingalls ("The Rich Man" and "A Land of Freedom") make appearances, and a few songs have texts by the likes of Thomas Paine ("Liberty Tree") and Joseph Warren ("Free Americay!"). But most were anonymous, or drawn from antique published collections, although even a few of those have remained virtually current, including the bittersweet ballad "Johnny Has Gone For a Soldier" and "Yankee Doodle," which was performed at the beginning and end of the program, as the musicians took and left the stage.
All of which is to say that it would be hard to find a more comprehensive or varied two-hour overview of this repertory, or one performed with greater polish, passion and zest. You might raise a historical quibble here and there. For example, you might have found yourself wondering whether the singers of the time really brought the kind of nuance (like the careful rallentando ending of "Friendly Union") that the Camerata musicians applied to what were essentially rough-hewn folk tunes and congregational church hymns.
On the other hand, performances that might have seemed a little odd - the unaccompanied vocal versions of a march and an untitled dance tune, in the set of Shaker pieces - were actually historically apt, since Shaker music was typically entirely vocal.
In the non-Shaker pieces, there is considerable leeway in how the music can be performed, and AzÃ©ma and company took every opportunity to vary the settings while keeping the music flowing smoothly. Unaccompanied vocal pieces (solos, duets, trios and choral settings) sat beside those accompanied by combinations of violin, flute, cello, fifes and percussion, and occasionally, arrangements would cycle through the possibilities, with instrumental, solo vocals and choral settings alternating.
Musically, the point that emerged most strikingly is the degree to which this music stood apart from the European mainstream. It was not only a matter of its folk influences, or its political rambunctiousness. Though these were mostly late 18th and early 19th century works, the harmonic language was often closer to the style of the late 16th century, or earlier. But they were not purely 16th century harmonizations; the folk elements pushed them in directions that European composers did not take.
This was the Boston Camerata at its best, performing music that has largely been overlooked, in an illuminating and thought-provoking way. If you missed it, or if you attended and loved it, there is more on disc - not only the new album, but several earlier Camerata recordings as well, among them "Liberty Tree - American Music 1776-1861," "New Britain: The Roots of American Folksong" and "Simple Gifts - Shaker Chants and Spirituals" (all on the Erato label).

Texto completo: The 39th president was treated over the weekend for a urinary tract infection and "is feeling better," his spokeswoman said. Mr. Carter, 95, has endured several medical issues in recent months.
WASHINGTON -- Former President Jimmy Carter was hospitalized again over the weekend only days after being released, this time for a urinary tract infection, but he was recovering well, his office reported on Monday.
"He is feeling better and looks forward to returning home soon," Deanna Congileo, his spokeswoman, said in a statement. "We will issue a statement when he is released for further rest and recovery at home."
The statement offered few details, saying only that he was admitted "this past weekend" to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Ga., without saying exactly when or under what circumstances.
Mr. Carter, 95, who in March became the longest-living president in American history, has been hospitalized repeatedly in recent months for various falls and, most recently, for a procedure to reduce pressure on his brain. He fell and broke a hip in May, requiring surgery, then fell again twice in October, once resulting in 14 stitches days after his 95th birthday and then a second time fracturing his pelvis.
Last month, he returned to the hospital for surgery to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding from his recent falls. The procedure was described as a success, and he was released last Wednesday in time for Thanksgiving after two and a half weeks at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.
Mr. Carter, the 39th president, served from 1977 to 1981, presiding over an often tumultuous period in American history. He brokered a landmark peace deal at Camp David between Israel and Egypt and pushed through treaties turning over the Panama Canal, but he lost re-election after a long-running hostage crisis in Iran.

New York Times chief condemns Trump campaign and RNC for banning Bloomberg reporters

Texto completo: New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet criticized the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee's decision to stop giving press credentials to Bloomberg News reporters.
The decision to bar the outlet comes after Bloomberg News announced its new editorial policy for covering the 2020 elections after its owner, Michael Bloomberg, entered the presidential race. In their new structure, which a former bureau chief has attacked, Bloomberg News will not investigate Bloomberg or any of the Democratic presidential candidates but will continue to do so regarding President Trump.
"Bloomberg News is one of the largest and most influential news organizations in the world. We condemn any action that keeps quality news media from reporting fairly and accurately on the presidency and the leadership of the country," Baquet said in a statement to Politico's Michael Calderone.
Tweet
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale made the announcement on Monday, saying in a statement, “Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events. We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis. This will remain the policy of the Trump campaign until Bloomberg News publicly rescinds its decision.”
Calderone also noted on Twitter that it remains unclear if Bloomberg reporters traveling with the president in the White House pool to events will be affected when the president hosts his campaign rallies.
RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said they would follow the campaign's lead and "will no longer credential Bloomberg representatives."
Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait pushed back on the notion that the newsroom's Trump coverage was biased, and said it would continue to cover the president "fairly & in an unbiased way ... despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign," and added that "the accusation of bias couldn't be further from the truth."

Texto completo: A combat veteran of three wars, he led an inquiry that criticized the planning behind a failed 1980 mission to rescue hostages in Iran.
Adm. James L. Holloway III, a combat veteran of three wars who served as the chief of naval operations in the 1970s and later headed an investigation that strongly criticized the military's planning of the failed 1980 mission to free hostages held at the American Embassy in Iran, died on Tuesday in Alexandria, Va. He was 97.
His death was announced by the Navy.
Admiral Holloway was the Navy's senior uniformed officer and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1974 to 1978, serving under three presidents.
He was an early proponent of nuclear-propelled ships, having studied under Adm. Hyman G. Rickover, the father of the nuclear-powered Navy.
Admiral Holloway served aboard destroyers in the North Atlantic and Pacific in World War II and flew fighter jets in the Korean War. He commanded the United States' first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the Enterprise, in the Vietnam War. After a stint at the Pentagon working on the Navy's nuclear development program, he returned to Vietnam in 1972 as commander of the Seventh Fleet's bombing raids over North Vietnam.
He was named chief of naval operations by President Richard M. Nixon, assuming the post in July 1974, then served under Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter before retiring at the end of his four-year term, when the military was transitioning from the Vietnam War era to a focus on naval competition with the Soviet Union.
President Carter ordered a raid in late April 1980 to free the 52 hostages held in Iran since Nov. 4, 1979, after a revolt by Islamic fundamentalists that had forced the pro-American shah to flee the country.
Eight American helicopters took off from an aircraft carrier and flew toward a desert landing site in Iran while six transport planes, carrying 90 Army commandos, arrived at the site from Egypt.
The commandos were to board the helicopters, rescue the hostages and return with them the next night. But President Carter canceled the mission when two helicopters broke down on their way to the desert site and a third arrived with a broken oil pump. After the order came to stand down, eight servicemen were killed when a helicopter smashed into a transport plane that was refueling at the site.
Soon after the failed rescue mission, a six-member panel of senior active and retired military officers, led by Admiral Holloway, was assembled to report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the planning for the raid.
Its 78-page finding, made public in August 1980, was especially critical of command issues. By not utilizing an existing military command, it said, "the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to start, literally, from the beginning to find a commander, create an organization, provide a staff, develop a plan, select the units and train the forces."
The Holloway panel called for the creation of a joint task force to bring counterterrorist forces of all the military services under a single command, a proposal that the Defense Department adopted.
The remaining hostages weren't freed until Jan. 20, 1981, the day Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as president.
After leaving military service, Admiral Holloway was president and chairman of the Naval Historical Foundation and the author of "Aircraft Carriers at War" (2007).
James Lemuel Holloway III was born on Feb. 23, 1922, in Charleston, S.C., to James Lemuel Holloway Jr., a 1919 graduate of the Naval Academy and a career Navy officer, and Jean Gordon Hagood Holloway.
He graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1942 in the first class of midshipmen whose curriculum was shortened to three years to speed the activation of officers for World War II.
At the time of his selection to succeed Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt III as chief of naval operations, Admiral Holloway was described by The New York Times as "far less formal than his father," whose "aristocratic demeanor prompted the nickname 'Lord Jim."'
James Jr. and James III became the only father and son to serve as four-star admirals in the Navy while on active duty.
Admiral Holloway's survivors include his wife, Dabney Rawlings Holloway, the daughter of an admiral; his daughters, Lucy Lyon and Jane Holloway; and a grandson. His son, James IV, died in an automobile accident in 1964 while he was a sophomore at the University of Virginia.
For all of Admiral Holloway's contributions to modernizing the Navy, his memories of World War II remained vivid. In a 2014 interview with the Naval Historical Foundation, he told of his time as a gunnery officer on the destroyer Bennion during the Battle of Suragao Strait at Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in October 1944.
"I couldn't suppress a gasp," he said, remembering when he first caught sight of a Japanese battleship. He told of a "a cascade of flames" as American and Japanese ships were hit.
Later in the battle, he directed a torpedo strike against a large ship but was not sure how effective it was. The after-action paperwork did not mention the Bennion's strike, but long afterward a Naval War College researcher uncovered details of how it had helped sink the battleship Yamashiro.
By the time he retired after 36 years of Navy service, Admiral Holloway had received numerous citations, including four Navy Distinguished Service Medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Bronze Star.

Texto completo: Can Big Tech solve the housing crisis? That’s the hope behind recent announcements by Apple, Facebook and Google, which together total $4.5 billion in grants and loans to remedy the affordable-housing crunch in California and the Bay Area. Microsoft last year pledged $500 million to relieve Seattle’s similarly stressed market. While Amazon’s opposition torpedoed Seattle’s attempt in 2018 to raise revenue for homelessness services, the company has embarked on a range of philanthropic housing ventures, including turning over a large chunk of one of its office buildings for use as a shelter for homeless families.
These moves, and the public reaction to them, reflect a common presumption: Tech broke the system, so it’s time for tech to fix it.
But don’t blame this economic crisis on the tech bros.
The spiraling housing costs in West Coast tech hubs are the result of 40 years of tax and land use policy — a period that mirrored the explosive growth of the tax-averse tech industry. This was also a time of continued activism by homeowners against higher-density zoning. Together, this has severely limited housing construction, particularly lower-cost houses and apartments. It is a chronic condition, inflamed by the current tech boom.
California’s saga began in the 1970s, when sprawling growth and spiking taxes seemed to threaten the quality of life so many came to the Golden State to find. Citizen activists created “urban growth boundaries” and land trusts to preserve open space and delicate coastal habitats. Yet these important moves also limited where developers could build new homes. Meanwhile, homebuilders chafed under what they saw as burdensome state rules about how many approvals they needed to build new housing.
Then came Proposition 13, a ballot initiative that passed in the summer of 1978 to slash property taxes. It has altered the way California has grown. By keeping property taxes low for longtime homeowners, Proposition 13 created clear winners and losers in the California housing market. “There has been a huge shift in the tax burden to young families from older homeowners and owners of businesses,” the Times noted in 1988. Cash-hungry cities opted to zone for commercial uses, which would generate sales taxes, instead of affordable housing. When houses got built, steep “impact fees” drove builders toward more expensive homes, whose buyers could absorb the costs.
Through all of this, California’s political leaders raised the alarm about housing affordability. In 1980, Gov. Jerry Brown formed an Affordable Housing Task Force, declaring that 60 percent of Californians were priced out of the market. By 1991, two-thirds of the 25 least affordable cities in the nation were in California.
There was some substantive action: In 1994, two of the state’s largest pension funds announced more than $340 million in construction loans for affordable development. But 25 years later, distressingly little has changed. California is America’s largest economy; but when its politicians have pushed to diversify its housing mix, they have been batted back by homeowners who resist new development in their neighborhoods.
But Proposition 13 has meant that city governments have few fiscal incentives to encourage private companies to build more housing. An important part of Apple’s housing plan, for example, involves developing land that it owns in San Jose. That property is zoned as industrial, so if it shifts to residential use, which generates limited property taxes, San Jose stands to lose tax revenue. This is a Catch-22 for a city desperate for both tax revenue and new, more affordable housing.
Seattle also has an affordable-housing shortage that predates the tech boom. Since its first zoning restrictions in 1923, the city has steadily expanded single-family residential zoning in ways that have limited housing supply and preserved racial and economic segregation. Today’s Seattle is larger, richer and more crowded, but remains overwhelmingly a city of single-family homes. The city abandoned plans to increase housing density in some neighborhoods after pressure. Washington State capped property taxes in 2001, creating a resource squeeze in even its wealthiest suburbs.
While tech is not responsible for this state of affairs, it has helped maintain it. Research has indicated that tax cuts have little effect on overall tech investment, yet industry leaders have consistently lobbied for them. They seek low-tax environments and have taken full advantage of deductions and incentives to effectively zero out their federal tax bills. Their billion-dollar housing promises are only a fraction of the taxes they might otherwise pay.
Until recently, tech workers haven’t had to worry too much about state and local politics. Their suburban campuses were comfortable bubbles. Company buses zoomed through traffic-choked highways; generous pay packages covered high rents and hefty mortgages.
Now, tech companies are increasingly moving into large cities where housing challenges can’t be ignored. Their suburban outposts are getting crowded, too. A decade ago, it would have been hard to imagine that companies like Facebook and Google would get into the housing development business. Now it’s hard to imagine how they could not.
Yet years of diminished faith in government and increased faith in tech have left things out of balance. We look to Big Tech to solve the housing crisis, when the solution involves things only government — and voters — can do, like changing land use rules and tax laws. And tech’s billions will mean little if homeowners continue to oppose new development.
The only way the status quo will truly shift is if the voices calling for more density and affordability become stronger than those against it.
Here is where tech workers again come in. They are disproportionately young and highly educated, and they often have a strong preference for dense, walkable neighborhoods. They care about making cities more livable and affordable for everyone. And they vote.
What might Seattle and San Francisco look like if more tech workers became engaged in state and local politics? What if companies didn’t only put up money, but worked to change laws constraining the housing supply? What if tech leaders and workers were willing to pay more taxes for better urban infrastructure and a higher quality of public services?
The tech bros did not create the housing crisis. But they can help fix it.

A most divisive tobacco ban Mentholated products come to the fore amid other nixed vape flavors

Texto completo: As states and communities rush to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products linked to vaping, Carol McGruder races from town to town, urging officials to include what she calls "the mother lode of all flavors": menthol.
McGruder, co-chair of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, has tried for years to warn lawmakers that menthol attracts new smokers, especially African Americans. Now that more officials are willing to listen, she wants them to prohibit menthol cigarettes and cigarillos, not just e-cigarette flavors, to reduce smoking among blacks.
McGruder and other tobacco control researchers are using the youth vaping epidemic - and the vaping-related illnesses sweeping the country - as an opportunity to take on menthol cigarettes, even though they are not related to the illnesses.
"We started to see that vaping is something that we could leverage in order to deal with this whole menthol issue," said Valerie Yerger, an associate professor of health policy at the University of California at San Francisco.
Menthol is a substance found in mint plants that creates a cooling sensation and masks tobacco flavor in both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Those properties make menthol more appealing to first-time smokers and vapers, even as they pose the same health threats as nonmenthol products and may be harder to quit.
Nearly 9 out of 10 African American smokers prefer mentholated cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But even as tobacco control activists see opportunity, some African Americans, including smokers, fear discrimination. They predict that banning menthol will lead to a surge in illicit sales of cigarettes and result in additional policing in communities that already face tension with law enforcement.
Joseph Paul, director of political and civic affairs at City of Refuge Los Angeles, a church with about 17,000 members in Gardena, California, spoke at a board of supervisors meeting in September against a proposed flavor ban in Los Angeles County that was adopted a week later.
If officials truly wanted to end youth vaping, he later told California Healthline, the ordinance should have targeted only vape flavors and exempted adult smokers and their menthol cigarettes.
"Menthol cigarettes are very popular in the black community, my people smoke menthol cigarettes," he said.
The Los Angeles County ban prohibits sales but not possession of flavored e-cigarette products, menthol cigarettes and chewing tobacco in the unincorporated area of the county, inhabited by about 1 million people. Shops have until April to clear their shelves of flavored tobacco products.
Paul warned that people will start selling menthol cigarettes illegally: "It's supply and demand." That will make the community more vulnerable to police harassment, he said.
In New York City, when officials proposed a ban on menthol cigarettes earlier this year, which has yet to be acted upon, the Rev. Al Sharpton made a similar argument against the measure: Banning menthol would lead to greater tensions with police in black communities.
"I think there is an Eric Garner concern here," the civil right rights activist told The New York Times in July, referring to the well-known case of a 43-year-old black man who died in a chokehold in 2014 while being arrested by New York City police on suspicion of selling single cigarettes.
The flavor bans that are currently sweeping the country have more to do with e-cigarettes than menthol cigarettes.
That's because a mysterious vaping-related illness has sickened more than 2,050 people nationwide and led to at least 39 deaths. Most of those illnesses have been associated with vaping cannabis products, and yet politicians' urge to adopt flavored tobacco bans continues.
In July 2016, Chicago became the first major U.S. city to ban menthol cigarette sales, but it limited the prohibition to within 500 feet of schools.
Of the more than 200 communities in the country that restrict or ban the sale of flavored tobacco, fewer than 60 include restrictions on menthol cigarettes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
Aspen, Colorado, will ban all flavored nicotine products, including menthol cigarettes, effective Jan. 1. A few communities in Minnesota already have such bans in place. In California, close to 50 communities restrict or ban flavored tobacco products; of those, more than 30 include restrictions on menthol cigarettes. Notably, San Francisco banned menthol cigarettes along with all flavored tobacco products in 2018, before banning all vapes and e-cigarettes earlier this year.
At the national level, the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of flavors in combustible cigarettes in 2009, but exempted menthol. Last year, the agency proposed a ban on menthol-flavored combustible cigarettes, calling their use among youths "especially troubling," but it has not yet taken action.
Then the Trump administration said in September it would soon ban all flavored e-cigarette products, but it may now be backing away from banning mint and menthol.
Menthol, which was first added to cigarettes in the 1920s, is as old-school as it gets when it comes to flavored tobacco, yet it hasn't prompted action in the way that vape flavors such as cotton candy and strawberry-melon have. That's because vaping was embraced by a specific population: affluent white teens, Yerger said.
Big Tobacco aggressively pushed menthol cigarettes on black youths in the 1950s and '60s, and now some people consider Kools and Newports part of black culture, McGruder said.
McGruder and others point out that the tobacco industry has supported and funded civil rights groups and causes, forming relationships with prominent black leaders such as Sharpton. Big Tobacco acknowledged that it has contributed to Sharpton's organization, the National Action Network, and similar groups.
McGruder said it's difficult for the African American community to contradict respected male civil rights and religious leaders, so when they argue that menthol bans will lead to criminalization, the community listens.
Some smokers understand the need to keep tobacco out of the hands of children, but they don't think it's fair to include menthol cigarettes.
"It's stupid. Now they're trying to act like menthol cigarettes are the problem. These have been around for a long time," said April Macklin of Sacramento, who smokes Benson & Hedges menthols.

Texto completo: The carton was in a back corner of an attic in Westchester County, buried beneath dresses and other boxes.
It was marked "Wellington Mara Navy Memories," and inside was a shoebox full of letters written to the parents of a 28-year-old Navy lieutenant and radar officer aboard the aircraft carrier USS Randolph in the Pacific Ocean in 1945.
And there was another folder beside it, one full of more detailed - and frank - letters to his older brother, Jack, about day-to-day life and fears as a bombing attack of Tokyo neared that February.
Powerful stuff for any family, but as Susan McDonnell went through her parents' attic a decade ago in search of material for a "Legacy Club" planned for the Giants' new stadium, she knew it had to be preserved.
McDonnell, one of Wellington and Ann Mara's 11 children, asked her mother about the box, and she said she did not know about it. (Ann and Wellington did not marry until 1954. She died in 2015; he died in 2005.)
"She said, 'Get rid of all this,' " McDonnell recalled. "I said, 'No, I'm not getting rid of this. It's history.' . . . So I took it home with the thought that someday I was going to try to make sense out of all this, because my brothers and sisters and children need to see this.
"I started to read some of the letters, and it became very emotional for me."
After putting it off for years, this past summer she decided to organize and publicize the letters during the NFL's 100th season and asked the Giants for help.
The result, for now, is a 4½-minute mini-documentary that was to be posted on the team's website on Friday and shown on its weekly television shows on Channel 9 and MSG Network this weekend.
John Mara, Wellington's eldest child and the current president of the Giants, reads portions of the letters aloud in the piece.
"It was kind of emotional thinking about what he must have been going through onboard ship, wondering whether they're going to be attacked or not, wondering whether they're going to get back alive or not," John said.
Like many World War II veterans, Mara did not talk much about his experiences in the decades after the war, but his letters home tell volumes.
The ones to his parents - his father, Tim, founded the franchise in 1925 - mostly sought to reassure them that he was eating well and/or needed items such as new boxer shorts.
The ones to Jack, who died in 1965, were so poignant that in March of 1945, Arthur Daley, The New York Times columnist and a close friend of Jack's, published a long excerpt to give readers a window into life on the front.
McDonnell said one that stuck with her read, "I'm sorry I haven't written in a couple of days. I'm just so miserable because I'm so homesick and I didn't want anybody else to be as miserable as me."
Even amid the war news, though, Mara inevitably had his mind on the team with which he would be closely associated for the final 80 years of his life.
Almost every letter included a reference to the Giants, or to NFL people he would run into, including Bears coach and fellow Navy veteran George Halas.
"There was a 14-page letter to his brother that included almost every player on the team and what he thought of them," McDonnell said. "He's literally in the Pacific and he's thinking about the team."
On the day he learned of the Japanese surrender, Mara compared his happiness with a Nov. 12, 1944, game in which the Giants scored 14 points in the fourth quarter to tie the Eagles, 21-21, and a Dec. 5, 1943, game in which Bill Paschal's 53-yard run in the fourth quarter beat the Redskins, 14-10.
In an earlier letter, he wrote of the scene on the ship, "The clouds are low and there are plenty of them, and they cover us like [Howie] Livingston covered [Don] Hutson - like a blanket."
And this, the night before the attack on Tokyo: "It's pretty near kick off now and the nerves are getting a little tense."
"The team was so integral to his life, and I know he thought about it all the time," John said. "The reference to covering Hutson like a blanket, that really was funny, but it didn't surprise me."
Mara wrote of being "home alive in '45," emphasizing for John the point that such a happy ending had been far from assured.
"I think [the war correspondence] certainly demonstrates that there was a lot more to him than just being the co-owner of the Giants," John said. "He had a history before that and it's one that his family is certainly very proud of, and I think he was a

Texto completo: The holiday season is typically an indulgent time, especially when it comes to food and drink consumption. For people who struggle with body-image issues, food and weight-related health problems, including and especially eating disorders, this time of year can be stressful. We spoke with experts to offer tips that can help you navigate the season and its attendant anxieties: the meals, the parties and the people.
Be honest about who’s safe for you and who isn’t
The holiday season is one in which we find ourselves reconnecting with family and old friends we don’t often see. Gravitate toward those who are grateful and happy to see you, and away from the people who are apt to make cutting comments.
“In general, we know who’s going to be emotionally more safe for us,” said Leslie Connor, a private-practice psychologist in Wilmington, Delaware. She recommends keeping interactions with “toxic” people as brief as possible.
How can you identify toxic people? Pay attention to how conversations make you feel: Do you feel drained, or do you feel energized? Do you feel bad about yourself - or empowered?
“When we’re at a family gathering, you kind of know who’s uncensored and just going to say what they think, whether it’s kind or not,” Connor said.
Help others by creating
a welcoming environment
“I encourage people to be supportive and not to ask probing questions or give unnecessary advice,” said Ed Abramson, a professor emeritus at California State University. Comments about weight will only serve to make someone with an eating disorder or issue more defensive and create barriers to communication. “If you do want to say something,” Abramson said, “basically what you want to communicate is: ‘How can I help you?’ ”
Connor agrees. “Your job is to be welcoming, warm and accepting of the people you’re with,” she said, “and that goes a long way.” If you do have a gaffe and comment on someone’s weight, “you can always apologize,” Abramson said. “But if that’s not appropriate or it doesn’t seem to work very well, gracefully focus on something else.”
Set boundaries
ahead of time
Whitney Catalano, a registered dietitian who works with clients to improve their relationships with food and their bodies, recommends telling the people you trust about your recovery before holiday gatherings, so you can set expectations and conditions for socializing. She suggests saying something like: “Just so you know, I don’t want to get into it more than this, but I’ve been healing my relationship with food and I’m particularly sensitive to diet talk or body talk right now.” Ask them to refrain from conversations about dieting or body image. You may have to wait to have this conversation in person, but try to do it right off the bat so you don’t have to think about it.
Friends could be more amenable to your requests than family members, who may feel entitled to comment on your body and weight. Catalano said it’s important to be direct and honest with your relatives, even if they’re the ones who taught you to hate your body or fear food in the first place.
“Pick a time to have this conversation when everyone’s defenses are low,” she said. “Set boundaries for what they can and cannot talk about in front of you, and then make sure to enforce those boundaries if they cross any.”
You don’t have
to please anyone
When someone comments on your food choices, you don’t have to engage. You can respond with a slightly disinterested “Oh?” and then either turn away or ask a question - “Have you watched ‘Succession’?” - to change the topic. “You don’t have to attend every conversation you’re invited to,” said Sophie Carter-Kahn, a writer and the host of the podcast “She’s All Fat.”
It’s also important to remember that it is the other person’s choice to create the situation. “It’s not your job to smooth everything over, to make yourself smaller to accommodate someone else’s ideas of how the world should be,” she said.
Food anxiety doesn’t have to turn into food panic
Between Thanksgiving, Friendsgiving and winter holiday parties, this season can be overwhelming for anyone whose relationship with food is fraught. “The holidays are a perfect storm of food and body anxiety,” Catalano said. “Don’t be surprised if your relationship with food feels particularly out of control during this time.”
She suggests two ways to weather the storm: First make a list of people, foods and situations that are likely to trigger disordered eating patterns or negative thoughts. Second, in the moment, name the experience by acknowledging that the negative diet and body image thoughts are happening, but that they do not have to dictate your actions. “Allow it to be a challenge,” Catalano said, “while also making a promise to yourself to not make any body or lifestyle decisions from a place of panic.”
No food is ‘bad’ food
“Certain foods get demonized,” like starches or gluten or fat, Abramson said, “and that gets exacerbated when someone has an eating disorder. But a balanced diet can include occasional foods that are problematic.”
If you’re struggling with allowing yourself to enjoy “bad” foods during the holidays, try to redirect your thoughts to the benefits of the meal. “Food is not just fuel, it’s cultural, celebratory and delicious. You are allowed to eat foods just because they are delicious or emotionally nourishing,” Catalano said.
Abramson suggests a dual approach to managing food anxiety. One is the more cognitive method of telling yourself: “I can allow myself modest amounts of it and be OK.”
The other is to use anxiety-reduction techniques like deep breathing, alternating between muscle tension and muscle relaxation, meditating or praying. “Whatever an individual can learn to do to decrease anxiety would be helpful when they’re confronted with the food,” Abramson said.
Go ahead and be the judge
Catalano warns against setting strict limits on food consumption during the holidays. “The best thing you can do to prepare for holiday dinners is to eat full meals leading up to the meal and center yourself right before eating so you don’t go into it anxious. It’s normal in diet culture to restrict or starve as a way of ‘earning’ the big holiday meal, but this will only cause you to overeat and feel way worse,” she said.
One piece of advice Catalano gives her clients to help them calm down from food anxiety is to “treat your meal like you’re a judge on ‘Chopped’ or any other Food Network show. How’s the presentation? What does it smell like? How’s the texture? Do the flavors go well together? Is the food lacking any flavor? What would you rate this meal if it were presented to you on a cooking show?” This exercise, she said, can “redirect the conversation away from diet talk because you’re focusing instead on the actual experience of eating.”
Bear in mind that the only way you can maintain balance is to say no to certain things, so if you have to pass on your brother-in-law’s best friend’s ugly sweater party in order to make it to a yoga class, catch up on “Real Housewives of New Jersey” or sleep, so be it.

Texto completo: Representative Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, gave the president until next Friday to say if he will present evidence or call witnesses.
WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee asked President Trump on Friday whether he intends to mount a defense during the committee's consideration of impeachment articles, setting a deadline of next Friday for Mr. Trump and his lawyers to decide if they will present evidence or call witnesses.
In a letter to the president, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the committee chairman, said Mr. Trump has the right to review the evidence against him, ask questions of his accusers during public hearings that begin next week and present evidence and request witness testimony.
"Please provide the committee with notice of whether your counsel intends to participate, specifying which of the privileges your counsel seeks to exercise," Mr. Nadler wrote. He said the deadline for responding is 5 p.m. on Dec. 6.
Mr. Nadler's panel will begin examining next week whether Mr. Trump abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine for politically beneficial investigations of his political rivals, and whether the president obstructed the congressional inquiry by refusing to provide documents and by blocking witnesses from testifying.
In Friday's letter, Mr. Nadler said that the committee has also been investigating whether Mr. Trump engaged "in acts of obstruction of justice" detailed in the report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign. Democrats are weighing whether to draft an obstruction-of-justice article based on Mr. Mueller's report.
Mr. Nadler's letter indicates that his committee is prepared to hear a public defense from Mr. Trump or his lawyers as early as the week of Dec. 9, potentially setting up a final vote on articles of impeachment in the committee later that week. Democratic leaders have said the entire House could vote on impeachment the week of Dec. 16.
The White House did not respond to an email seeking comment on Friday, but lawyers for the president have repeatedly expressed deep skepticism about participating in the impeachment inquiry, which the president and his allies have denounced as unfair and a sham.
Mr. Nadler had previously set a deadline of 6 p.m. on Sunday for Mr. Trump to decide whether his lawyers would attend a public hearing on Wednesday in which constitutional scholars will discuss the definition of an impeachable offense and whether Mr. Trump's actions justify removing him from office.
The president and his lawyers have not responded to the earlier request, according to committee officials.
Under the impeachment resolution adopted by the House in late September, Mr. Trump and his lawyers are allowed to attend all impeachment hearings in the Judiciary Committee, including the presentation of a report from the House Intelligence Committee, which is expected to take place within days.
In 1998, President Bill Clinton's lawyers delivered a 30-page rebuttal report to the Judiciary Committee as it began consideration of whether to impeach Mr. Clinton for his actions related to a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. Mr. Clinton's lawyers and several witnesses later argued in a daylong appearance before the committee that the president's actions did not warrant impeachment.
James St. Clair, President Richard Nixon's White House counsel, argued against Mr. Nixon's impeachment during Judiciary Committee hearings on Watergate in 1974.
Pat Cipollone, Mr. Trump's White House counsel, has said for weeks that the president had no intention of cooperating with the House inquiry, saying in a letter to the House Democrats that "President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances."
Mr. Nadler also wrote a letter on Friday to Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, asking whether Republicans intend to request any subpoenas to compel witnesses to testify on Mr. Trump's behalf.
The rules adopted by the House require Mr. Nadler to agree to any Republican subpoena requests. If he rejects the requests, Republicans are allowed to ask for a vote of the full committee, though because it is controlled by Democrats, the committee is unlikely to overrule Mr. Nadler's decision.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Collins did not respond to a request for a comment. But a Republican aide on the Judiciary Committee said Mr. Collins had not received responses from Mr. Nadler to four recent letters expressing concerns about the way Democrats are running the impeachment inquiry. Representative Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wrote that the committee will also consider whether Mr. Trump should be impeached for engaging "in acts of obstruction of justice."

TRUMP RECKLESSLY CROSSES ANOTHER LINE THE PRESIDENT'S FIRING OF THE NAVY SECRETARY SABOTAGED A PROCESS OF INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's attempt to manipulate military justice had a sorry outcome Sunday with the firing of Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer. For the past nine months, Mr. Spencer had tried to dissuade Mr. Trump from dictating special treatment for Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher - but in the end Mr. Spencer was sacked for his efforts to protect his service.
?With Mr. Spencer's firing, Mr. Trump has recklessly crossed a line he had generally observed before, which had exempted the military from his belligerent, government-by-tweet interference. But the Gallagher case illustrates how an irascible, vengeful commander-in-chief is ready to override traditional limits to aid political allies in foreign policy, law enforcement and now military matters.
Mr. Spencer was fired by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper late Sunday, supposedly because Mr. Esper was "deeply troubled" that Mr. Spencer had tried to work out a private deal with the White House that would avoid a direct presidential order scuttling a scheduled SEAL peer-review process. That panel was set to determine whether Gallagher would keep his coveted Trident pin, marking him as a SEAL, after he was convicted in July for posing in a trophy photo with the corpse of a Islamic State captive.
Mr. Spencer had tried to find a compromise, sources tell me, after Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday, "The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin." Mr. Spencer feared that a direct order from Mr. Trump to protect Gallagher, who is represented by two former partners of Mr. Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, would be seen as subverting military justice.
After that Trump tweet, Mr. Spencer cautioned acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney that he would not overturn the planned SEAL peer review of Gallagher without a direct presidential order; he privately told associates that if such an order came, he might resign rather than carry it out. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke with the White House late Thursday to try to avert this collision.
Gen. Milley's de-escalation efforts initially appeared to be successful. A Pentagon official messaged me last Friday morning: "Missiles back in their silos . for the time being." But the truce was short-lived. By Saturday, the White House was demanding to know whether Mr. Spencer had threatened to resign; the Navy secretary issued a statement denying that he had made any such public threat and continued to seek a deal that would protect the Navy from a direct showdown with Mr. Trump.
"It was a hold-your-nose solution," said a source close to Mr. Spencer about his effort to broker an arrangement that would allow Gallagher to retire at the end of November with his former rank, an honorable discharge and his Trident pin, as Mr. Trump wanted, but without direct presidential interference in the SEAL review process. As so often happens with attempts to work with Mr. Trump's erratic demands, this one ended in disaster.
"The president wants you to go," Mr. Esper told Mr. Spencer on Sunday, according to this source. Mr. Esper then toed the White House line and announced Mr. Spencer's dismissal.
For Pentagon officials who have wondered whether Mr. Esper would have the backbone to resist Mr. Trump, Sunday's events were troubling. The Pentagon, like the State Department under Mike Pompeo, is now overseen by an official whose overriding priority seems to be accommodating an impetuous boss in the White House.
Mr. Spencer's letter Sunday to Mr. Trump, acknowledging his "termination," echoed that of former defense secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned in December because of similar concerns about Mr. Trump's unwise intervention in military and national-security decisions.
"As Secretary of the Navy, one of the most important responsibilities I have to our people is to maintain good order and discipline throughout the ranks. I regard this as deadly serious business," Mr. Spencer wrote. "The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries." In a paraphrase of what Mr. Mattis wrote 11 months ago, Mr. Spencer wrote that Mr. Trump should have a Navy secretary "who is aligned with his vision."
For Navy commanders who have worried about eroding discipline in a SEAL force that's lionized in movies and television, and protected by presidential diktat, Mr. Spencer's most ominous line was: "I no longer share the same understanding with the commander-in-chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline."
Mr. Trump began lobbying Mr. Spencer to exempt Gallagher from Navy discipline back in March, when he ordered the Navy secretary in an early-morning phone call to release Gallagher from the brig and give him more comfortable quarters. Presidential pressure has been relentless ever since.
Gallagher has become a hero in the Trump echo chamber of Fox News commentary, where he's seen as a victim of vengeful SEAL commanders. His case may have caught White House attention because his legal team included two Trump friends who are former partners of Mr. Giuliani: investigator Bernard Kerik, a former New York police commissioner, and Marc Mukasey, who represents Mr. Trump.
While Gallagher is celebrated on Fox, current and former senior officers of the SEALs and other elite units told me this weekend that his case has little support within the community of Special Operations forces. One former SEAL commander noted that maintaining discipline among these elite units is so important that the SEAL peer-review panels have removed more than 150 Trident pins since 2011, or more than one a month.
That's the process of internal accountability that Mr. Spencer was trying to defend, and that Mr. Trump sabotaged.

When Is a Star Not Always a Star? When It's an Online Review

Texto completo: Customer reviews are incredibly important in e-commerce, but they can be unreliable or downright dishonest.
In the world of e-commerce, the online review is king, the internet's answer to walking into a store and trying out a product for yourself.
An increase of just one star in a rating on Amazon correlates with a 26 percent increase in sales, according to a recent analysis by the e-commerce consulting firm Pattern.
But while online reviews have become powerful sales tools, the ecosystem is relatively crude. Reviews can be easy to manipulate, and the operators of sites with the most reviews are not always motivated to crack down on fake ones planted to promote products. That leaves many consumers wondering what to believe.
"The detection of it is a very difficult issue," said Edward C. Malthouse, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University who has studied the influence of online reviews. "How can you tell if I'm just someone who's being paid to write a review versus a genuine review?"
The state of the system was highlighted last month in a proposed settlement between Sunday Riley Skincare, a popular seller of items like $ 55 night oils and $ 85 brightening serums, and the Federal Trade Commission, which found that the company had posted fake reviews of its products on Sephora's website for years. Allegations that the brand directed employees to write fake reviews emerged on Reddit last year, but the F.T.C. complaint was far more detailed and said the company's chief executive, Sunday Riley, had been directly involved in the scheme.
The complaint included a July 2016 email from Ms. Riley that told employees to create three Sephora accounts each with different personas and Gmail addresses. In addition to posting praise, she wrote, employees should "dislike" negative reviews.
"After enough dislikes, it is removed," she added. "This directly translates to sales!!"
Ms. Riley said she was disappointed that the brand's Tidal Brightening Enzyme Water Cream and Good Genes All-in-One Lactic Acid Treatment were rated 4.2 out of 5, and wanted at least a 4.8.
"Make sure to NOT compare the product to other products, to not use foul language, and to be very enthusiastic without looking like a plant," she wrote. "Leave a review for a different product every day so you build up history."
The agency found multiple fake reviews between 2015 and 2017. When Sephora removed some of them, the F.T.C. said, Sunday Riley started to use technology that obscured locations and IP addresses. Interns were asked to post from fake Sephora accounts as recently as April 2018.
The F.T.C. complaint cited another email from a Sunday Riley employee offering tips: "If you notice someone saying things like I didn't like 'x' about it, write a review that says the opposite. The power of reviews is mighty, people look to what others are saying to persuade them and answer potential questions they have."
Ms. Riley and her company did not respond to email and LinkedIn messages seeking comment for this article. Two public relation firms that previously worked with Sunday Riley said they no longer represented the firm.
Sephora still promotes Sunday Riley products in its stores. The retailer said in an email to The New York Times that it did "not believe the actions at Sunday Riley are representative of our brands or the countless hours our clients have spent sharing their authentic product experiences with us." The company said it vetted and had removed certain Sunday Riley reviews from its website, particularly if reviews were left the same day the account was created.
Sephora has a new system for verifying the source of reviews and added badges to highlight reviews tied to purchases, the company said. It did not address questions about any punitive action it took against Sunday Riley.
The response from Sephora and the proposed settlement with the F.T.C., which did not include a financial penalty, surprised some in the industry. The commission received roughly 40 comments about the agreement from frustrated consumers, one of whom said it was a "finger wag."
"It was the most blatant case of fake reviews, and this is how the government responds to it," said Saoud Khalifah, chief executive of Fakespot, a company that analyzes the authenticity of reviews on sites like Amazon, Sephora and Best Buy. "Now everybody is like, O.K., if that's the penalty, then why not write more fake reviews and pump ourselves through the roof?"
Two of the F.T.C.'s five commissioners, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, objected to the proposed settlement. Mr. Chopra said in a statement that it was "unlikely to deter other would-be wrongdoers" and that the agency should impose financial penalties for the growing problem of fake review fraud.
Sunday Riley would face the threat of civil penalties if it engaged in this behavior again. The company did not have to provide consumer redress, in part because it would be difficult to calculate how many purchases were driven by the fake reviews.
"An order that binds a company and its C.E.O. for 20 years, imposing reputational costs and subjecting Ms. Riley and her company to the threat of significant civil penalties, sends a strong signal to the market," Noah Joshua Phillips, an F.T.C. commissioner, said in an email to The Times.
E-commerce sellers, from legitimate brands to counterfeiters, can also buy good reviews through dodgy websites, online forums and Facebook groups. There are services that connect sellers with consumers who are willing to buy and rate products online for reimbursement. Positive ratings not only drive sales but can increase the odds that products appear high in search results.
"The incentives are incredibly high for brands to create fake reviews or incentivize reviews," said John LeBaron, Pattern's chief revenue officer. "Many brands I've spoken with say: 'I feel like if I don't do this, then I'm not staying level with my competition, I'm literally just falling behind."'
Volume can also make a big difference. The likelihood that consumers who read reviews will buy a product can triple based on the number of reviews it has, according to research by Mr. Malthouse, the Northwestern professor, and Yorgos Askalidis, a data scientist, in 2016.
Companies like Fakespot specialize in detecting fake or paid reviews, particularly those posted by humans. Their systems look at language patterns, account creation dates, the types of items that certain accounts are reviewing, and more.
"Amazon is removing fake reviews, but not at the scale to remove every single fake review on the platform," Mr. Khalifah said.
An Amazon spokesman said in a statement that companies like Fakespot "simply do not have access to the information we have, and they wrongly accuse reviews from genuine customers who have worked hard to provide valuable feedback so that other shoppers can benefit."
"That is not to suggest that there aren't bad actors," the spokesman added. "We are aware of bad actors that attempt to abuse our systems, and we continue to invest significant resources to protect the integrity of our reviews, and we will not stop working hard on behalf of our customers and selling partners."
Amazon said that last year it prevented more than 13 million bogus reviews and "took action" against more than five million accounts.
The schemes can be complex. BuzzFeed News recently detailed how one woman had bought hundreds of cheaply made products on Amazon and given them five-star reviews in exchange for reimbursement from sellers, whom she often connected with through Facebook. Her fraudulent reviews, which are given credibility through the "verified purchase" label and can include photos and videos, have gone undetected by Amazon, BuzzFeed reported.
Consumers should be aware of how reviews can be manipulated but may not be able to avoid them entirely, said Rob Gross, Fakespot's chief operating officer. He advised sorting reviews by "most recent," which can help illuminate any issues. He also said he tended to ask family and friends about products and checked with independent resources like Consumer Reports.
Mr. Chopra, the F.T.C. commissioner, called on the agency to confront review fraud more aggressively and to keep pace with regulators around the world that have recognized the problem as "a major threat to honest competition online."
"The law has long recognized that false advertising is an unfair method of competition that harms both consumers and honest businesses," he wrote. "We must remember this when it comes to calibrating consequences for wrongdoers and comprehensively attacking the problem of fake reviews."

Texto completo: Headnote EDITORIAL
We need not say again our feelings about polls, which are but a momentary reading of an issue, but we are certainly elated to learn that a recent CNN poll shows that half the country believes that Trump should not only be impeached by the House but also removed from office by the Senate.
This is not exactly fresh news since the same numbers were citizens, mostly young Black and Latino men and boys, were stopped during his tenure as mayor, were his remarks about reducing gun violence and about "righting wrongs that have fallen heaviest on the most vulnerable communities. I know government can improve people's lives- because when 1 ran New York City, that's exactly what we did."
Of course he addressed this issue with an apology at the Christian Cultural Center before a packed congregation that was received with tepid applause. Now that he is officially in the race he is sure to have that mistake thrown back at him by the other candidates. And expect Sen. Elizabeth Warren to have the perfect foil for her plan to tax the rich.
Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, if Bloomberg makes it to the debate stage next month, will take him to task on how his focus to make things better only made them worse for certain members of the community.
Already Sen. Bernie Sanders has commented on Bloomberg's vast wealth, reportedly more than $50 billion with millions in his war chest, declaring that Bloomberg "cannot buy this election." That was even more true years ago when Nelson Rockefeller failed to purchase the presidency.
"I'm running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America," Bloomberg said, in what may be the slogan of his campaign. "We cannot afford four more years of President Trump's reckless and unethical actions. He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage. The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America."
One could point to Bloomberg's wealth as a positive since he wouldn't be beholden to special interests. But that same wealth means he's not beholden to anyone so he can do what he wants. Another road block for the former mayor of New York City is getting America to vote for a Jewish billionaire who owns his own media company. With the resurrection of public displays of anti-Semitism under the Trump regime, Bloomberg might have a hard time convincing America to chose him over a man who purports to hate the same people they hate.
But according to anti-police brutality activist Josmar Trujillo, Trump and Bloomberg are the same person.
"Given that President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted stop-and-frisk, Bloomberg's signature policing policy, there appears to be little discernible differences between the two on the crucial issues of race and law enforcement," said Trujillo. "Both men are arrogant businessmen who think that their wealth makes them qualified to be president. Bloomberg's legacy as mayor of NYC, however, offers something that in some ways is worse than Trump: a man who steamrolled millions of people's lives for 12 long years as he turned New York City into a corporatized police state."
Former Vice President and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden seemed to be the front runner for the nomination, but has recently fallen in some polls. A recent piece in the New York Times notices that Biden has fallen a bit in the Iowa polls while South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has taken the lead. However, according to a recent Morning Consult poll, Biden has a nine-point lead on Sanders nationally 32% to 20% while Warren fell back a bit at 17%.
With all of the uncertainty surrounding the Democratic primaries, Bloomberg might smell blood in the water of the Democratic party: a party divided by the agendas of different groups and elected officials. It's one of the drawbacks to having a diverse group of people under one umbrella. Different desires, wants and agendas.
But Jose Lopez, spokesperson for Communities United for Police Reform Action Fund, said Bloomberg or Trump wouldn't be a great for Black and Browar Americans.
"Bloomberg consistently supported the goals of NYC's racist police unions through his obstruction of democratic processes, litigation to appeal police accountability measures, and his threats to personally finance campaigns to unseat elected officials who supported police accountability," said Lopez. "Instead of investing city resources in community infrastructure that would have made New York's communities of color safer, he championed neoliberal policies that disinvested from community infrastructure like affordable housing, leading to a trend of hyper-gentrification, displacement and increased policing of low-income New Yorkers of color."
Bloomberg's political leanings are considered centrist at best. In an era where liberals have gone more to the left and have openly advocated for socialism, Bloomberg's presence could upset the more extreme left wing of the party. But outside of social media, all people want is someone with the best chance of beating Trump. Bloomberg's worth is close to $54 billion. He has the wealth to fund lots of anti-Trump commercials and dominate television ad sorts. But other Dems could use his police, racial and social inequality record against him.
"Eve worked very hard to make sure that we tackled discrimination wherever 1 saw' it," said Bloomberg while taking questions post-speech in Virginia. "New York City has a record that's not perfect, but I think we should be proud of it in terms of making it a city that's open to everyone."
But according to VOCAL-NY Co-Director Jeremy Saunders, Bloomberg's record on race issues leave a lot to be desired.
"Bloomberg drove income inequality, gentrification and homelessness in New York City. He made our city the global leader in low'-level marijuana arrests- with massive racial disparities despite white New Yorkers using marijuana at similar rates-as stop-and-frisk made many New Yorkers feel they lived in an apartheid city," said Saunders. "Then he used his wealth and power to buy himself a third term in office.
"I would hope these are not the qualities most Americans are looking for in a presidential candidate," concluded Saunders.

Resumen: In good news this week: An 11% increase in the number of working Latin American women is thanks in part to more education – and more positive stories.

Texto completo: Latin America More women are entering the workforce across Latin America. New data from the United Nations shows an 11% increase of women working in the region over the past 30 years. Despite this rise, however, the report highlights women’s earnings remain on average 17% below those of men with the same education and economic status. In both Peru and Bolivia, more than 60% of women age 15 and older hold jobs. One of the factors underpinning the growth is access to higher education, according to the study. (U.N. News)
Yemen Solar panels have increased energy and water production in and around the capital, Sanaa. After Houthi insurgents captured Sanaa in 2014, a series of attacks on its power lines left the country without reliable electricity. But now solar panels are providing an alternative power source for some residents. South of the capital in Dhamar, solar-powered pumps have helped to restore water production, which has plummeted since the civil war began. “People used to get water every 10 to 12 days,” said Muhammad Ali al-Habshi of Dhamar’s water authority. “Now it is every three days.” (Reuters, Al Jazeera)
Italy Italy will become the first country in the world to make sustainable development and climate change studies compulsory in its education system. Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti said beginning in September 2020 all state schools will dedicate an hour per week to climate change issues. The pilot program plans to incorporate the United Nations climate agenda into the entire curriculum. Younger students will be taught stories from different cultures that emphasize a connection to the environment. More technical information will be introduced in the middle school curriculum, and the U.N.’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be taught at the high school level. “The 21st century citizen must be a sustainable citizen,” said Mr. Fioramonti. (The New York Times, Reuters)
Senegal A new school has opened in Dakar that teaches people how to use artificial intelligence to find agricultural solutions. In September, the Dakar Institute of Technology partnered with French AI school Vividata to begin educating farmers on how to use AI to increase crop yields. With temperature, soil pH, and moisture level data processed by AI, farmers can learn more specifically where and when to add fertilizer and water, a scarce resource in the region. The school plans to launch a bachelor’s degree in big data and a master’s degree in AI in 2020. (Reuters)
Kenya Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta approved a new data protection law to regulate how personal information is handled and shared by companies and the government. The law complies with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation law passed in 2018. The GDPR includes the right to access one’s data, to request one’s data be removed, and to be notified about a data breach. Amazon Web Services, part of the Amazon group, said it is encouraged by the new law and will be setting up part of its cloud infrastructure in Kenya. There is no single federal data protection law in the United States, but California’s new data protection law takes effect Jan. 1, 2020. (Qz Africa, Reuters)
India India has banned the use of electronic cigarettes, according to court documents. The government told a federal court that a recent ban on the import, manufacture, sale, advertisement, storage, and distribution of e-cigarettes implies their use is also prohibited. Enforcement of the new ban, in a country with 106 million adult smokers, will be difficult, observers say. India’s population of smokers is second only to China in e-cigarette use, where seven top companies recently agreed to stop online e-cigarette sales. The nationwide action came after nearly a dozen Indian states banned sales of the product. The country’s finance minister said the devices pose a health risk, especially to young people.

Reasons I swoon for Thanksgiving

Texto completo: I love bottle rockets bursting to a John Philip Sousa soundtrack.
I love a festive Sunday brunch topped off with Cadbury chocolate eggs.
I love the way children positively glow in anticipation of Christmas.
But, this year, I'm swooning for Thanksgiving, even though our family dinner won't look much like those Norman Rockwell paintings.
We tried for years to fit that "traditional" holiday food model, only to end up with lots of leftovers and then lots of trash. Lately, we've opted to be more realistic.
Few in my family care for traditional roasted turkey or canned sweet potatoes sprinkled with marshmallows or even pumpkin pie (except my husband, who loves it buried in whipped cream).
So our holiday dinner will reflect our personal harvests and our food preferences. There will be beef tenderloin, pasta topped with sauce made from my garden and assorted salads. I will, however, make a turkey breast for my "tradition-loving" dad. And for dessert, most of us will indulge with cake because the holiday falls on my daughter's birthday, the same daughter who hates mashed potatoes, green beans and all manner of pie.
Despite food allergies and aversions, many people, myself included, have come to call Thanksgiving our favorite holiday. Just not because of the stuffing.
I like Thanksgiving best for many other reasons:
* We need it. In a year filled with anger, hostility and divisiveness, we all can use a time-out. This isn't the first Thanksgiving at which Americans find themselves divided over politics. Nor will it be the last. And yet, Thanksgiving has endured. Let's keep it that way. Let's bring our best selves to the table and enjoy what is good. And for those who insist on starting a feud, quick someone pass that sweet potato-marshmallow concoction.
* It is an equal opportunity celebration. There's no nod to religion, lifestyle or income. You don't need a high tolerance for noise or a flair for decorating or a big bank book to indulge. At the root, it is about recognizing how good we have it. And, as troubling as these times may seem, we still have it much better than a lot of people around the world.
* It makes us pause in the middle of the busy workweek during a somewhat gloomy month to do something so many of us have forgotten how to do: gather round a table and talk.
* It is a lesson in adapting. People travel far and wide simply to reconnect with loved ones. They sleep on sofas and sometimes in airports for the opportunity to break bread, or taco chips or whatever.
* There is no dress code. No costumes, no fancy bonnets, no ugly sweaters (well, not intentionally). Just Bears jerseys, if you must. But feel free to bring your slippers.
* Although you might see an occasional inflatable turkey, there's no need to go gaga over Thanksgiving decorations. The only thing getting pulled out of storage is the china. But we might actually light the decorative candles.
* Other than re-engineering the fridge and oven to accommodate an influx of casseroles, Thanksgiving can be relatively low-stress. If you're worried your guests will judge your scene, forget about it. Martha Stewart is not on your guest list. People will only remember your graciousness and your attentiveness -- oh, and your willingness to share the Wi-Fi password.
* It is a holiday that is relatively low on trash, not counting the butter boxes, and low on noise, unless the Bears do something remarkable. Afterward, the garbage cans aren't bursting with wrapping paper, we don't have to vacuum under sofas and inside closets to get rid of any annoying plastic "grass" and our meal-induced slumber isn't blasted to kingdom come by errant M-80s.
* And, while there are plenty of gifts to be celebrated on this day, material goods are not among them. Forget the boxes, the ribbons, the gift receipts. Instead, we'll cherish what really matters -- time with each other.
Thanksgiving has been celebrated in various forms since 1621, when Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians shared an autumn harvest, according to history.com. It became a national holiday in 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln declared it as "a kind of thank you for the Civil War victories in Vicksburg, Miss., and Gettysburg, Pa.," according to The New York Times.
The holiday can give us a big return on a relatively small investment, starting with the emotional boost we need to get through the dark days of winter and ending with a plan for doing it all again in a few weeks.
In summation, Thanksgiving is not about what you eat; it's about with whom you eat it.
One tradition I will uphold, even though it sometimes leads to grumbling among the diners, is the one in which we all pause before we dig in to name something we are grateful for this year.
My personal list is long. It includes a baby brother for our cherished granddaughter, as well as family, friends, good health and lots of plans. It also includes you, dear reader, for whom I am so thankful.
I hope the mac and cheese can hold on.

Texto completo: There was a time sports fans would stuff themselves over the long Thanksgiving weekend, and park themselves in front of the TV to watch endless hours of football and other games until they couldn't remember the names of the relatives sitting next to them on the couch.
Ah, but these days, things are so much different. Now, sports fans can stuff themselves over the long Thanksgiving, and park themselves just about anywhere – in a department store, in front of a computer, in a car dealer showroom – and watch endless hours of streaming football and other games until they can't remember if they put on clean socks.
In the spirit of the season, and in hopes of helping you navigate through the endless trough of sports over the next four days, so you'll actually find time to connect with a real person or two, here is our annual field guide to the moveable feast that is Thanksgiving Sports 2020.
Thursday Bears at Lions, 10:30 a.m.. Fox: Generally, I try to watch some of this game for the sake of tradition and nostalgia. Generally, this matchup isn't worth our time. Watch, but keep an eye on the turkey (the one in the oven). WATCH IT
Bills at Cowboys, 2:30 p.m., CBS: Best of the three offerings today by a mile. Too bad it usually comes right when dinner's served. But modern technology has a solution. RECORD IT
Egg Bowl: Ole Miss at Mississippi State, 5:30 p.m., ESPN: I guess it was 2014 when this game was a worth-watch, because MSU had a pulse in the playoff race. Still, only once in the last 48 years has either team been ranked in the top 15 for this game and neither is wowing anybody this season. They are a combined 4-10 in SEC play. SKIP IT
Saints at Falcons, NBC, 6:30 p.m.: Too bad NBC can't flex out of this one. Seemed like a compelling matchup when the schedule was set. Today, it's a dud (and whatever happened to the Falcons anyway?). Good thing you've recorded Cowboys-Bills. SKIP IT
Arizona-Pepperdine basketball at Anaheim, 9 p.m., ESPN2: Arizona's first game in the Wooden Legacy Tournament really is cruel and unusual punishment for Wildcats fans. Nobody will be awake tonight (blame the carbs, not tryptophan). You'll have better luck staying awake for the subsequent games on Friday and Sunday. RECORD IT
Friday Arizona State women's basketball vs. Maine, 3 p.m., FloHoops: Something to divert your attention standing in line on Black Friday (is that even a thing anymore?) or doing research for Cyber Monday. ASU's playing in a tournament in Florida, so you can do the same thing Saturday and Sunday. If you sign up for an account with FloHoops (I believe a fee in involved), you can ... STREAM IT
Coyotes at Vegas, 4 p.m., FSAZ Plus: Last meeting was a one-sided 4-1 Coyotes victory in Glendale. Too bad the Coyotes will be moving out of the Pacific Division in 2021 – this is shaping up as a nice little desert rivalry. Early start time gives you the rest of the evening for leftover turkey, and to flip over to the Suns game. WATCH IT
Dallas at Suns, 7 p.m., FSAZ: Hey, you're probably off Friday anyway, so how about finding a sports bar in Phoenix to watch the Coyotes, then head to Talking Stick Resort Arena for this one. GO TO IT
Saturday Ohio State at Michigan, 10 a.m., Fox: Ohio State's already locked into the Big Ten championship game next week, but I suppose a case can be made that Michigan could damage the Buckeyes' CFP case with a win. Might this game decide the fate of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh? He's 0-4 against the Buckeyes. WATCH IT
Palmetto Bowl: Clemson at South Carolina, 10 a.m., ESPN: Tempted to write this off as another speed bump for a largely untested Clemson team on its way to the playoffs, but then I remembered the Gamecocks' double OT win at Georgia in October. RECORD IT
Wisconsin at Minnesota, 1:30 p.m., ABC: For the Big Ten West title and a shot to knock Ohio State out of the College Football Playoff, in theory. WATCH IT
Iron Bowl: Alabama at Auburn, 1:30 p.m., CBS: Sadly, one of the classic games of the season has lost much of his luster with Alabama losing its quarterback and Auburn sitting on three losses. SKIP IT
Texas A&M at LSU, 5 p.m., ESPN: Anyone think the Aggies have a chance to throw a scare into the Bayou Bengals? Nah, me either. But it's a last tune-up before the SEC title game, so, while you're tailgating in Tempe .... STREAM IT
San Jose at Coyotes, 6 p.m., FSAZ: When LSU has a big lead at halftime, switch over to this one while you're working on that second brat at the ASU tailgate. But if you are passing on the T-Cup this year, head on over to Glendale. STREAM IT/GO TO IT
Territorial Cup: Arizona at Arizona State, 8 p.m., ESPN: Even the New York Times proclaimed this the best rivalry in the country. Heck, we don't need those folks to tell us what we already knew. Fork 'em or Bear Down, but don't miss out. GO TO IT
Sunday Rams at Cardinals, 2:05 p.m., Fox: I'd like to know which genius in the NFL scheduling department didn't let these two meet earlier than December? Must be the same "algorithm" that let the Cardinals play the 49ers twice in 18 days. How about spreading it out. Oh, by all means, have the Cardinals play ONE division game in the first eight weeks of the season. OK, rant concluded. WATCH IT
Patriots at Texans, NBC, 6:20 p.m.: Since there's usually only one question every regular season for the Patriots – will they go undefeated? – and it's already been answered, put Belichick and Co. on pause until January. SKIP IT

Texto completo: Manny Fernandez, our Houston Bureau Chief, and Tamir Kalifa, a photographer, discuss spending nearly three months with Luis Calvillo, who was seriously wounded at the Walmart shooting in El Paso, and his family.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.

Objectivity Is Not Invisibility
EL PASO -- The first time we met the Calvillo family, it was Aug. 28, three weeks after Walmart. That was how they talked about their lives now: before Walmart and after Walmart.
Luis Calvillo's wife was at the University Medical Center of El Paso, waiting for news from the doctors. Her husband was having surgery, for the fifth time. Mr. Calvillo, 33, was shot five times outside an El Paso Walmart on Aug. 3. A Mexican-American soccer dad and Iraq veteran, he survived a war zone overseas, only to nearly bleed to death outside a Walmart one American Saturday.
"I take it day by day, honestly," his wife, Marcela Martinez, 38, said.
For Tamir and me, it was the quiet start of what would become a nearly three-month project for The New York Times. We spent hours and hours with the Calvillo family, hiking with them, waiting at the V.A. with them, even crying with them. The story was about Mr. Calvillo's slow-motion recovery, and how soccer -- fifth-grade, Bad News Bears-style soccer -- helped save his life. Twice.
But Tamir and I knew none of that then.
Ms. Martinez agreed to meet us in a waiting room at U.M.C. While her husband was in surgery, while their lives were shattered, she was so shockingly, extraordinarily ordinary -- humble, humorous, curious about who we were. We wanted to tell her story, but she wanted to know ours, too. We talked about our kids, all in elementary school.
For the next several weeks, Tamir and I struggled to find the balance between reporting and intruding, between being there and being there too much. I don't think we ever figured out the right mix. There were times when Mr. Calvillo simply told us, as he lay on his hospital bed, that he was done for the day, and we thanked him and left.
As the funeral Mass for Mr. Calvillo's father was ending -- Jorge Calvillo García, his lifelong mentor, was killed in the attack -- I sat in the pews and looked to my left. A long line formed. Mr. Calvillo's relatives and friends stood there, waiting to express their condolences to him. I hesitated, and thought about what to do. And then I joined the line, with tears in my eyes.
Objectivity is not invisibility. I cover Texas for The New York Times, but at a basic level I write about people. And he was one, and his father as well. And I am, too.
Like a Thunderclap in a Quiet Room
EL PASO -- It was our third visit to El Paso in three weeks. Mr. Calvillo and his wife, Ms. Martinez, were trading jokes in a rapid-fire blend of English and Spanish in his room at Kindred Hospital, where he had been transferred. Within minutes, the mood had shifted. Mr. Calvillo's face turned pale as he began writhing in pain from a bad reaction to new medication.
There is no script for recovering from mass violence. One moment they were laughing; the next they were surviving.
Manny and I glanced at each other: What should we do? The urge to leave the room and let Mr. Calvillo and Ms. Martinez endure this excruciating moment in private was overwhelming. But we stayed.
When reporting on stories involving trauma, my greatest fear is that I may compound it. That's why, while speaking to Mr. Calvillo for the first time back at U.M.C., I explained how I hoped to document his recovery in pictures. I asked Mr. Calvillo and Ms. Martinez for their permission to photograph during the inevitable moments of grief and anguish. I did not want the sound of the camera to come as a surprise, and I wanted them to feel they had some control over a story about their own lives. They said yes.
I thought about that conversation, the trust that we were building and their consent, as I inched my camera closer to Mr. Calvillo's agony.
A single tear rolled down his cheek. The camera's click was like a thunderclap in the quiet room.
Photographing intimate, painful experiences can be intrusive. But to appreciate the bright moments we knew would eventually come, we first needed to witness the dark ones. Mr. Calvillo and Ms. Martinez knew this, too.
They allowed us to see their pain so that the world could have a better understanding of how mass violence changes lives and how a family recovers from it.
To Manny and me, this was yet another act of bravery. For Mr. Calvillo and Ms. Martinez, it was just another Friday evening at the hospital.

Texto completo: The publication of the allegations came a week after Mr. Sondland testified before Congress in the impeachment proceedings.
Three women have accused Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, of making unwanted sexual advances toward them years before his recent turn as a star witness at the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, according to a news report.
The women shared their accounts with ProPublica and Portland Monthly, which published them online Wednesday in a joint investigative project between the nonprofit news organization and the Oregon magazine.
The publication of the allegations came exactly one week after Mr. Sondland appeared before Congress and gave what was widely viewed as damaging testimony about Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine and a "quid pro quo." Mr. Sondland, 62, a businessman and hotelier, contributed $ 1 million to Mr. Trump's inaugural committee.
The report identified the three women as Jana Solis, Natalie Sept and Nicole Vogel, who is the owner of Portland Monthly. The magazine said that Ms. Vogel was not involved in editorial decisions and that the magazine's editorial team decided independently to pursue the story.
Ms. Sept and Ms. Vogel confirmed on Wednesday night that their accounts in the report were accurate. Ms. Solis could not immediately be reached for comment, but all three told the magazine that it felt like Mr. Sondland had retaliated against them after they rejected his advances.
In an email to The New York Times on Wednesday night, Ms. Sept said that she had been "haunted by this experience -- especially since seeing Sondland's confirmation as ambassador."
"I never met either of the other two women, yet each of our stories contained corroborative elements, which were recounted in the ProPublica and Portland Monthly story," she said. "I'm coming forward now so other women can tell their stories, and be believed."
Mr. Sondland disputed the women's allegations and questioned their timing in a statement posted on his personal website, saying that they were at odds with his character.
"These untrue claims of unwanted touching and kissing are concocted and, I believe, coordinated for political purposes," Mr. Sondland said. "They have no basis in fact, and I categorically deny them."
Ms. Vogel, 51, told the magazine that she approached Mr. Sondland in 2003 about investing in a magazine start-up that would cover Portland's art, culture and food scenes. After dining at a local restaurant with Mr. Sondland, she said, he invited her to a nearby hotel owned by his company and tried to forcibly kiss her after asking for a hug.
Despite the episode, Ms. Vogel told the magazine, she kept a lunch meeting with Mr. Sondland, who she said put his hand on her mid-thigh as they drove to the restaurant. Later, she said, Mr. Sondland substantially changed the terms of his pledge to invest in her publication.
Ms. Solis, 58, told the magazine that Mr. Sondland exposed himself to her during a 2008 visit to his home in Portland, where she said he had invited her to evaluate his art collection. She accused Mr. Sondland of forcibly kissing her and climbing on top of her when she visited his penthouse apartment on another occasion, which she said caused her to fall over the back of the couch as she tried to get away from him.
Ms. Sept, 35, said Mr. Sondland tried to forcibly kiss her after a 2010 networking dinner meeting with him, which she told the magazine she had hoped would lead to a job with the state film commission.
Jim McCarthy, a spokesman for Mr. Sondland, challenged the independence of the Portland Monthly's reporting in a statement posted on Mr. Sondland's personal website addressing each of the women's accounts.
He called it " an outlandish conflict of interest" because of Ms. Vogel's position with the magazine.
The magazine said it started reporting the story in October, around the time that Mr. Sondland gave a closed-door deposition to the House Intelligence Committee in which he said there was no quid pro quo by Mr. Trump seeking to tie foreign aid for Ukraine to an investigation into the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Mr. Sondland later changed his testimony to say that Mr. Trump had ordered him and other top administration officials to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, to dredge up unflattering information on Mr. Trump's political rivals from the former Soviet republic. Mr. Trump then said that he didn't know Mr. Sondland very well.
Mihir Zaveri contributed reporting.

The Hoodie Becomes Museum Appropriate

Texto completo: Few items of clothing are as politically and socially loaded as the hoodie. A new exhibition in Rotterdam tries to explain why.
There are few items of clothing as politically, socially and racially charged as the hoodie.
Long a linchpin of streetwear and, more recently, the advertising campaigns and catwalks of high fashion, the hoodie is a contemporary wardrobe staple, a declaration of fealty to a school or team, a comfortable garment for a plane ride and a sight that can trigger fear and panic.
Desired and derided in equal measure, regularly misunderstood, the hoodie is now heavy with associations of social inequality, youth culture and police brutality, even banned from certain streets, schools and institutions worldwide.
And, as of next month, it will be embraced by a museum.
"The Hoodie," the first exhibition devoted to its powerful and political nuances, opens Dec. 1 at the Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Dutch institute for architecture, design and digital culture in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A mixed media show of photographs, music, magazines covers and film footage, as well as more than 60 hoodies, it aims to frame the hoodie as a garment that Lou Stoppard, the curator of the exhibition, calls "unparalleled in its loaded tensions and contradictions." (Ms. Stoppard is also a journalist and an occasional contributor to The New York Times.)
Ms. Stoppard said she had wanted to curate a show about the hoodie for some time but had struggled to find a suitable site in more conventional fashion capitals like London or New York. The Instituut, with its focus on design objects and digital culture, proved a good fit for exploring the evolution of the hoodie as a sociopolitical carrier.
"The hoodie is a beautiful example of a design product that we all use and wear and that has become almost invisible as a result," said Guus Beumer, the Instituut director and a onetime art director in the fashion world. "And yet, at the same time, it now carries complex layers of meaning and privilege that should be unpacked."
"The Hoodie" charts the modern history of the garment, from the emergence of the first hooded sweatshirts worn by boxers and blue collar workers in the 1930s through its evolution as a 1970s streetwear staple and its role in the present day.
The show explores when and why the hoodie became intertwined with certain communities, like the worlds of hip-hop and Silicon Valley, and how designs from some of the biggest names in fashion came to reflect evolving social concerns like elitism and gender neutrality.
Rick Owens's furry, floor-length hoodie appears to be a sort of armor for the end of days, while Craig Green's androgynous, utilitarian garb is an innovative exploration of work wear. Hoodies from Vetements, the upstart Paris label that for a time became one of the most disruptive and influential forces in fashion thanks to its runway reimagining of urban streetwear, are inscribed with tongue-in-cheek slogans like "It's my birthday and all I got was this overpriced hoodie from Vetements."
The show also dissects the ways in which the hoodie has often become a stereotype to represent the supposed criminality of black and brown communities, as well as a tool of racial profiling, tracing such connections through, for example, the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot while wearing one.
"Deliberately concealing one's identity can be seen as an act of defiance or rage, and often generates uncertainty and fear," Ms. Stoppard said. "But many people, particularly those who are young or feel marginalized from society, wear a hoodie to feel safe and cocooned. Pulling one on allows them to feel like they disappear, or blend in."
The show ends with an examination of the rise of surveillance culture, and how that phenomenon may affect what we wear. Pervasive monitoring by video cameras on street corners and lampposts, capturing your face and tracking your movements, then cross-referencing that information with a central database, means that garments like the hoodie (or the burqa) may become even more contentious.
"To want privacy, anonymity, is inherently suspicious, and an affront to surveillance culture," Ms. Stoppard said, noting that not far from where the exhibition was about to open its doors, high-profile court hearings were taking place over the Dutch government's automated system for detecting welfare fraud and profiling of the poor.
She and the Instituut hope to use the exhibition not just to raise awareness of the presumptions many of us bring to hoodies, but also to change attitudes, to create a sense of inclusivity and community around the garment. Anyone who wears a hoodie to see the show will be given access free of charge.
"The hoodie is an iconic and recognizable piece of clothing, but to wear one with unthinking confidence tends to be inextricably tied up with privilege," Ms. Stoppard said. "By giving visitors that platform, should they want it, we can aim to make visible the individuals underneath."
"The Hoodie" runs until April 2020 at the Het Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Pass the pie and shut your piehole: Almost a third of Minnesotans have stopped talking to someone due to politics

Texto completo: As Americans come together for Thanksgiving, they are divided: a recent Harris Poll for the Instacart Grocery Delivery Company found almost half of Americans find the canned variety of cranberries “disgusting.”
Politics has become one of the other polarizing elements of the holiday. Though most Minnesotans — about seven of every 10 — talk politics with family and friends at least once a week, over a third of have stopped talking with at least one person due to politics, according to a recent survey conducted by the University of Minnesota’s Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication.
Polarization is to blame, says Paul Goren, chair of the University of Minnesota’s Political Science Department. President Donald Trump has a “unique ability to fire up Republicans and alienate Democrats,” Goren said.
But Trump’s election is a consequence, not the cause, of such polarization, said Goren. America’s divisions have been growing wider for several decades, with politics becoming more about winning and less about solving problems, which manifests in our political conversations. Rather than having civil discussions that seek common ground or at least end with agreement to disagree, talk devolves into a competition to come out on top.
Grant Rockwood, a Republican of Minneapolis, is in that one-third. He stopped talking with his mother over their political disagreements for months. But he is joining his family for Thanksgiving in Elk River, bringing a new girlfriend and crossing his fingers that politics doesn’t make the menu. “I don’t need to go there,” he said.
The poll was conducted for the Hubbard School by Strategic Research Group, an Ohio-based strategic research firm. Results are based on 707 completed responses from a representative sample of Minnesotans who were invited to participate using an address-based approach. The responses were collected Oct. 2 through Oct. 31. The margin of error for the survey is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points, though margins are larger when breaking down subgroups of the sample.
According to the U survey, strong partisans were more likely to cut off communicating over politics: 44 percent compared to 27 percent among those who are not strong partisans.
Q: Is there anyone you have stopped talking with due to disagreements about politics?
A: Yes
The survey also suggests suburban Minnesotans were less likely to have cut ties over politics than their urban and rural counterparts, though the results fell within the margins of error. Just 26 percent reported that they quit talking to someone over politics. That compares to 32 percent of rural residents and 39 percent of urbanites.
Q: Is there anyone you have stopped talking with due to disagreements about politics?
A: Yes
“There’s more churn, more diversity, and so it’s easier to find people who disagree with you in the suburbs, but because there’s more of them, maybe it’s not quite so judgmental,” Goren said.
Democrats who responded to the survey were more likely to have stopped talking to someone than were Republicans, though the difference is also within the margin of error.
A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that “people with down-the-line ideological positions – especially conservatives – are more likely than others to say that most of their close friends share their political views.” The survey also found that “partisan animosity has increased substantially” over the previous two decades.
In Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School has been asking similar questions of registered voters for several years. In August 2018, the most recent time it was asked, 18 percent of respondents said they had stopped talking to someone because of political disagreements.
Minde Frederick, a Democrat from Minneapolis, said she tends to avoid certain people not just because it can be uncomfortable, but because “right or wrong, I don’t necessarily want to hear their opinion.” She said politics will come up on Thanksgiving Day though “because my mom and I won’t be able to help ourselves.” Then again, they tend to agree, she added.
Helping people discuss politics constructively has become a bit of a cottage industry. NBC News suggests nine tips for doing so. The New York Times has 10. Most such lists include better listening and less judging; arguing from a position of respect for the other person; and trying to understand rather than convince.
The Better Arguments Project, created by several groups including The Aspen Institute, aims to bridge ideological divides “by teaching Americans how to have better arguments.”
Eric Liu, executive director of the Institute’s Citizenship & American Identity program, lists three steps, and one of them is, surprisingly, to argue more. “We don’t need fewer arguments today; we need less stupid ones,” Liu wrote for The Atlantic.
That means getting past the two-party style of debate and arguing over deeper, foundational aspirations for the country. But the first step to getting there is listening, according to Liu. “I don’t mean ‘debater’s listening,’ in which you pay only enough attention to get the gist of the other person’s point so you can prepare your rebuttal. I mean radically compassionate listening: without judgment, without response,” he wrote.
The second step: “doing stuff together,” such as community or national service to focus on the needs of others rather than on our own differences. “ . . . Whatever it is, if it brings people together across lines of race, class, and politics, it will bring to the fore our common humanity.”
More argument isn’t what many Minnesotans will be looking for as they pass the gravy this week, however. Several said they’ll be serving up political talk only among guests with shared ideology. When company is bipartisan, they tend to dampen debate.
“I appreciate healthy dialogue,” said Annissa Ulbrich, a Democrat from Winona. “This is just kind of getting out of control crazy, and it makes it very hard to have a civil conversation.”
Still, as Ulbrich enjoys her Thanksgiving meal, she is sure politics will come up. Despite voting for Democrats his whole life, her dad supports Trump, she said. Her brother does too, and he is more opinionated. “I always think it is hard to argue or discuss politics with somebody that’s supporting this particular administration,” Ulbrich said. “It’s not technically having a conversation.”
But there are Trump supporters who are also eager to avoid the topic. Curt Kaderlik, a Republican from Owatonna, said he often calls the White House to tell Trump “what a great job he is doing.” But the 78-year-old will try to avoid the topic on Thursday even though it will just be him and his “better half.”
“She is a staunch Democrat,” he said. “We’d get world war three going here … so I don’t dare mention Trump. She hates his guts.”

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and current host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” first cut his teeth in some of the area’s smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100 to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000 to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed The Loud & Clear Tour, is now playing out in arenas across the country and Noah will return to Southern California to headline Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles Friday, Dec. 6.
“I’ve been lucky that California has been one of the places where I’ve had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following,” Noah said during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping “The Daily Show” back in New York. “It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That’s the only way I can look at this show (at Staples Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show.”
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah said that’s not what his comedy show is. He’s said in previous interviews that he doesn’t talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
“The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste,” he said. “‘The Daily Show’ is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I’ve been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they’ll say ‘Hey, I love your stand-up … I don’t like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.’ That’s fine with me. I don’t think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people. I’ve always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends … I just want you to have a good time. It’s not a show designed for one specific person, it’s designed for everybody.”
Doing the stand-up tour gives Noah a break from the 24/7 news cycle and all the commotion and breaking news that comes with ongoing impeachment hearings and the ramping up of yet another election year.
“It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too,” he said. “People always ask me, ‘How do you cope with Trump all the time?’ It’s not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that’s 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that’s more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don’t have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too.”
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he’s a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, “The Beautiful Ones,” which was released in late October. He also said that if he had to choose between either being on “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars,” he’d pick “The Masked Singer.”
“Because I’d be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off,” he said with a laugh. “I don’t think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice.”
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He’s obviously got a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,” became a New York Times Bestseller and his “Son of Patricia” special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Jan. 26 at Staples Center.
“I live a very strange life in that I’ve never been too worried about the distant future,” Noah said. “I just try to focus on what I’m doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I’m focused on is the Loud & Clear Tour and ‘The Daily Show,’ just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that’s all done, I’ll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that’s right in front of me.”

Texto completo: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz put together a chart of all the mistakes he found the FBI made in the process of obtaining warrants to wiretap former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
The list of "numerous" errors and omissions appears in a draft report containing the findings of Horowitz's year-and-a-half investigation examining the DOJ's and the FBI's compliance with legal requirements and policies in applications filed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, according to the New York Times.
The final report is slated for release on Dec. 9, and two days later Horowitz is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about his investigation.
President Trump's GOP allies have eagerly anticipated Horowitz's report, believing it will show that top Justice Department and FBI officials misled the FISA Court by using an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain warrants to wiretap Page after he left the campaign.
Democrats, as well as current and former FBI officials, have dismissed allegations of wrongdoing and have raised concerns that information about U.S. intelligence-gathering could be weaponized to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller.
[RELATED: DOJ watchdog expected to criticize FBI for excluding 'game changer' material from FISA application]
According to leaks about the draft report, Horowitz is expected to condemn the FBI for failing to inform the judges on the FISA Court of potential problems with the dossier.
The inspector general is also said to have found no evidence of political bias by top officials tainting the Russia investigation. His investigators did find that an FBI lawyer, identified as Kevin Clinesmith, allegedly altered a document related to the surveillance of Page, but determined Clinesmith's actions did not taint the overall validity of a renewal application.
[RELATED: Bruce Ohr faces criticism in Russia investigation review]
Horowitz referred his findings about Clinesmith to the Justice Department for potential criminal charges.
At about the same time, U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was conducting an administrative review of the Russia investigation at the behest of Attorney General William Barr, shifted his case into a criminal investigation.
Page, an American citizen who was suspected to be a Russian asset but was never charged, claimed he has not been given a chance to provide any input for Horowitz's "one-sided" report and filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for D.C. last month accusing the Justice Department of Privacy Act violations and demanding an opportunity to review the FISA report before it is released to the public.

Confronting the reality of a cruel hoax on race and crime

Resumen: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that "systemic racism" will "be with us" no matter who is in the White House. Sen. Cory Booker called for "attacking systemic racism" in the "racially biased" criminal justice system.
Let’s follow up by examining Booker’s concern about a "racially biased" criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, "A Platform of Urban Decline," which appeared in Manhattan Institute’s publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you’ve never read before.
According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: "According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well."
There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races.
White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House" are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people. We face the difficult, and sometimes embarrassing, task of confronting reality.
Mac Donald says that Barack Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an "unforgivable outburst of white supremacy." Here’s what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: "If we are honest with ourselves," too many fathers are "missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men." Then-Sen. Obama went on to say, "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
White liberals deem that any speaker’s references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. Black people cannot afford to buy into the white liberal agenda. White liberals don’t pay the same price. They don’t live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don’t go to bed with the sounds of gunshots. White liberals don’t live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don’t attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair, such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago.
Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system.

"This is the most powerful station we have been on in our 33 years. We're movin' on up."

Texto completo: For too long, "kitchen gifts" have referred to kitschy, single-use products (think novelty aprons, egg cookers) that are more likely to get stuck inside some drawer than proudly displayed and used day after day. Even the most well-intentioned gift givers tend to draw a blank when it comes to the kitchen and succumb to the lure of plastic gadgets and funny mugs. Luckily, it doesn't have to be that way. To help you gift smarter and better, we've rounded up the best kitchen gifts of the year that people actually want and love. Whether you're shopping for an experienced chef or someone who uses their oven to store clothes, we've got you covered. These are the best kitchen gifts of 2019, according to Reviewed:
For the one who wants an air fryer: Philips Airfryer XXL Air fryers were the hottest kitchen gadgets (literally) again in 2019, and they're popping up all over wish lists this holiday season. With so many on the market, it can be hard to tell them all apart—that's why we tested over 20 of the best air fryers to see which are actually worth buying. The Philips Airfryer XXL easily claimed the top spot, churning out massive batches of crisp french fries, crackling fried chicken, and perfectly cooked burgers with ease.
If your giftee can't decide between an air fryer and an Instant Pot, the other trendiest gadget on shelves this year, we recommend checking out the Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker that can sear, bake, pressure cook, air fry, and more.
Get the Philips Airfryer XXL on Amazon for $299.95
For the one who doesn't want an air fryer: Breville Smart Oven Pro While the idea of an air fryer might sound nice, not everyone can afford that extra countertop space—and having a massive black plastic appliance out at all times isn't the most design-friendly. For those cooks who prefer sleek minimalism, the Breville Smart Oven Pro is the appliance of their dreams. It scored top marks in our toaster oven roundup, but it's so much more than a toaster oven. It can bake, broil, and roast as well as a full-size oven, and its convection bake setting yields crispy results like an air fryer.
If you didn't know that an air fryer is just a small convection oven, now you know—now share that with your loved ones and get gifting.
Get the Breville Smart Oven Pro on Amazon for $269.99
For the wannabe 'Bake Off' contestant: KitchenAid Artisan 5-Quart Stand Mixer The KitchenAid brand is synonymous with "stand mixer" for a reason—their timeless, high-performing mixers are simply better than the competition. The 5-quart Artisan stand mixer remains No. 1 in our roundup of the best stand mixers on the market thanks to its powerful, quiet motor and user-friendly design. Hobby bakers and professionals alike adore this model, which has almost 7,000 5-star reviews on Amazon. Oh, and it comes in 20 stunning colors—but if you're not sure what color your giftee would love, you can never go wrong with Empire Red.
Get the KitchenAid Artisan 5-Quart Stand Mixer on Amazon for $299.99
For the one who wants an Instant Pot: Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 For busy home cooks who don't already have a pressure cooker, you can never go wrong with an Instant Pot. The incredibly popular family of multicookers still has everyone buzzing—but there are too many models to tell apart! If you don't know where to start, we recommend the Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1, which took first place in our roundup of the best multicookers and offers the most valuable options for the money. It's sleek interface and convenient controls will have your giftee thanking you again and again.
Get the Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 (6 Quart) on Amazon for $109
For the cook who needs to feed a crowd: Staub Cast Iron 5.5-Quart Round Cocotte A classic, well-designed Dutch oven is a great gift for just about anyone, but they're particularly handy for people who tend to cook a lot of food at once. You might assume that Le Creuset has this category on lock, but the best Dutch oven from our testing is actually the 5.5-Quart Round Cocotte from French competitor Staub, a sleek, stylish, and versatile vessel for cooking just about anything.
If you're put off by the price tag on the Staub, we recommend the Lodge 4.5-Quart Round Dutch Oven, our top budget pick.
Get the Staub Cast Iron 5.5-Quart Round Cocotte on Amazon for $339.95
For the beginner in need of knives: Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet Classic Knife Block Set Experienced chefs might find the number of knives in a knife block excessive, but for beginners and households with multiple cooks, a block is essential. We tested the best knife sets on the market and found the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet Classic Knife Block to be the most comprehensive set with the sharpest blades—very giftable.
For the one who wants to save the turtles: Hummingbird Glass Straws Straw bans and single-use plastics have been all over the news since last year, so we tested the best reusable straws to help you make the best environmentally conscious decision. Our favorite, the Hummingbird Glass Straw, is beautiful, durable, and easy-to-clean, making it the perfect stocking stuffer for on-the-go sippers who want to be a little kinder to the Earth.
Get Hummingbird Glass Straws, Set of 4 on Amazon for $19.99
For the classic style icon: Baker Stripe Dish Towels Dish towels can (and should) be a lot more than some rags you keep around to your kitchen. With their colorful pinstripes and high-quality knit fabric, these stylish dish towels evoke thoughts of French patisserie windows and dreamy summer fantasies of a simpler life. OK, and they're soft and absorbent and highly rated on Anthropologie. If you're just looking for clean white towels or even simpler designs, check out our roundup of the best dish towels for some great options.
Get the Baker Stripe Dish Towels, Set of 4 from Anthropologie for $20
For the talented chef: 'How to Cook Everything' by Mark Bittman Cookbook collectors can be hard to shop for, but there's a good chance they don't already have the 20th anniversary edition of How to Cook Everything from Mark Bittman of the New York Times. Released just this month, this edition expands on Bittman's excellent recipes and deep explainers on all-things cooking. This is a tomb with something to teach novices and experienced chefs alike.
Looking for something easier to digest? Celebrity chef Samin Nosrat's "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat," the book that launched her hit Netflix show, is a colorful and eye-opening guide to mastering the elements of cooking. "Just reading Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat will make you a better cook, adept at seasoning, balancing, and understanding what it really is you're doing and why," writes Bon Appétit.
Get "How to Cook Everything—Completely Revised Twentieth Anniversary Edition: Simple Recipes for Great Food" by Mark Bittman on Amazon for $22.20

President Pledges to Label Drug Cartels as Terrorists

Texto completo: The comments, made in an interview with the former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, came three weeks after nine American citizens, including six children, were killed in Mexico.
President Trump said in an interview posted online Tuesday that he planned to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, owing to what he said was the high number of Americans killed by their activities.
The comments, which were made in an interview with the former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and posted to his personal website, represent a shift in United States policy that the Mexican foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, told reporters on Monday he did not believe would happen.
"I will be designating the cartels," Mr. Trump said in the interview. "I have been working on that for the last 90 days. You know, designation is not that easy, you have to go through a process, and we are well into that process."
Deadly violence by drug cartels in Mexico gained new attention in the United States in recent weeks after the killing of six children and their three mothers, all dual Mexican and American citizens, who were part of a fundamentalist Mormon community in the north of the country.
After that ambush, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the time had come "for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth."
In the interview posted online Tuesday, Mr. Trump declined to say what measures he would consider taking once the cartels had been designated as terrorist organizations. When Mr. O'Reilly asked if drone strikes in Mexico were a possibility, the president replied, "I don't want to say what I am going to do, but they will be designated."
"Look, we are losing 100,000 people a year to what is happening and what is coming through from on Mexico," the president said, without elaborating. "They have unlimited money, the people, the cartels, because they have a lot of money, because it is drug money and human trafficking money."
The administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico seemed to be caught off-guard by Mr. Trump's declarations.
In a statement issued Tuesday night, the Mexican Foreign Ministry said it had "entered into communication with the various corresponding authorities" of the United States "to know the content and the reach" of Mr. Trump's statements. The ministry also said it would seek to set up a high-level meeting "as soon as possible" to address the issue.
"The Government of Mexico will continue its diplomatic work towards an understanding that, through cooperation and intelligence, guarantees the security of both countries," the statement said.
Mr. Ebrard, the foreign minister, had said a day earlier that he did not expect the United States government to seek to designate Mexican drug trafficking organizations as terrorists, and suggested that the two countries were already working together closely enough in the fight against those groups without the need for that legal designation.
"You do not need to designate or classify a specific group as terrorist so that we act together against it," Mr. Ebrard said.
Once a group has been designated as a terrorist organization, it is illegal for people in the United States to knowingly provide support for it, and its members are barred from entering the country. Financial institutions are also forbidden from doing business with the organization.
Arturo Sarukhán, a former Mexican ambassador to Washington, said that the designation would create "a series of collateral effects" with profound implications for the relationship between the United States and Mexico.
The designation would not only have an impact on the bilateral strategy to combat narcotrafficking, but could also have "very broad and brutal political, diplomatic, financial, economic and commercial consequences," he said in an interview on Milenio Televisión, a Mexican network.
It would also have the political effect of reinforcing "this narrative of Mexico as a threat to the national security of the United States," Mr. Sarukhán said, noting that the timing coincided with the start of the presidential campaign.
"It's something that really can be very, very, very disruptive for the bilateral relationship," he said.
The interview between Mr. Trump and Mr. O'Reilly that was posted online on Tuesday evening was a clip from a longer conversation between the two. Mr. O'Reilly said that the full interview would be available to people who bought a premium membership to his personal website.

Texto completo: Readers criticize President Trump's failing policy. Also: The G.O.P. and guns; grief at the holidays; free parking in New York City.
To the Editor:
Re "Mr. Trump's Lose-Lose Proposition in Korea" (editorial, Nov. 22):
The failure of the most recent round of talks between the United States and South Korea on how to equitably share the costs of American troops on the peninsula is dangerous to the future of this crucial alliance, which has kept the peace in Northeast Asia for more than six decades. The alliance has also underpinned South Korea's prosperity and fostered trade and investment relations increasingly beneficial to America.
South Korea is not a free rider. It bolstered military expenditures 7 percent in 2018, reaching $ 43.1 billion, or 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, a level greater than any other major American ally. And South Korea receives zero foreign military aid from American taxpayers while 80 percent of its arms purchases are of American weapons.
The United States' request that South Korea shoulder more of its defense burden is reasonable. But the ask should be fair and transparent.
South Korean public opinion remains broadly optimistic about our two countries' relations, and Congress staunchly supports the alliance. Its value cannot be reduced to a nearsighted balance-sheet calculation by either side.
Thomas Byrne

To the Editor:
President Trump's failing Korea policy could be saved with some of Dwight D. Eisenhower's ideas.
Ike's open skies plan -- joint aerial inspection missions -- would benefit North and South Korea. These flights over each other's territory would improve transparency and cooperation between the two rivals. This is based on the Open Skies Treaty, which Mr. Trump is wrongly trying to eliminate.
Another Eisenhower idea, ending nuclear weapons testing, would also help ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which bans all nuclear test explosions, should be ratified by the United States along with North Korea and China.
These two arms control steps would be powerful symbols of peace and improve cooperation among rival countries. We need steppingstones toward a disarmament agreement.

The Republicans and Guns
To the Editor:
Re "The G.O.P. Can Win the Suburbs" (Op-Ed, Nov. 20):
A thought for David A. Hopkins: Yes, "soccer moms" care about education, but they also care even more about school safety.
As long as the Republican Party opposes any measures to manage the proliferation of firearms, schoolchildren everywhere face danger in one of the places they should feel secure: their schools.
Even participating in safety drills is traumatizing.

Dealing With Grief at the Holidays
To the Editor:
Re "Yes, It's O.K. to Be Sad During the Holidays" (Wellness special section, Nov. 24):
I am now a member of the club no one wants to belong to: those who have lost a spouse in the last year.
As a bit of an introvert as well as one who could take pleasure in wallowing in grief, I have found a truism in what my mother used to say: "Laugh and the world laughs with you; cry, and you cry alone."
So with the holidays bearing down upon me, I decided to force myself out of the house (no mean feat!), and I have taken to smiling like the Cheshire cat, even while driving.
Amazingly I have found that in turn, my mood is lighter, and I can face the Currier & Ives-type gatherings.
Sometimes we need to give ourselves that little "push" to go out; we need to paste on that smile. It's only for a few hours, and I truly don't feel as if I'm overcompensating. I am helping myself through the holidays and through this grief.

Don't Ban Free Parking
To the Editor:
Re "Thinking the Unthinkable: Don't Even Think of Parking Here" (news article, Nov. 21), about proposals to eliminate free street parking in Manhattan:
It's hard to imagine in what universe the critics of street parking are living. Haven't they gone outside? Stand on any street corner and watch cars go by. Around 90 percent are taxis or ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. New York has been flooded by about 80,000 ride-sharing vehicles in the last couple of years.
Between bike lanes, commercial parking, construction and other lane closures, driving in the city has become an exercise in exasperation. Almost none of this is because of private passenger cars.
Why is free parking being blamed for the traffic problems? And why are those of us who need a car (I have to take a lengthy subway ride to get mine) being punished for a problem we didn't cause? Banning free street parking is undemocratic and misguided, and will not increase traffic flow.

Texto completo: There’s a local angle to everything, even the impeachment hearings. David Holmes, a U.S. Embassy diplomat in Ukraine who testified Nov. 21, went to college in the Inland Valley, as reader Ray Escoto alerted me.
“I’m a graduate of Pomona College in Claremont, California,” Holmes told the House Intelligence Committee in his opening statement. No one interrupted to ask why Pomona College isn’t in Pomona.
Holmes is the witness who said he was eating lunch at a restaurant in Ukraine with Gordon Sondland, the ambassador, when Sondland placed a call to President Donald Trump on an unsecured line. Trump spoke so loudly, Holmes said, that Sondland pulled the phone away from his ear and both sides of the conversation were audible.
(We’ve all taken calls like that. Perhaps I’ll get one after this item runs.)
According to Holmes, when Trump asked if the Ukrainian president was on board with investigating the Bidens, Sondland assured the president, “He loves your ass.”
“There’s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly,” Holmes testified.
In response, Trump tweeted that his hearing is “great” and that he’s never been able to overhear the other side of a phone conversation, statements that may cancel each other out.
“Who is David Holmes?,” the New York Times asked in a headline the next day. Answering its own question, the paper said Holmes joined the State Department under President George W. Bush and has been stationed in Russia, Afghanistan and India.
He won a State Department award in 2014 for “constructive dissent” for expressing concerns about President Barack Obama’s policy toward Afghanistan. The Washington Post described him as “a rising star in the Foreign Service.”
Closer to home, the 1997 alumnus won Pomona College’s Inspirational Young Alumni Award in 2004. Still, be careful what you say around him. He must have good ears.
Grandfatherly advice
A newspaper colleague in Upland told me last week: “My grandson had to attend a council meeting for his government class so I suggested he go to Ontario, rather than Upland meetings which go on forever. Great idea — tonight’s Ontario meeting lasted 12 minutes.”
I’ve rarely seen any high school students at Ontario meetings, but they’re worth the drive if you want to spare yourself a late night. And also if your grade isn’t dependent on excitement.
Stone wall (cont’d)
Remember the topic of the stone wall on Claremont’s Foothill Boulevard, newly revealed after vegetation was removed? Its origins are somewhat mysterious, although it’s believed to date to the 1920s or ’30s, when the land behind it was first subdivided for housing.
But now we know who built it: Clarence Stover.
Paula Pitzer, into whose family Stover married, told me: “His idea was he would make a form and drop in cement, rebar and these rocks. After he got in enough layers, he would shake the form. The idea is the rocks would slide over the surfaces and it would make it a good look.”
Stover’s company built houses, college buildings and commercial buildings in the Village. Stover “contributed to the look of Claremont more than any other builder,” John Neiuber wrote in the Courier in 2018.
Stover graduated from Pomona College in 1921, later served as a trustee and has the campus’ Stover Memorial Walk near Bridges Auditorium named for him. He died in 1955.
“He never did another wall,” Pitzer said. Apparently building it was more labor-intensive than he’d expected. But the one wall he did certainly contributed to the look of Claremont.
Thanksgiving!
Thanksgiving almost couldn’t fall any later, but here it comes Nov. 28 — not even a month shy of Christmas.
Whenever the date lands, it’s an opportunity to reflect on what we’re thankful for. Reasons I’m thankful include a stimulating job in an ever-changing valley, one that generates a steady flow of column ideas. Another reason is you attentive readers, who let me know you’re reading, correct me when I flub something and give me the occasional knock to keep me honest.
Thanks for reading, enjoy your holiday and I’ll see you here Friday — with a column I’ll be cobbling together on Wednesday, pre-turkey.
Valley Vignette
The TGI Friday’s restaurant in Ontario at 3351 N. Centre Lake Drive is closing Dec. 8. Reader Jeff Butler told me he and his wife have been regulars for 15 years and got the bad news from the manager recently. “There are a lot of memories from that place, as we had many birthday dinners and dinners with good friends there,” Butler said. The restaurant is planning a “Go out with a bang” farewell party Dec. 5 from 6 to 10 p.m. for regulars. “So come early,” an announcement board in the restaurant urges, “and let’s talk about how we all made this place like home.”

Paul Krugman: Trump is giving U.S. businesses the Ukraine treatment

Texto completo: The story that has emerged in the impeachment hearings is one of extortion and bribery. Donald Trump withheld crucial aid — aid Ukraine needed to defend itself against Russian aggression — and refused to release it unless Ukraine publicly said it was investigating one of his political rivals. Even Republicans understand this; they just think it’s OK.
And remember, the Ukraine scandal made it into the public eye only because a single whistleblower set an investigation in motion. I know I’m not alone in wondering how many other comparable scandals haven’t come to light.
Nor need these scandals involve foreign governments. What I haven’t seen pointed out is that Trump is quietly applying a Ukraine-type extortion-and-bribery strategy to U.S. corporations. Many businesses are being threatened with policies that would hurt their bottom lines — especially, but not only, tariffs on imported goods crucial to their operations. But they are also being offered the possibility of exemptions from these policies.
And the implicit quid pro quo for such exemptions is that corporations support Donald Trump, or at least refrain from criticizing his actions.
Consider, for example, what happened last week, when Trump toured an Apple manufacturing plant together with Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. Trump used the occasion to make a political speech, attacking impeachment proceedings and falsely claiming that Nancy Pelosi has “closed Congress.” He also asserted that the plant, which has been operating since 2013, had just opened.
And Cook, far from correcting these falsehoods, expressed support, declaring that America has the “strongest economy in the world.”
Cook’s incentive to play along was obvious. Apple assembles many of its products in China; it’s seeking exemptions from Trump’s China tariffs. And there’s every reason to believe that the allocation of such exemptions is driven by politics, not the national interest.
For example, in 2018 a company owned by Oleg Deripaska — an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, who is supposed to be under U.S. sanctions for activities that include interference in foreign elections — received a waiver from aluminum tariffs. The waiver was withdrawn only after Democrats in Congress noticed it, with the Commerce Department claiming that it had been granted as a result of a “clerical error.” Uh-huh.
By the way, if you’re wondering why the Trump administration has the power to play favorites, it’s because U.S. trade law gives the president a lot of discretion in setting tariffs. The purpose of that discretion was to diminish the power of special interests in Congress, based on the assumption that the president would be better at serving the national interest. But then came Trump.
And tariff policy isn’t the only area in which the administration seems to be using its power to punish corporations if they don’t show proper political fealty.
Recently the Pentagon granted the huge Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract for cloud computing (yes, JEDI) to Microsoft, shocking observers who expected it to go to Amazon. Amazon is challenging the decision, claiming that it was punishment for critical reporting in The Washington Post, now owned by Jeff Bezos — a claim that is entirely plausible, given Trump’s own repeated declarations that he was going to give Bezos “problems.”
Trump officials claim, of course, that the decision process was squeaky-clean, based on expert judgment untainted by any political influence. But seriously, is anything clean in this administration? Are we really supposed to accept on faith that people who are willing to politicize weather forecasts were totally hands-off when it came to awarding a huge, lucrative contract to a company Trump considers an enemy?
When I and others point out the ways in which Trump is using crony capitalism to lock in political advantage, we tend to get two kinds of pushback. First, we’re told that we shouldn’t feel sympathy for wealthy corporations. Second, we’re told that progressive Democrats also criticize some corporations, like Facebook, and have proposed a crackdown on some kinds of corporate behavior. So what’s the difference?
Well, these critiques (willfully, one suspects) miss the point. What progressives are proposing are rules for corporate behavior that would apply equally to all companies, not be imposed selectively on corporations depending on their political orientation.
And the trouble with Trump’s selective doling out of punishment isn’t the harm it inflicts on corporations, it’s the incentives this regime creates for political sycophancy. American voters and American democracy, not Apple and Amazon — which are, as it happens, notorious examples of tax avoidance — are the victims we care about.
Put it this way: By using his political power to punish businesses that don’t support him while rewarding those that do, Trump is taking us along the same path already followed by countries like Hungary, which remains a democracy on paper but has become a one-party authoritarian state in practice. And we’re already much further down that road than many people realize.

Texto completo: The country music star celebrates 50 years as a member of the Grand Ole Opry. And the comedian's one-man Broadway show about fatherhood comes to Netflix.
What's on TV
DOLLY PARTON: 50 YEARS AT THE OPRY 9 p.m. on NBC. The newly crowned millennial queen, Dolly Parton, is currently enjoying a renaissance of sorts as the subject of a popular podcast and a Netflix anthology series. But this two-hour special celebrates Parton's legacy as a performer. At age 73, she is celebrating 50 years as a member of the Grand Ole Opry, even though her first performance on the storied Nashville stage was at age 13, following an introduction from Johnny Cash. The special will feature performances from Parton and other country music artists like Emmylou Harris, Dierks Bentley and Toby Keith, as well as new interviews about the star's life and career.
LINDSEY VONN: THE FINAL SEASON 10 p.m. on HBO. One of the most difficult decisions many Olympic athletes are forced to make at some point in their careers is when to stop competing. This documentary takes viewers inside that emotional process for Lindsey Vonn, a top female skier, who decided to retire at the age of 34 this year. The directors Steve and Todd Jones capture the moments leading up to Vonn's final World Championship appearance, and retrace the triumphs and setbacks the four-time Olympic gold medalist encountered throughout her career.
CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS (2004) 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. on AMC. This Christmas movie has been voted one of the worst of all time, but that doesn't mean it can't grow into a holiday cult classic like "A Christmas Story." Tim Allen, who has played Santa in other holiday films, stars as this movie's scrooge. He decides, for budgetary reasons, that he and his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) will skip Christmas, despite a collective rebuke from members of their festive Chicago suburb. When their daughter decides to return home for the holiday from her stint working in the Peace Corps, the empty nesters scramble to get into the Christmas spirit at the last minute.
What's Streaming
MIKE BIRBIGLIA: THE NEW ONE Stream on Netflix. The comedian, storyteller and director Mike Birbiglia has made a career out of deftly observational and confessional comedy, performing one-man shows about his troubles with sleepwalking, joke-telling and, most recently, fatherhood. After a Broadway run and a national tour, this show, which Ben Brantley designated a New York Times Critic's Pick, is now available to stream. In it, Birbiglia agonizes over the decision to have and raise children, using a list of seven reasons like "I have a cat," or "consciousness is only a hallucination," and expands on them, going down detours that explore who he is as an individual, a husband and a father. "As he restlessly circumambulates, verbally and physically, he's always reaching for explanations that seem to explode on him," Brantley wrote in his New York Times review. "Yet, in the end, a symmetry emerges from the chaos he describes and embodies."

Texto completo: The DNA of Montgomery Allen was there in the screenplay for "The Last Black Man in San Francisco." But "anyone who has siblings knows DNA does not a person make," says Jonathan Majors, who plays Montgomery in the film. "The 'how' is kind of the actor's work."
"Mont" is best friend to Jimmie Fails -- a heightened version of the real Jimmie Fails, who co-wrote the film's story with director Joe Talbot inspired by his own life. Fails is fixated on the grand house with a "witch hat" roof that he brags was built by his grandfather, and he and Mont take over the house when it suddenly becomes vacant.
It's a story about gentrification and racial sidelining, and a coming-of-age tale -- but told in the romanticized realm of fable.

"It's an exploration of something so specific that it does kind of become magical," Majors said, "like in the way that the town is really being examined. If you look at anything under a microscope, it seems impossible that that's actually happening. There's beauty in it, and there's complexities that you wouldn't know if you just saw it."
Majors, 30, studied acting at Yale. Small roles in "Hostiles" and "White Boy Rick" preceded his performance in "Last Black Man," which Manohla Dargis of the New York Times called "a mournful heartbreaker."
Mont is a sensitive artist always armed with a sketchbook, but he earns money as a fishmonger. He's also an aspiring actor and director. He lives with his blind grandfather, played by Danny Glover, and shares his bedroom -- as well as a rarely seen platonic intimacy -- with Jimmie. Even though the film has fable qualities, Majors didn't give a larger-than-life performance.
"No, I think it's natural," he said. "That individual literally thinks differently. And how you think is how you behave, right? So he behaves truthfully under his real circumstances -- at least that was my hope in portraying him."
Majors and Fails became inseparable during the shoot, developing a very real friendship chemistry. The film's star had no prior training or experience in front of the camera, so Majors became a de facto acting coach -- just like his character.
"We had such an ease between us," said Majors. "I could see where he was coming up against unknown territory, and I just said, 'This is possibly how you can navigate it.' He in character, and me in character, and I'd just tell him -- as Mont would do -- 'Well, you could try it this way.' "
One of the great, revealing Mont moments in the film is when Kofi (Jamal Trulove) gets into a tense altercation with his group of macho guys. Mont walks up to the fray like a theater director and says to the gathering of toughs: "Good, good, excellent. Great news is, you're all doing marvelous work." The fight defuses through sheer bewilderment at this enigmatic, tenderhearted act.
Majors auditioned with that scene, but in the original script Mont does a magic trick. On the day they shot it, he and Talbot felt that wouldn't work anymore, and the end result was "full-on improvisation."
"There's a guy, Paul Mullins, who directed me one summer in 'Our Town,' " Majors said, "and he would always say 'Good, good, excellent.' I just thought it was the funniest thing in the world, you know. If you've been in drama school for eight years, you've got teachers in your head all the time. It was a full tribute to them."
Majors was born in Lompoc, Calif., and moved to Texas as a boy. His mother is a Methodist pastor. Jumping around between cultures -- including Yale -- as a black man made him keenly observant, with a gift for switching codes.
"You speak to be understood, right?" he said. "And you're understood so you can be felt. And you're felt so you can get what you want."
That ability fed into his portrayal of Mont, who studies the foulmouthed speech patterns of the street gang as well as the impassioned rhythms of the street preacher -- and tries them all on in a big, theatrical performance at the climax of the movie.
"He has multiple codes," Majors said, "and he can take on those codes so quickly because he's so empathetic. I want to know what Mont's point of view would be on Donald Trump." He laughed.
Montgomery was modeled after a friend of Talbot and Fails' named Prentice. Before production began, Majors said he could do an "interview project" on the real Prentice and capture his mannerisms and personality. But he strongly suggested bringing his own, original character to life -- which Talbot gladly accepted.
"No one wants to say, 'OK, I think there's a Picasso here, but just draw this,' " said Majors,"which is anathema to the Montgomery that we meet, who is individual and cannot be defined."

Michael Bloomberg spends $3 million on Texas TV ads as he rolls out presidential bid

Texto completo: As former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg rolls out his late-starting campaign for president this week, Texas is getting a big chunk of the billionaire’s television spending.
On Monday, Bloomberg began advertising on broadcast television in the Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso, Harlingen-Weslaco, Houston and San Antonio markets. More than $3 million will go toward Texas airwaves, according to Advertising Analytics, a Virginia-based company that tracks ad buys throughout the 2020 election.
Texas is one of 32 states in which Bloomberg is spending a total of $35 million on air time, which represents the largest one-week television buy in political history, according to Advertising Analytics. In Texas, his ads will remain on the airwaves until Dec. 2.
Bloomberg also has more than $1 million booked in Washington state, North Carolina, Illinois and Ohio, and nearly $1 million in Michigan, according to CNN. The top five markets Bloomberg is spending in are New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas and Miami.
No other presidential candidate has run broadcast television ads in Texas yet. Bloomberg’s advisers have said he plans to skip the four traditional early-state contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, and instead focus his campaign in Super Tuesday states, which include Texas.
“Texas is a pretty expensive media market, and some of the lower-tier campaigns will have trouble competing in Texas,” said Nicco Mele, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Bloomberg is looking for states where money is leverage.”
One of Bloomberg’s TV ads is a biographical one that was airing in the Dallas and Houston markets as of Monday morning. The 60-second spot discusses how he built his business and later became mayor of New York City as it was reeling from the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
“A three-term mayor who helped bring it back from the ashes, bringing jobs and thousands of affordable housing units with it,” a narrator says. “Jobs creator. Leader. Problem solver. Mike Bloomberg for president.”

A second ad, which was also running in Dallas and Houston, according to Advertising Analytics, focuses on the middle class.
“In the shadow of 9/11, Mike is elected mayor of a shaken city. He rebuilds, creating 400,000 new jobs to help the struggling middle class, improving care and safety for seniors and raising teacher pay and graduation rates,” the narrator says.
The ads — and the huge personal fortune thrown behind them — are a preview to the financial force Bloomberg plans to utilize to shape his White House bid. His $30 million purchase eclipses all of Bloomberg’s Democratic rivals’ spending on television ads for the year, save for fellow billionaire Tom Steyer, according to The New York Times.

A spokesman for Bloomberg told The Texas Tribune Monday afternoon that “Mike is prepared to spend what's needed to defeat Trump.”
Rivals, including Texan Julián Castro, have chided Bloomberg for using his financial force to attempt to sway the Democratic presidential primary.
“Ten months in Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is jumping in the race to use his personal fortune to try and buy the nomination,” Castro wrote in a fundraising plea to supporters. “We don’t need another ego-driven billionaire flooding the airwaves. We know your support isn’t for sale.”
But there’s no telling if Bloomberg’s strategy is a winning one.
“There’s many, many examples of candidates who have tried to spend their own money as a way to win elections, and it typically does not work,” said Stephanie Martin, an assistant professor of political communications at Southern Methodist University.
His aides told the Associated Press this weekend Bloomberg would not accept donations, essentially precluding him for hitting the donor threshold required to make the December debate stage.
This isn’t the first time Bloomberg has given Texas early attention. Last week, before his White House bid became official, he announced a plan to spend an estimated $15 million to $20 million on a voter registration drive, targeting five states including Texas. And on Wednesday, Bloomberg filed for the Democratic presidential primary in Texas — weeks before the Dec. 9 deadline and before officially announcing his White House bid.
But waiting to compete until the March Super Tuesday elections is risky; in most election cycles, nominating contests were all but decided after the first four early states. And Bloomberg has not registered as a serious contender in any Democratic primary poll.
“He’s engaged in a high-risk, high-reward strategy because he’s depending on primary voters in second-tier states to hold off and not fall into line with the candidates who entered early,” Martin said.
Bloomberg wasn’t mentioned in the most recent University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll in early November. Joe Biden led the state in that poll, with 23% of voters expressing support for the former vice president. He was followed by Elizabeth Warren at 18% and Texan Beto O’Rourke, who has since dropped out of the race, at 14%. Just 5% of Texas voters said they didn’t know whom they would support.

Texto completo: In May, the Chronicle published a dyspeptic report by Andrew Kay, a Wisconsin writer, on this year's meeting of the Modern Language Association, whose members teach literature to a declining number of interested students: Kay says the number of English positions on the MLA job list has shrunk 55% since 2008, the number of University of Michigan English majors declined from 1,000 to 200 in eight years, and adjunct instructors now are a majority of college teachers.
Kay's villains are "the avarice of universities" and "politicians and pundits" who despise "humanistic thinking, which plainly threatens them." His disparagements implicitly enlarge and celebrate him as a threat to the villains.
He is nostalgic for the 1960s and 1970s, which "brought literary-critical methods to bear on every aspect of culture, from sexuality to disability." He is impervious to the possibility that his mentality, stocked with stereotypes and luxuriating in victimhood, might be a symptom of what repels students who care about actual literature more than "literary-critical" approaches to this and that.
Also in the Chronicle in May, Daniel Bessner of the University of Washington and Michael Brenes of Yale deplore without defining "the neoliberalization of the university system." The definition presumably is obvious to all inhabitants of the academic bubble, where "neoliberals" are disdained as respecters of market forces.
Citing a 1972 New York Times report on "an oversupply of trained historians," they say "for nearly a half-century, historians have failed to organize to halt the disappearance of positions," which they blame on "unnecessary neoliberal austerity, corporatization, and adjunctification" and "boot-strappism and market-Darwinism."
Their jumble of jargon means: The fact that the supply of historians has outpaced the demand for history instruction is the fault of many things, but not of academic historians, who need to show "solidarity" to "overturn a patently unjust system" that offers "crummy and exploitative" jobs. Their message is clear: History doctorates are entitled to good academic positions regardless of the absence of a demand for their services.
So perhaps the American Historical Association (and the MLA, the American Political Science Association, etc.) should wield its "labor power" by threatening to strike. It is a plan only academics could concoct: Because there is weak and declining demand for our labor, we should coerce our adversaries (neoliberals, market-Darwinism, the law of supply and demand) by threatening to withdraw our labor.
In the Chronicle in March, the University of Washington's Bessner said we are in a "crisis of capitalism," by which he seemed to mean a shortage of jobs for people like him: left-wing academics. "Given that there are almost no tenure-track jobs, the majority of the next generation of intellectuals - like my own generation - will probably have to look outside the university for employment." To him, "intellectuals" denotes left-wing aspiring academics. Again, note the absence of self-examination, and the disregard of the possibility that there are fewer teaching jobs because fewer students are drawn to the study of literature, history and the rest of the humanities because of the way these subjects are taught.
This is a trans-Atlantic problem. The author of the Economist's Bagehot column notes that although the study of history "used to hold a central position in [Britain's] national life," the number of history students has declined 10% in a decade.
Perhaps because "the historical profession has turned in on itself," with practitioners turning away from "great matters of state" and concentrating on "the marginal rather than the powerful, the poor rather than the rich, everyday life rather than Parliament." They "almost seem to be engaged in a race to discover the most marginalized subject imaginable." This reduces history's helpfulness as "a safeguard against myopia. Modernity shrinks time as well as space; people live in an eternal present of short-term stimuli and instant gratification."
Americans have a voracious appetite for serious historical writing - note the robust demand for narratives and biographies by David McCullough, Ron Chernow and many others who are not academics, who do not write about marginal subjects, and who do not tell the nation's story as a tale of embarrassments.

Casting call for Iao Theater’s ‘Matilda’ draws girls far and wide

Texto completo: In show business, as in the parable of the wedding feast, few are chosen.
“How many Matildas are there in a show?” The question boomed through the Historic Iao Theater, Wailuku, in a voice of fire and brimstone.
A little-and-not-so-little-girls chorus piped up in unison. “One!”
“One,” the booming voice confirmed.
One Sunday in mid-September, an intense afternoon of callbacks for “Roald Dahl’s Matilda, the Musical” was drawing to a close. For the last half-hour, the musical director, Robert E. Wills, had been riding herd on all the girls under consideration for the title role to let loose in the taxing solo called “Quiet.”
“In the theater we’re all boys and girls,” Wills had earlier decreed, “no matter how old we are.”
Like Tim Minchin’s entire score for the show, “Quiet” layers intricate vocal writing on top of tongue-twisting lyrics and plenty of them. Now Wills was steeling the young hopefuls and very possibly also himself for the coming crunch.
“You never know why a person gets chosen,” Wills continued, giving it to them straight. “Maybe they wanted someone with red hair. Maybe they wanted someone with blond hair. Or they were looking for someone taller or shorter or older or younger. If you didn’t get the part, you’re still very good! What you’ve been doing here, sight-reading this difficult music — that was hard.”
You remember Matilda, the elfin 5-1/2-year-old who gets back at her cartoonishly hateful parents with seriously wicked pranks? Who to the amazement of her teacher Miss Honey can rattle off the answer to 14 times 19 on her first day of school and has already taught herself to read Dickens and Hemingway and “The Sound and the Fury.” Matilda, who when push comes to shove bests the hammer-throwing, tyrannical headmistress Miss Trunchbull with strategic deployments of mind over matter.
“People say it’s about girl power,” says Jennifer Rose, the director of the show, who observed most of the auditions in silence, from the shadows. “I say it’s also just about personal power, about taking action, right action. I love it that Matilda’s such a good student but appropriately just a little bit naughty. That’s a positive message for kids and grown-ups. Really, Matilda’s story is all of our story. We’re the only ones who are going to make a change in our own story. We can’t wait around.”
The stage, it often seems, is like an air terminal, where passengers’ trajectories converge for a spell before dispersing again to who knows what future destinations. The audition process in Wailuku had turned up a bumper crop of potential Matildas.
Angular Matildas and willowy Matildas. Petite Matildas and long-stemmed Matildas.
A sassy, round-faced big sister (at a guess) who loves to toss her lion’s mane.
A pre-Raphaelite imp with tumbling curls of flame who keeps her chin down and peers out from under shy, mischievous eyebrows, missing nothing. To her left, a serious, dark-eyed dreamer, poised as a ballerina.
A pale Renaissance Madonna minus only the halo. A square-shouldered, easygoing rodeo rat (another guess) aglow with a touch of late-summer sun.
Tackling Tim Minchin was not the only curve thrown the girls’ way that afternoon. For starters, Camille Romero, the choreographer, had been putting them through their paces in a spiffy movement combination, not only to test their speed and quickness with the steps, but also on the lookout for those all-important sparks of personality.
Dancing along with the Matildas at that point were 14 other players who had survived the first cut, including four boys, ages 11 to 17, offering another study in contrasts: the loose-limbed surfer dude, the junior fashion plate a season or two away from his first print campaign for Armani, a crown prince straight out of “The King and I,” a best friend who goes first only if the teacher makes him. Tryouts, especially with the youngest actors, make a casting director of anyone.
Visitors from capitals like London and New York, where theater is king, think of Maui, if they think of Maui, for the ocean, the beaches and maybe the sunrise over Haleakala. Yet if you’re local and the stage is a thing you live for, the playhouses on island can keep you crazy busy.
Just ask Marsi Smith, who says she likes nothing better than to go straight from show to show. And sure enough, she opened at the Iao Theater in the speaking role of the cougar Mrs. Robinson in “The Graduate,” adapted from the Mike Nichols movie, two weeks to the day since she raised her hand for her next assignment.
It happened to be midafternoon on Friday the 13th when she bounced with the announcement, “I’m here for Matilda!” Then she lit into “Always True to You (In My Fashion),” the bouncy material-girl confession from the Cole Porter classic “Kiss Me, Kate,” and just crushed it.
“I stand 4 foot 10 without my heels, which I’m never without,” Smith said later, “so people tease me, not all in jest, about playing children’s parts. This time I thought I’d tease them first. Hey, you never know!”
No, you never do. “Say,” said Wills, after Smith aced it and vanished, “suppose we cast this thing age-reversed. Kids in the grown-up parts, grown-ups as kids?”
“That would be interesting,” Rose drawled. “Let’s not do that.”
Rather than Matilda, Smith landed Matilda’s mother, Mrs. Wormwood, a gargoyle who teases her hair out to there, sings like an air-raid siren and barrels through her competition rumba like a runaway locomotive. Her big number (“Loud”) is a cruel catalog of zingers fired at the mousy but caring Miss Honey, played by Sara Jelley, a Maui favorite since her breakthrough in the title role of “Mary Poppins.”
Dale Bottom, a local fixture, went up for the drag part of the sadistic Miss Trunchbull and got it, which cannot have surprised him; Francis Tuau, another familiar face, returns as Matilda’s father, Mr. Wormwood, the flashiest used-car salesman in the U.K.’s 48 counties and the crookedest.
If such choices for the grown-up leads almost made themselves, casting the kids has to have been agony. “This isn’t really a big kid show,” Rose explains. “There aren’t a ton of kids in it, just 16. We cast maybe a third of the people who auditioned. We didn’t have roles for everyone.”
And what about Matilda? With seven to choose from, how could Rose and Wills and Romeo settle on just one?
“As a matter of fact, in this case,” Rose replies, “two Matildas are gonna swing. Partly because it’s kids and so many were so capable, and partly because on two Saturdays in December, we’ve got two shows. That’s a lot.”
Depending on the date, you’ll be watching Calilynn Salzer, the pre-Raphaelite imp, or Shayla Sanchez, with the poise of a ballerina. How to choose? It won’t be easy.

How perfectionism can be a trap in creative endeavors

Texto completo: If we try to tackle a new project of any size or complexity, perfectionism can be a deadly trap. With so much pressure to deliver a flawless performance, we end up either diluting our creativity by playing it too safe or self-sabotaging the work altogether.
We imagine a brilliant artist approaching her work with the masterpiece perfectly etched in her mind before a single brush stroke graces the canvas. Or a prolific musician with an idyllic melody already seared into his mind before playing a single note. Then, when we approach our own creative efforts, we often freeze up before leaping in, lacking the creative confidence to continue.
The truth is, artists rarely have perfectly formed ideas before beginning. Nor do they believe their work will effortlessly flow from the start. Their confidence, instead, is not in expecting perfection but rather in their ability to overcome the inevitable setbacks that occur during any creative effort.
I've been studying and performing jazz music for over 40 years and can tell you that the art form is messy. Mistakes are expected, which in turn become the portals of discovery.
After decades of practice, I now bring a reservoir of confidence to every performance, but that confidence isn't what you think. It isn't that I'll play perfectly, or even well for that matter. Instead, it is knowing with certainty that I'll screw something up, make a blunder, or trip on my ideas. In my case, and the case of most artists, the confidence lies in the ability to recover.
If we try to tackle a new project of any size or complexity, perfectionism can be a deadly trap. With so much pressure to deliver a flawless performance, we end up either diluting our creativity by playing it too safe or self-sabotaging the work altogether. Instead, try the jazz musician approach of knowing that slip-ups will predictably occur and focusing more on your ability to recover than avoiding the potholes completely.
In jazz, if we play a terrible clunker by mistake or land on a really bad note, we play it twice more and call it art (kidding, but not kidding). Consider that your most imaginative ideas may emerge from your struggles rather than your achievements.
The mistakes of today may just be the breakthroughs of tomorrow.
So the next time you're approaching your work with creativity (which I hope is daily), realize that confidence is built not by avoiding messy mistakes but through embracing, overcoming, and learning from them. Creative confidence is your ability to bounce back, to course-correct when the inevitable stumble happens, and to continue without trepidation.
In this sense, fear is eradicated because only one of two things can happen when you inject inventive thinking: Either you'll nail it and enjoy the big win or you'll stumble and grow as a result. Both options are truly a win, whereas the only real loss is never trying in the first place.
So take some creative risks, knowing that a few crash-landings are far more likely that instant perfection. But instead of forging ahead in fear, take solace in your ability to recover and learn from the setbacks. That's how artists of all types bring their best work to life, and how you can inject artistry into your own work as well.
Ready, set, stumble ... soar.

Whitaker has been loyal to Trump, not vice versa

Texto completo: Seven months after Matt Whitaker's brief tenure as acting U.S. attorney general ended with William Barr's confirmation to the post, Iowa's native son returned to speak to the A.M. Des Moines Rotary. It was a club where he had belonged, where he said loyalty actually mattered.
In Washington, Whitaker quipped, "everyone is looking through the lens of 'Can this person help me?'"
He has more friends in that Wakonda clubroom, he declared, than in Washington.
Whitaker, 50, said he was treated poorly by staffers because "I was not part of the elite. Like 'you unqualified moron.'"
He said members of Congress had a stunning "inability to coherently put together a line of questioning."
And calling out a "culture of personal destruction," where disparaging leaks about one's past instantly make it onto twitter and Wikipedia, Whitaker said, "It's no fun when you're in the middle of it."
I don't doubt that. In fact, as he noted dryly in his opening remarks, I'd contributed to his angst. A critical column I'd written years ago about his investigation of a gay, Democratic Iowa lawmaker — republished last Nov. 7 after his appointment — gave the Washington press corps more fodder. "Glad to have that brought back up," he said, noting he thought that was behind him.
I'll give Whitaker this: He's artful at poking fun at himself. It's true that he was controversial from the moment he was named to the post, but seems a bit naive as to why that would be. I'd argue much was of his own doing.
He was immediately suspect for stepping into the job after the man he'd worked for, Jeff Sessions ("one of the most decent men I've ever met"), had put ethics before his own career. Sessions had recused himself from overseeing the Russia probe because he had worked for Trump's election. That angered the president, who demanded Sessions' resignation the day after the midterm elections swept Democrats into the House majority.
Enter Whitaker, who would hold the job from Nov. 7 to Feb. 14, unconcerned with his own conflicts of interest. As a CNN commentator, Whitaker had imagined "a scenario where Sessions was replaced with a recess appointment" who would cut special counsel Robert Mueller's budget so low "that his investigation grinds almost to a halt."
He'd also written an op-ed calling on Rod Rosenstein, who had appointed Mueller and was overseeing the investigation in lieu of Sessions, to limit its scope. Otherwise, Whitaker warned, it would look like a political fishing expedition that could hurt Mueller, Trump, Trump's family and the whole country.
Then again, so would a U.S. alliance with a foreign government intended to influence a U.S. election.
Democrats and 18 state attorneys general blasted Trump's appointment of Whitaker, which, for whatever reason, didn't translate into a permanent appointment. Whitaker, a former Hawkeye football player, attorney and businessman, said he was amply qualified to replace Sessions, after serving as a former U.S. attorney in Iowa and Sessions' chief of staff.
"I felt the entire ground shift," he said of the December day he was blindsided when Barr was named attorney general. And one can feel some empathy for that, especially considering he and Barr seem to have shared an antipathy for the investigation.
But Whitaker won't speak ill of Trump, calling himself "one of the few people that left on good terms with him" (which makes you wonder where Whitaker's loyalty to Sessions was). It's the other side, he said, that sees the president as an "unhinged whirling dervish spinning out of control."
Whatever their respective politics, the Rotarians treated Whitaker respectfully. A former club president sang him a riff on Don McLean's "American Pie," substituting the lyrics, "So bye-bye this Matt Whitaker guy. 'Your five minutes is up,' was a hell of a line." Photos on a screen behind him showed Whitaker and House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler at a hearing involving the Mueller investigation. That was the one where Whitaker famously retorted to Nadler's question: "Mr. Chairman, I see that your five minutes is up."
The New York Times characterized that as "a remarkable breach of decorum between two branches of government," observing, "It is highly unusual for a witness, much less an official serving in an acting capacity, to challenge the chairman of a congressional committee that oversees his department."
Whitaker, however, criticized Nadler for calling him in to testify, and then "drilling me" about attempts to interfere with the Mueller investigation, "which I didn't at all." He said he'd also been "dressed down by staff," who told him he was too hot, looked like a fool and needed to calm down. Though Whitaker didn't specify which staff, a story in The Daily Beast reported staff in the Department of Justice had seen him as a rogue and under-qualified new leader who, in the words of one, had long tried to "suck up to the president."
Asked how he felt about losing the spotlight, Whitaker scoffed, "Trust me. I've had it enough." But he also stressed he wasn't looking for pity, noting he'd made "every one of these decisions."
As one who has criticized Whitaker's stances and actions, I found him surprisingly witty, self-deprecating and even naive. I'm sure D.C. partisanship can be savage. But while he aimed his barbs at Democrats, it was the one he won't criticize, the head of his own party, who let him down.
Whitaker's rise to acting AG came because his former boss who held that position was punished by Trump for showing honesty and integrity about his conflict of interests.
Then Whitaker was passed over by the same president for another Republican. I'd say that his real issue is with Trump.

Texto completo: NEW HAVEN, CONN. — Demonstrators stormed the field during halftime at the Harvard-Yale football game Saturday, delaying the game for about an hour to demand that both universities divest their investments in fossil fuels and to call attention to the issue of climate change.
The protest, which began with a few dozen protesters staging a sit-in midfield as the Yale band finished its halftime routine, swelled to about 500 people at one point as others in the stands joined the demonstration, The New York Times reported.
Some held banners urging the schools' presidents to divest from the fossil fuel industry and others spoke out against Puerto Rican debt and the treatment of Uighurs in China.
“Students are tired of Harvard and Yale profiting off of climate destruction and neocolonial investments in Puerto Rico's debt," protesters said in a statement to news organizations Saturday. “It's time for more than lip service and greenwashing from academic leaders. Harvard and Yale must address the climate emergency at the scale and with the urgency it demands. This action is only the beginning."
ESPNU replaced the live broadcast with another game.
During the midfield protest, the protesters chanted: “Hey hey! Ho ho! Fossil fuels have got to go!" One banner read, “This is an emergency."
Some of those involved with the game, such as Yale captain J.P. Shohfi, took the disruption in stride.
“If we can't control it, we can't worry about it. In the locker room we were just ­re-focusing on our game plan, trying to stay loose," Shohfi said.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy said you just deal with the circumstances that you have.
“You don't make a big issue out of it with your team," he said. “It is what it is."
Demonstrators were surrounded by police and security and the public address system asked them to clear the field “as a courtesy to players."
Finally, police formed a line and moved from the Yale sideline to the Harvard sideline. Protesters began leaving the field.
Up to about two dozen protesters remained on the field, and Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins warned them they would face arrest, according to the AP.
Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman, said the university would not comment on the student protest or police response. A New Haven police spokeswoman directed comment to Yale University.
In a statement on Harvard's climate actions, the university said that Harvard Management Company, which manages the University's endowment, “engages directly with companies to address issues related to climate change through its work with the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment and the Climate Action 100+."
The university statement said commitments in its Climate Action Plan “explicitly recognize" that the world must move quickly to end its use of fossil fuels.
“While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it," the statement said.
“Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions."
In a statement posted to Twitter Saturday afternoon, the Ivy League conference said it supports the right to freedom of speech and demonstration.
“It is regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow ­students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual ­tradition when thousands gather from around the world to ­enjoy and celebrate the ­storied traditions of both football ­programs and universities," the conference statement said.
Karen Peart, a Yale spokeswoman, said in a statement that the university “stands firmly" for the right to free expression, and also stands with the statement issued by the Ivy League.
“We are grateful to the staff members and police officers who ensured the peaceful departure of students from the field," Peart said in the statement.
“The exercise of free expression on campus is subject to general conditions, and we do not allow disruption of university events."

Social Media and the Populist Moment

Texto completo: Sacha Baron Cohen is the latest champion of a theory with limited empirical support.
Social media is bad for everything and everybody, for human beings and journalists and other living things. But at least it reliably generates interesting juxtapositions from which op-ed columns can be made -- including columns about how a fixation on, well, social media, is damaging liberalism's understanding of the world.
The relevant juxtaposition comes from my Twitter feed, which on Friday featured -- to great acclaim and many retweets -- a speech by Sacha Baron Cohen, the erstwhile fake newsman Borat, condemning "a handful of internet companies" for building the "greatest propaganda machine in history" and driving the rise of authoritarianism, demagoguery and bigotry.
At the same time, Twitter also surfaced a recent study from academics in France, Canada and the United States, which examined the relationship between social-media echo chambers and support for populism in France, Britain and the United States. The authors found that there was either no relationship or a negative one: Populist voters were somewhat more likely to hang out with people of a similar ethnicity or social class offline, but on the internet they were no more likely than other voters to inhabit an echo chamber. And social media use was a strong predictor of opposition to the campaign of Donald Trump.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
This is not the first study to question social media's supposedly central role in the drama of right-wing populism. Shortly after Trump's election, economists at Brown and Stanford found that he performed more poorly than Mitt Romney and John McCain among Americans who get their news online, while the voters he converted were often the very offline.
This kind of evidence doesn't mean that online conspiracy mongering has no influence on populism. People who rarely use the internet might be more easily deceived by fake headlines when they do wander online. Normal partisans may get kookier under the sustained influence of the memeplex. And Cohen is right that small communities of depraved people, from pedophiles to anti-Semites, use online platforms in vicious ways -- and internet giants invoke free expression while shirking their responsibility to deny such viciousness a refuge.
But we should be more doubtful of Cohen's larger narrative, which is commonplace among progressives -- a narrative that invokes the "sewer" of social media to explain everything from climate-change skepticism to anti-immigration sentiment, portrays Russian trolls and YouTube stars as the crucial actors of the populist era, and proposes the regulation of online speech as the main restorative that the liberal order needs.
Instead, the evidence in the papers cited above hints at a different scenario -- in which because educated liberalism is increasingly so very online itself, ensconced in its own self-reinforcing information bubble, liberals end up analyzing populism exclusively through their digital experience even when that analysis is obviously insufficient.
In a recent Boston Review essay, Tufts political scientist Eitan Hersh notes that many American liberals participate in politics through a kind of uber-online "political hobbyism," in which real-world organizing recedes in favor of constant engagement "from behind screens or with earphones on."
Inside this hobbyist's world the centrality of those screens becomes a given. Spend all your time on Twitter and Facebook and it seems that Twitter and Facebook must be essential to the far right's appeal, and that a better social media ecosystem would suffice to deal with Trump or suppress Marine Le Pen or sideline Nigel Farage.
But if the other side is actually less online than you are, this assumption leads to two mistakes. First, you end up downgrading the obvious real-world forces driving populism's appeal, persuading yourself that an algorithmic tweak or better fact-checking will deal with deep trends -- economic stagnation, social crisis -- that would exist with or without fake news.
Second, you lose sight of the ways in which your own information bubble is a potential radicalizing force -- including for people observing it from outside, for whom it makes political liberalism seem like an airless world filled with hyper-educated ideologues. Indeed, on the evidence of a Democratic primary that seems made for the social-media bubble, it's liberalism that's being warped by online feedback loops and radicalization cascades.
Which is not to say that conservatism isn't pretty warped at the moment, or that social media has been good for right-wing decency and common sense. (Remember where I began: It's bad for everything.) But what's wrong with conservatism has as much to do with old-media forces like talk radio and cable news, plus real-world isolation and disconnection, as it does with QAnon. Donald Trump owes his (relative) resilience to the inertia of medium-information voters enjoying a decent economy, not to YouTube radicalism.
And if those voters are the battlefield, than any Democratic strategy will be insufficient unless liberalism realizes that before it regulates social media for other people, it should learn how to resist the internet itself.

A Planning Guide For Your First Safari

Texto completo: To get the food, shelter and safari experience you want, you need to research your trip. Here's a thorough list of the details you should consider.
A safari vacation in Africa is probably the most organized vacation you'll ever take. While it is possible to simply fly to a few places -- Arusha, Tanzania, or Maun, Botswana -- and rent a car to take off into the countryside, few people want to risk being alone on unmarked dirt roads patrolled by hyenas, cheetahs and lions.
No, you use professionals to help you choose an itinerary and arrange transportation. Your travel company will have a driver waiting for you, and from the time you land, you're in the hands of people who will feed and shelter you and take you amazingly close to fearsome beasts. To get the food, shelter and safari experience you want, you need to research your trip.
Time
Plan on at least two weeks. That should allow for at least three different camps in different areas, for three nights each. Generally, you get an early morning game drive and a late afternoon game drive each day, so two full days in each camp almost guarantees that you'll see a lot. My wife, Jane, and I went on safaris in January and February in Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. It was the wet season in some places, but it wasn't particularly rainy. Although the vegetation was lush, we saw elephants, hippos, giraffes and baboons beyond counting. In the drier Serengeti, Kalahari and Sabi Sands, we saw a lifetime's worth of cheetahs, leopards and lions. We also got to see the Serengeti's great migration of wildebeests and zebras.
Cost
A doctor friend who lived and worked in Malawi until recently says that the best thing you can have on a safari is a generous parent to pay for it. Daily costs per person range from $ 200 to well over $ 1,000, and typically include travel, including airplanes, between different camps. It would not include airfare from the United States. Tips are suggested and expected at each camp. A couple should figure on up to $ 50 per day total for guides, drivers and food service. Tips should be in the local currency and are given upon departure.
The Travel Company
My wife and I used African Portfolio, a Connecticut-based company, when we spent six weeks in Africa in 2016. We started planning our trip with a different company, but it ignored our budget concerns and other requests by giving us an itinerary of super-deluxe camps. You also could simply deal directly with a company that operates multiple camps, such as Asilia Africa or Wilderness Safaris. Cultural and educational organizations offer safari packages. African Portfolio got us to the Asilia and Wilderness camps that really intrigued us, as well as to camps operated by other companies. Whoever helps plan your trip will take care of getting you from one remote camp to another, often in small airplanes.
The Animals
The Big Five -- lions, elephants, leopards, rhinos and Cape buffalo -- were the most challenging game animals for hunters on foot in another era. They're still worthy targets for your camera, but so are zebras, giraffes, exotic antelopes and almost countless kinds of birds. All of these are in Kenya, Tanzania and Botswana. Gorillas are in Rwanda and Uganda.
Accommodations
Lodges, from hostels to luxury hotels, are found near some game-rich areas like the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania and Kruger National Park and the Sabi Sands Game Reserve in South Africa. In the Kalahari Desert and the Serengeti you'll find tented camps, which are clusters of individual cabinlike tents and one or two large tents for the dining room and staff operations. The individual tents usually have real beds and attached private bathrooms with heated showers and flush toilets. There are also mobile camps, which move to follow game, especially the migration in the Serengeti. All your meals will be at the camp. Most camps supply the usual toiletries as well as sunscreen and insect repellent.
Guides
Some safari agencies will hook you up with a guide who will go with you from camp to camp. We had the same guide for two camps and he relied on radio contact with other guides to find game. Elsewhere we had guides supplied by the camps. All knew their areas and the wildlife. With camp guides, you can pay extra to have your own vehicle, or you can share a vehicle with other guests. Do the latter. Your fellow riders are likely to enrich the experience with their knowledge and camaraderie. And listen when the guide in your open-air vehicle tells you not to stand or move. There's nothing but air between you and that hyena.
Clothing
You will need fast-drying nylon clothes. Your luggage may be limited to a small duffel bag. Camps generally provide laundry service, usually washed by hand and dried in the sun. Guests may be expected to wash their own underwear. You don't need an all-beige wardrobe. Most of the animals can hardly distinguish colors, but you should avoid white because it attracts attention. Black and other dark colors attract tsetse flies. Popular safari areas can be chilly mornings and late afternoons and very hot at midday, so dress in layers (and wear a hat).

Texto completo: When did The Washington Post change its style for referring to married women from 'Mrs. [husband's full name]' to the woman's actual name, such as 'Aurora Poston' instead of 'Mrs. Philander Poston'? (This is a real example from the 1920s.)
" Robert Oshel, Silver Spring
Most large organizations employing copious amounts of words have rules governing precisely how to use those words. These are called stylebooks and they evolve along with customs and language. (A recent change at The Washington Post: The capital of Ukraine is now 'Kyiv,' not 'Kiev.')
Thanks to the late Bill Walsh , an acclaimed Post copy editor who wrote about usage and grammar and collected books about language, our newsroom has copies of Post stylebooks dating to 1963.
The 1963 stylebook decrees: '-'Mrs.' is never used with the Christian name of a woman. It is Mrs. Walter C. Louchheim ; Mrs. Louchheim; Katie Louchheim " NOT Mrs. Katie Louchheim.''
Things had improved a bit by 1969. The Post stylebook from that year stipulates: 'In first reference to women, 'Miss' or 'Mrs.' is omitted as a prefix to a given name: ' Muriel Humphrey .' But use 'Mrs.' when her name is used in conjunction with her husband's name: 'Mrs. Hubert H. Humphrey.'-'
The 1969 stylebook continues: 'Except on the editorial page, omit 'Mr.' in reference to men except in the construction 'Mr. and Mrs. James Smith,' which may be used instead of 'James Smith and his wife.'-'
Answer Man takes that to mean that in 1969 women were starting to be viewed as their own people " they get to use their first name on occasion " but that the husband's name still takes precedence.
Answer Man found plenty of examples in The Post in the early 1970s of married women who seemed not to have first names. This was especially common with the wives of well-known men. It took a while for 'Mrs. Martin Luther King Jr.' to become ' Coretta Scott King .'
The most egregious recommendation, at least in hindsight, found by Answer Man was in the 1971 edition 'The Art of Editing' by Floyd K. Baskette and Jack Z. Sissors . The textbook decreed: 'A married woman or a widow, if addressed as 'Mrs.,' is referred to by her husband's Christian name, not by hers. It is 'Mrs. John Smith.' If he dies, it is still 'Mrs. John Smith.' If they are divorced, it is 'Mrs. Helen Smith.'-'
Only divorce, it seemed, could free a woman from the tyranny of her husband's first name.
Things had advanced by the time the 1989 Post stylebook was published. Married women were to be referred to by their first names and surnames without 'Mrs.' It included as an example: 'Helen Black,' not 'Mrs. John Black.'
But there was a caveat: If only the husband's first name was known, it was acceptable to revert to the old style, thusly: ' 'Police identified the victims as Mr. and Mrs. John Black. They said Mrs. Black was not wearing a seat belt.''
What Answer takes from this " besides that one should always wear a seat belt " is that no one thought to just ask what the wife's name was.
Some of the push to lose 'Mrs.' was led by members of the Washington Press Club, formed in 1919 by women when the National Press Club did not allow female members.
In her 1988 book, 'A Place in the News: From the Women's Pages to the Front Page,' author Kay Mills wrote that eliminating courtesy titles was one of the female press club's goals.
Although the National Press Club began admitting women in 1971, the Washington Press Club continued until 1985. In 1984, its members pointed out that it didn't make sense to refer on second reference to vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro as either 'Miss Ferraro' or 'Mrs. Zaccaro,' her husband's name. (Thank you to veteran journalist Richard Prince for directing Answer Man to this reference.)
Today, The Post doesn't use honorifics, except in its obituaries. The New York Times continues to use them: calling someone 'Ms. Jones' on second reference when The Post would just write 'Jones.'
The Times held on to 'Mrs. [husband's first and last name]' longer than most papers, if only in a unique situation, spelled out in its 1999 style manual: 'In an exceptional case, typically on the society pages, a woman may wish to be known by her husband's name: 'Mrs. Morgan Berenich,' and then 'Mrs. Berenich.''
The collision between style and preference is most obvious in a 1932 letter that hangs in a hallway at the Times. It is from aviator Amelia Earhart and expresses her irritation at being referred to in news columns as 'Mrs. Putnam' after her marriage to George P. Putnam .
Wrote Earhart: 'I admit I have no principle to uphold in asking that I be called by my professional name in print. However, it is for many reasons more convenient . . . to be simply 'Amelia Earhart.'-'
In an email to Answer Man, Merrill Perlman , former director of the Times copy desks, wrote: 'The letter got it changed " for her.'
It would be decades before the style applied to more earthbound women in U.S. newspapers.

'I'm convinced': Biden gets boost from Obama world with Vilsack endorsement

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa — Tom Vilsack endorsed Joe Biden for president Saturday morning before introducing the former vice president at a campaign rally in Des Moines.
"Joe Biden has offered a progressive and a realistic vision of how to move our country forward. This — combined with the experience and the relationships that he has, that he’s developed over time — have enabled him to implement that vision," said the former two-term Democratic Iowa governor and secretary of agriculture under President Barack Obama. "Just take the [Affordable Care Act] for example, as vice president, he watched the impact of that law on 20 million Americans expanding access for healthcare."
Tom Vilsack was joined on stage by his wife, Christie Vilsack, who served as senior adviser for international education at the U.S. Agency for International Development under Obama. She was also a failed candidate for Congress in 2012.
During his speech to a crowd of roughly 200, Tom Vilsack took veiled swiped at the former vice president's rivals by noting their lack of experience and dismissing their proposals as impossible to pass through Congress.
"[Biden] has offered a realistic and progressive vision for a new American economy and what I really like about what he’s put forward," he said. "We’ve tried a rookie in this position for the last three years, and I’d simply ask, 'How’s it going?' We need someone who understands the complexity of the world and has the relationship with world leaders.
"I’m convinced that Joe Biden has the capacity and the experience and the knowledge to restore America’s credibility in these key areas," he added.

He also noted a number of polls showing Biden handily defeating Trump in a number of swing states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan.

"You can’t govern until you win. Who today has the best opportunity? Joe. And that's the one thing and maybe the only thing I agree with President Trump about," Tom Vilsack said. "He obviously thinks Joe is the hardest person to beat."
The endorsements from both Vilsacks not only aids Biden in avoiding an embarrassing finish in the state during the caucuses next year, but also provides evidence that former members of Obama's White House still think he is a strong enough candidate to secure the Democratic nomination.
Biden is ramping up his campaign efforts in Iowa, with a trip this weekend, as well as an eight-day bus tour at the end of the month through the first week of December. The planned events come as he has seen his position drop precipitously in the state, according to the latest polls.
An Iowa State University survey this month found Biden's support at just 12% in the state, placing him in fourth place. A Siena College/New York Times poll released Nov. 1 found his Iowa support at 17%, found him in last among the group of four front runners that includes South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Texto completo: Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer denied reports he threatened to resign over President Donald Trump's intervention in the Navy's disciplinary proceedings against Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who had been demoted over a war crimes charge.
"Contrary to popular belief, I'm still here. I did not threaten to resign," he said at a defense conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Saturday. "But let us just say we're here to talk about external threats, and Eddie Gallagher is not one of them. "
Reports in the New York Times and NBC News said the secretary had threatened to resign if Trump went forward with his plans to stop the Navy from demoting Gallagher.
"The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin," Trump tweeted on Thursday, referring to the symbol of SEAL membership. "This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!"
Trump's intervention: Donald Trump says he will block military from removing Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher
Last week, Trump restored Gallagher's rank and pay. Gallagher had been accused of using a knife to kill an Islamic State prisoner and of killing civilians, but in July, he was found not guilty of the most serious charges.
Gallagher was found guilty of posing for a photo with a human casualty.
Despite Trump's restoration of his rank and pay, the Navy said it would review his status, a process that could have resulted in his expulsion from the SEALs.

Texto completo: A look at the scene from inside the room.
The past two weeks of public impeachment testimony before the House Intelligence Committee produced indelible scenes of drama and confrontation. The photographs here are images that will fill American textbooks for generations, whatever the outcome of the proceedings. Unseen but vividly present was the most important character of all, the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, only the fourth president to face possible impeachment.
Americans were witness to images of career public servants testifying against the wishes of their superiors, including the unforgettable Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, whose family came to the United States from Ukraine when he was 3, in Army dress uniform. A daughter of refugees from the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, a model of dignity and composure, faced hostile questioning from committee Republicans. A major Trump political contributor, Gordon Sondland, named ambassador to the European Union, provided a few moments of color and comic relief. The Democratic chairman, Adam Schiff of California, tried to maintain decorum befitting such a solemn undertaking. For the most part, he succeeded.

Texto completo: One of America’s strangest intellectual intersections comes at the nexus of radical feminism and religious conservatism. Both forces combined to oppose commercial surrogacy, and now they can celebrate a new win: the Victoria’s Secret fashion show is canceled.
The yearly celebration of skinny, mostly white, barely clothed bodies has officially been scrapped this year after much talk over the company’s attempts to rebrand its image. Public opinion has recently turned against the company's narrow beauty standards, and its own executives haven't done the lingerie brand any favors.
Former chief marketing officer Ed Razek enraged liberals last year when he said Victoria's Secret wouldn’t employ transgender models on the runway “because the show is a fantasy.”
Critics have long accused Victoria’s Secret models of representing only one type of beauty: white, possibly anorexic, and with enough plastic surgery to bear the generically beautiful visage of an Instagram model — lip injections and Botox are a must.
“Victoria’s Secret’s angels are so stunning,” Nikki Leigh McKean, a photographer who has modeled for the more inclusive intimates brand Knix, told the New York Times. “But they are not real. I mean they are real people, but they are not a reflection of how we should look at our bodies and at women.”
Victoria’s Secret was founded in 1977 as a place for men to buy lingerie for women. From the beginning, women’s interests were a corporate afterthought. While the company has tried to brand itself as helping women feel good about themselves, its advertising has always been about fulfilling male fantasies.
It's not good for customers, and Victoria's Secret doesn't have such a great reputation with its employees, either. This summer, more than 100 models signed a petition demanding that the company protect its models from sexual misconduct. Did you know Victoria's Secret was also closely associated with sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein?
Now, after last year’s fashion show had the lowest ratings ever, the sordid event appears to be gone for good. “Oh, Thank God,” ran a headline in New York magazine’s website for women, the Cut. “It’s Over Now.”
Whether concerns about the show center around “the male gaze” or the hypersexualization and commodification of women, both radical feminists and conservatives can agree on one thing: The Victoria’s Secret fashion show was no good for women, and we're better off without it. Good riddance.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Un exfuncionario de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA) que pudo haber devastado la recopilación de inteligencia de Estados Unidos en China al entregar a su red de informantes a Pekín fue sentenciado el viernes a 19 años de prisión.
Jerry Chun Shing Lee, un ciudadano estadounidense naturalizado que trabajó para la de 1994 a 2007, fue arrestado en enero de 2018 por poseer ilegalmente información clasificada de defensa estadounidense, que según los fiscales, entregó a los agentes de inteligencia chinos.
“Lee traicionó a su propio país por codicia y puso en riesgo a sus antiguos colegas”, dijo Timothy Slater, subdirector de la oficina de campo del FBI en Washington. “La seriedad de su traición y crimen se demuestra con la sentencia de hoy”, indicó.
La acusación asegura que Lee se mudó a Hong Kong en 2010 y comenzó a aceptar pagos de agentes chinos que le pidieron información confidencial sobre la CIA.
Pero en mayo pasado, Lee, de 55 años, se declaró culpable de un cargo de conspiración por entregar información de defensa nacional para ayudar a un gobierno extranjero, al tiempo que insistió en que el gobierno nunca probó que dio información a los chinos ni que haya aceptado $840,000 dólares de Pekín, como se alega.
El caso ha generado mucha especulación sobre lo que realmente hay debajo, porque le tomó al gobierno seis años desde la primera investigación de Lee hasta su arresto.
Informes de medios de prensa lo vincularon con la destrucción catastrófica de la red de informantes de la CIA en China entre 2010 y 2012.
El New York Times informó en 2017 que los chinos mataron a “al menos una docena” de fuentes que la CIA tenía dentro de China y encarcelaron al menos a otras seis.

Texto completo: ARLINGTON, Texas - Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred mostly confirmed Thursday that the leaked list of 42 minor-league teams that potentially could be de-affiliated was correct - including one member each of the Mets' and Yankees' farm systems - but further clarified that MLB still has not reached an agreement with Minor League Baseball on the matter.
In what is billed as a vast restructuring of the minor leagues, Manfred said they are proposing to de-affiliate dozens of teams in the lower levels, ranging from rookie ball to Double-A - a list that includes the Staten Island Yankees, the Yankees' short-season Class A team, and the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, the Mets' Double-A affiliate.
Manfred confirmed that MLB provided the list to MiLB president Pat O'Conner and said that O'Conner leaked the names of the affected teams, which was later printed in The New York Times.
"We provided to Pat O'Conner [the list] at his request - with an assurance that he would keep it confidential, which he subsequently broke - a list of facilities that we felt needed to be upgraded, and if they couldn't be upgraded, that we were not prepared to operate," Manfred said.
The New York Times' list had 42 teams; Manfred repeatedly said it is 40 teams. Either way, the teams in question run the risk of being de-affiliated and then either liquidating or becoming independent. Another 120 teams would remain at "status quo," he said.
Yankees president Randy Levine defended the Staten Island Yankees' facility in a statement and said negotiations still are very much underway. Levine was on hand for this year's owners' meetings, but Hal Steinbrenner did not attend them.
"There are negotiations currently taking place between Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball," the statement said. " We have been assured today that there have been no decisions made regarding the elimination of the Staten Island Yankees. We support the Staten Island Yankees and their facility, and people should give the negotiations a chance to conclude before speculating on any outcome."
Manfred said four major issues factored into the proposal:
 (1) A number of teams had inadequate facilities, "simply not appropriate for professional baseball players." This included small locker rooms, inadequate showers, and, at times, no places for players to eat or work out.
(2) Since 1990, 77 franchises have moved, leading to an untenable travel schedule, often completed with hours on school buses.
(3) The minor-league players who remain need to be paid better.
(4) There are players who are being drafted and signed who don't have a realistic opportunity to make it to the big leagues.
Minor League Baseball told MLB that they saw "all four of those problems as your problems," Manfred said. "[Minor League Baseball] would like to keep the tens of millions of dollars in profit [they] make every year . . . I'm not sure why Major League Baseball should pay to fix a facility that the minor-league operators tell you can't be fixed. It doesn't make a lot of sense from our perspective, so we thought about an alternative."
Previously, O'Conner told The New York Times that his "job is to save baseball in all 42 of those communities" - further highlighting how great the schism has become. And, in a few instances Thursday, Manfred indicated his frustration with the process and, by extension, Minor League Baseball.
"I have preferred to do my business in the room and I think the current swirl surrounding the minor leagues is another example of people not doing business in the room and trying to get public about it," he said. "We went to the minor leagues and we explained [our position] to them, I think, ver

Texto completo: Black Friday is a money- and time-sucking vortex. Here's what not to do this year.
To make the most of Black Friday, follow the Wirecutter Deals page , where Wirecutter staff members will be constantly updating their list of researched deals that are actually worth your time.
Black Friday is a highly anticipated day for shoppers who can't resist a good deal. For others, it's an overwhelming 24-hour marathon in which the pressure to buy anything (everything?) feels unbearable. For me, watching a timer count down the minutes until the discounts expire causes panic, and most years I end up buying nothing.
But there's no longer a reason to panic on Black Friday, thanks to Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products. Through our obsessive price-tracking and deal-finding for the Wirecutter Deals page and daily deals newsletter, my co-workers and I know that some bargains get posted as early as Nov. 1, turning Black Friday from one high-stress day into an entire month rich with discounts. That counting clock creates a sense of urgency, and sometimes you do have to buy quickly before a deal expires. But more often than not, you can take an extra few minutes to verify details and really think about your needs.
So don't stress this Black Friday. Here are five other things the Wirecutter Deals team recommends you avoid this year while you hunt for the best deals on things you actually need.
Gadget fads
Remember hoverboards and fidget spinners? We've all fallen for culture-consuming fads at one time or another, spending money on something that won't be around by the end of the year. Even if you think you're impervious, stores may tempt you this Black Friday: According to my colleague, the Wirecutter Deals editor Nathan Burrow, this holiday usually offers heavy discounts on trendy items. For example, this year you're likely to see impressive price drops on electric scooters. They've become ubiquitous, popping up in cities alongside short-term rental bikes, but according to our testing, they're unreliable, faulty and, in some cases, dangerous. Resist until you've done your research and you're sure you'll want the gadget a few months from now.
Exercise equipment
Some people think Black Friday is the best time to buy big-ticket items. That's not necessarily the case, especially if you're shopping for expensive exercise equipment. January offers some of the best deals we see on treadmills and ellipticals. Though there are rare instances during Cyber Week where you'll find low prices on home exercise machines that match January's discounts, you're better off waiting. Not only will the items be more steadily available, but there's also a better chance you'll put that treadmill to use immediately. Let's face it: You're likely to put off your workouts until you have a New Year's resolution to work on.

Doorbuster deals
You don't have to rush Walmart to nab great deals. You don't even have to be glued to your phone for website deals before dawn -- we know from years of experience that it's almost never worth it. "The 'doorbusters' are often on items that aren't worth busting doors for," Mr. Burrow said. The 55-inch TVs that drop to $ 200 are often less-familiar brands; the vacuums with price tags that fall a few hundred dollars aren't Dysons. If lining up at midnight is something your family considers a tradition, we won't stop you. But keep in mind that most times, you're better off passing on the meh deals that are thrown your way.
Buying in bulk
Last year, Mr. Burrow snagged a great Black Friday deal on six 75-ounce jugs of laundry detergent. It wasn't until the package arrived on his doorstep that he realized he didn't have the space to store his bounty. Though he hasn't needed to replenish his stock yet, the jugs clutter his basement, blocking the path to the rest of his storage space. This is why buying in bulk is almost always better in theory than in practice. The same goes for buying anything perishable, said Mr. Burrow, who also purchased a 100-pack of Peet's Coffee espresso capsules that he was unable to finish before they expired.
Anything you already have
Mr. Burrow has a weakness for Bluetooth speakers: Though he already has two that are perfectly functional, he still found himself purchasing a third when the price fell to a new low on Black Friday last year. Now that he's spent a few hundred dollars on different versions of the same product, he confidently suggests you avoid buying more of the same thing -- no matter how good the discount may be. "Don't invent a reason to own something just because the price is great," he said. Instead, look for discounts on items that will bring new joy to your life.

NEW YORK - Oprah Winfrey's going on tour, and she's bringing a rock-star lineup with her, including former first lady Michelle Obama and Grammy- and Oscar-winner Lady Gaga.

Texto completo: We will remember the 2010s as a grifter’s paradise. These were the years when our collective sense of objective reality totally fell apart and when politics, business, technology, culture and even ordinary life fell fully under the sway of a new breed of swindler, huckster, influencer, troll and hacker.
Scams and fakery were not just ascendant this decade — they were often the dominant story line. It was a time of “life comes at you fast” and “milkshake duck.” The primary feeling of the 2010s was one of punch-drunken disorientation, of always having the rug pulled out from under you. And this was the big lesson of the 2010s: Almost nothing is as it seems. Doubt everything. Trust no one.
Not that this idea works very well: Doubting everything may be a workable plan for individual survival in a fracturing media universe dominated by algorithms and digital media of dubious authenticity, but pervasive doubt could just as well bring on civilizational ruin. Getting through modern life seems to require adopting a corrosive view of society that makes a hash of our fundamental ideas about the value of cooperation and trust among our fellow humans. We’re bringing on a death-spiral of distrust — and I fear that in the 2020s and beyond, grifters peddling alternative facts may come to suffocate us all.
The most obvious example of the huckster’s rise was, of course, Donald Trump. When Trump announced his bid for the presidency in 2015, much of the political and media establishment, including many leading Republicans, thought the idea of a self-dealing, conspiracy theorizing reality TV star winning the White House was a pretty funny joke. Few of them understood Trump’s effectiveness at hacking the news landscape to command our attention completely. Few of them could have guessed that rather than the establishment foiling Trump, his slippery style and overwhelming blizzard of lies would so fully alter political and media culture that by the end of the decade, members of the GOP would be embracing and echoing his conspiracy theories as a way to forestall his removal from office.
While conspiracy thinking took full flower on the right, it began to bloom on the left, too. Trump’s election was followed by the rise of anti-Trump online influencers who came to dominate news and activism. These were the “resistance grifters” — Michael Avenatti, the brothers Ed and Brian Krassenstein, the nearly self-parodic Louise Mensch — who peddled a self-serving brand of breathless anti-Trumpism heavily peppered with calls to buy their books and other merch. A specter of foreign disinformation led to widespread suspicion, and it became a handy defense for grifters to dismiss opposition as bots or Russian shills.
The grift wasn’t limited to politics. The tech industry welcomed hucksters with open arms. Look at WeWork, Uber and Theranos — once highflying startups that promised to change the world in big ways and small, each unmasked for peddling false prospects, unreal tech or hiding systemic corruption and abuse. Facebook and other social media services were not just a haven of state-sponsored disinformation; with dodgy, easily gamed stats, social media increasingly came to provide a false view of the world.
Facebook admitted a series of errors overstating advertising metrics. YouTube’s stats were shown to be lousy with fake views, Twitter’s were overwhelmed by fake followers and Amazon was full of fake luxury goods. Scams pervaded new technologies and old ones. The spectacular rise in the price of Bitcoin in 2017 was later found to be the product of market manipulation. And, according to a report by the telecommunications firm First Orion, about 29% of all voice calls placed in 2018 were scam robocalls; one estimate puts the volume of spam calls at billions per month.
Why are we being overrun by scams? Society’s signals for judging reputation and trustworthiness haven’t caught up with the changing tech. Even though we know better, we reflexively mistake Instagram for reality — online influence is seen as a proxy for real-world authenticity, and so we are constantly falling under the sway of people who’ve found ways to game the digital realm. On your phone, the Fyre Festival looks irresistible.
We are also too easily blinded by wealth, or markers for wealth. Anna Sorokin, the Russian immigrant convicted this year of conning New York society into thinking she was a German heiress named Anna Delvey, defrauded hotels and banks of hundreds of thousands of dollars by pretending to be rich. She’d hand out $100 bills to anyone and everyone. “For a stretch of time in New York, no small amount of the cash in circulation was coming from Anna Delvey,” Jessica Pressler wrote.
You could argue that my take on the end of truth is too gloomy. Consider the clarifying power of #MeToo — how in the cases of Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Cosby and other once-powerful men, we witnessed the power of facts and objective, clear-eyed investigation to alter the brutal power structures that had long held victims in silence.
You might also argue that collectively, we’re getting better at spotting hucksters and frauds. The resistance grifters had a good run, but we found them out. Less than a year from now, if not sooner, Trump, too, may hit the end of his run.
But I’m skeptical that these things signal some reason for optimism. Our information system has slipped its moorings, and as a result, lying and scheming and fraud has simply become too effective a life strategy. As I argued in March, when the celebrity college admissions scandal broke, we’re seeing the “uberization” of corruption — bending the rules is becoming routine and pervasive, a push-button cheat code for modern life.
It’s not a big leap from “Trust no one” to “swindle everyone.” Happy new decade, I guess.

Texto completo: A pity, all those tainted degrees
Do the students and administration of Macalester College really believe that scrubbing the name of their school’s odiously racist and misogynistic founder, the Rev. Edward Duffield Neill, from campus buildings is sufficient to separate the school from its deplorable beginnings? Even as they take this baby step, school leaders acknowledge that there are other specters in their past to be exposed. As the appalling scope of the school’s shameful history becomes clear, the stain will be everlasting. Renaming a few halls or buildings will not change or hide this history — more must be done! Some may offer as a defense that the school has had many laudable chapters in its past that serve as a counterweight to its scarlet infamy. That doesn’t matter — the school must be closed!
When a politician or clergyperson is disgraced through some despicable betrayal of trust or principal, the only acceptable course of action is abject public apology, resignation from office and all honors, and complete withdrawal from the public eye. Macalester must do the same. There is no road back to decency after such a shocking fall from grace.
One can’t help but feel a degree of sympathy for all those Macalester alumni who hold now-tainted degrees from the school. Although they’re certainly keeping quiet now, let’s hope that they haven’t been too free in their workplaces and social lives with mention of their alma mater. A cultivated obscurity about those formative school days may limit the risk of the professional, financial, and social repercussions that association with the disgraced college might bring.

Some questions about the train
Billions of dollars and years have been spent planning, getting funding, designing, building and operating the light rail system in the metro area. It took only a few years for the homeless, the street people with non-sense of responsibility, the gangs, and the defiant young people to take them over. They smoke, urinate, defecate, vomit, and have sex on the trains. Homeless lie across the handicap seats. They have grown to know no one is going to challenge their behavior so they become more empowered. The sad part is the transit police seem to have given up and turned it over to them.
At a forum with a public official recently, people who chose to move downtown to access public transit recounted numerous horror stories about why they have quit riding the Green Line and are considering buying a car and moving back to the suburbs. Men who report they have been threatened and intimidated by thugs. People in wheelchairs who report they can’t find handicapped space and get rude treatment. Young professional women who are afraid to ride because of the treatment they experience and the disgusting conditions on the trains.
The thug culture has gotten so bad it is going to take a monumental effort to take back the trains. Are we going to save the system or just let it decay into a rundown rolling slum?
Some questions:
Is it true the transit police have been instructed to lay off the homeless people sleeping on trains without paying any fare?
Ramsey County Commissioner Ortega was proud to report that the Green Line has the highest ridership on the system and as a result it requires little or no government subsidies to operate. If that is true shouldn’t there be funds to take back the trains and and keep them safe and clean?
Taxpayers spend millions building homeless shelters and low-income and market-rate housing. Are we going to also be expected to give up our transit system and allow it to become a rolling homeless encampment full of trash, needles, used condoms, and reeking of bodily wastes?
Steve Loeding, St. Paul
On trash, case is closed
The results of the trash referendum don’t please oped writer David Schultz because, apparently, he’s still against organized trash pickup (“The results of the St. Paul trash referendum should please no one,” Nov. 14). OK, but the referendum settled that question. If Schultz wants to make a constructive contribution, he might suggest specific improvements to our system, instead of whining that it’s still theoretically a bad idea and raising vague process complaints.
Most people wanted organized pickup, so our elected city government solicited a lot of input into the design of the system, and then they implemented it. The resulting system works, though it has several problems and nobody thinks it’s perfect. One year into this experiment, the referendum showed that the public prefers organized pickup by a wide margin, and they returned their city council members to office, most by comfortable margins.
Some people, like Mr. Schultz, will not be satisfied, but the case is closed.
John Evans, St. Paul
Spend, spend, spend?
Whoever approved to cartoon last week showing Democrats as part of “spend, spend, spend” apparently doesn’t read their own paper. On page 13A that day was an article stating “the U.S. budget deficit rises 34% in October.” Yes, 34%! Seriously? You’re pointing fingers at Democrats and ignoring that? Donald Trump promised to eliminate the deficit and instead it’s skyrocketing, but the newspaper apparently wants to deflect from that fact.
Gloria Zaiger, St. Paul
What’s next for Ford site? Not transit, apparently
Frederick Melo’s otherwise informative Ford Site update Nov. 17 omitted one key word: “transit.” Given estimates as low as 22,000 and as high as 41,740 in daily person trips by car due to Ford’s redevelopment, and the drumbeat of legitimate concern about this from current residents nearby, what gives?
The omission is not Melo’s fault. Tough driving disincentives and bold transit options are nowhere in all the Ford Site planning to date. Why?
Cities elsewhere in our warming world are realizing that driving needs public limits and transit needs priority. Human nature loves a car, even if it cooks the atmosphere and floods our coasts; transportation — mostly cars — is the biggest climate change emitter as of 2016. Recently the New York Times headlined cities’ car control efforts (Nov 14). I hope sometime soon Minnesota will merit such coverage in our own papers.
Unfortunately, some of Minnesota’s elected leaders have been making effective public policy nearly impossible by demonizing transit — especially rail transit — as a wedge issue and extolling the virtue and need for roads regardless of the true costs. Meanwhile, pedestrian deaths from cars spike upward.
In recent years, as Ford Site planning was taking shape, some of us pointed out, repeatedly, the absence of transit. Leaders have seemed reluctant to awaken potential opponents. St. Paul City Council-member Chris Tolbert, to his credit, inserted a proposal to study a direct connection to the Riverview Corridor, currently envisioned as a $2 billion “Modern Streetcar.” Tolbert’s proposal went to the Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority — and sank like a stone. Again, why?
Endless, disconnected planning has exhausted the powers that be. Cities plan land use and traffic management, counties plan transitways, the Metropolitan Council builds and operates them, and Republicans in the Legislature try to block them. For a while there was the Counties Transit Improvement Board (CTIB), but even that broke up over ideological and territorial disputes. No wonder everyone is burned out.
Highland Park and the Ford Site urgently need and deserve a real plan to shift much more of the new trips out of cars. All the great walking and cycling elements in the plan are fine, but only transit can do the heavy lifting that will deliver mode shift at the scale required. Hennepin County is building out a full spine of light rail, while the East Metro struggles, and so far fails, even to connect what is Minnesota’s most prominent redevelopment opportunity.
It’s time for us all to look in the mirror and accept that livability, car control and excellent transit are essential to each other and the Ford Site.

Texto completo: A terrifying trove of documents from China leaked to the New York Times confirms that hundreds of thousands of Uighurs - a largely Muslim ethnic minority population - are being systematically placed in internment camps to be stripped of their identities.
In public, Beijing has told the world a tale that it has gently sought to reeducate Uighurs to promote cultural and societal harmony. In these classified documents, the picture becomes indisputable: The regime has orchestrated a forcible cleansing program, spiriting people away by the hundreds of thousands and stealing their freedom because of who they are.
Such brutality comes as little surprise in China, where the state's machinery of repression is refined. But the world cannot lose the capacity to be outraged.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has, to his credit, called China's treatment of Uighurs "one of the worst human rights crimes of our time." So what will we do to stop it?

Leaders: No 'fake news,' later school start times

Texto completo: Today's theme is no.
Florida officials said no to The New York Times in one county and no to later start times for high schools in another.
We start in Citrus County, just north of Tampa Bay, where commissioners made national news last month by refusing their own library's request to get digital subscriptions to The New York Times.
The library already carried print copies of the Times but wanted to switch to a digital service that all 70,000 cardholders could access.
The idea angered commissioners. "I don't want the New York Times in this county," said commissioner Scott Carnahan. "It's fake news."
Another commissioner explained his objection by saying: "Some of us support the president of the United States."
But after backlash from residents who said commissioners were letting their personal politics interfere with the library's stated mission, commissioners said they would reconsider the issue.
This week, they did. And they stuck to their anti-Times guns after being urged to by other residents, including one who asked: "You let The New York Times in, what's coming next? What radical publication is coming next?"
The board denied its library's request in a 3-2 vote, according to the Citrus County Chronicle.
Some commissioners (seemingly unaware their original comments were captured on video) tried to rewrite history and claim their objections to the Times weren't political. They claimed they simply objected to the $2,700 cyber-subscription price.
Except the library's request to provide digital subscriptions was actually $290 cheaper than the library's current practice of providing hard copies of the Times.
As I mentioned two weeks ago, a good solution might have been for Citrus County to subscribe to a multi-newspaper service that provides digital access to hundreds of papers that provide editorial perspective from all sides of the political spectrum and from all over the country.
But it doesn't look like Citrus County politicians were looking for a solution.
They were looking to make a political point - and were willing to spend more taxpayer dollars to serve fewer people to do so.
In the dark
Also on the "no" front, Orange County school leaders agreed last week (without taking a formal vote) not to move high school start times any later.
High school here starts at 7:20 a.m. - earlier than it does in 90% of American school districts and too early for effective learning or student safety, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Many students catch the bus in the dark around 6:15.
In supporting the early-morning status quo, school leaders cited a survey that suggested parents wanted to leave start times where they are.
That's true. And false.
See, what you may forget is that Orange County conducted another survey two years ago where parents said they did indeed want to move back start times.
But the county didn't like those results. Or didn't think it could fund or find a solution.
So it conducted another survey that offered later start times - but only if parents agreed to other, unwanted changes. (One called for starting middle school at 10:15 am. Another called for moving elementary schools an hour earlier.)
Of course parents objected to those. So did I.
It was like running a survey that said: "Who would like a pretty flower?" Most people would say yes.
But if you didn't want to buy anyone a pretty flower, you'd run another survey that said: "Who would like a pretty flower - but only if it comes with slap in the face or a punch in the gut?"
Then, after everyone said "Um, no," you could say: See? Nobody wants flowers.
Orange County spent four years (and two surveys) on this issue and did nothing.
This is a money issue. State funding lags. And schools need more of it for teachers, classes and, yes, buses and drivers.
The county now says it may consider a cheaper option - moving start times slightly later, just for high schools. (It should.)
Members should also seriously lobby legislators, who have acknowledged this problem in the past. (A good idea would be legislation that provides beefed-up bus funding for districts that move start times later.)
In the meantime, though, don't let anyone convince you that parents don't want later times. They already said they do - just like the experts recommend.
Listen to Mr. Rogers
And finally, the Tom Hanks movie tribute to Rollins College alumnus Mr. Rogers ("A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood") opens this week.
The movie tells the story of Rogers' friendship with a journalist.
To honor that, I thought we'd end today's column with Mr. Rogers' "Four Pillars of Journalism" - as reported in the Pennsylvania Post.
1. Journalists are human beings not stenographers, human beings not automatons.
2. Point out injustice when you have to.
3. Point out beauty when you can.
4. Be aware of celebrating the wonders of creation.
Thanks for the words, Mr. Rogers.
(And thanks to my mother for flagging them for me.)

As Uber Films Its Passengers, Privacy Fears Come to Fore

Texto completo: The company says it is increasing the recording of rides to settle disputes between drivers and passengers and to improve safety.
SAN FRANCISCO -- For several months, some Uber passengers in Texas have been recorded on video as they have been driven to their destinations. The video has been stored online and could have been reviewed by members of Uber's safety staff if the driver had reported a problem with the passenger.
The video recordings are part of a broad initiative at the ride-hailing company to capture more objective data about what happens inside vehicles during Uber trips, where disputes between riders and drivers often play out without witnesses.
Uber has experienced years of complaints about the safety of its riders and drivers, who are often left to sort out episodes without the help of the company, and it has settled lawsuits claiming that it does not do enough to protect passengers. But as Uber increases the practice of recording drivers and passengers, the company is facing new privacy pressures.
"Uber already has this treasure trove of highly personal data about people," said Camille Fischer, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "When you pair surveillance during those trips, whether it's over the driver or over the passenger, you are getting a more fine-tuned snapshot of people's daily lives."
Uber began the video recording program in Texas in July, and is conducting smaller tests of the program in Florida and Tennessee. In November, it announced a similar effort in Brazil and Mexico to allow riders and drivers to record audio during a trip. The audio recording feature, first reported by Reuters, is managed by Uber, and begins a recording if either the rider or driver requests it.
At the end of the trip, the rider or driver has the option to send the recording to Uber for review, but cannot save it themselves, a safeguard Uber built to prevent riders and drivers from recording each other and posting the clips online, the company said.
Uber's video recording feature is a partnership with Nauto, a technology company that uses artificial intelligence to analyze video from vehicles. The company aims to detect potential collisions and warn drivers, and uses facial recognition to detect distracted drivers and remind them to keep their eyes on the road.
Under the partnership, Uber issues cameras to Texas drivers who request them at a fee of $ 5 a month. Footage gathered by the cameras is stored by Nauto but available to Uber if the camera detects a crash, a serious safety incident is reported or a driver requests the footage, according to a frequently-asked-questions document compiled by Nauto.
Passengers' faces are blurred in the footage provided to drivers, but visible to Uber employees who review it during safety incidents.
"It is about providing the right tools in the hands of our users. We want them to feel, as they're in the car, that the lights are on," said Sachin Kansal, a director of project management at Uber who oversees the company's safety features. "We want to empower our users to have safer interactions on the platform."
The recording features are part of Uber's larger campaign to improve safety, Mr. Kansal said, pointing to recent product changes that have allowed riders to call emergency services from the Uber app and offered them pin numbers to confirm their rides.
The effort to record audio of passengers and drivers in Brazil and Mexico will begin next month, Uber said. Drivers and passengers in those areas have been targets of crime, and some have been robbed or killed. The company said it would share the audio recordings with law enforcement authorities if asked to do so.
But as Uber experiments with recording riders and passengers in the United States, it will have to confront a thicket of privacy issues. Laws governing whether or not a person can be recorded without their knowledge vary state by state, making it difficult for the company to roll out a recording feature nationwide.
"We want to make sure we are following the privacy laws of the land wherever we launch," Mr. Kansal said. "This is a small pilot. We are going to try a few things and see what works."
Ms. Fischer, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyer, said the recordings raised privacy concerns for drivers, who may feel that they have to opt in to video or audio recording in order to remain in good standing with Uber.
Some Uber drivers already record their passengers, although the practice has not been sanctioned by the company.
Last summer, Uber terminated a driver in St. Louis who routinely live-streamed his passengers online. That November, a Canadian hockey team faced backlash after their Uber driver posted a video online of team members gossiping about their coach. And in 2017, an Uber driver recorded the company's then-chief executive Travis Kalanick chastising him for complaining about falling wages on the platform. Mr. Kalanick was ousted from the company later that year.
Uber is expected to release a transparency report this year describing the number of assaults and safety incidents that occurred in its vehicles, the first report of its kind for the company.

Texto completo: The loss of local news coverage in much of the United States has frayed communities and left many Americans woefully uninformed, according to a new report.
School board and city council meetings are going uncovered. Overstretched reporters receive promising tips about stories but have no time to follow up. Newspapers publish fewer pages or less frequently or, in hundreds of cases across the country, are shuttered completely.
All of this has added up to a crisis in local news coverage in the United States that has frayed communities and left many Americans woefully uninformed, according to a report by PEN America released on Wednesday.
"A vibrant, responsive democracy requires enlightened citizens, and without forceful local reporting they are kept in the dark," the report said. "At a time when political polarization is increasing and fraudulent news is spreading, a shared fact-based discourse on the issues that most directly affect us is more essential and more elusive than ever."
The report, "Losing the News: The Decimation of Local Journalism and the Search for Solutions," paints a grim picture of the state of local news in every region of the country. The prelude is familiar to journalists: As print advertising revenue has plummeted, thousands of newspapers have been forced to cut costs, reduce their staffs or otherwise close.
And while the disruption has hampered the ability of newsrooms to fully cover communities, it also has damaged political and civic life in the United States, the report says, leaving many people without access to crucial information about where they live.
"That first draft of history is not being written -- it has completely disappeared," said Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive of PEN America, a nonprofit organization that celebrates literature and free expression. "That's what is so chilling about this crisis."
The authors of the report spoke to dozens of journalists, elected officials and activists, who described how cutbacks in local newsrooms have left communities in the dark and have failed to keep public and corporate officials accountable.
In 2017, when work on the PEN project began, researchers planned to call it "News Deserts," examining pockets of the country where local news was scarce. But the more research the group did, the more it realized that the original scope was inadequate: Since 2004, more than 1,800 local print outlets have shuttered in the United States, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper at all.
"This was a national crisis," Ms. Nossel said. "This was not about a few isolated areas that were drying up."
Many Americans are completely unaware that local news is suffering. According to a Pew survey this year, 71 percent of Americans believe that their local news outlets are doing well financially. But, according to that report, only 14 percent say they have paid for or donated money to a local news source in the past year.
"They don't realize that their local news outlet is under threat," said Viktorya Vilk, manager of special projects for PEN, who was one of the report's authors.
The decline of local news outlets threatens the reporting on public health crises in places like Flint, Mich., where residents voiced concern about the quality of their water to The Flint Journal long before the national media reported on the issue.
In Denver, a diminished local news presence -- after the closure of The Rocky Mountain News and the shrunken Denver Post -- has contributed to civic disengagement, one case study in the report says. Kevin Flynn, a former journalist turned City Council member, lamented the large number of people who seemed to be unaware of local elections, and the relative handful of reporters covering a quickly growing city. "It feels like we could all be getting away with murder right now," Mr. Flynn said of public officials.
In some communities, a dearth of local news was associated with a population that was less aware of politics.
"Voting and consuming news -- those things go hand in hand," said Tom Huang, assistant managing editor of The Dallas Morning News.
One case study in the report shared the experience of Greg Barnes, who took a buyout in 2018 after three decades at The Fayetteville Observer in North Carolina.
Toward the end of his time at the paper, the report said, "his job had essentially been filling holes for the rapidly diminishing staff instead of doing the sprawling investigations that had been his trademark."
The report offers several solutions: It cites newer, digitally focused outlets like Chalkbeat, an online organization that focuses on education; Outlier, based in Detroit; and Block Club Chicago as examples of small but vibrant news sources that have stepped into the void.
But a more comprehensive solution is required, the report suggests, including private donations and expansions of public funding.

Texto completo: President Trump considered the Wednesday testimony from Ambassador Gordon Sondland as a “win” for his presidency despite the ambassador’s claim of a “potential quid pro quo.”
During a tour of an Apple factory in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, Trump told reporters he was pleased with how he came out in Sondland’s testimony. He called the impeachment an “embarrassment to our country” and bashed the leadership of House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Let me tell you, it’s a hoax, it’s a disgrace, it’s an embarrassment to our country. Nancy Pelosi has done a terrible job as speaker. There’s never been a speaker that has done so little, and she's totally incompetent,” Trump said. “And shifty Schiff stands up, and he tells lies all day long.”
He added, “And even with that, we have no due process, we can’t have anything, and yet not only did we win today, it's over.”
Trump slammed the press for claiming that Sondland landed some punches during the hearing. He said, “But we have a fake press, we have a phony press. We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have a phony press. They are dishonest, most of them.“
He continued, “Most of them are fake and phony. CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, the Washington Post, New York Times. These are fake papers. They are fake press. They should be ashamed of themselves. And they hurt our country.”

'This is a fight, it’s not a dance': Democrats urge Klobuchar to repeat tough talk at debate

Texto completo: Amy Klobuchar dispensed with her “Minnesota nice” act during last month’s debate, and the decision helped boost her presidential bid in Iowa.
November’s debate in Atlanta on Thursday night provides another opportunity to claw back ground on the top-tier candidates and insert herself in the 2020 primary, according to Democrats.
Democratic strategist Mike Lux said undecided, likely caucus-goers in Iowa were considering the Minnesota senator, 59, as a centrist alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, should either front-runner slip in the polls. Her candidacy counters the more liberal platforms of Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
“I think she remains in the mix,” Lux told the Washington Examiner. “She obviously needs to continue to do well in the debates. She needs to hit Pete hard and go after him on his lack of experience, and the fact that he hasn’t taken positions on some issues. In order for her to get in the top three or four, she has to figure out how to take Pete down.”
During the last debate in Ohio, Klobuchar dropped "Minnesota nice" pretenses and went after Warren over her refusal to admit middle-class taxes would go up under “Medicare for all” and for implying that she, through her “wealth tax,” espoused better values than her rivals via their respective tax plans. The strategy was in stark contrast to the approach Klobuchar adopted during the July debate in which she declined to say who she was referring to during a Sunday morning news show interview when she claimed her opponents were making empty promises to get elected.
The former prosecutor’s casual, congenial manner on the campaign trail has earned her fans, particularly in Iowa, where she averages 5% support, according to RealClearPolitics data. Though in single digits, she's in fifth place behind Biden, Buttigieg, Warren, and Sanders.
"I think that’s a Viking horn. You’re gonna piss off all the Packer fans,” Klobuchar said as a loud noise rang out during this month’s Iowa Democratic Party’s Liberty and Justice celebration, referencing the Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers NFL franchises.
At the same time, the “Minnesota nice” image she projects to the public contradicts with complaints about hostile work environments she has created as an employer. In February, the New York Times reported she once berated a staff member for forgetting to bring a fork onto a plane for her to eat a salad and then made the aide wash a comb she used instead of utensils after she had finished the meal. She later lampooned herself at this year’s Gridiron dinner following her insistence that she was merely a demanding boss.
"How did everyone like the salad? I thought it was OK, but it needed just a bit of scalp oil, and a pinch of dandruff would be a little better," Klobuchar joked in March.
For Lux, although Klobuchar taking direct shots was a shift, the Yale University and University of Chicago Law School graduate has always “shown sharp elbows” when necessary.
“Early on, in a multi-candidate field, nobody wants to be seen as the biggest asshole in the race,” he said. “In the early days, your biggest goal is to have everybody like you. Then, as time goes on in the campaign and it gets closer and closer, you have to start throwing elbows, you have to start showing more toughness because you’re down to that time when people are picking and choosing. You have to be able to show that you’re tough, that you can take a punch, and that you can give a punch.”
Going on the offense too early was perhaps a lesson Klobuchar learned from California Sen. Kamala Harris, whose momentum after the June debate for confronting Biden over federally mandated busing was blunted by criticism over the premeditated nature of the attack. Harris had t-shirts emblazoned with a childhood photo ready to go for $30 after she took Biden to task for his opposition to the policy in the 1960s and '70s.
Pat Taylor, 68, a retired probation parole officer from Oelwein, Iowa, told the Washington Examiner after a Buttigieg event this month in Waverly, Iowa, that Harris’s attempt was “scripted.”
“And that’s bullshit,” said Taylor, who will likely caucus for Biden. “It was very ham-handed.”
Although Taylor was open to Klobuchar, she worried about the White House hopeful’s electability.
“I think realistically, the numbers are not in her favor. I like Klobuchar, I do, but a lot has to change for her to move up and gain credibility.”
But Betty Arcidlacono, 70, of Marion, Iowa, is tossing up caucusing for Klobuchar and appreciated the senator’s more assertive tone.
“She didn’t get where she is by being a ‘yes’ person and not standing up for her own ideas. And she has a lot of good ideas, and she has a good background, which is going to influence her future ideas,” the retiree, who previously worked in the insurance industry, told the Washington Examiner after Iowa Democratic Rep. Abby Finkenauer’s first fundraiser fish fry in Cedar Rapids. “It’s going to get a little nastier, yeah, but that’s just the way it has to be. This is a fight, it’s not a dance. Everybody doesn’t get a little trophy at the end of the season for being a good sport," she added.

Tulsi Gabbard could disrupt the Democratic primary but refuses to distinguish herself where it matters

Texto completo: A lot of conservatives will like that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii got nasty with California Sen. Kamala Harris at the Democratic presidential primary debate on Wednesday, and they have reason for it. But where is Tulsi distinguishing herself when it really matters?
I gather that she's a non-interventionist unlike most of her party. That's supposed to make her something of a moderate politically. But where is she on healthcare? Where is she on immigration? Where is she on education? I have no clue. I don't even know where she stands on the ridiculous impeachment investigation.
Republicans like Gabbard because she's disrupting the primary. She is. But aside from that, she could actually be a legitimate disrupter in the race, someone who could have done what Michael Bloomberg will fail to do when he enters. She could have said what needs to be said on every issue that matters to independent and moderate Democratic voters.
But she's not doing that. She's getting in little tiffs with Hillary Clinton and her fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Kamala Harris.
They count for something. But they don't count where it matters. She's not running a long game.

Texto completo: Wednesday night, the country’s most liberal Democrats will descend on my home state of Georgia and flood the airwaves with their radical, socialist ideas.
The presidential candidates on stage will attempt to paint a rosy picture of a socialist worldview that has failed repeatedly around the globe.
Do not be fooled by catchy names like the “Green New Deal,” “Medicare For All,” and the “Freedom Dividend.” These are disguises for socialist policies that would fundamentally change the country as we know it.
Socialist policies have destroyed other countries. The Soviet Union crumbled. Greece’s economy collapsed. Cuba and Venezuela today are failed states, and people are suffering. Why would America want to emulate any of these failed socialist regimes?
America was built on simple principles: economic opportunity for everyone, fiscal responsibility, limited government, and individual liberty. In the post-World War II era, our free-market, free-enterprise system has generated the greatest period of economic growth in human history.
The American dream exists because of the free-market system. The socialist agenda would kill the American dream.
Why? Because state control shuts down creative thought and individual choice.
The free-market system in America relies on innovation, capital formation, and the rule of law. Socialism thwarts innovation and hijacks the flow of capital.
Free markets breed entrepreneurship and foster risk-taking. Socialist regimes crush job creators and eliminate economic growth.
Capitalism creates individual opportunity. Socialism undercuts individual liberties and allows the state to dictate what is best for the individual. This type of government control is precisely what our Founding Mothers and Founding Fathers fled.
Individual freedom, by definition, must be sacrificed to implement the Democrats’ socialist agenda.
The free-market system creates opportunity in America. Take a man named JL Turner, for example. Turner’s father died when he was 11 years old, and he had to feed his family. He was functionally illiterate but started a general store in Scottsville, Kentucky, in 1939.
The business grew, and his stores eventually became known as Dollar General. Years later, I was humbled to serve as the company’s first non-family CEO.
Today, Dollar General is a Fortune 500 company with more than 135,000 employees and $25 billion in revenues, and it underwrites one of the country’s largest literacy foundations.
Dollar General’s success story could not exist in a socialist society where the state controls the economy and makes decisions for individuals.
Although I have seen the power of the free-market system firsthand, I have also lived and worked under socialist regimes during my business career. The difference is astounding, and workers are the ones who suffer the most.
I have seen the insidious way socialized medicine bifurcates healthcare delivery by giving better service to those who can afford private care. I have run multinational businesses and experienced how a government-run economy closes doors for consumers and innovators. On top of that, the burden of socialist wealth redistribution through heavy taxation encourages political patronage, corruption, tax evasion, and ultimately hurts the workers the “state” claims it is trying to help.
As Winston Churchill said in 1947, “the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. The inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of misery.” Churchill was right.
Today, we are in an ideological war for the future of our republic. If Democrats win the White House, take the Senate majority, and keep the House, they will create a socialist regime to change the very fabric of America.
The choice in 2020 is not about personality. It is about what kind of nation we will leave for our children and our children’s children.
It is about America’s national interest versus political self-interest. It is about self-determination versus total state control. It is about preserving America’s founding principles.
Always remember: The price of socialism is freedom.

Texto completo: Major League Baseball's existing Professional Baseball Agreement with Minor League Baseball expires at the end of the 2020 season.
MLB's proposal for a new deal includes the contraction of as many as 42 MiLB affiliates and a slew of other unfavorable changes to MiLB and potential future draft picks, according to reports. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred presented the proposal to the 30 owners, who according to the New York Daily News approved it unanimously.
Here are five questions on the as-yet ratified contract that would radically change the minor-league system that has been in place for decades:
1. How does this affect the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, Triple-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies?
The IronPigs, who will start their 13th season at Coca-Cola Park in April, won't be directly affected. They are not among the MiLB affiliates proposed to be eliminated. Part of the proposal does include adding a third Triple-A league, which conceivably could pull a few teams from the International League and reduce some travel for remaining IL clubs.
Improved facilities and player wellness through less travel and better living conditions are being used as the selling points by those behind this proposal - led by the Astros, who have gained notoriety for their massive turnaround from 2013 doormat to 2017 World Series champion and, now, scandals involving sign-stealing and inappropriate behavior by their front-office personnel.
It is clear, however, that the proposal as reported would save MLB and its 30 organizations a lot of money. It also would destroy many minor-league franchise owners, some of whom have invested life savings in their respective teams.
2. Are any Phillies affiliates
facing contraction?
Yes, the short-season New York-Penn League's Williamsport Crosscutters, who have been a Philadelphia affiliate since 2007, are among those on the list. Nine of the 14 NY-Penn League teams are on the chopping block, including the Staten Island Yankees and State College Spikes. The Brooklyn Cyclones, a Mets affiliate, would be among those franchises reassigned to other leagues.
The proposal, which also tears up other rookie leagues (Appalachian, Northwest, Pioneer) would leave 118 MiLB affiliates. There would be the creation of a new Mid-Atlantic Class A League and a third Triple-A league (along with the IL and Pacific Coast League).
It is floated that many of the 42 cities/stadiums losing affiliated clubs would comprise a vaguely-detailed Dream League with some form of MLB connection. This sounds a lot like independent league ball, which has no secure connection to and limited financial obligations from MLB. And that will be a tough sell to those small markets.
3. What changes would be
made to the MLB Draft?
Plenty. It would move from early June to after the College World Series (which begins mid-June), according to Baseball America, and be reduced from 40 rounds to 20. Drafted players would not sign contracts until the following season and instead spend the early fall being introduced to the abundance of analytics resources being used by every MLB team.
It also would change the number of minor-leaguers an MLB franchise could have under contract from unlimited now to 150 to 200 to cover all affiliated leagues as well as those who are in "extended spring training."
The reduced draft would drastically decrease the chances for the next Luke Voit, Raul Ibanez, Roy Oswalt, Mike Piazza, Ken Griffey Sr. or Jorge Posada - all of whom were drafted after the 20th round - to have a shot at the majors.
4. What legal ramifications would there be for MLB with this massive reconstruction?
Significant, according to some.
One major-league official told Bill Madden of the New York Daily News, "I don't see any way we can do something like this. My God, we'll be sued all over the place from these cities that have built or refurbished ballparks with taxpayer money, and this will really put our antitrust exemption in jeopardy."
However, a minor-league franchise owner who has been part of the negotiations said, "I cannot believe the arrogance of these people. They don't care about lawsuits or anything. They think they're bulletproof. They've told us, 'We're doing this and there's no discussion about it. And if you don't like it, we'll form our own minor leagues.' "
5. How does this proposal
advance the game of baseball?
Put aside the fact MLB is tossing aside towns that have had minor-league baseball for more than a century (led by Chattanooga, Tennessee) and think about some of these points logically.
Williamsport has hosted an MLB game each of the last few seasons, including the Phillies and Mets in 2018, but yet its facilities are not good enough to house a minor-league franchise?
Many of the rookie-league franchises are in states hundreds of miles away from an MLB stadium. Take away those fans from pro baseball in their backyards and they are not packing up for a weekend to pay considerably higher prices for tickets, parking, concessions and team merchandise, plus a likely hotel stay, to see one game.
MLB attendance is in a 12-year downward cycle (the Phillies were among the few who saw an increase in 2019). Parts of this proposal seem to defy logic when it comes to growing the game.
In fact, it appears obvious this has nothing to do with making sure the underpaid, overworked minor-leaguers at all levels are better cared for and more about making sure MLB owners have more money in their pockets.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
With the focus on Ukraine and Turkey in recent weeks, it may have been easy to miss the news story about the Environmental Protection Agency release of “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science.” This proposal would limit the research that is necessary to understand the impacts of pollution on public health.
Normally, I would consider such a stance out of step for the EPA's mission “to protect human health and the environment.” Unfortunately, I am not surprised. Just this year, the EPA, as well as a number of other executive branch agencies, have quietly been taking actions and promulgating administrative orders that are rescinding air and water emission standards. This regression goes deeper. There is a systematic dismantling of monitoring and data collection, and overt actions to silence or discount the scientific findings that are necessary to inform future policy creation.
The administration's strategy reflects the promises by President Trump to both disengage with the Paris agreement and walking back regulations that the he claims are imposing undue costs on Americans and stifling economic development. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that since Trump took office, the EPA, the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Land Management and other executive branch agencies have rolled back 85 regulations.
Since the beginning of 2017, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, at Columbia Law School, has been tracking any deregulatory-related activity related to climate change. The center has documented more than 150 such actions that directly, or tangentially, challenge or attempt to silence the science behind the policies.
The Union of Concerned Scientists has been more focused about the administration's attack on science and the ramifications on our nation's ability to meet current and future public health and environmental challenges. This concerted effort has been multi-faceted, ranging from burying peer-reviewed scientific reports, appointing non-scientists to head up scientific advisory committees or even disbanding such committees to leaving scientific political-appointee positions vacant, reducing the voice of agency professional scientific staff and removing entire governmental websites where scientifically grounded information had been presented.
This executive branch strategy seems to be working. The one bright light still shining has been the court decisions to counter actions by the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture and the EPA to cut back on emission standards or freeze regulations.
And there are proactive stances being taken at the state level to ameliorate some of the actions occurring on the national stage. California is leading a group of 21 states challenging the administration's rollback on tailpipe standards. There is also the United States Climate Alliance, initiated by the governors of California, New York and Washington state just after the president announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. This coalition now has bipartisan support from 25 state governments, whose initiatives are being informed both by science and economics.
One last point should be made about the administration's current strategy. As a former high school science teacher, I worry what such an outright effort to discount the voice of science to inform the nation's environmental and health policies signals to the next generation of would-be scientists.

Texto completo: Readers discuss why many Americans are not paying attention and praise the testimony of three officials last week.
To the Editor:
Re "House Hearings Roll On, but Many Tune Out" (front page, Nov. 18):
Thank you for reporting on how so many Americans did not bother to listen to the impeachment proceedings last week. It helps to answer a question that was nagging at me all weekend: How on earth could anyone listen to the words of George Kent, William Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch and still not question the ethics and morality of our current president?
Cathy Bernard
New York
To the Editor:
Impeachment has invaded every cell in my body. Physically it has caused rashes and fatigue. Mentally it has left me saddened and anxious, dizzy at times, and desperate for relief. Even Valium could not overcome impeachment's toxicity. Even when conversations never touch impeachment, it remains the elephant in the room.
So the monster has triumphed. Au revoir to cable news. Sayonara to talk radio. Farewell to the written media. Hello to ESPN, western movies, "Say Yes to the Dress." You are my haven now. For the sake of all Americans, censure the guy and move on.
Howard Quinn
Bronx
To the Editor:
We Americans had the opportunity last week to hear from three stellar Foreign Service professionals. Their love for this country is unquestionable, and the dignity with which they serve us is admirable.
Anyone who has become dispirited by the stark, in-your-face corruption and degradation visited upon us by President Trump and his stable of sycophants would do themselves some good to find and watch videos of the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch, my hero, as well as George Kent and Bill Taylor. They remind me that droves of people of good character and integrity still exist within the realms of government. They give me hope.
Any American who is turning his or her attention elsewhere is missing an opportunity to see our democracy in action. May it prevail.

Granby, Mass.
To the Editor:
Re "Honesty Is the Best Foreign Policy," by Elizabeth Drew (Sunday Review, Nov. 17):
During Watergate, as now, a select group of people stood up for what they saw as right. However, let us also remember that Watergate was largely ignored by the public until the investigation really heated up. When there was actual testimony that the president had, indeed, conspired to cover up wrongdoing in his own administration, people woke up.
Right now, the sad fact is that much of the general public doesn't care. Either they have other issues that are important for them, they don't read much and are ignorant of the issues involved, or they are with President Trump through thick and thin. Whatever the reason, let us hope that they wake up. I do believe that our democracy will survive because of honest people like those Ms. Drew describes.

Texto completo: Politicians must focus on deficit
The public, regardless of political party affiliation, should advise all of our elected officials to do whatever is reasonable to lower the federal deficit.
The federal deficit for 2019 is $984 billion. This is a 26% increase over the previous year. This is partly linked to President Donald Trump's tax cut. We should never grant any tax cuts that increase the federal deficit. The long-term harm is greater than the short-term benefit. Politicians like the idea of tax cuts because it helps them win votes, but at what cost to the national welfare?
If we were wise, we would tell our elected officials never to grant us tax cuts that would increase our annual deficit for that year. President Trump told us that his tax cut would not increase the deficit because of all the other economic gains we would have. He has been proven wrong about this. Are we smart enough to learn what is good fiscal policy and what is foolhardy policy?
Do the right thing - cut deficits.

Like people, nature can be confused
The writer of the Nov. 1 letter to the editor "Gender is assigned by natural world" wonders if we are losing our collective minds.
The writer is one of those who mistakenly believe transgender is caused by wanting to choose a different gender than the one you were born with.
An article in the New York Times last year explained what is really happening. Nature makes mistakes, just like we do.
Sometimes nature accidentally gives people a physical gender that doesn't match their psychological gender. Normally both genders are determined in the fetus at the same time. But sometimes a few weeks delay occurs between the two determinations. By the time nature gets around to determining the psychological gender, she has forgotten what the physical one is. In this case, people are their psychological gender, because that's how they feel.
The mainstream media could do a better job of explaining this phenomenon to members of the public, many of whom will otherwise remain as confused as nature.

Hybrids are too complex to compete
The owner of a Chevy Volt was recently lamenting GM's decision to discontinue the vehicle, in the recent letter to the editor "Plug-in hybrid cars offer versatility."
While the Volt is certainly a great vehicle, and much-loved by its owners, GM lost money on every Volt it produced. That's just not a sustainable business model.
Toyota's Prius is the only mass-produced electrified vehicle that's profitable, according to WardsAuto.
It is costly to produce a vehicle that has both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine, and all the required components for both systems, in addition to the batteries.
The main purpose of the hybrid vehicles was to quell the range anxiety for those who desired to drive electric. But with the advent of improved and lower-cost battery technology, such as the 325-mile range Tesla Model 3, the future belongs to the all-electric vehicles.
Getting rid of the entire internal combustion engine system also significantly lowers your operating and maintenance costs.

Guns should be No. 1 on to-do list
I can't believe Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and the Republican legislators think for a moment that anyone believes the two gun control ideas Gov. Tony Evers has suggested challenge the Second Amendment.
I am sick and tired of them using that argument whenever the Democrats come up with an idea. We all know it's politics and this is way too important a problem for political games. Let's bring some adults to the table and come up with an all-inclusive, bipartisan gun control bill.
Like every other mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, I want our children to be able to go to school, the theater, the park or wherever they want to go without being afraid of being shot. Enough is enough.
The Republicans should be ashamed of not addressing a problem which should be No. 1 on their to-do list. And please, no more Second Amendment excuses. They know and I know no one is going to take our guns.

Boomers have duty to address climate
"OK, boomer" is a disparaging comment currently popular with millennials referring to baby boomers. As a boomer, I have to admit they have some legitimate beefs. One is climate change.
Boomers by and large have been part of the problem and have not necessarily been a force for change. Individuals can minimize their carbon footprint, but that is not enough. Catastrophic changes are predicted if we don't do something significant now. Sweeping government policies are needed.
We are all aware that the fool residing in the White House is a climate change denier. It is clear we must elect someone else in 2020 to address climate change. We have no time to waste. I recently heard the suggestion that all boomers be required to write a letter to their grandchildren spelling out what they did to address climate change.
OK, boomers, what would you write?

Texto completo: Man charged with killing 4: I don't remember assault
NEW YORK - A homeless man charged in the beating deaths of four men as they slept on New York City streets says he has no memory of the assault.
"I was looking for bottles for cash," Randy Santos told The New York Times in a jail interview published Monday. "I needed the money because I was living on the streets and at an abandoned building. That's all I remember."
Santos, 24, has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges, but prosecutors have said he told police that he committed the killings in Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood on Oct. 5.
Man charged with making explosives tutorial for terrorists
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Authorities say a man who moved from Florida to Virginia earlier this year was trying to support the Islamic State terrorist group by posting a video online for making explosives.
The Florida Times-Union reports that 30-year-old Romeo Xavier Langhorne is charged with attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and faces up to 20 years in prison.

Open Phones Made U.S. An Open Book to Russia

Texto completo: American officials expressed wonderment that Rudolph W. Giuliani was running his "irregular channel" of diplomacy over open cell lines and communications apps penetrated by the Russians.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor at the center of the impeachment investigation into the conduct of Ukraine policy, makes a living selling cybersecurity advice through his companies. President Trump even named him the administration's first informal "cybersecurity adviser."
But inside the National Security Council, officials expressed wonderment that Mr. Giuliani was running his "irregular channel" of Ukraine diplomacy over open cell lines and communications apps in Ukraine that the Russians have deeply penetrated.
In his testimony to the House impeachment inquiry, Tim Morrison, who is leaving as the National Security Council's head of Europe and Russia, recalled expressing astonishment to William B. Taylor Jr., who was sitting in as the chief American diplomat in Ukraine, that the leaders of the "irregular channel" seemed to have little concern about revealing their conversations to Moscow.
"He and I discussed a lack of, shall we say, OPSEC, that much of Rudy's discussions were happening over an unclassified cellphone or, perhaps as bad, WhatsApp messages, and therefore you can only imagine who else knew about them," Mr. Morrison testified. OPSEC is the government's shorthand for operational security.
He added: "I remember being focused on the fact that there were text messages, the fact that Rudy was having all of these phone calls over unclassified media," he added. "And I found that to be highly problematic and indicative of someone who didn't really understand how national security processes are run."
WhatsApp notes that its traffic is encrypted, meaning that even if it is intercepted in transit, it is of little use -- which is why intelligence agencies, including the Russians, are working diligently to get inside phones to read the messages after they are deciphered.
But far less challenging is figuring out the message of Mr. Giuliani's partner, Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, who held an open cellphone conversation with Mr. Trump from a restaurant in Ukraine, apparently loud enough for his table mates to overhear. And Mr. Trump's own cellphone use has led American intelligence officials to conclude that the Chinese -- with whom he is negotiating a huge trade deal, among other sensitive topics -- are doubtless privy to the president's conversations.
But Ukraine is a particularly acute case. It is the country where the Russians have so deeply compromised the communications network that in 2014 they posted on the internet conversations between a top Obama administration diplomat, Victoria Nuland, and the United States ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Geoffrey R. Pyatt. Their intent was to portray the Americans -- not entirely inaccurately -- as trying to manage the ouster of a corrupt, pro-Russian president of Ukraine.
The incident made Ms. Nuland, who left the State Department soon after Mr. Trump's election, "Patient Zero" in the Russian information-warfare campaign against the United States, before Moscow's interference in the American presidential election.
But it also served as a warning that if you go to Ukraine, stay off communications networks that Moscow wired.
That advice would seem to apply especially to Mr. Giuliani, who speaks around the world on cybersecurity issues. Ukraine was the petri dish for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the place where he practiced the art of trying to change vote counts, initiating information warfare and, in two celebrated incidents, turning out the lights in parts of the country.
Mr. Giuliani, impeachment investigators were told, was Mr. Trump's interlocutor with the new Ukrainian government about opening investigations into the president's political opponents. The simultaneous suspension of $ 391 million in military aid to Ukraine, which some have testified was on Mr. Trump's orders, fulfilled Moscow's deepest wish at a moment of ground war in eastern Ukraine, and a daily, grinding cyberwar in the capital.
It remains unknown why the Russians have not made any of these conversations public, assuming they possess them. But inside the intelligence agencies, the motives of Russian intelligence officers is a subject of heated speculation.
A former senior American intelligence official speculated that one explanation is that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Sondland were essentially doing the Russians' work for them. Holding up military aid -- for whatever reason -- assists the Russian "gray war" in eastern Ukraine and sows doubts in Kyiv, also known as Kiev in the Russian transliteration, that the United States is wholly supportive of Ukraine, a fear that many State Department and National Security Council officials have expressed in testimony.
But Mr. Giuliani also was stoking an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Mr. Putin has engaged in, suggesting that someone besides Russia -- in this telling, Ukrainian hackers who now supposedly possess a server that once belonged to the Democratic National Committee -- was responsible for the hacking that ran from 2015 to 2016.
Mr. Trump raised this possibility in his July 25 phone call with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. It was not the first time he had cast doubt on Russia's involvement: In a call to a New York Times reporter moments after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time in Hamburg, Germany, in 2017, Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Putin's view that Russia is so good at cyberoperations that it would have never been caught. "That makes sense, doesn't it?" he asked.
He expressed doubts again in 2018, in a news conference with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland. That was only days after the Justice Department indicted a dozen Russian intelligence officers for their role in the hack; the administration will not say if it now believes that indictment was flawed because there is evidence that Ukranians were responsible.
Whether or not he believes Ukraine was involved, Mr. Giuliani certainly understood the risks of talking on open lines, particularly in a country with an active cyberwar. As a former prosecutor, he knows what the United States and its adversaries can intercept. In more recent years, he has spoken around the world on cybersecurity challenges. And as the president's lawyer, he was a clear target.
Mr. Giuliani said in a phone interview Monday that nothing he talked about on the phone or in texts was classified. "All of my conversations, I can say uniformly, were on an unclassified basis," he said.
His findings about what happened in Ukraine were "generated from my own investigations" and had nothing to do with the United States government, he said, until he was asked to talk with Kurt D. Volker, then the special envoy for Ukraine, in a conversation that is now part of the impeachment investigation. Mr. Volker will testify in public on Tuesday.
Mr. Giuliani said that he never "conducted a shadow foreign policy, I conducted a defense of my client," Mr. Trump. "The State Department apparatchiks are all upset that I intervened at all," he said, adding that he was the victim of "wild accusations."
Mr. Sondland is almost as complex a case. While he is new to diplomacy, he is the owner of a boutique set of hotels and certainly is not unaware of cybersecurity threats, since the hotel industry is a major target, as Marriott learned a year ago.
But Mr. Sondland held a conversation with Mr. Trump last summer in a busy restaurant in Kyiv, surrounded by other American officials. Testimony indicates Mr. Trump's voice was loud enough for others at the table to hear.
But in testimony released Monday night, David Holmes, a veteran Foreign Service officer who is posted to the American Embassy in Kyiv, and who witnessed the phone call between the president and Mr. Sondland, suggested that the Russians heard it even if they were not out on the town that night.
Asked if there was a risk of the Russians listening in, Mr. Holmes said, "I believe at least two of the three, if not all three of the mobile networks are owned by Russian companies, or have significant stakes in those."
"We generally assume that mobile communications in Ukraine are being monitored," he said.

Texto completo: Readers say his regret is welcome but too little too late. Also: Dietary fats.
To the Editor:
Re "Bloomberg Says He Now Regrets 'Stop and Frisk"' (front page, Nov. 18):
Understandable as a political strategy, but not credible as a heartfelt apology.
It's too late and too facile, especially coming at a time when it serves Michael R. Bloomberg's electoral interests. Especially when he defended the tactic for years in the face of undeniable evidence that it was racist and illegal. He even said, "I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little."
As other New York City mayors have done, Mr. Bloomberg is paying the price for not restraining the Police Department's worst practices.

To the Editor:
Even if Michael R. Bloomberg's apology is genuine and most sincere, it would have been much more credible if he had offered it to a carefully selected group of black and Latino victims of his stop-and-frisk policy instead of to a gathering at the Christian Cultural Center, a black megachurch, in Brooklyn.
His response is difficult to accept, even for African-Americans like me who would like to believe him. It suggests an apparent insensitivity to how stop-and-frisk was reminiscent of the South African passbook laws during apartheid. Under those laws, it was compulsory for all black people over 16 to carry a passbook when in a white neighborhood.
Let's hope that Mr. Bloomberg recognizes that his apology is only a first baby step in accounting for his stop-and-frisk policy.

Let's Re-examine the Science of Dietary Fats
To the Editor:
"Why Diets Are Such a Mystery," by David S. Ludwig and Steven B. Heymsfield (Op-Ed, Nov. 14), rightly highlights the lack of funding for diet trials and notes that a dearth of such data may inhibit work by the expert committee currently reviewing the science for the next Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
In fact, many large, government-funded trials have been conducted but ignored, by all successive expert committees, since the guidelines' launch in 1980.
Most critically, no committee has ever directly reviewed the trials on saturated fats, on more than 25,000 trial participants in experiments lasting up to 12 years. These experiments conclusively demonstrated that when people replaced saturated fats with polyunsaturated vegetable oils (swapping butter for margarine, for instance), there was no reduction in cardiovascular or total mortality.
These major trials, which are the most rigorous evidence available on these fats, have been analyzed in 17 different reviews, concluding over all that there is little to no support for the government's continued caps on saturated fats.
Thus, while we wait for new funds for new diet trials, let's use the data we do have to provide science-based advice to the public.

Texto completo: FedEx paid no federal income tax in 2018.
The New York Times wants you to think that this fact is a stunning indictment of President Trump's Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which reduced the corporate tax rate to a globally competitive 21%, nearly the same as that of the European Union.
It's not. In fact, not only is it not a slight against FedEx for benefitting from the cuts, but as the delivery giant pointed out in a scathing response to the Times, it's a complete self-own.
In 2017, FedEx owed $1.5 billion in federal taxes, or a 34% effective tax rate. That same year, prior to any provision of the tax act going into effect, retorted Fred Smith, FedEx chairman and founder, the New York Times paid not one dime of federal taxes. (The Times did not dispute Smith's claim.)
In a scathing response to the Times report that FedEx slashed its tax bill without equivalently increasing its capital investment, Smith lambasted the hypocrisy of the Times.
"In 2018 the New York Times cut their capital investments nearly in half to $57 million, which equates to a rounding error when compared to the $6 billion of capital that FedEx invested in the U.S. economy that same year," Smith wrote. He then challenged Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger and the business section editor to publicly debate "federal tax policy and the relative societal benefits of business investments and the enormous intended benefits to the United States economy, especially lower and middle class earners."
Contrary to Smith's tease that the story was "factually inaccurate," the true crime of the Times piece was its apparently deliberate lack of context, which misinformed the reader. The point of the tax cut and reform measure was specifically to diminish tax considerations in business decisions. Nobody "owes" the economy anything in exchange for the tax cut they got. It's simply a non sequitur to judge a company in this manner based on what it does with its tax cut.
So no, FedEx's capital investment wasn't necessarily proportional to its tax cut, but the company created 58,000 new jobs in 2018, bringing its total employment to nearly a quarter-million. The Times paid zero taxes in 2017, and how many net jobs did it create? The answer appears to be 80.
Meanwhile, the Times criticizes FedEx for buying back billions of dollars in its stock in the short term. But there is ample evidence that stock buybacks prepare firms for sustained increases in investment. They also allowed shareholders, especially pensioners who suffered through the bad times when FedEx stock lost half its value during the financial crisis, to take profits.
Although the Times report clearly irked FedEx, Smith probably wouldn't wish to punish the New York Times with a tax increase. He advocated for the corporate tax cut in the first place because it benefits everyone, not just individual shareholders, through broad economic growth.
The value of FedEx isn't just in its share price, either. It comes in the form of innovation and reduced prices that benefit hundreds of millions of customers. The economic value of the Times may be a lot smaller, both as a private company and one that employs fewer people, but there's no doubt that the country is better off with a tax code that allows the Times to turn a profit while very modestly increasing employment.
Surely, the tax cut bill wasn't perfect. But it's time for us all, media naysayers included, to admit that a corporate tax cut that repatriated over $60 billion in profits in its first year, increased foreign investment, and pushed unemployment to its lowest rate in half a century is an unequivocal victory.

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Nov. 15, 2019 edition of the Inside the Dodgers newsletter. To receive the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
I broke the story of Andrew Toles’ promotion to the big leagues in the summer of 2016. One thing I didn’t include in any of my reporting at the time was this text message from a Dodgers staffer: “that could end poorly.”
The story of Toles’ career with the Dodgers hasn’t technically ended. He’s still under contract to the team, but he spent all of 2019 on the restricted list and did not play. The reason for his absence was never revealed; we only knew that Toles had the support of the organization while he was away. For a player who joined the team in a cloud of mystery, it was an appropriate fadeout to the decade.
The Dodgers were well aware of his question marks when they signed Toles as a minor league free agent. They knew Toles had been disciplined by two different college programs — kicked off the University of Tennessee baseball team in 2011 and suspended by Chipola College in 2012. They knew the Tampa Bay Rays expelled Toles from his Single-A team following a blow-up with his manager in May 2014. They knew all this because the GM who drafted and developed Toles with the Rays was none other than the Dodgers’ Andrew Friedman.
Toles’ second chance in professional baseball went much better than his first. Fast-tracked from Single-A to the majors in 2016, Toles slashed .314/.365/.505 in 48 regular season games. By October, he had ramrodded his way into the starting outfield. Toles started four of six NLCS games against the Cubs that year, going 6 for 13 (.462) with a pair of doubles. At 24 years old, Toles had made the leap from prospect, to failed prospect, to starting outfielder on a playoff team. The transformation landed him in the pages of the New York Times.
The following winter, the Dodgers jettisoned their de facto left fielder, Howie Kendrick, paving the way for Toles to seize regular playing time in 2017. However, a knee injury in May promptly ended his season. His absence on the field would have been more conspicuous without the emergence of Chris Taylor. Still, by 2018, Toles was healthy and competing for a job in spring training. There was a pathway for him to regain his standing on the depth chart.
By the final week of camp, Toles and Joc Pederson were in the running for the final outfield job. Pederson went 8 for 54 during the Cactus League season. Toles went 15 for 53. Pederson won the job anyway, and Toles began the season in Triple-A. There, a hamstring injury cost him two months. He batted .306 at Oklahoma City but never cracked a Dodger outfield rotation that now featured a rejuvenated Pederson and Matt Kemp, in addition to Chris Taylor, Kiké Hernandez and Yasiel Puig. On Sept. 29 in San Francisco, Toles singled and stole second base against the Giants. He hasn’t batted in a major league game since.
Judging only what he did on the field, Toles deserves some extolling. His postseason at-bats, limited though they were, look impressive in the context of the decade. His .792 regular-season OPS compares surprisingly well with the Dodgers’ other outfielders of the last 10 years. His effort in the outfield and on the bases was at least as impressive as hit bat. Ironically, Toles’ hard-nosed efforts landed him in the operating room and derailed his early promise perhaps as much as anything. Toles is still only 27 years old. But without knowing the substance of his off-the-field issue(s), it’s hard to say anything definitive about his future in baseball.
All we have for now are memories of one of the game’s best personalities, a talented athlete who offered tantalizing glimpses on the field. Who else points at a mean-mugging Chase Utley and says, unironically, “I wake up in the morning and I’m like, ‘how can I be like Chase Utley today?’ ” Who else admits he checked FanGraphs to see when he’d get called up from Triple-A? Who else, while being unable to walk, says (also unironically), “I’m pretty much healthy right now … besides my knee”? No one, that’s who. You can tell the story off the 2010s Dodger teams without Andrew Toles, but it wouldn’t be nearly as fun.

Texto completo: Readers disagree about whether political humor is a salve during difficult times or an unwelcome reminder.
To the Editor:
Re "Please, No More Trump Jokes," by Blayr Austin (Op-Ed, Nov. 12):
I am so tired of individuals attempting to be the arbiter of what is acceptable in the world of comedy. Ms. Austin seems to think that there should be an unofficial quota on how frequently the president should be the subject of today's humor. Would she try to silence Will Rogers, whose career was celebrated for his wit and criticisms of our nation's politicians? Or the brave efforts of the Smothers Brothers in the 1960s?
The time to stop mocking tyrants is never. To paraphrase the Beatles, the mockery President Trump gets is equal to the mockery he deserves.
Ken Ferber
Westlake Village, Calif.
To the Editor:
I agree that many of the jokes in comedy shows have been very shallow and lack any good punch lines. Routines usually end up being a bunch of insults hurled at different people, usually celebrities and politicians. Comedy should be a medium through which people can take their minds off daily stressors, and more than ever, politics has become one of those stressors.
The issue has become exceptionally bad in late-night shows, where it feels more like a news show and less like a talk show. As Blayr Austin said, we can appreciate that people such as Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah discuss important political issues. However, I feel that it has come to a point where these late-night shows are almost an extension of the news.
Jonathan Korsunskiy

To the Editor:
The belly laughs I get from the Trump jokes are the best possible medicine (if not the actual remedy) for the despair I, and many millions of others, are experiencing around this disaster of a president. And once I have exhausted myself with the belly laughs, I put on my determined citizen robe again and work toward a real civic-minded solution. Please, please, don't take our laughs away!
Lindsay A. Desrochers
Kapolei, Hawaii
To the Editor:
I agree that there should be no more Trump jokes simply because the danger posed by President Trump to the future of world civilization is not a proper subject for humor.

Texto completo: Auction watch * 1969 Ford Torino convertible, sold, $35,000: 1960s mid-size Fords aren’t usually sought after by collectors, but this Torino GT is exceptional for its condition and its original 390-cubic-inch V-8 mated to a four-speed manual transmission. The fact that it’s a convertible adds to the desirability. Interestingly, the car has a bench front seat, instead of the usual buckets.

Who am I?
To guess my secret identity, read the following clues.
1) I received a Ford scholarship and attended the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.
2) I was a designer with Ford for 40 years and was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame.
3) A string of successful designs beginning in the 1960s was topped by the Ford Taurus in 1986.
4) The New York Times called me one of the most influential designers since Harley Earl of General Motors.
5) After the Taurus, I headed up Ford’s global design organization and worked on the 2002 Thunderbird.
Answer at the end of this column.
Drawing board * The Lexus LF-SA concept: The brand’s first all-electric vehicle will reportedly launch in 2020 as a 2021 model. The four-passenger LF-SA is envisioned as an urban runabout and will use a new scalable platform that can support future Lexus and Toyota electric designs. It will also reportedly use solid-state batteries that deliver greater range and shorter charging times than current lithium-ion battery technology.
The Auto Doc Air gets into the braking system when the fluid-filled components are replaced. The result is a spongy pedal and ineffective, dangerous stopping performance. Getting the air out necessitates "bleeding," which involves opening the valves located on the wheel cylinders/brake calipers at each wheel, one at time, thereby forcing out the fluid and air with pressure from the brake pedal. Unless you have brake-shop equipment, this usually takes two people and the following oft overlooked tips. 1) Make sure the reservoir of fluid is full and that you have enough fluid to refill it often. 2) The person in the vehicle holds constant and steady pressure on the pedal. 3) Begin with the wheel farthest from the reservoir, usually the right rear. 4) Do not pump the pedal while a bleeder valve is open. Doing so sucks air back into the system. 5) Each time you bleed a line, refill the reservoir. Put the top back on the reservoir each time. 6) A clear plastic hose pressed over the bleeder screw will allow you to drain the fluid into a container instead of letting it run all over the parts and onto the ground.

Still stumped?
Jack Telnack’s idea of market research was to drive that Thunderbird around town and check out the public’s reaction.

Nicholas Kristof: Fox News is Trump’s shield against impeachment

Texto completo: When President Richard Nixon’s Watergate misconduct was being dissected before congressional committees in 1973 and 1974, Republican support for him collapsed because most Americans shared news sources and inhabited a similar political reality.
In short, facts mattered.
Aides to Nixon did propose to him a plan to create sympathetic television news coverage; Roger Ailes backed the idea; and it eventually evolved into Fox News. And today Fox gives President Donald Trump an important defense system that Nixon never had.
Fox was the most popular television network for watching the first day of impeachment hearings this past week, with 2.9 million viewers (57% more than CNN had), and Fox viewers encountered a very different hearing from the one seen by viewers of other channels.
With Rep. Adam Schiff on the screen, Fox News’ graphic declared in all caps: “TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY IMPLIED THAT SCHIFF HAS COMMITTED TREASON.” At a different moment, the screen warned: “9/26: SCHIFF PUBLICLY EXAGGERATED SUBSTANCE OF TRUMP-ZELENSKY CALL.”
Fox downplayed the news and undermined the witnesses. While Ambassador William Taylor was shown testifying, the Fox News screen graphic declared: “OCT 23: PRESIDENT TRUMP DISMISSED TAYLOR AS A “NEVER TRUMPER.” It also suggested his comments were, “TRIPLE HEARSAY.”
Researchers have found that Fox News isn’t very effective at informing Americans. A 2012 study by Fairleigh Dickinson University reported that watching Fox News had “a negative impact on people’s current events knowledge.”
The study found that those who regularly watched Fox News actually knew less about both domestic and international issues than those who watched no news at all. NPR listeners were particularly well-informed, the study found, but even people who got their news from a comedy program like “The Daily Show” — or who had no news source whatsoever — knew more about current events than Fox viewers.
That may be correlation rather than causation, but at the least it suggests that viewers of Fox News don’t actually learn much.
Yet if Fox News doesn’t inform citizens, it does sway their votes. Two Stanford scholars, Gregory J. Martin and Ali Yurukoglu, published a paper in American Economic Review in 2017 suggesting that without the network, the Republican share of the vote for president would have been 0.46 percentage points lower in 2000, 3.6 points lower in 2004 and 6.3 percentage points lower in 2008.
Let’s pause here to acknowledge that Fox News has some excellent reporters, and let me just say that I’m jealous of Chris Wallace’s interviewing skill. It’s unfair that the real Fox reporters are tainted by blowhards like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, who engage less in journalism than in presidential public relations.
There’s no easy solution at a time when we’re all so polarized, but we can try to stand up for democratic and journalistic norms. It’s of course true that I live in a glass house. I’ve made countless mistakes in my career, and The New York Times makes them almost every day.
Yet that shouldn’t have stopped us from criticizing Father Charles Coughlin’s anti-Semitic radio broadcasts in the 1930s, and it shouldn’t stop us today from pointing out that Fox regularly hands the microphone to a guest, Joseph DiGenova, who might have made Joe McCarthy blush with this absurd anti-Semitic rant: “There’s no doubt that George Soros controls a very large part of the career Foreign Service at the United States State Department.”
While Democrats feel victimized by Fox News and allies like Rush Limbaugh, it’s also true that this right-wing cocoon is a disservice to its own true believers — because it feeds them misinformation. We saw that in the Iraq War, when Fox News anticipated that troops would be welcomed with flowers and that the war would pay for itself.
Early in the invasion of Iraq in 2003, I spent a scary, violent day with U.S. troops, and that night we watched a feed of Fox News — and our jaws dropped as commentators ridiculed critics of the invasion and blithely insisted that Iraqis were welcoming us as heroes. The troops and I looked at each other in astonishment.
The right-wing media bubble and its conspiracy theories can even be lethal. During the 2009-10 swine flu epidemic, Democrats and Republicans initially expressed roughly equal concern. But then conservative commentators denounced the Obama administration’s calls for vaccination as a nefarious plot. Glenn Beck, then of Fox News, warned that he would do “the exact opposite” of what the administration recommended.
As a result, Democrats in the end were 50% more likely to seek vaccination than Republicans, according to the Journal of Health, Politics and Law. Some 18,000 people died in that flu epidemic, so it seems logical that some died because they believed Fox News.
I wonder if Fox viewers are again being misled when they watch Hannity celebrate the opening of the impeachment hearings as a victory for Trump and as “a lousy day for the corrupt, do-nothing-for-three-years radical extreme socialist Democrats.” That is, shall we say, a quixotic interpretation.
In the meantime, Fox News is aggressively defending Trump, joining in smears of public servants and playing a role in history that embarrasses many of us in journalism.

Texto completo: "Thank God for the deep state," declared former acting CIA chief John McLaughlin recently while appearing on a panel at George Mason University. A year ago, the deep state was routinely reviled as a figment of paranoid right-wingers' imagination. But much of the news media are now conferring the same sainthood on the deep state that was previously bestowed on special counsel Robert Mueller.
A New York Times article last month gushed that "over the last three weeks, the deep state has emerged from the shadows in the form of real live government officials, past and present ... and provided evidence that largely backs up the still-anonymous whistleblower" on President Donald Trump's phone call to the president of Ukraine.
Times columnist James Stewart declared: "There is a deep state, there is a bureaucracy in our country who has pledged to respect the Constitution, respect the rule of law ... protecting the American people."
Much of the news coverage of the Trump impeachment is following that storyline — even though it is as astonishing as an overheated Trump tweet.
Five years ago, Director John Brennan's CIA ignited what should have been a constitutional crisis when it was caught illegally spying upon the Senate Intelligence Committee, which was compiling a massive report on the CIA torture program. After 9/11, the CIA constructed an interrogation regime by "consulting Egyptian and Saudi intelligence officials and copying Soviet interrogation methods," The Times reported in 2007. Secret Bush administration torture memos "set the CIA loose to slam suspects' heads into walls up to 30 times in a row, to deprive suspects of sleep for more than a week straight, to confine them to small dark boxes for hours at a time ... and to suffocate them with water to induce the perception that they are drowning," Georgetown University law professor David Cole noted. But the only official who went to prison was John Kiriakou, a former CIA operative who publicly admitted that the CIA was waterboarding.
Is the deep state more trustworthy when it is killing than when it is torturing?
Brennan declared in 2016 that "the president requires near certainty of no collateral damage" before approving a drone strike. Confidential CIA documents revealed that the CIA had little or no idea who it was killing most of the time with its drone attacks in Pakistan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Yemen and other nations. A Salon analysis, summarizing an NBC News report, noted, "Even while admitting that the identities of many killed by drones were not known, the CIA documents asserted that all those dead were enemy combatants. Lying about drone killings quickly became institutionalized throughout the deep state. The Times reported in 2015: "Every independent investigation of the (drone) strikes has found far more civilian casualties than administration officials admit."
The deep state is practically designed to destroy privacy that enables government officials to deny illegalities. The National Security Agency's credibility was obliterated in 2013 when former NSA analyst Edward Snowden revealed that the agency can tap almost any cellphone in the world, access anyone's email and web-browsing history and crack the vast majority of computer encryption.
Trump's version of his call to the Ukraine president has been challenged in closed testimony to the House Intelligence Committee by Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the Ukrainian-born officer who listened in to the call while serving on the National Security Council.
There are plenty of honorable, upright military officers, but the Pentagon per se has little as much credibility as a second-term congressman. In the post 9/11 era, Pentagon officials deluged the news media with false progress claims on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, perennially covered up killings of civilians, and also sought to bury their own torture scandal (revealed in a neglected 2008 report by a Senate investigation co-chaired by John McCain).
It is worse than naive to expect the deep state to provide an antidote to the venality of American politics. The agencies now being exalted have some of the longest records of deceit and crimes.
The Trump-deep state clash is a showdown between a presidency that has become far too powerful versus federal agencies that have become fiefdoms that enjoy immunity for almost any and all abuses. Regardless of the outcome of the congressional impeachment investigation, can the political system pull in the reins on imperious agencies? It is unlikely.

Blumenthal advocates for animal welfare

Texto completo: It seems often that Washington, D.C., is not a single city, but two different planets. Depending on your political orientation, impeachment is a long overdue redress of presidential misconduct or it's a calculated attempt to overturn a national election. Tax cuts are a giveaway to the wealthiest families and business or a jump-start to the economy. Background checks are a sensible way to prevent shooting sprees or a first attempt to disarm the nation.
But there is less-noticed story arc coming out of Washington: Congress gets a few things done, and there are still some examples of shared values in our nation. One of those areas has been animal welfare. And U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut has been in the forefront of this effort.
Since his election in 2010, he's been the single most important and successful legislative architect of creating and upgrading our federal anti-cruelty laws. His latest success came last week, when he teamed up with U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to pass the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act, which establishes a federal anti-cruelty law for the first time in our republic's history.
On its way to the president for signing, the PACT Act builds on a 2010 statute that bars the sale of videos showing illegal acts of animal cruelty. Specifically, PACT would make it a federal crime to torture an animal in cases where acts of intentional cruelty affect interstate or foreign commerce, on federal property, or "in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States." It also makes it a federal crime to engage in sexual exploitation of animals; Hawaii, New Mexico, West Virginia and Wyoming have no laws banning bestiality.
In the last five years, he's also led efforts to pass two upgrades of our federal law against animal fighting. Last December, with Senators Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, he succeeded in adding an anti-animal fighting amendment to the Farm Bill - in that case, to apply all prohibitions against cockfighting and dogfighting to the U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands).
Just two weeks ago, a U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico affirmed that the law does ban cockfighting in all five U.S. territories, none of which have enacted territorial bans on the blood sport. There are 71 cockfighting arenas operating in Puerto Rico alone, and there are dozens in the other territories. That means that Blumenthal's upgrade of the law is one of the most consequential animal protection laws passed in recent decades. The federal animal fighting law takes full effect on Dec. 20, and the territories are obligated under the law to stop raising tens of thousands of fighting birds and shutter dozens of fighting arenas.
Five years earlier, Blumenthal was the author of a bill to make it a federal crime to attend or bring a minor to a dogfight or cockfight. This legislation allows the federal government to crack down on the entire cast of characters involved, since spectators represent the vast majority of people at these spectacles. It's their participation that fuels the industry and makes it profitable.
If you think animal fighting is a settled matter, just look at Monterey County, Calif. A grand jury there recently determined that there are 1,000 backyard cockfighting operations in that jurisdiction alone. Indeed, if you drive around rural reaches of the United States, you'll see large colonies of roosters tied to A-frame huts or to barrels; these are birds raised for cockfighting. There are millions of birds now being raised for fighting in the U.S. Two million, 5 million, 25 million? Nobody quite knows, but it's happening on a quasi-agricultural scale.
We cannot hope to break down malicious cruelty and organized animal fighting syndicates without a strong legal framework forbidding that conduct. Laws against animal cruelty are, in the best case, essential antecedents to enforcement of them.
We are most grateful to Senator Blumenthal for leading the national fight against animal cruelty. He knows that cruelty to animals is wrong, and it's typically tangled up with other forms of violent social behavior in our communities.
Wayne Pacelle, a native of New Haven and a graduate of Yale, is the founder of Animal Wellness Action and the author of "The Bond" and "The Humane Economy," both New York Times bestsellers.

Installation shows affirming view of black Americans

Texto completo: At this year's Venice Biennale, Wadsworth Atheneum contemporary art curator Patricia Hickson was impressed with Kahlil Joseph's two-channel video installation "BLKNWS." She also was impressed by those watching the installation: They wouldn't get up to leave.
Visitors to Joseph's exhibit at the Hartford art museum will understand. The temptation is strong to sit in the darkened gallery much longer than originally planned, wondering where Joseph will go next. The progressive collection of images about black American lives is magnetic and thought-provoking.
The images include viral videos, reproductions of newspaper stories, historical footage or stills and segments filmed specifically for BLKNWS. Each segment is 30 seconds to six minutes long and proceed one after the other, frequently broken up by the logo BLKNWS.
Hickson describes the premise:
"All you ever see about the black community on the news is bad, stories about violence and stuff. This black news program is affirmative to the black community."
The fleeting images celebrate intellectuals, artists, writers, Civil Rights heroes, athletes and historical trailblazers as well as the nobility of common folks.
FYI: BLKNWS has no set running time. You could sit in that black-box screening room for hours.
"The video has a hard-wired connection to [Joseph's] studio in LA. He's constantly updating it as news hits the airwaves," Hickson says. "It continually changes every week. There's no telling how long it is."
BLKNWS is the latest exhibit in the museum's long-running MATRIX contemporary-art series. Joseph originally created BLKNWS as a potential cable-news program focusing on historical and contemporary issues important to African-American viewers, alongside issues important to all viewers, most notably climate change.
No cable networks took him up on it, which is how BLKNWS wound up at the Biennale, where it was a big hit, followed by art festivals and museums.
Since there's no set beginning and end, viewers can enter the screening room at any time, sit down and become immersed in Joseph's world, whose headlines and images flow from one topic to another:
*A photo of a young man in a mortarboard and graduation robe, headlined "A teenager with promise," and placed on the cover of the New York Times.
*A clip from the 1991 film drama "Boyz N the Hood," by John Singleton, the first African American to be nominated for a best director Oscar.
*An elected official, Mariah Parker of Georgia, being sworn in with her hand not on a Bible but on a copy of "The Autobiography of Malcolm X."
*A video of a black family singing during a road trip, and other videos showing black families playing and hugging.
*A segment of Childish Gambino's music video, "This is America."
*A segment of Langston Hughes' poem "The Negro Speaks of Rivers": "I've known rivers. I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins. My soul has grown deep like the rivers."
*A clip of a Michael Che standup routine: "Black lives matter, not matter more than you, just matter."
*A headline "Congolese doctor wins Nobel Peace Prize" next to a photo of that doctor, Denis Mukwege.
*A clip of intellectual Cornel West discussing economics.
*A headline: "Sean Combs buys Kerry James Marshall painting in record bid," over a story about how the music mogul paid $21.1 million for an artwork, the most ever paid for a work by a living African American artist.
*Segments focusing on the Yoruba Ifa religion, which is growing in popularity in the United States
*A photo of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who once described her Puerto Rican community "We are black, we are indigenous, we are Spanish, we are European."
And many, many more, too numerous to list, probably too numerous for any one person to digest in one sitting, and being added to all the time.
Filmed segments with Ifa priestess Trifari Williams, comedian Alzo Slade, artist Henry Taylor, actress Amandla Stenberg and others appear in segments specially filmed for BLKNWS, to give the "news network" an "anchor desk." A text crawl across the bottom of the screens mimic the "breaking news" feeds on television networks.
The two video screens are framed by a mural-sized reproduction of a historical photo of the Harlem Hellfighters, a WWI African-American military unit, whose heroism in battle went unappreciated by their racist communities when they returned home. BLKNWS is a fitting complement to "Afrocosmologies," the huge exhibit of black American art that is in the museum until Jan. 20, 2020.
Two other video exhibits
Two other noteworthy exhibits in Connecticut museums focus on the moving image.
AtNew Britain Museum of American Art, Bill Viola's The Raft shows 19 men and women, a variety of races and ages, standing and waiting for ... something. A bus maybe? Some are suspicious. A white woman clutches her purse protectively when an Asian woman looks at her. Two people read as if to ward off conversation. The people rarely look into each other's eyes, even if they are facing each other. Suddenly, their alienation is rendered meaningless by an unexpected event. "The Raft," inspired by Théodore Géricault's 1818-19 painting "The Raft of the Medusa," is on view until Jan. 5. The museum is at 56 Lexington St. nbmaa.org.
Migrating Worlds: The Art of the Moving Image in Britain is the first exhibit at Yale Center for British Art dedicated exclusively to film. The features work by British video-art notables including Theo Eshetu, Isaac Julien, Zino Saro-Wiwa, Zineb Sedira, John Smith, Alia Syed, Rosalind Nashashibi and Charlotte Prodger. Nashashibi's and Prodger's films are not in the gallery with the other films, but are being screened in the lecture hall. Check the schedule and plan your visit accordingly. The exhibit is up until Dec. 29. The museum is at 1080 Chapel St. in New Haven. Screening schedule: britishart.yale.edu.
KAHLIL JOSEPH: MATRIX 183: BLKNWSis at Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, 600 Main St. in Hartford, until March 1, 2020. Some of Kahlil Joseph's short films and videos - including work starring Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar and Alice Smith - will be shown on Jan. 18, 2020, in the Aetna Theater at the museum. A reception will begin at 5 p.m., the screening at 6 p.m. and a conversation with Helen Molesworth at 7 p.m. Admission is free. thewadsworth.org.

Kentucky detectives make arrest in 1978 rape case
PARK HILLS, Ky. — Authorities in Kentucky say they've arrested a man who raped a woman in 1978 and who may be responsible for other crimes.
News outlets report 77-year-old Michael Dean Tate was charged Thursday with rape, sodomy and kidnapping.
In October 1978, a woman told Park Hills police that a man grabbed her throat as she exited her car. She says he then kidnapped and raped her.
Boone County detectives Timothy Adams and Coy Cox reopened the case in 2017 while investigating a similar unsolved murder.
Adams and Cox ran fingerprints from the case, which matched Tate's.
The pair interviewed Tate in Union City, Ga., where authorities say he confessed to the rape and other sexual assaults.
Tate is awaiting extradition to Kentucky. It's unclear whether he has an attorney.
Border Patrol agent shoots Russian man in Arizona
LUKEVILLE, Ariz. — The U.S. Border Patrol says an agent shot and wounded a Russian man suspected of crossing the border illegally in Arizona.
The agency said Friday that the man was flown to a Phoenix hospital and is expected to survive.
The Border Patrol says the unidentified agent attempted to arrest the man Thursday just east of the border town Lukeville.
Authorities say a physical altercation followed and the agent shot the man. The agent was not seriously injured.
The Border Patrol has faced criticism over its use of force in the past, but the number of shootings has fallen over the past few years.
Earlier this month, an agent shot and killed a gunman who opened fire near Sunland Park, N.M.
Library cancels drag queen event after violent threats
MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — A West Virginia library says violent threats prompted it to cancel an event where drag queens were going to read to children.
The Morgantown Public Library System announced it was canceling its Drag Queen Story Time event in a Facebook post Friday.
The statement cited “multiple threats of violence against the volunteer readers” as the reason for the cancellation. A voicemail left at the library wasn't immediately returned.
The library's statement says it “remains committed to fostering a love of reading for all ages” and will instead have its staffers read for the event this morning.
Bloomberg pouring $100M in anti-Trump ad campaign
NEW YORK — New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who is deciding whether to launch a Democratic presidential bid, is pouring $100 million into an online advertising campaign attacking President Donald Trump.
The campaign, which targets voters in four general election battleground states — Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — began running on Friday, according to Bloomberg spokesman Jason Schechter.
News of the massive investment was first reported by The New York Times. The former New York City mayor has already filed paperwork in at least two states to appear on presidential primary ballots.
Bloomberg himself is not featured in the ad campaign.
One example of a new ad: An image of Trump's Twitter account that says, “A TWEET SHOULDN'T THREATEN OUR COUNTRY'S SECURITY.”
9-year-old boy catches massive blue catfish in N.M.
ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. — He caught a fish “this” big. No, really.
A 9-year-old New Mexico boy landed a 42-pound blue catfish Sunday evening while fishing in the Elephant Butte Reservoir.
Kris Flores said his son, Alex, made the big catch by himself and shattered dad's record of reeling in a 36-pound fish.
Flores says the fourth grader named the fish Wailord after the Pokemon character. The father says his son released the fish back into the reservoir after taking some photos and videos.
The biggest fish ever reportedly caught in Elephant Butte history was 78 pounds.
Arizona's tiny desert owl has new chance for protection
PHOENIX — Environmental groups say a tiny desert owl that makes its nest inside cavities of Arizona's saguaro cactus has a new chance for federal protection.
The Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity said Thursday an Aug. 5, 2021, deadline is set for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to decide if the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl should be protected again as an endangered species.
The owl lives in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, the neighboring Mexican state of Sonora and southern Texas.
The pygmy owl was protected as an endangered species from 1997 to 2006, but lost that status following a developer's lawsuit that resulted in the protection's removal. The center and Defenders of Wildlife filed a new court petition in 2007 to restore the endangered status

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Steve King tweeted out photos of a person he believes could be the whistleblower behind the recent impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukraine.
The Iowa Republican posted photos to Twitter of a man standing with various Democratic politicians, including Hillary Clinton, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren. King wrote the photos "are four strong clues" about the whistleblower's identity.
That tweet was later deleted and replaced with another post that included three photos of a man's face. Along with the photos, King tweeted that he does not know the whistleblower's identity, but the photos are "a better clue."
"Adam Schiff said, 'I do not know the identity of the whistleblower.' Me either, but @RepAdamSchiff here's a better clue."
Some Republicans have suggested that Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has met personally with the whistleblower. On Wednesday, Schiff denied knowing the identity of the person who made the report.
Conservatives' push to reveal the whistleblower's identity comes as the U.S. House of Representatives launched its first week of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. Renewed talks of impeachment started after an anonymous report was filed alleging Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.
The whistleblower's identity has not been officially revealed or verified, despite calls from the president and conservative allies to make it public. Numerous conservative websites and social media accounts claim to know the identity of the whistleblower.
King's office did not respond to requests for comment about his Twitter posts or the relationship between the man in the photographs and the whistleblower case.
Federal laws provide protections to whistleblowers. It's unclear what consequences King could face if his tweets have revealed the person who made the report.
King is not the only Republican in Congress who has made allegations about the identity of the whistleblower. U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, retweeted King's original tweet showing four photos of the alleged whistleblower.
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul shared the name of a person he believes could be the whistleblower on a conservative talk radio show Wednesday. The person "needs to be pulled in for testimony" to clarify whether they are indeed the whistleblower, Paul said.
The organization employing the person pictured on King's social media also released a statement that King was circulating false information.
This isn't King's first time weighing in on the impeachment process. Last month, he joined other Republican House members in a protest over the secrecy of impeachment inquiry testimony by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees.
King does not sit on any House committees. He was removed from his assignments by House Republicans after comments he made to the New York Times about white nationalism and white supremacy.
Iowa's Republican U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst have said politicians should not try to reveal the identity of the whistleblower, in accordance with federal law. In a call with reporters in November, Grassley argued that the whistleblower's identity does not matter as impeachment hearings proceed.
"I don't know whether the whistleblower's very darn important when what the president has done in two instances: one, released the whistleblowers' comments and, secondly, released the transcript of the telephone call with the president of Ukraine," Grassley said.

Taylor Swifts Escalates Battle Over Song Rights

Texto completo: The singer said in a post on Tumblr that her old label was blocking her use of certain songs, and she asked her fans to get involved.
After a few months of public détente, a bitter fight between some of the music industry's most powerful figures was ratcheted up again on Thursday night when Taylor Swift called on her fervent army of fans to express their displeasure with the men she said were controlling her most recognizable music.
In a note posted to Tumblr, and then across the rest of her millions-strong social media channels, Swift said that she was being blocked from performing her old songs at an awards show, as well as from using them in a coming Netflix documentary, by the executives who own the master recordings for her first six multiplatinum albums.
Big Machine Label Group, the Nashville-based home of Swift's music for more than a decade, said in a statement on Friday that it was shocked by the singer's claims and that it had "continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate."
The move by Swift, one of pop's biggest and most carefully calibrated stars, yet again brought typically opaque industry negotiations into the open. Her followers promptly made #IStandWithTaylor the top trend on Twitter as some shared what they said was the personal information of her named rivals.
The escalating battle -- a sort of chess game of contract maneuvers and public relations -- started over the summer, when Swift spoke out against the music manager and entrepreneur Scooter Braun after he announced his company's purchase of Big Machine.
Braun -- who once managed the noted Swift adversary Kanye West -- was a bully, the singer said, and in teaming with the Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta, who signed Swift when she was 15, the pair would partially dictate her musical legacy. (Borchetta countered that Swift had been offered a new deal at Big Machine that would have allowed her to eventually own her recordings; Swift instead signed to a new label last year, and stipulated that she will own her masters there.)
Stars like Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj and the K-pop group BTS have aggressive online fan communities that frequently attack perceived enemies online, for slights real or imagined. On Thursday, Swift effectively weaponized her following, calling explicitly for her fans to "help" by letting Borchetta and Braun "know how you feel about this," and by asking her followers to lean on artists managed by Braun, whose roster includes Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande. While thousands of Swifties, as her supporters are known, shared messages of solidarity for the singer and even circulated a Change.org petition ("Let Taylor Swift perform/use HER art"), Twitter was also forced to delete multiple posts that it said violated its rules by purporting to share Braun and Borchetta's phone numbers.
Swift's call to action did not stop there: She also invoked the private equity firm the Carlyle Group, a major investor in Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings, that helped to fund the purchase of Big Machine, leading her followers to share information among themselves about the firm. Carlyle did not respond to a request for comment.
In the wake of the sale of the label, and ahead of her most recent album "Lover," Swift had said publicly that she would rerecord new versions of her old music in a workaround that would allow her to regain some control of the work. The singer said her contract with Big Machine allowed her to remake her first five albums beginning in November 2020.
"Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun have now said that I'm not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be rerecording my music before I'm allowed to next year," Swift wrote in her statement on Thursday.
Swift is scheduled to be named the artist of the decade at the American Music Awards on Nov. 24, with the show having promised "an epic, career-spanning performance."
It was not immediately clear how Swift's appearance at the awards would fall under the control of her former label. Typically, the only copyright issues in a live performance would have to do with her songwriting rights, which do not involve Big Machine.
"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the A.M.A.s," the label said. "In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere."
According to Susan C. Genco, a music industry executive and lecturer at the U.C.L.A. School of Law, it's possible that Big Machine could assert that Swift's performance would violate the label's contractual control of rerecordings, since viewers can save and replay the broadcast -- but this, she said, would be an unusual interpretation of typical contract terms.
"A label may have a technical argument that a taped television performance is a violation of those provisions," Genco said. "But it is certainly not the intent of the rerecord provision and, to my knowledge, not a position that a label has taken before."
She added: "It's definitely not an artist-friendly position."
The A.M.A.s did not respond to requests for comment.
Record companies generally retain rights to masters, which allow them to sell albums or license songs for commercial use, in exchange for the financial investment they make in an artist's career. But some stars, at the urging of musicians like Prince and Jay-Z, have used their leverage to gain ownership of their past work or negotiate for such control when signing new contracts.
In her post, Swift also announced for the first time that Netflix "has created a documentary about my life for the past few years," and said her former label had declined the use of older music or performance footage for the film.
Big Machine denied that it had tried to "block her Netflix special." Though the full picture of the negotiations was not clear, a representative for Swift provided The New York Times with an email dated Oct. 28 in which an executive from Big Machine said the company "will not agree to issue licenses for existing recordings or waivers of its rerecording restrictions in connection with" the Netflix documentary.
The two sides also invoked a dispute over what they said was millions of dollars, though they disagreed about who was contractually owed.
Swift wrote: "Scott Borchetta told my team that they'll allow me to use my music only if I do these things: If I agree to not rerecord copycat versions of my songs next year (which is something I'm both legally allowed to do and looking forward to) and also told my team that I need to stop talking about him and Scooter Braun."
The singer added that she hoped to raise awareness for other artists who did not control their work. "The message being sent to me is very clear," she wrote. "Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished."
"I've tried to work this out privately through my team but have not been able to resolve anything," she wrote.
Big Machine said that Swift's activation of her fan base "greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families," and addressed the singer directly in a call for further negotiations. "To date, not one of the invitations to speak with us and work through this has been accepted," the label said. "Rumors fester in the absence of communication. Let's not have that continue here. We share the collective goal of giving your fans the entertainment they both want and deserve."
Ben Sisario contributed reporting.

Save Earth’s little things and you save us all, including the Joshua tree

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

The Santa Clarita shooting doesn’t support liberal's gun control agenda

Texto completo: Tragedy struck again Thursday morning.
A 16-year-old at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, killed two of his classmates and injured three more. According to the New York Times, the shooter opened fire around 7:30 a.m., sparking terror in the community and causing irreparable damage before attempting to take his own life. This was yet another irrational shooting shocking the country. And, as is so often the case, liberals politicized it almost immediately.
The editorial board of the Los Angeles Times called for Second Amendment restrictions right after the news of the shooting broke, writing in a Thursday editorial that “There will certainly be an investigation... [b]ut in the end, the availability of the gun remains, and that is the root of our gun violence problem.” And an NBC News opinion piece took this one step further, shamelessly citing the incident — the bodies practically still warm — as an opportunity to “defeat the NRA.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal wasted no time before exploiting the tragedy, immediately invoking it in real-time after learning of the shooting halfway through a stump speech for gun control on the Senate floor. The Connecticut Democrat said, “As I speak on the floor right now, there is a school shooting. How can we turn the other way, how can we refuse to see that shooting in real-time, demanding our attention, requiring our action?” Sen. Kamala Harris echoed his sentiments. The California Democrat and 2020 contender called the tragedy “preventable,” as part of her broader push for Second Amendment restrictions. TweetTweet
Yet the immediate calls for gun control aren't just distasteful, they're entirely unsupported. It’s early, and more details are sure to emerge, but nothing about this shooting appears to support or vindicate any part of the Democrats’ gun control agenda.
For one, the shooter was only 16. That means it was illegal for him to purchase or own a firearm. The idea that more laws would have prevented a crazed actor from doing something, even though they already clearly evaded and trampled on the law, is simply nonsensical.
How would he have been stopped by a background check?
There’s no way a sick, disturbed, determined person would have been stopped by expanding background checks (which are already quite robust and cover almost 90% of gun purchases) when it would still inevitably be easy enough to have someone else purchase a firearm on their behalf, steal one, or buy one illegally on the black market.
So, too, the shooting, in this case, was carried out using a handgun. Bans on “assault weapons” wouldn’t have even made the gun in question illegal, let alone stopped the shooter from carrying out the attack. Unless Democrats are seriously willing to cross the bridge into banning all handguns, using this shooting to push their agenda is just shameless politics.
Plus, the Santa Clarita shooting happened in California, not exactly a Second Amendment free-for-all state. The Los Angeles Times almost reached self-awareness and realized that perhaps a shooting in the state with some of the most restrictive gun laws doesn’t quite support the addition of more gun laws … but ended up apparently not noticing this massive contradiction.
Their editorial noted, “This is the 39th mass shooting (that is, a shooting in which at least four people were wounded) in California this year, bringing the statewide total to 53 people killed and 158 injured. And this in a state with some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country.” It’s stunning to witness the mental gymnastics required for the Times to not realize they’ve just undercut their entire argument.
Let’s be clear: Liberals are telling you that more gun laws — which don’t actually apply to the specifics of this case at all — would have stopped a shooting in the state that already has one of the strictest gun control regimens. Right. They’ll have to do better than that if they want to make the case against our Second Amendment rights.

Charles M. Blow: This is not a game

Texto completo: On Wednesday the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump took place.
It was a somber moment. The country has not often inched up to this precipice, and for good reason.
The fact that we are here signals that the country got something horribly wrong. It elevated a man of poor character who did not keep faith with the country, but instead did something so egregious and offensive that lawmakers are forced to employ one of the Constitution’s greatest powers.
No, this was not a good day. But it was a necessary day.
It is a stress test for the country and its institutions. It will test whether a president with utter contempt for tradition, history, conventions and the rule of law itself can be reprimanded and chastened by the instruments of power as they now exist.
The notion that no one is above the law is being tested.
The thing is that Trump, knowingly or not, has been priming the country for this moment, weakening it for this moment. He has attacked vital institutions like the press. He has corroded the very idea of truth. He has snatched the souls from Republicans in Congress. And he has seeded the courts as much as possible with people who are likely to be more in line with his positions.
This impeachment will test whether the spell Trump cast can indeed be broken.
Setting the bar for success is important here. Ultimate removal from office is an awfully high bar, and it is hard for me to imagine the Senate clearing it. I’m not ruling it out completely. Absolute predictions are dangerous, particularly now.
On the other hand, what I’m most interested in is whether the truth can shine through some of the smoke and mirrors that the president and his enablers have established.
Trump, from the very beginning, has been overwhelming the public with lies and dissembling, while at the same time attacking society’s truth-seekers — journalists, investigators and jurists. Republicans in Washington, instead of pushing back and standing on principle, have simply followed suit. God only knows what happened to Lindsey Graham.
And Trump’s tactics have been informed and amplified by the misinformation organ that is Fox News and much of conservative talk radio.
At a time of hyper-partisanship, when people treat political parties like sports teams, when it is ever easier to exist in an information silo of like-mindedness, it is now possible to hear information that only affirms you and none that challenges you.
As such, people choosing to live in a Trump/Fox/Limbaugh world are unlikely to be altered by the truth because they are less likely to be exposed to the truth, the fullness of it, the unassailability of it.
But one hopes there are those whose blinders slip. One hopes that there are those somewhere in the middle still in possession of an open mind. One hopes that there are many whose sense of morality is greater than their sense of tribalism.
The bar, then, is whether some of these people reach a point during these hearings where they simply say, “Enough!” And that they do so on the facts and not on the theater of the moment.
Too much of today’s political culture, from the delivery of speeches to debate performance to testimony, is caught up in an “America’s Got Talent,” entertainment-quotient, viral-capacity sensibility. Nothing is genuine; everything is contrived.
But the truth, the cold hard fact, exists on a plane above all that. The truth is not ephemeral or fungible. The truth stands, strong and unyielding.
There was a time in my life when I believed — and thought that most other Americans believed — that the truth was all that mattered. That honesty and bravery were the hallmarks of good character and honorable leadership.
Somehow, somewhere, that got lost, particularly by Republicans in this country. Blind devotion to Trump blinded them to the truth.
On Wednesday, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and the State Department official George Kent testified in direct, unvarnished terms, revealing to the public what they had testified to behind closed doors: that Trump had attempted to extort the president of Ukraine into publicly declaring that he was opening an investigation in the Biden family and the 2016 election.
There is no real room to spin their testimony. They seemed to stick only to what they knew and repeatedly resisted being drawn into the politics of the process. These were career diplomats whose lives have been devoted to serving this country trying once more to defend it.
There was no insinuation, not even from the Republicans questioning them, that they were not being honest and forthright. The only criticism was that some of what they testified to they heard from others.
These men seemed to be telling the truth, and that’s the way that it reads.
At some point that has to matter again, even to partisans who don’t want to admit that they were wrong, even to those who hate the idea of conceding a victory to their political foes, even to those who get a druglike high out of anyone who can “own the libs.”
In the end, this is not a game. This is a tragedy. This is a mourning. This is an awakening. This is the moment where truth has to matter more than all else. That is the bar America has to clear.

Bloomberg will not save the Democrats

Texto completo: WARNING: Parts of this column may bear strong resemblance to my earlier columns when Michael Bloomberg toyed with running for president, because with Bloomberg, history has a way of repeating itself. Every four years, Michael Bloomberg hears something virtually no other American hears: a groundswell of support for a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy. Now, as the 2020 Democratic primaries rapidly approach, he’s hearing it again.
Bloomberg, a fairly successful mayor of New York and a fabulously successful businessman, has an estimated net worth of $52 billion. Without that fortune, nobody would be talking about a Bloomberg candidacy at this late date. But with his money, Bloomberg could self-finance a run from start to finish without ever having to ask a single donor for a penny. This time, Bloomberg, who in his political life has been a Democrat, a Republican, an independent and now a Democrat again, is setting a personal record by flirting twice in a single cycle. Last spring, there was a ripple of speculation about a 2020 Bloomberg candidacy. On March 5, Bloomberg put an end to it when he announced flatly, "I’m not running for president." Instead, he said, he would pour his energy and resources into a new climate change project called Beyond Carbon. Now, however, he has apparently moved beyond Beyond Carbon. Last week, The New York Times reported that Bloomberg is "actively preparing to enter the Democratic presidential primary."
Bloomberg is said to be concerned — and it is a legitimate concern — that the current Democratic field has moved too far left. But there is no indication that voters believe Bloomberg is the solution to the problem. This latest tease is too recent for any reliable polling — although one survey found Bloomberg with the highest negatives in the field — but in the past, he has never been a voter favorite outside the confines of New York City.
Bloomberg is being pressed into action by states with early primary filing deadlines. He has already placed his name on the ballot for the Alabama primary, and a short time later flew to Arkansas to file there. Alabama and Arkansas are fine, but what about Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — the first states to cast votes and award delegates? Bloomberg has apparently decided to blow them off.
Candidates in the past have sometimes tried to skip an early primary or caucus, but skipping all four at the beginning is a sure way to lose.
Bloomberg’s move is a symptom of Democratic anxiety. We’ve seen it before, in both parties. At the beginning of a primary season, with a big field of candidates starting the race, the party faithful say, "Isn’t this great? We have so many good candidates — almost an embarrassment of riches!" Then, after several months of campaigning, they say, "Can’t somebody enter this race and save us?"
The answer is no. The Democratic field is what it is. One of the candidates in the race right now will win the nomination, go on to face President Donald Trump, and have a chance to become the next president. There’s no savior waiting to rescue Democrats — and that includes Michael Bloomberg.

At the beginning of a primary season, with a big field of candidates starting the race, the party faithful say, "Isn’t this great? We have so many good candidates — almost an embarrassment of riches!" Then, after several months of campaigning, they say, "Can’t somebody enter this race and save us?"
The answer is no. The Democratic field is what it is. One of the candidates in the race right now will win the nomination, go on to face President Donald Trump, and have a chance to become the next president. There’s no savior waiting to rescue Democrats — and that includes Michael Bloomberg.

Texto completo: With another academic year churning on, many people, bemused by campus excitements -- trigger warnings, safe spaces, "bias response teams" in hot pursuit of the perpetrators of microaggressions -- wonder whether higher education has become a net subtraction from the nation's stock of reasonableness. Those who read The Chronicle of Higher Education, a window into that world, are not reassured.
In May, the Chronicle published a dyspeptic report by Andrew Kay, a Wisconsin writer, on this year's meeting of the Modern Language Association, whose members teach literature to a declining number of interested students. Kay says the number of English positions on the MLA job list has shrunk 55% since 2008, the number of University of Michigan English majors declined from 1,000 to 200 in eight years and adjunct (limited-term, non-tenure track) instructors now are a majority of college teachers.
Kay's villains are "the avarice of universities" and "politicians and pundits" who despise "humanistic thinking, which plainly threatens them." His disparagements implicitly enlarge and celebrate him as a threat to the villains.
He is nostalgic for the 1960s and 1970s, which "brought literary-critical methods to bear on every aspect of culture, from sexuality to disability." He is impervious to the possibility that his mentality, stocked with stereotypes and luxuriating in victimhood, might be a symptom of what repels students who care about actual literature more than "literary-critical" approaches to this and that.
Also in the Chronicle, Daniel Bessner of the University of Washington and Michael Brenes of Yale deplored without defining "the neoliberalization of the university system." The definition presumably is obvious to all inhabitants of the academic bubble, where "neoliberals" are disdained as respecters of market forces -- supply, demand, etc. Citing a 1972 New York Times report on "an oversupply of trained historians," they say "for nearly a half-century, historians have failed to organize to halt the disappearance of positions," which they blame on "unnecessary neoliberal austerity, corporatization, and adjunctification" and "boot-strappism and market-Darwinism."
Their jumble of jargon means: The fact that the supply of historians has outpaced the demand for history instruction is the fault of many things, but not of academic historians, who need to show "solidarity" to "overturn a patently unjust system" that offers "crummy and exploitative" jobs. Their message is clear: History doctorates are entitled to good academic positions regardless of the absence of a demand for their services. So perhaps the American Historical Association (and the MLA, the American Political Science Association, etc.) should wield its "labor power" by threatening to strike.
It is a plan only academics could concoct: Because there is weak and declining demand for our labor, we should coerce our adversaries (neoliberals, market-Darwinism, the law of supply and demand) by threatening to withdraw our labor.
In the Chronicle in March, the University of Washington's Bessner said we are in a "crisis of capitalism," by which he seemed to mean a shortage of jobs for people like him: left-wing academics. "Given that there are almost no tenure-track jobs, the majority of the next generation of intellectuals -- like my own generation -- will probably have to look outside the university for employment." To him, "intellectuals" denotes left-wing aspiring academics. Again, note the absence of self-examination, and the disregard of the possibility that there are fewer teaching jobs because fewer students are drawn to the study of literature, history and the rest of the humanities because of the way these subjects are taught.
This is a trans-Atlantic problem. The author of The Economist's Bagehot column notes that although the study of history -- and eminent historians -- "used to hold a central position in (Britain's) national life," the number of history students has declined 10% in a decade. Perhaps because "the historical profession has turned in on itself," with practitioners turning away from "great matters of state" and concentrating on "the marginal rather than the powerful, the poor rather than the rich, everyday life rather than Parliament." They "almost seem to be engaged in a race to discover the most marginalized subject imaginable." This reduces history's helpfulness as "a safeguard against myopia. Modernity shrinks time as well as space; people live in an eternal present of short-term stimuli and instant gratification."
Americans have a voracious appetite for serious historical writing. Note the robust demand for narratives and biographies by David McCullough, Ron Chernow, Rick Atkinson, Nathaniel Philbrick, Rick Brookhiser and many others who are not academics, who do not write about marginal subjects, and who do not tell the nation's story as a tale of embarrassments.

Bloomberg would make presidential race interesting

Texto completo: President Trump has been paranoid about Joe Biden, but he should be more nervous about the potential for Michael Bloomberg to be on the ballot opposite him next November.
Bloomberg quickly could become a Democratic front-runner if he enters the race, as it's been reported that he's expected to do.
Biden hasn't impressed. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are too far left for a lot of people, including me. I'm intrigued by Pete Buttigieg, but he is a bit green and I wonder if he eventually will fade as Beto O'Rourke did. Kamala Harris has impressed more than I anticipated.
Bloomberg, the former three-term New York City mayor, hasn't committed to running but filed paperwork last week to be on the primary ballot in Alabama, just in case.
While that primary isn't until March 3, it has the earliest filing deadline. The New York Times reported that Bloomberg intends to skip the first four primaries - Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina - and focus on larger states with more delegates.
Bloomberg's political experience is limited to his campaigns for mayor. He's spent big bucks to influence the outcome of elections, though, including about $100 million to support Democrats in last year's midterms.
He has tried to influence in other ways as well, including Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control organization he helped found and heavily funds. He is a United Nations special envoy for climate change and spoke at the U.N. Climate Action Summit in September.
In March, Bloomberg said he wouldn't run for president. He reportedly is changing his mind because he's disappointed with his party's performance so far. He's right about that. It hasn't been compelling.
Bloomberg, meanwhile, is riding high.
Everytown for Gun Safety played a big role in Democrats taking control of the state House and Senate in Virginia - home of the headquarters of the National Rifle Association.
Everytown spent $2.5 million to support candidates in those races, more than eight times the $300,000 spent by the NRA.
I think that got his juices flowing and made him want to get more involved.
Waiting until late in the game to get in is wise. Let the field thin out. Watch where the remaining candidates are scoring points, and where they are slipping up. Then stake out your ground.
I would like to see billionaire Bloomberg in debates with Warren and Sanders, whose campaigns have targeted wealth inequity. Warren already is painting him as trying to buy the presidency.
I specifically would like to see Bloomberg answer the question he posed to voters in a Washington Post op-ed last month:
"The presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren't up to the job."
Have you read the "Medicare for All" proposal from Warren? There are so many parts that it could take a decade to get them all in place, if she could ever get the support. I can't see that happening. It's a noble thought, but it's not practical. Let's look at other ideas to reform health care.
Bloomberg isn't a die-hard Democrat, which makes him an intriguing candidate for Democrats near the center of the political spectrum, and for Republican voters who don't like Trump.
He was a Democrat for most of his life, but he switched to Republican to run for mayor in 2001. He got the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose term was up.
Bloomberg switched to independent in 2007, and returned to Democrat last year prior to the midterm elections.
A significant position that Bloomberg took as mayor, "stop-and-frisk" policing, runs against Democratic values. He also supports charter schools, traditionally a Republican model of public education.
Bloomberg's wealth may turn off many Democrats. But that wealth also may give him the best chance to go toe-to-toe with Trump if he can win the primary.
Two old, rich, white New York men duking it out for the presidency isn't the most-ideal situation. But it might be the most competitive.

Texto completo: A documentary on the National Enquirer pays tribute to a halcyon era of dirt digging.
Shocker! Could even a tawdry supermarket tabloid be worthy of a gushy, nostalgic tribute? "Scandalous: The Untold Story of the National Enquirer," a documentary from Mark Landsman, presents The Enquirer as an unlikely haven of bona fide shoe-leather journalism, or at the very least a fun place to work, until -- in this telling -- David J. Pecker became the owner and sullied a halcyon tradition of dirt digging.
For much of the movie, former staff members share recollections of the scoops of yore, a period that encompassed paying an Elvis Presley relative to snap a photo of the deceased singer in his coffin and killing stories on Bob Hope and Bill Cosby in exchange for access. Occasionally, an interviewee acknowledges a pang of conscience. Tony Brenna, discussing Cathy Evelyn Smith, the "Florence Nightingale with a hypodermic syringe" ultimately imprisoned for her role in John Belushi's death, feels the paper crossed a line in befriending her to coax a quote.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Traditional reporters like Carl Bernstein and The New York Times's Maggie Haberman are used as foils to explain that, for instance, paying for information is wrong -- although Haberman notes that there are times when The Enquirer has gotten stories "really right." Landsman weaves in tales of the spadework that went into locating a photograph of O.J. Simpson in Bruno Magli shoes.
Landsman also traces the role The Enquirer may have played in Donald Trump's rise. Still, the various excuses made for The Enquirer's ethics undermine Landsman's efforts to portray the paper as splashy, all-American fun.

Authenticity Of Receipts From ISIS Splits Experts

Texto completo: A Times article based on documents recovered by a researcher reported that ISIS made payments to members of a rival group.
Questions have been raised about documents that seemed to indicate that the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was able to hide out in a hostile area of northwestern Syria because ISIS paid members of a rival jihadist group.
An independent Syria researcher, Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, said he believed that the documents, which were central to an article published in The New York Times on Oct. 30, had been forged.
The documents were provided to The Times by Asaad Almohammad, a retired American intelligence operative who is now a senior research fellow at the George Washington University Program on Extremism.
They purport to be receipts for payments made by the security branch of the Islamic State to members of Hurras al Din, a Syrian jihadist group known to be an enemy of ISIS. The receipts showed that the payments were for services like security and logistical expenses.
After The Times published its article, Mr. Almohammad published a report that also cited the receipts. He said he stood by their authenticity.
Mr. al-Tamimi, who had been asked by The Times to review four of the receipts, was cited in the article as vouching for their authenticity.
He has since reviewed all eight receipts and now says he believes they are forgeries. He concluded that although the receipts appear to be printed on original ISIS stationery, the handwritten information on them was most likely not authentic.
He noted that several of the receipts are dated in 2017, before Hurras al Din was known to have existed. He said part of receipts showing the location of the ISIS branch was whited out, raising questions about their provenance. And he said that a similarity in the handwriting on receipts that purport to have been written by two different people suggests they were written by the same person.
"Unfortunately, this only leads me to the conclusion that they are not authentic," Mr. al-Tamimi said.
Mr. Almohammad disagreed.
He said that his conclusions are supported not only by the receipts but by interviews with informers in Syria over a 16-month period. His research found that ISIS made a concerted effort to co-opt the rival group, Hurras al Din, starting in January 2017, more than a year before the group announced its formation.
Mr. Almohammad argued that had someone gone to the trouble of forging receipts, he would have been unlikely to date them before the time when Hurras al Din made that announcement. That date is readily available online.
He also rejected the assessment regarding the whited-out material on the receipts. The documents were retrieved by two different people in Syria who did not know each other, he said. "A forger could have kept the original names or added new ones," he said. "Scrubbing the original is hardly a smart thing to do for a forger."
As for the similarity in handwriting, Mr. Almohammad said all eight receipts had been issued under the same nom de guerre, which most likely belonged to the ISIS official charged with dispensing the funds. It is possible, he said, that the official filled out the entire receipt, including the portions attributed to the other signatories.
"Taken altogether, I have assessed that given the format, style, timing and sources, the receipts are highly likely to be authentic," Mr. Almohammad said. "Of course, you can never claim 100 percent verification without the signatories confirming, and even then questions will remain. This is the nature of this work."
Mr. al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader, was living in a zone where Hurras al Din operates, in Idlib Province, as far back as July, according to American officials. He died at his compound there last month during a raid by American Special Operations forces.

Risking Lives in Endless Wars is Morally Wrong

Texto completo: Headnote Guest Columnist
We just celebrated Veterans Day, paying tribute to the young men and women who have served our country. Across the country, families gathered at the gravesites of those who gave their lives. Veterans drank toasts to their fellow soldiers.
In football and basketball stadiums, crowds offered a moment of silence for the fallen. The rituals are heartfelt, but far from complete.
Too often ignored is the far greater number of lives that are lost not on the battlefield but at home, not from the enemy's guns but from our veterans' own hands.
Now, in the sober aftermath of the celebration, there should be a reckoning.
On an average day, a staggering 20 veterans commit suicide. The deaths from suicide outnumber the losses on the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The risk to veterans who served in combat holds true for all generations.
It doesn't matter if the war is popular or unpopular; the veterans celebrated or controversial.
Even the Greatest Generation that fought in World War II suffers current suicide rates four times that of civilians.
In a stunning essay, Matthew Hoh, an Iraqi veteran who came close to suicide himself, tries to put this in perspective.
The famous Vietnam Memorial, he writes, "is a wall that contains 58,000 names. It would have to lengthened by some 2,000 feet to include the 100,000 to 200,000 plus Vietnam vets who are estimated to have been lost to suicide, while keeping space for those yet to come. VA data reveals that almost two Afghan and Iraq veterans the by suicide each day on average. That adds to an estimated 7,300 veterans who have killed themselves since just 2009, after coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq, a number greater than the 7,012 service members killed in those wars since 2001."
The military is aware of the depth of this horror and has dedicated a billion dollars in trying to solve it.
The New York Times reports that the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) is incredibly active, staffed 24/7 at 800-273-8255. This service, only available since 2007, has helped stave off hundreds of thousands of potential suicides.
More than 30 times a day, VCL responders call police, fire or EMS to intervene in a suicide situation.
Thirty times a day.
There are many explanations offered for why veterans - and the families of veterans - are at greater risk of suicide: the difficulty of readjusting to civilian society; the macho military culture that keeps soldiers from seeking help; the post-traumatic stress disorders that result from combat.
Hoh, wisely in my view, offers a broader explanation: that veterans suffer from a moral injury - a shock to their own sense of themselves, their basic moral values from what they have done or have not done in combat: The killing of the enemy, the failure to save the life of a comrade, the mistaken shooting of the innocent.
Thou shalt not kill is a basic precept of all religions.
In war, the state gives soldiers the mandate to kill. The military has perfected ways of conditioning young men and women to be able to kill in combat.
Yet, Hoh argues, the conditioning does not prevent some from seeing themselves in the enemy, from feeling deeply the violation that comes from violence.
There is a lesson from this.
We should reject the easy assumption that the U.S. military should police the world, that we've perfected ways of fighting wars with drones and air power and with limited U.S. casualties from "boots on the ground."
The national security managers who too often have never served in the military should be far more constrained in sending our soldiers into combat.
War is hell. It is hell for those who fall in combat - and for their families and friends suffering their loss. It is hell for those who survive it - and for their families and friends dealing with their struggles on return.
Risking lives constantly in endless wars is a moral violation and strategic failure.
If we are truly to celebrate the service of our veterans, we should demand that war not be a routine part of American policy, but a last resort used rarely and only to defend our people when attacked.
The best tribute to our combat veterans would be to create fewer of them in the future.

Hunger and poverty

Texto completo: President Donald J. Trump bragged recently that the economy was the best ever. Unemployment is the lowest in 50 years, he says. Black and Hispanic unemployment is the lowest since unemployment statistical measurement of those groups started in the 1960s. His political strength, he says, is among white working people, especially in the south where he polls the best.
There is some truth in what the President says. However, behind those statements lies a bitter truth that the President never mentions.
"More than 37 million Americans live in households that struggle against hunger...Nearly one in seven households with children cannot buy enough food for their families...The rates of food insecurity were much higher for households headed by African Americans (21.2 percent - two and a half times the rate for white non-Hispanic households) and Hispanics (16.2 percent - two times the rate for white non-Hispanic households)...The food insecurity rate is highest in the South, followed by the Midwest, West, and Northeast."
For those challenged by mathematics, that's more than ten percent of the American public that "struggles against hunger."
So, if the economy is the best ever, why is more than ten percent of the population having hunger problems especially if children are involved? Part of it is geographic; i.e. rural hunger problems are greater than urban hunger problems. We know that the region of the country, the South, that supports President Trump the strongest has the highest percentage of hunger problems. Rural America, especially in the Old Confederacy, suffers from hunger.
It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Blacks in the poorest state, Mississippi, suffer immensely; ditto New Mexico with the highest rate of hunger in the state with the largest percentage of Hispanics.
The tie between "poverty" and hunger is direct.
"38.1 million people (11.8 percent) lived in poverty in 2018, down from 12.3 percent in 2017...More than 16 percent of children (11.9 million) lived in poverty in 2018...The 2018 poverty rate was much higher for African Americans (20.8 percent) and Hispanics (17.6 percent) than for whites (8.1 percent) . ..SNAP lifted 3.2 million people out of poverty, school lunches lifted 1.4 million out of poverty, and WIC lifted 302,000 people out of poverty in 2018."
Why, then, is the Trump Administration suggesting 4.5 billions of dollars in cuts to food supplement programs such as sNAp that has lifted millions out of poverty?
Another element of the hunger problem is that crops are rotting in the fields in California. One third of California's multi-billion dollar crop rots in the fields every year. While some are left to rot because the market doesn't support the harvest, much of the problem is that the cost of harvesting and processing the surplus fresh produce is higher than the potential revenue from those crops.
Embarrassing as it might sound, California's Fresno County, the most food productive county in the country, has a high percentage of hunger while the very food local people could eat is rotting all around them.
Poverty and its attached hunger are the most serious problems for American children there are.
Here are suggestions the President should consider so he can brag that he has cut poverty and hunger for vulnerable Americans, the rural, the Black and the Hispanic. They, who are cursed with poverty and hunger while the President boasts the economy is the best in history, that the stock market that has no effect on poverty reaches record levels and that more Amerricans are working than ever.
Suggestion: Make SNAP more available to more people, not cut it.
Suggestion: Pursue more economic and infrastructure development in rural America, especially in the South to create jobs where they don't exist now.
Suggestion: Increase corporate taxes by 2-3 percent and increase personal income tax levels by 5 percent to raise a large amount of money to finance an expanded SNAP and economic/infrastructure development in rural America. The corporations won't mind because they will follow federal development money into rural America and the rich (over $250,ooo annual income) won't miss another nickel in taxes on every dollar they make and, their investment dollars will follow the federal rural development.
Everyone wins.

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he does not believe House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s claim that he does not know the identity of an anonymous whistleblower, whose complaint against President Trump launched the impeachment investigation.
“Yes,” the California Republican said when a reporter asked if he believes Schiff is lying. “And I don’t think it’s the first time he lied to us, either.
Schiff, a California Democrat, during the first public impeachment hearing Wednesday, told Republicans on the Intelligence Committee he does not know the identity of the whistleblower even though the person contacted his staff about the complaint earlier this year.
“I do not know the identity of the whistleblower, and I’m determined to make sure that identity is protected,” Schiff told Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan.
McCarthy said Schiff has a history of lying, and he pointed to Schiff’s public, unsubstantiated claims that there is evidence Trump colluded with Russians ahead of the 2016 election.
McCarthy did not provide direct evidence Schiff knows the identity of the whistleblower, although several media outlets reported his name.
McCarthy said Schiff lied when he initially said his office had no contact with the whistleblower.
Schiff then contacted the New York Times to explain that his staff had, in fact, worked with the whistleblower when he contacted them about his complaint.
“I think he has lied numerous times, and I do not think he is fit to be in charge of this committee,” McCarthy said.

10 things to know about Cortaca Jug

Texto completo: The coveted Cortaca Jug will boldly go where it has never gone before.
Neither Jim Butterfield Stadium nor SUNY Cortland Stadium will host the annual game between Ithaca College and SUNY Cortland this season.
The Division III football rivals with campuses about 20 miles apart in central New York are hitting the road this year to play at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Kickoff is 1 p.m. Saturday.
Here are 10 things to know about the Cortaca Jug:
It'll be a record The largest crowd to see a Division III football game is 37,355. That happened Sept. 23, 2017, when Minnesota rivals St. Thomas and St. John's played at Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins.
As of about two weeks ago, more than 42,500 tickets had been sold for the Cortaca Jug, Ithaca College Athletic Director Susan Bassett said.
"We've probably expanded a lot of peoples' imagination at this point," Bassett said. "For Division III to have this kind of showcase and this type of interest, everyone thinks it's all about professional sports and Division I sports, but this really sets the bar for interest in Division III athletics."
Doing the math Ithaca and Cortland have been playing for the Jug since 1959, with the Bombers holding a 37-24 lead in Jug games.
But their first football game came in 1930, a 12-0 Cortland victory.
They played 16 times before the first Cortaca Jug. Ithaca leads the overall series, 41-33-3.
The teams played twice in 1988, the Red Dragons winning the Cortaca Jug game, 21-20. Three weeks later they met in an NCAA quarterfinal and the Bombers won, 24-17.
It's more than football Ithaca will be sending 16 buses to New Jersey, many carrying student spectators as well as others who participate in the event.
The Bombers' choir will sing the national anthem, cheer teams will accompany both teams, Ithaca's West African Drumming and Dance Ensemble will perform and students from IC's school of sports management will organize pre-game events
"It's beyond this being a football game," Bassett said. "There are multiple ways people are involved. It's multi-faceted and comprehensive."
Media interest Cortland AD Mike Urtz said he's done interviews with the New York Times and Forbes Magazine in the lead up to the game.
"Our campus is getting unbelievable exposure," he said. "This is probably my fourth interview. When you look at the free marketing and free branding for both institutions, it's been incredible."
Local talent Ithaca is in Section 4 boundaries and Cortland is just outside, and both teams' rosters include players from nearby.
The Bombers' top receiving threat is Owego graduate Will Gladney, a senior who leads the team with 60 receptions, 811 yards and 12 touchdowns.
On the defensive side, Greene graduate John Hadac, a senior lineman, has a team-best 61/2 sacks among his 41 tackles and one forced fumble.
Junior defensive back Khiry Brown, an Ithaca High graduate, has 28 tackles, two interceptions and five pass break-ups.
For Cortland, senior linebacker Dylan Studer, a Chenango Forks graduate, has 21 tackles.
Others from Section 4 are freshman quarterback Joe Mack (Dryden), sophomore linebacker Trey Floyd (Tioga), freshman offensive lineman Dylan Houseknecht (Odessa-Montour), sophomore offensive lineman Daquan Griffin (Ithaca) and junior receiver Ky'Sawn Veale (Norwich).
Cortland's head coach is Dan MacNeill, a Walton graduate.
Downstate interest Bassett and Urtz said a major reason ticket sales have been so brisk is the large number of downstate graduates from both schools.
"The alumni gatherings to watch the game down in the city, they were getting larger and larger," Urtz said. "Within the last two years, there were two bar/restaurants in New York City somewhere, one of them hosted Cortland and the other hosted Ithaca and they were across the street and they each had more than 1,000 people just to watch the game. I knew we were going to have a pretty good draw."
Tickets They're still available, plenty of them. If you're looking to go and you're a fan of perusing online ticket sites such as stubhub or ticketmaster, you can find tickets for as low as $20 or as expensive as $500.
Might happen again Bassett said given the interest this year's game has drawn, she wouldn't be surprised if the Cortaca Jug returned to the NYC area in the future.
"We look at this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Bassett said. "At some point is it possible our campus leadership would say, 'Let's do this every four years and we'll alternate who the host team is.' I just have no idea. We haven't gotten that far yet. We're so focused on this experience.
"If you had a couple years to plan, I think this would be so much easier for everybody, but this is all coming together nicely."
What can you bring If you're heading to the game, here's what you can bring:

Texto completo: "I think Arrokoth is going to work even better because it's such a great trifecta of confluence about America and indigenous Americans and people from Maryland who were at the heart of our project and the concept of sky and flight."
Alan Stern
NASA's New Horizons principal investigator
When NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew by the most distant object in the solar system to be explored by a human spacecraft last New Year's, it was met with applause and jubilation as scientists, families and even rock stars celebrated this historic achievement.
But now NASA has changed the object's original name following concerns that it had Nazi connotations.
Originally nicknamed "Ultima Thule," the snowman-shaped object in the Kuiper belt — the region of the solar system beyond Neptune that contains hundreds of thousands of objects such as asteroids, comets and dwarf planets — is now officially named "Arrokoth," a Native American term meaning "sky" in the Powhatan/Algonquian language, according to NASA's press release Tuesday.
The change came after NASA received backlash over the original nickname because of its historical association with the Third Reich, despite it originally being a Latin term that means "a place beyond the known world."
"This isn't just some obscure element among hundreds of others in the Nazi cosmology," Eric Kurlander, a professor of history at Stetson University in Deland, told The New York Times. "They named a tank division after Thule in World War II. It keeps popping up, which is why it probably makes sense not to name something that anyone has any interest in Thule. It has too much baggage at this point."
Robert Taylor, associate dean and professor of history at Florida Tech, agrees.
"There are many, many, many different names and a name that could be interpreted as giving credence to, again, racist Nazi ideology, why do it," Taylor told FLORIDA TODAY.
But the plan was never to keep the name "Ultima Thule," New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern told FLORIDA TODAY.
"When we find an object in space, it gets a license plate," Stern said. "In this case, it's 2014 MU69. And I knew as we were planning the flyby of this target, that's a jawbreaker and it's not a good handle for public engagement. But I also knew that we couldn't give it a real name until after the flyby when we saw what it looked like."
"Early in 2018, we put out a press release that said we had nicknamed it ... That nickname was Ultima Thule, chosen because it's inspiring about that exploration and because it has a certain gravitas because it comes from Latin," Stern said. "But we never intended for that to be the name. From the very beginning, we always said, 'this is temporary.' "
And now, after scientists were finally able to "catch their breaths," as Stern put it, a new official name has been given to an object nearly four billion miles away from any Nazi connection.
"I think Arrokoth is going to work even better because it's such a great trifecta of confluence about America and indigenous Americans and people from Maryland who were at the heart of our project and the concept of sky and flight."
The team, which is based out in the John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, wanted to find a name that had a special connection to Maryland, and since "all objects in the Kuiper belt are named after creation deities," according to Stern, finding a name used by indigenous people who were from Maryland was the perfect fit.
"Maryland has played such an important role in this mission. From the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab to NASA people at NASA Goddard to the Space Telescope Institute, let's find a creation deity from indigenous Americans who populated Maryland long ago," Stern said.
"We looked through that dictionary and liked this one best. ... So I thought it was aspirational in three different ways and that seemed to me like a home run again."
So where did the idea for Ultima Thule come from?
Back in 2017, scientists put up a public vote to decide what nickname to give to 2014 MU69, the official name given by the International Astronomical Union. Ultima Thule became the winner, despite scientists being unaware of the Nazi connection at the time, according to Stern. But even after they were made aware, Stern and others still decided to keep the nickname until a new official name could replace it.
"Those bad guys liked a lot of things in life," Stern said. "When I later learned that they liked this term, Ultima Thule, I felt like we shouldn't give them the power to own it forever ... So I wanted to take it back and keep using it for something good."
Yet Taylor argues NASA should have never named it Ultima Thule, to begin with.
"I understand how NASA feels about not wanting to surrender something to folks on that side of the issue. But let's face it, they can and already have the ability to use it as sort of respectability for their beliefs," Taylor said. "Saying, 'Oh well, we think it means "A" and NASA named this space item after it so it must have some merit.' It would be like giving an intergalactic billboard for Nazi ideology."
Vladimir Solonari, a professor of history who focuses on the Holocaust as well as Russian and Eastern European history at the University of Central Florida disagrees, however.
He believes changing the name gives some of the power back to these fascist groups.
"I think maybe them actually calling it (Ultima Thule) and then replacing it creates kind of a useless conversation," Solonari told FLORIDA TODAY. "I don't think the story was handled well. (NASA) should have thought more about it right from the beginning, but once they called it 'Thule,' and changing it now, people are talking not so much of the object, but now whether (the name should have been changed) or should not have been done. I don't think it helps."
Moving forward, Daniel Batcheldor, the head of aerospace, physics and space sciences at Florida Tech believes scientists should wait until the International Astronomical Union gives the official name to avoid any potential controversy.
"We, of course, hope that nobody is going to purposely name something that would cause anybody to take offense, but nevertheless, we can never be sure that that is going to be the case," Batcheldor told FLORIDA TODAY. "That is why we should always wait for the International Astronomical Union to make that final determination on the official names of celestial objects."
Despite all the drama, the scientists on the New Horizons mission aren't letting this nomenclature squabble deter them from the actual work they're conducting.
"I'm just a little disappointed because it's just coming out of left field," Stern said. "It's got nothing to do with how we named it or why a permanent name was selected or what our objectives are, but I know that in the long run, forever, this object will be 'Arrokoth' and all that other stuff probably won't even be a trivia question in a board game."
While scientists continue to study the data of the rusty-colored snowman-like object sent back from the spacecraft, Stern is also looking ahead to what other foreign objects New Horizons can visit next. Starting next summer, Stern and the rest of his team will start looking at other flyby targets to learn more about the early formation process of our solar system.

Texto completo: Ben Casselman, an economics reporter, uses a programming language called R and works with vast data sets. But he says interviews still make for the best stories.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ben Casselman, an economics and business reporter, discussed the tech he's using.
You compile complicated data sets and distill them into stories for our readers. What are the tech tools and methods behind this madness?
"Madness" is tough but fair. If you walk by my desk on any given day you'll find my computer monitor littered with charts, spreadsheets and way more Chrome tabs than any sane person would consider reasonable. And my physical desktop is just as cluttered with half-used notebooks, printed-out economics papers and my trusty TI-86 calculator (a holdover from college calculus that I still find inexplicably useful -- apparently a theme among economics reporters at The Times).
Really, though, the most important piece of technology on my desk is my landline telephone. I think some people have the idea that "data journalism" means staring at spreadsheets until a story magically appears, but in the real world that almost never happens. The best stories almost always emerge from talking to people, whether they are experts or just ordinary people affected by the issues we write about. They're the ones who pose the questions that data can help answer, or who help explain the trends that the data reveals, or who can provide the wrinkles and nuances that the data glosses over.
For example, one of my favorite stories from the past year is one that I wrote with my colleague Conor Dougherty about investors buying up single-family homes. We had access to a huge data set -- millions and millions of real estate transactions -- that showed how investors had come to dominate the market for starter homes in many cities. But what really made the story come to life was when we zoomed in on one house that had changed hands several times and got to talk to all the people who had touched it -- the investor who flipped it, the family that bought it, the would-be buyer who kept losing out to investors.
At the end of the day, data isn't the story; people are the story.
Fair enough. But I assume you aren't doing all that data analysis on your phone. Or on your TI calculator, for that matter.
Yes, that's true. I do most of my data analysis in a statistical programming language called R. It lets me work with data sets that have hundreds of thousands or even millions of rows, much too large for a spreadsheet program like Excel. It also makes it easy to automate tasks that I perform regularly -- so when the Labor Department's monthly jobs report comes out, for example, I can download the new data and update my analysis with just a few keystrokes.
R also has a great suite of tools for making charts, which is a critical part of my work. The Times has the best graphics team in the business, and I can't come close to doing what it does in terms of making beautiful, readable charts and interactive graphics. But I'm not trying to make charts like that. I just need something that lets me spot a trend or relationship, or that helps identify examples that are worth exploring further. For that, quick-and-dirty is just fine.
In terms of hardware, I wish I could tell you I was running some hotshot rig with multicore processors and a boatload of RAM. But these days I do pretty much all my work on a standard-issue laptop. I store some data in the cloud, but that's mostly because I don't want to lose it all if my computer melts down.
That's mostly a reflection of how quickly technology has improved. A few years back, when I was at The Wall Street Journal, I had to go begging for extra processing power, and even then my co-workers used to complain that my computer sounded like a jet airplane struggling to gain altitude. These days, my computer can manage much larger data sets without breaking a sweat.
There has been a running debate in journalism circles about whether reporters should learn to code. I take it you're firmly in the "yes" camp?
Not at all! Coding has been a valuable tool for me, and I'm glad that more journalists are learning to code (and that more coders are getting interested in journalism). But I was a reporter long before I learned how to code, and most of the reporters I admire most have never written a line of code in their life.
I do think that pretty much all reporters need to have a basic comfort with numbers and statistics. Not that everyone needs to be able to run regressions or calculate p-values, or even define what a p-value is (which isn't easy, by the way). But they should be fluent enough in the language of statistics to understand when an argument makes sense, and when it's suspect enough that they should start probing more deeply. And, yes, I think you should be able to do a percent change calculation without turning to Google for help.
In the last couple of years, The Times has developed a course to teach basic data skills to reporters and editors -- things like how to vet data to make sure it's legitimate, how to evaluate statistical claims and how to use a spreadsheet program to explore a data set. One of the core messages is that you can do a lot of this stuff without learning to code. I do a session where I walk through how to replicate a story of mine using nothing but Google Sheets and a few basic functions.
Outside of work, what tech product are you personally obsessed with? What do you do with it?
Despite my love of data, I'm not much of a techie in my nonwork life.
I don't have a smart watch or a smart thermostat or anything like that, and I still had an old cathode-ray TV until my in-laws finally broke down and sent us a flat screen. (I did give my wife a HomePod, Apple's smart speaker, for her birthday a couple of years ago, but it mostly just terrifies me by having Siri pipe up seemingly at random.)
Probably my most prized digital possession is my kitchen scale. I've gotten really into baking sourdough bread, without any commercial yeast, which means it's about the lowest-tech form of baking imaginable.

Texto completo: With another academic year churning on, many people, bemused by campus excitements " trigger warnings, safe spaces, 'bias response teams' in hot pursuit of the perpetrators of microaggressions " wonder whether higher education has become a net subtraction from the nation's stock of reasonableness. Those who read the Chronicle of Higher Education, a window into that world, are not reassured.
In May, the Chronicle published a dyspeptic report by Andrew Kay, a Wisconsin writer, on this year's meeting of the Modern Language Association, whose members teach literature to a declining number of interested students: Kay says the number of English positions on the MLA job list has shrunk 55 percent since 2008, the number of University of Michigan English majors declined from 1,000 to 200 in eight years, and adjunct (limited-term, non-tenure track) instructors now are a majority of college teachers. Kay's villains are 'the avarice of universities' and 'politicians and pundits' who despise 'humanistic thinking, which plainly threatens them.' His disparagements implicitly enlarge and celebrate him as a threat to the villains.
He is nostalgic for the 1960s and 1970s, which 'brought literary-critical methods to bear on every aspect of culture, from sexuality to disability.' He is impervious to the possibility that his mentality, stocked with stereotypes and luxuriating in victimhood, might be a symptom of what repels students who care about actual literature more than 'literary-critical' approaches to this and that.
Also in the Chronicle in May, Daniel Bessner of the University of Washington and Michael Brenes of Yale University deplore without defining 'the neoliberalization of the university system.' The definition presumably is obvious to all inhabitants of the academic bubble, where 'neoliberals' are disdained as respecters of market forces " supply, demand, etc. Citing a 1972 New York Times report on 'an oversupply of trained historians,' they say 'for nearly a half-century, historians have failed to organize to halt the disappearance of positions,' which they blame on 'unnecessary neoliberal austerity, corporatization, and adjunctification' and 'boot-strappism and market-Darwinism.'
Their jumble of jargon means: The fact that the supply of historians has outpaced the demand for history instruction is the fault of many things but not of academic historians, who need to show 'solidarity' to 'overturn a patently unjust system' that offers 'crummy and exploitative' jobs. Their message is clear: History doctorates are entitled to good academic positions regardless of the absence of a demand for their services. So perhaps the American Historical Association (and the MLA, the American Political Science Association, etc.) should wield its 'labor power' by threatening to strike. It is a plan only academics could concoct: Because there is weak and declining demand for our labor, we should coerce our adversaries (neoliberals, market-Darwinism, the law of supply and demand) by threatening to withdraw our labor.
In the Chronicle in March, the University of Washington's Bessner said we are in a 'crisis of capitalism,' by which he seemed to mean a shortage of jobs for people like him: left-wing academics. 'Given that there are almost no tenure-track jobs, the majority of the next generation of intellectuals " like my own generation " will probably have to look outside the university for employment.' To him, 'intellectuals' denotes left-wing aspiring academics. Again, note the absence of self-examination and the disregard of the possibility that there are fewer teaching jobs because fewer students are drawn to the study of literature, history and the rest of the humanities because of the way these subjects are taught.
This is a transatlantic problem. The author of the Economist's Bagehot column notes that although the study of history " and eminent historians " 'used to hold a central position in [Britain's] national life,' the number of history students has declined 10 percent in a decade. Perhaps because 'the historical profession has turned in on itself,' with practitioners turning away from 'great matters of state' and concentrating on 'the marginal rather than the powerful, the poor rather than the rich, everyday life rather than Parliament.' They 'almost seem to be engaged in a race to discover the most marginalized subject imaginable.' This reduces history's helpfulness as 'a safeguard against myopia. Modernity shrinks time as well as space; people live in an eternal present of short-term stimuli and instant gratification.'
Americans have a voracious appetite for serious historical writing " note the robust demand for narratives and biographies by David McCullough, Ron Chernow, Rick Atkinson, Nathaniel Philbrick, Richard Brookhiser and many others who are not academics, who do not write about marginal subjects, and who do not tell the nation's story as a tale of embarrassments.

Texto completo: As states and communities rush to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products linked to vaping, Carol McGruder races from town to town, urging officials to include what she calls "the mother lode of all flavors": menthol.
McGruder, co-chair of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, has tried for years to warn lawmakers that menthol attracts new smokers, especially African Americans. Now that more officials are willing to listen, she wants them to prohibit menthol cigarettes and cigarillos, not just, e-cigarette flavors, to reduce smoking among Black people.
McGruder and other tobacco control researchers are using the youth vaping epidemic - and the vaping-related illnesses sweeping the country - as an opportunity to take on menthol cigarettes, even though they are not related to the illnesses.
"We started to see that vap-ing is something that we could leverage in order to deal with this whole menthol issue," said Valerie Yerger, an associate professor of health policy at the University of California-San Francisco.
Menthol is a substance found in mint plants that creates a cooling sensation and masks tobacco flavor in both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Those properties make menthol more appealing to first-time smokers and vapers, even as they pose the same health threats as non-menthol products and may be harder to quit.
Nearly nine out of 10 African American smokers prefer mentholated cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But even as tobacco control activists see opportunity, some African Americans, including smokers, fear discrimination. They predict that banning menthol will lead to a surge in illicit sales of cigarettes and result in additional policing in communities that already face tensionwith law enforcement.
Joseph Paul, director of political and civic affairs at City of Refuge Los Angeles, a church with about 17,000 members in Gardena, Calif., spoke at a board of supervisors meeting in September against a proposed flavor ban in Los Angeles County that was adopted a week later.
If officials truly wanted to end youth vaping, he later told California Healthline, the ordinance should have targeted only vape flavors and exempted adult smokers and their menthol cigarettes.
"Menthol cigarettes are very popular in the Black community, my people smoke menthol cigarettes," he said.
The Los Angeles County ban prohibits sales but not possession of flavored e-cigarette products, menthol cigarettes and chewing tobacco in the unincorporated area of the county, inhabited by about 1 million people. Shops have until April to clear their shelves of flavored tobacco products.
Paul warned that people will start selling menthol cigarettes illegally: "It's supply and demand." That will make the community more vulnerable to police harassment, he said.
In New York City, when officials proposed a ban on menthol cigarettes earlier this year, which has yet to be acted upon, the Rev. Al Sharpton made a similar argument against the measure: Banning menthol would lead to greater tensions with police in Black communities.
"I think there is an 'Eric Garner' concern here," the civil rights activist told The New York Times in July, referring to the well-known case of a 43-year old Black man who died in a chokehold in 2014 while being arrested by New York City police on suspicion of selling single cigarettes.
In July 2016, Chicago became the first major U.S. city to ban menthol cigarette sales, but it limited the prohibition to within 500 feet of schools.
Of the more than 200 communities in the country that restrict or ban the sale of flavored tobacco, fewer than 60 include restrictions on menthol cigarettes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
Aspen, Colo., will ban all flavored nicotine products, including menthol cigarettes, effective Jan. 1. A few communities in Minnesota already have such bans in place. In California, close to 50 communities restrict or ban flavored tobacco products; of those, more than 30 include restrictions on menthol cigarettes. Notably, San Francisco banned menthol cigarettes along with all flavored tobacco products in 2018, before banning all vapes and e-cigarettes earlier this year.
At the national level, the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of flavors in combustible cigarettes in 2009, but exempted menthol. Last November, the agency proposed a ban on menthol-flavored combustible cigarettes, calling their use among youths "especially troubling," but it has not yet taken action.
Then the Trump administration said in September it would soon ban all flavored e-cigarette products, but it may now be backing away from banning mint and menthol.
Big Tobacco aggressively pushed menthol cigarettes on Black youths in the 1950s and 1960s, and now some people consider Kools and Newports part of Black culture, McGruder said.
McGruder and others point out that the tobacco industry has supported and funded civil rights groups and causes, forming relationships with prominent Black leaders such as Sharpton. Big Tobacco acknowledged that it has contributed to Sharpton's organization, the National Action Network, and similar groups.
Bobby Sheffield, a pastor and vice president of the Riverside County Black Chamber of Commerce, said the criminalization argument is a scare tactic.
"We're not trying to have anyone incarcerated because they have this product in their possession," Sheffield said. His organization, which represents local businesses, started campaigning this year for menthol bans in California's Inland Empire, including the cities of Riverside, San Bernardino and Perris.
Some smokers understand the need to keep tobacco out of the hands of children, but they don't think it's fair to include menthol cigarettes.
"It's stupid. Now they're trying to act like menthol cigarettes are the problem. These have been around for a long time," said April Macklin of Sacramento, who smokes Benson & Hedges menthols. She smoked when she was younger, quit, and started again three years ago.
The city of Sacramento will ban the sale of flavored tobacco, including menthol cigarettes, effective Jan. 1.
Macklin, 53, said she might just quit because she won't smoke anything other than menthol. But even with a ban in place, she doubts menthol cigarettes will be gone for good. "I'm sure people will figure something out," she said.

Texto completo: The swamp runs deep
Imaad Zuberi, longtime bundler for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and late arriving donor for Donald Trump, solicited funds from foreigners and passed them on to candidates. He created fake names, allowing the politicians to claim ignorance.
Hunter Biden offers no description of the skills and credentials, other than his last name, which justified being paid more than half a million dollars per year by a foreign company. Anderson Cooper, a celebrity no one appointed judge in this matter, assures us that Hunter's activities provide no evidence of wrongdoing.
I believe that many voters cast their vote for Donald Trump in 2016 not because they desired a Trump presidency, but because they were utterly sick of the protected corruption of those in power. Time after time, voters elect school teachers and small-town mayors to Congress, to witness them return with inexplicable wealth and unmatched legal protections. If a candidate for president was demonstrably above enriching themselves in the Washington swamp, I would vote for them. As it is, I will probably just stay home.

Home park owners lack integrity
I was delighted to finally see some exposure to the exorbitant rental raises in local manufactured home parks. We were residents of Woodland East for over 18 years when it was sold to the Werners in June 2017. We were assured by the sellers that the new owners were “well known for their integrity and high standards.”
Within two weeks we were notified that our rent, beginning Oct. 1, 2017, would go up $242 per month. As mentioned in the news article, the new owners had to back down on raising the rent in October because we had just had a rent increase in March of that year. So, it became effective on March 1, 2018. Almost overnight, 19 houses were up for sale in our park. The bottom dropped out on what people could get for their homes. We soon became one of those attempting to sell our home.
“Integrity”? I don't think so. The definition of integrity is “the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness.” Is it morally acceptable to line one's pockets at the expense of elderly people living on fixed incomes? Is it morally acceptable to make promises to improve or upkeep the park's amenities, and then not keep them?

President violated Constitution
Everyone needs to understand that congressional committees conducting impeachment inquiries are well-represented by both major political parties. For example, the Intelligence committee has 13 Democrats and nine Republicans. The Oversight committee has 24 Democrats and 18 Republicans. The truth is quite transparent at this point; we have seen the Mulvaney comments (get over it), and anyone can read the damning information from William Taylor published in the New York Times. Not a witch hunt, but a president who violated our Constitution.

There's more to discipline rates
Regarding the article, “AG: Vancouver district discipline rates higher for students of color, those with disabilities” (The Columbian, Oct. 23), if, as I suspect, the discipline rates do not show equality between boys and girls, I'm sure there are ways to make them equal. The district could have a rule that every time a boy is disciplined, it would have to find a girl for disciplining. Of course, given the performance of Asian students in general, it would be hard to concoct disciplinary measures for them, but bureaucracies are creative. Remember the USSR's Lavrentiy Beria's quote: “Show me the man and I'll find you the crime.” It is surely good guidance for equalizing discipline rates.

Herrera Beutler, GOP need to go
The committee involved with the impeachment inquiry is taking depositions. Witnesses being deposed are not supposed to discuss their testimony with other witnesses, so that as much as possible, the truth can be ascertained about what happened. The questioners in the depositions are both Democrats and Republicans.
Republicans, including Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, are outright lying about the process, because they cannot argue on the basics of the facts or the law of the case.
The Republican Party at this point is tethered to Trump; almost without exception they speak in lockstep to whatever Trump wants. While some may wish for the Republican Party to be considered legitimate to maintain the so-called “two-party system” (of which there's absolutely no constitutional basis), the fact is, this Trump-toadying Republican Party must cease to exist for the good of the nation. They are putting their party above their constitutional oaths and their duties to serve the people.
It's time to call Republicans including Jaime Herrera Beutler what they are: liars with contempt for their oath of office, and they're lying in the service to a would-be dictator. She needs to go.

Hybrid owners treated unfairly
It often seems like one hand of government doesn't know what the other hand is doing, or doesn't even care. Washington state is trying to encourage everyone to produce less carbon pollution. Many are in accordance with this goal, and my household has spent a great deal of extra money to purchase a hybrid car such as Prius.
None of us ever expected we would suddenly be subjected to an annual $75 penalty on our car tabs to be used to create facilities for plug-in cars. Hybrid cars do not plug in; we will never use what we are being forced to pay for. Whose brilliant idea was it to single out this group for unfair treatment?
Better to put a small tax on fuel that would create an incentive to pollute less. I think I am going to buy a big gas guzzler truck. … Anyone want to buy a used Prius

WHAT WILL WE TELL THE CHILDREN?; PLAIN TALK

Texto completo: Have you ever wondered what some of these people are going to tell their grandkids? The glaciers are shrinking. Sea levels are rising. Ice on rivers and lakes is melting faster. Tornadoes and hurricanes are stronger and more devastating than ever. Wildfires fueled by excess heat are causing billions of dollars of property losses. Birds are disappearing.
But, they don't care.
The 1,300 scientists who belong to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecast a rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century unless greenhouse gases are reduced. There will be places on Earth that won't be inhabitable. Hundred-year floods will occur every year. The United Nations predicts the costs to cope with severe weather events, rising oceans and severe heat will be in the trillions of dollars.
Yet, in the face of all this, we have government leaders who not only willfully ignore the dangers to the planet and human life they actually help make them worse.
National Geographic has documented 15 ways that the Trump administration has, in less than three years, changed the nation's environmental policies, increasing the probability that the climate will become unbearable for much of life on the planet.
While there have been publicized changes? like declaring war on California's efforts to reduce carbon emissions by enacting stricter gas mileage requirements on motor vehicles, and the admin-istration's ham-handed pull-out from the Paris Climate Agreement there have been dozens of rollbacks that have garnered little notice.
Thanks to efforts to clean up coal power plants, restricting the methane-flaring at refineries and working with other nations to fight pollution, the country was finally making some headway in reducing or at least containing carbon emissions. But, thanks to this administration's polices ostensibly aimed at "unshackling" big business from onerous regulations 2018 saw a rise in greenhouse gases of 3.4%, the highest increase since 2010.
New York Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote earlier this year: "(Trump's) administration is filled with former corporate lobbyists, and they have been changing federal policy to make it easier for companies to pollute. These officials like to talk about free enterprise and scientific uncertainty, but their real motive is usually money."
And don't think we are any different here in Wisconsin. While our farmers have had to cope with abnormal weather events and several communities have had to deal with annual floods that have ruined homes and businesses, the speaker of the state Assembly belittles the formation of a gubernatorial climate change task force to explore what the state can do.
In his usual display of arrogance, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, insinuated the only reason Gov. Tony Evers wants to appoint a task force to develop strategies to deal with climate change is "to make people on the left feel better about themselves."
Like his hero, President Donald Trump, Vos says that, yes, there "probably" is climate change happening before our eyes, but he nor anyone else, he says knows what's causing it. Not the 98% of climate scientists who have documented how emissions caused by human activity are contributing to melting polar caps, rising oceans and super-charged storms. The popcorn maker from Racine County knows better.
It took a Swedish teenage girl named Greta Thunberg to call out governmental leaders for sitting on their hands while the world deteriorates. She inspired thousands of young people to join in marches aimed at calling attention to what should be a major if not the major issue in next year's elections.
Meanwhile, it's taken an 81-year-old actress named Jane Fonda to call attention to this atrocity. Every Friday she's been arrested at the nation's Capitol for sitting in to call attention to our inaction.
But where are the American politicians who ought to be hammering this issue home, explaining to voters what needs to be done and how they will do it?
As more Americans experience the effects of climate change, this could well be Trump's Achilles heel and perhaps even Robin Vos will need to answer to his constituents for his pathetic indifference.
If this kind of neglect goes unpunished, what, indeed, will we tell the children? CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @DaveZweifel.

Texto completo: Pues esa será la cifra de precandidatos presidenciales demócratas si el exgobernador de Massachusetts Deval Patrick se suma a la carrera por la Casa Blanca antes del fin de semana, como informó el miércoles la prensa estadounidense.
Patrick, de 63 años, uno de los primeros gobernadores afroamericanos de Estados Unidos y cercano al expresidente Barack Obama , no confirmó haber comunicado estos planes a varios políticos demócratas, como indicaron varios medios.
Pero según el New York Times y la televisión CNN, este sexagenario relativamente moderado podría confirmar su decisión por video desde este jueves, e inscribirse como candidato a las primarias demócratas en New Hampshire el viernes, día de cierre de las inscripciones en ese estado.
Si se confirma, la candidatura tardía de Patrick demostrará las angustias en el campo demócrata: muchos se inquietan de ver que los senadores Bernie Sanders y Elizabeth Warren, muy de izquierda, suben en los sondeos y superan al centrista Joe Biden , lo cual según ellos arruina las posibilidades de que los demócratas expulsen a Trump de la Casa Blanca en las presidenciales de noviembre de 2020.
Testigo de estas preocupaciones, el multimillonario y exalcalde de Nueva York Michael Bloomberg también contempla disputar las primarias demócratas.
Casado con una abogada y padre de dos hijas, Deval Patrick descartó no obstante en diciembre de 2018 la idea de presentarse a las presidenciales, citando “la crueldad del proceso electoral que terminaría por perjudicar a personas que Diane (su esposa) y yo amamos”.
Pero a menos de tres meses de las primarias, Patrick estima ahora que aún hay lugar para un candidato capaz de unir a demócratas moderados y radicales, según sus allegados.
Nacido en una familia pobre de Chicago, luego becario de una escuela de élite de Boston antes de graduarse en derecho en Harvard, Patrick fue abogado durante mucho tiempo, sobre todo para la asociación de defensa de los derechos de los afroamericanos NAACP, antes de convertirse en gobernador de Massachusetts de 2007 a 2014.
Desde que dejó la gobernación trabaja para el fondo de inversiones privado Bain Capital, que se especializa en empresas que impulsan un modelo de desarrollo sustentable, y como comentarista político del canal CBS News.
Fue así que comentó el último debate demócrata, donde subrayó que “ser candidato, como ser un funcionario electo, es una mezcla de sustancia y de desempeño artístico”.
La disputa por la investidura demócrata ya cuenta con otros dos candidatos afroamericanos, la senadora de California Kamala Harris y el senador de Nueva Jersey Cory Booker. Pero ninguno lidera por ahora la carrera.

Texto completo: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, "I never say never to anything. "
The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was "100%" certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks "all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world. "
"So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time," she said.
When she was asked a second time if she was ruling out another run, Clinton again declined to explicitly say she would not do it.
"I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it," she said. "But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans. "
If Clinton does plan to enter the fray, time is not on her side as the filing deadlines have already passed in at least two states and others are fast approaching. And Clinton said Tuesday, "it's way past time" to get in the race.
Trump vs. Clinton: Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton: Run for president again! Clinton to Trump: Do your job!
Speculation about a 2020 rematch between Clinton and President Donald Trump, the man who defeated her in 2016, has swirled virtually since the moment the election results were announced three years ago.
Though she declared in March that "I'm not running," pundits began to rekindle the idea of a 2020 Clinton campaign after former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's unexpected moves toward a late entry into the race. Former Massachusetts Gov. Duval Patrick is also said to be considering a last-minute run.
Bloomberg is "increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned" to beat Trump, said his adviser Howard Wolfson. The New York Times reported Monday that wealthy Democratic donors have been hoping for fresh faces to enter the race amid concerns about fundraising totals and a lack of confidence in the strength of the leading candidates.
Mark Penn, who was chief strategist for Clinton's 2008 presidential run, said Bloomberg's move could prod Clinton to consider a run and decide there's "still a political logic there for her. "
Former Clinton adviser Philippe Reines said on Fox News last month that "if she thought she had the best odds of beating Donald Trump, I think she would think about it long and hard. "
And on Oct. 31. , former President Bill Clinton dropped the aside that while he is ineligible for another term, his wife "may or may not run for anything. "
In another BBC Radio interview on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton said, "I try to give the best advice I can to the candidates who are running because my goal is to help retire the current incumbent. "
Clinton said she did not expect to endorse a candidate in the primary but would "support them and answer their questions in any way that I can. But once we have a nominee to do everything I know to do to win. "
"The process is unfolding," she said. "And we'll see who emerges. "

Texto completo: FRANKLIN, N.H. – Pete Buttigieg was talking about climate change to about a dozen reporters on his campaign bus Saturday when the presidential candidate leaped out of his captain's chair to look out the picture window at a burning building.
"Oh!" he exclaimed. "That is a very large fire."
Then his attention was drawn to a boy who had been watching the Franklin firefighters' controlled burn turn away from the fire to point at Buttigieg's passing blue and gold bus.
"I thought, if this bus is enough of an attraction to pry the eyes of a 10-year-old off of a burning structure surrounded by firefighters, we know that we've generated a little bit of excitement," Buttigieg later told a gathering of about 50 supporters at a home in Madison.
After the TV cameras and notepad-toting reporters had squeezed into the living room, Buttigieg explained he was crisscrossing New Hampshire with the news media in tow to "really show, versus tell, the importance of transparency as a value at a time when we've got a White House that doesn't even do press briefings anymore."
His bus had rolled into New Hampshire after two trips through Iowa, where he has climbed into the top tier of polls. A Quinnipiac University poll of New Hampshire Democrats released Monday likewise showed Buttigieg among the top four candidates in the crowded field
On board for much of the tour through all of the state's 10 counties were a rotating batch of local, national and international reporters taking advantage of what Buttigieg referred to as the "radical access" to his campaign. More than one reporter said they had gone through all the questions in their notebook during the trip.
The Indiana mayor's availability to the media – a strategy initially born out of necessity for the largely unknown politician – is one reason he has vaulted over more established candidates in the Democratic field. In fact, a New York Times article on how Buttigieg is "annoying" his rivals with his success was one of the first topics reporters raised on the second day of the four-day trip.
"I'm not going to get into the inside-baseball stuff," Buttigieg responded, adding: "I get that I'm coming from a nontraditional place."
But was he surprised by the comments from some of the other campaigns?
"It's a competition," he said with a shrug. "But it's just not where my focus is."
Buttigieg had been pressed the day before on why he doesn't allow the media into his fundraisers, as former Vice President Joe Biden does.
That's a question for staff, he demurred.
In fact, during the New Hampshire trip, Buttigieg made a detour without the media entourage to a fundraiser in Providence, Rhode Island.
On other topics, Buttigieg fielded dozens of questions over many hours in between ducking into his back office on the bus for private calls or to work on a Veterans Day speech.
What did he think when Biden started calling his own health care plan, Medicare for All Who Want It, a term Buttigieg coined?
"Well, it's a very effective way to describe my plan," Buttigieg said. "I'm not sure that my plan and his plan are exactly the same."
Is his approach to issues like health care more palatable to voters than the calls for structural change coming from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders?
"What I see is an attempt to address these problems that could be addressed with less cost and less upheaval," he said.
What's his favorite hymn? The Welsh hymn "Bryn Calfaria," or Calvary Hill, which he says is best in the original Welsh.
What kind of stress dreams does he have? It's the last day of a school semester and he doesn't even know what classes he was supposed to have been attending. (Turns out most reporters on the bus have that dream, too.)
Buttigieg got multiple versions of recurring questions that have been asked about his campaign: Why isn't he attracting more support from African Americans? Has he shifted his positions since entering the race to sound more moderate? Why doesn't he talk more about his time at the consulting firm McKinsey? What mistakes did he make in handling problems within the South Bend Police Department? How can he beat President Donald Trump when the only elections he has won have been two mayoral races in a not-large Democratic city?
In between, Buttigieg hopped on and off the bus for well-attended town halls, campaign organizing meetings, walking tours of downtowns he said reminded him of the revitalization efforts in his own South Bend, and a stop at a solar-powered brewery where he sampled a mai tai-inspired beer.
'Straight Talk Express' for the social media era A stuffed dog he picked up at a shop in Franklin that sells locally made products found a home on the bus, as did a basket of fudge and other treats personally delivered by Pat Provencher, a superfan from North Hampton. When she's not baking for Buttigieg or attending a barn party for him, the senior citizen keeps an eye on Facebook so she can respond to any negative comment she sees about her favorite candidate.
The bus is modeled after the "Straight Talk Express" that Arizona Sen. John McCain first rode in his unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination in 2000.
But in the age of social media, it's more of a high-wire act – both for the candidate and for the news media.
When a reporter incorrectly quoted Buttigieg as criticizing the "failures of the Obama era" instead of the "failures of the old normal," the comment went viral before it was fixed. Buttigieg then tweeted that he appreciated the reporter's "swift and honest correction."
Buttigieg also took in stride the blowback he received on social media for "cutting up his cinnamon roll into small pieces and eating it like a CHICKEN WING."
"Twitter will hate anything I get," Chasten Buttigieg, Pete's husband, said when perusing what is billed as the "world's longest candy counter" during a stop at Chutters in Littleton. (Twitter, in fact, loves Chasten.)
Biggest misconception about Mayor Pete? In addition to the omnipresence of social media, Buttigieg's bus is also very different from the original Straight Talk Express in tone and temperament. McCain reveled in his rebel persona, enjoyed ribbing reporters and didn't hide his quick temper.
Buttigieg, the erudite son of university professors, is contemplative and careful.
He said the biggest misconception about him is "I guess the idea that I don't get angry."
"There's been an idea that because I don't emote in the same way as some others that I'm not passionate," he said. "Just because it's a slower burn doesn't mean it isn't a kind of passion."
But he gave the nonpersonal answer of "injustice" when pressed to describe what makes him angry.
Any regrets about the 'just in case' letter? He did submit to a deep dive into his personal history: How old he was when he started to feel different? What was the path of his religious journey? And has he revisited the "just in case" letter he wrote to his parents before he deployed to Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2014 – an experience that he has said made him realize he needed to come out as gay when he returned so he could live a full life.
"It's funny to think that I wrote that trying to project a sense that I didn't have any resentment over missing out on things when what I was missing out on then was now the most important thing in my life," he said of his marriage to Chasten.
One of the only times he showed discomfort with a line of questioning was when pressed on his ambition and whether achievement is important to him.
"Um...yeah," he said, before elaborating – after a prompting – that everyone gets only one turn in life so it's important to make it count.
"Watching you write is a little unnerving," he said with a nervous laugh as the reporter scribbled the answer into her notepad.

Asheville Tourists baseball in flux?

Texto completo: Today's batch of burning questions, my smart-aleck answers and the real deal:
Question: Maybe you can take a stab at this, although they may not answer. Major League Baseball is revamping the minors, potentially eliminating 40 teams. Do we know of any implications for the Asheville Tourists? They'd definitely have to do some upgrades. You can find the ESPN story about this here: https://es.pn/2O4E3in
My answer: This could be the straw that finally drives Ted E. Tourist to off his archrival, Mr. Moon, under the guise of a "mascot upgrade." This tension has been brewing for a long time, folks.
Real Answer: The ESPN article, published Oct. 18 and titled, "Reports: MLB proposes overhaul of minor leagues, elimination of 40 teams," does indeed paint an alarming picture.
"Major League Baseball is in negotiations with its minor league teams about efforts to 'reorganize elements of the system' that could reduce the number of affiliated teams from 160 to 120, according to reports," the article states, noting that the "current agreement between Major League Baseball and the minor league teams — called the Professional Baseball Agreement — expires at the end of the 2020 season. MLB is looking to make some major changes, according to reports, that would overhaul all levels of the minors, particularly at low Class A and below."
Baseball America first reported the proposal.
Asheville plays in the South Atlantic League, a Class A Minor League level that plays a full season.
"I am unable to comment on the ongoing negotiations between Minor League and Major League Baseball, however, I am confident that the Tourists will remain in Asheville for years to come," Asheville Tourists President and Owner Brian DeWine told me via email.
He referred further questions to Jeff Lantz, senior director of communications for Minor League Baseball, which encompasses 160 minor league teams across the country. Lantz stressed that it's early in the process, and that mostly what the major and minor leagues are looking at are ways to lessen travel times for teams, better organize leagues and bring all facilities up to a standard level.
"Basically, we're not naming any specific teams at this point, because we don't want to hurt anybody's chances of doing business," Lantz said. "One of the main focuses for Major League Baseball is the geography of some of our leagues. The leagues have kind of gotten kind of out of whack."
He noted that the South Atlantic League has one team in Lakewood, New Jersey, and another as far south as Augusta, South Carolina (yes, it's South Carolina, just across the river from Augusta, Georgia).
"With the footprint, it's a good time to do some realignments," Lantz said. "That said, with where the Tourists are, there are so many teams in that region I have a hard time believing they wouldn't be included (in the Minor Leagues). It's a historic franchise, with a great ballpark in a great market. Everybody that goes there raves about it."
He agreed with DeWine, saying, "I would expect there to be baseball in that area."
The biggest problem the Tourists franchise faces may well be its home ballpark, McCormick Field, which opened in 1924 but underwent a major rebuild in the early 1990s. The original wooden stands were torn down, replaced by a modern concrete grandstand, new locker rooms and an upgraded field, all ready for the 1992 season.
While 1992 may sound fairly modern, in baseball terms it's getting to be an older facility, and one that I suspect will need some significant upgrades to meet Major League standards. I further suspect we'll see the Tourists approaching the city of Asheville, which owns the ballpark, as well as the Buncombe County Tourism Development Authority, for potential funding for upgrades.
Stay tuned on that front.
Lantz acknowledged that "facility standards are another big sticking point" for minor league teams. In a nutshell, MLB wants minor league parks to meet its standards for everything from lighting and locker sizes to padding for fences and number of urinals in the locker rooms.
The big league is not expecting cities to building 45,000-seat stadiums. McCormick holds about a tenth of that.
Lantz said all minor league facilities are reviewed every three years, with an "evaluator" measuring the size of clubhouses, training rooms, indoor batting cages, and checking them for quality.
"In most parks, there might be one or two things a year that need to be touched up," Lantz said. "In most cases, they're simple fixes."
One complicating factor is that Minor League teams have more staffers traveling with them now than in days past, as they've added positions such as team nutritionists, strength and conditioning coaches and even video scouting coordinators.
"So now you might have nine people traveling with a team, when it used to be four," Lantz said. "So you need more lockers for those people, and that nutrition person will need access to a kitchen area. The strength and conditioning coach needs a weight room to work in, and the video scouting person will need a place to set up three or four laptops so the players can look at their at-bats and check the opposing pitcher."
In short, "You're talking about a lot of space needs for a team that's coming in and playing against you, and those are some of the upgrades MLB is looking for," Lantz continued.
The ESPN article noted that Major League Baseball sent a statement to the New York Times, which read:
"We are in discussions with the owners of the Minor League teams to reorganize elements of the system with the goal of improving the working conditions of minor league players, including upgrading the facilities to Major League standards, increasing player compensation, reducing travel time between affiliates for road games, improving transportation and hotel accommodations, increasing the number of off days, and providing better geographical affiliations between the MLB clubs and affiliates."
The Times also reported that Pat O'Conner, president of Minor League Baseball, advised teams not to make any major decisions or financial commitments beyond the 2020 season. Some teams could lose their affiliation with Major League teams, and those 40 teams not included may be reclassified as a "Dream League," run by MLB and Minor League Baseball and including undrafted players, ESPN reported.
"It's unfortunate that first proposal got leaked to Baseball America, but we'd like to emphasize this is a lengthy process," Lantz told me. "We knew this was a concern, and we knew this was coming, so we started the ball rolling a little early, knowing full well some of the things they'll want to see done. We want to give teams as much time as possible to get things done."
The Minor League plans to work hard on helping teams meet the standards.
"Our goal is to fight for the 160 teams we have and keep professional baseball growing in as many of the 160 markets as we can," Lantz said.

Texto completo: McDonald's lawsuit claims culture of sexual harassment
A former McDonald's employee who says a manager at a Michigan store grabbed her breasts and buttocks is suing the chain, blaming her mistreatment on what she calls a culture of sexual harassment at the fast-food company. The former employee and the American Civil Liberties Union filed the suit in state court, as hundreds of McDonald's employees in Michigan prepared to go on strike to protest the company's handling of such allegations and demand a labor union. It increased the scrutiny of McDonald's a little over a week after its CEO, Steve Easterbrook, was fired for having a relationship with a subordinate. The lawsuit named Chicago-based McDonald's Corp., as well as the franchise owner. In a statement responding to the suit, McDonald's said it was working with franchisees to create safe workplaces.
Burger King bringing a plant-based Whopper to Europe
Burger King is introducing a plant-based burger in Europe. But it's not the Impossible Whopper that has been a hit with U.S. customers. Instead, a Dutch company called The Vegetarian Butcher will supply the new soy-based Rebel Whopper set to go on sale at 2,400 restaurants across Europe. Impossible Foods' burger hasn't been approved for sale in the European Union because it contains genetically modified ingredients. A spokesman for the Dutch government confirmed that Impossible submitted an application last month and is awaiting a ruling from the European Food Safety Authority.
Facebook Pay consolidates payments across apps
Facebook is taking another step to tie its massive social media applications more closely together at a time when there are mounting calls for the company to be broken up. The company said it is consolidating its payment processing for Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp into one brand called Facebook Pay. Deb Liu, Facebook's VP of marketplace and commerce, said the singular brand should eventually help users understand why their shipping address or payment information shows up in Instagram, for example, if it wasn't entered there but was put into Facebook. The move comes as Facebook and other tech companies face increased antitrust scrutiny.
Dell unveils subscription model to counter Amazon, Microsoft
Dell will offer business clients more flexible, on-demand buying options for products like servers and personal computers, seeking to counter the lure of cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft. Customers will now be able to use Dell's hardware, based on their consumption, as a service or through a subscription, the Round Rock, Texas-based company said in a statement. Public cloud titans such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure have cut demand for data-center hardware as more businesses look to rent computing power rather than invest in their own server farms.

Texto completo: Nov. 13, 1946 : An airplane flew over Mount Greylock (above, as seen from Adams) in Western Massachusetts and seeded the clouds with super-cooled ice crystals. The first-ever artificially produced snow melted before it hit the slopes below, but the event created a national sensation.
The experiment marked the first field test of scientist Vincent Schaefer's laboratory experiments in which he produced precipitation by adding dry ice to lower the temperature of a chilled chamber.
Schaefer, a self-taught chemist who worked for General Electric, seeded the clouds from an altitude of 14,000 feet. Flying over Greylock (at almost 3,500 feet, it is the highest point in the Berkshires), Schaefer dropped his pellets and produced a similar effect in the clouds, which resulted in snow that fell an estimated 3,000 feet before evaporating in the dry air.
“It seemed as though the cloud almost exploded," he wrote in a notebook after the experiment, according to his New York Times obituary in 1983.
Artificial snow, like so many other scientific innovations, was born out of wartime necessity. In this case, it began during World War II and experiments with the creation of artificial fog, which was meant to conceal ships at sea.
Although some people protested that tampering with nature might not be safe or proper, within three years ski resorts across the United States were experimenting with snowmaking.
The snow cannon was invented in 1950. Snow is made by combining water and air, often compressed and pressurized through hoses.
By 1952, the first snowmaking machinery was in regular use at a Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel (one of the largest Borscht Belt resorts), near the village of Liberty, N.Y.
Today, virtually every American ski area produces artificial snow, and snowmaking is a multimillion-dollar global business.
For his part, Schaefer was remembered as “the first person to actually do something about the weather and not just talk about it," according to his obituary. “Hopes grew that cloud seeding could fight drought, control storms, reduce hail, quench forest fires, and even guarantee a white Christmas."

Texto completo: Impeachable intent
Re "The ever-changing story," column, Nov. 10
Several Republicans assert that what President Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart in that July phone call was not criminal or impeachable. They admit that Trump threatened to withhold congressionally allocated aid if the Ukrainian government did not announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.

But the aid was eventually provided and no investigation occurred, Republicans say, so no impeachable offense was committed.
Here's the problem: Trump's threat itself violated the law.
If law enforcement authorities learn of a plot to bomb a shopping center, the act of planning the attack is considered a crime and the person is arrested. If they learn a student is planning to bring a weapon to school to harm others, that student is charged with a crime. If they learn a person is demanding payment to prevent a kidnapping, that extortion is a crime.
In these hypothetical cases, the intended event did not occur, only the threat. And that is a crime.

I thoroughly enjoyed Doyle McManus' column.
But, I wish the media would stop using the term "quid pro quo," as I think there are a lot of Americans who do not understand it. Reporters should should use the term "bribery," which is what Trump did with regard to Ukraine.
People understand bribery, and it is one of the three specifically named offenses in the U.S. Constitution for which a president can be impeached.
Mary Duque

Sen. Lindsey Graham's latest arguments for not impeaching the president include the terms "inept," "incoherent" and "incapable."

LAX-adjacenttent housing
Re "A plan to rapidly house L.A.'s homeless," Opinion, Nov. 10
I read with great interest Rob Eshman's op-ed article suggesting installing temporary tent housing for homeless people on the empty land surrounding Los Angeles International Airport, particularly to the north.
My family lives half a mile to the north of LAX and I can tell you why that land is empty, why the homes that once stood there are gone, and why putting tent housing there is a really bad idea. The airport noise and exhaust are horrific, and nobody could endure it.
Thanks to the city agency in charge of LAX, my house is soundproofed with quadruple-pane windows, solid-core doors, and insulation above the ceilings and below the floors. Yet we still hear the airplanes all day and night, and anyone who walks or bikes on the surrounding roads can smell the planes' exhaust.
Inhabitants of any temporary housing would be continuously subjected to the din and stench, and with only a tent to protect them. I wouldn't wish this torture on my worst enemy.
Margaret Parkhurst
Los Angeles
::
Thank you, Rob Eshman.
His suggestion of meeting the urgency of local homelessness with reinforced tent structures has been advocated for a long time, but our politicians are obsessed with long-range construction projects that cost half a million dollars per unit.
I hope everyone sends copies of this article to their elected representatives.

Why isn't building something like an Olympic village for people currently "tenting" on the street a win-win?

A moderate again in 2020?
Re "Angling for the middle ground," Nov. 11
This article states that many Democrats are "anxious that an uncompromising progressive at the top of the ticket could push swing states into President Trump's hands." Perhaps this could more accurately say that people comfortable with the status quo think an uncompromising progressive will appeal to swing states in the general election.
Many of those who voted for Trump in 2016 were unhappy with the policies of both parties that had steadily eroded the economic well-being of their families. That they would be particularly turned off by that pillar of the establishment, Hillary Clinton, is hardly a surprise.
With all due respect, I suggest that they do provide fertile ground for an "uncompromising progressive."
Reneau Reneau
Inglewood
::
We know that winning a presidential election requires capturing the middle ground, but that shouldn't make us overlook the fact that the middle ground can be moved to the left, as with Franklin D. Roosevelt, or to the right, as with Ronald Reagan.
Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is aiming at the middle ground by promising moderation and reconciliation with Republicans. That's one reason the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is Wall Street's favorite Democrat.
Unfortunately, favoring a Wall Street-aligned Democrat is like supporting cops who can get along with the mafia.
Republicans sought to block every initiative by President Obama, regardless of whether it benefited the public. Their opposition to healthcare arguably cost American lives. Republicans, as economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote, are "perfectly willing to sell out America if that's what it takes to get tax cuts for the wealthy."

Re "Is she too far left on health?" Nov. 11
Sen. Elizabeth Warren has let herself be trapped by fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders' nonsensical "Medicare for all" fantasy. The current Medicare for seniors isn't free to them.
Warren may not want to talk about it, but support for free healthcare and more open borders will kill Democrats. The destructive power of recent progressives has been clear for the last 20 years.
In 2000, Ralph Nader's Green Party candidacy gave us George W. Bush's first term as president. Four years later, then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom started issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, giving the right a political issue that resulted in a second term for Bush. Those eight years gave us Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito.
Sanders was a critical part of Hillary Clinton's loss in 2016, which gave us Supreme Court Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. Sanders' influence remains strong for reasons I cannot fathom and will give us four additional years of the unthinkable.

It's about the vets, not the wars
Re "How to honor our warriors," Opinion, Nov. 11
Gil Barndollar's conclusion, "This Veterans Day, Americans should think less about their warriors and more about their wars," dishonors those who served.
Since World War II, this country has been involved in wars that have been found ultimately to be based on poor judgment. Those errors are political and regrettably continue because of our leadership (or lack thereof).
Veterans pay the price regardless of the reason. Combat veterans never forget their experiences. Mine are still vivid more than 50 years after I was a battalion surgeon with the Marines in Vietnam.
Stuart Fisher
Los Angeles
::
The United States' endless wars since 1945 were authorized by the president, not, as the Constitution requires, declared by Congress. Therefore, all those wars have been unconstitutional and illegal.
Our widespread unease about the "not worth it" wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sacrificing our soldiers should escalate to revulsion and outrage at the injuring and killing, mostly by aerial bombing, of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in those countries. All in our name.
The citizens' ignorance of and indifference to their government's actions, especially in the world's most powerful nation, can have dire consequences. History provides many examples how.

Texto completo: National Nurses United, the country's biggest nurses' union, also endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2016. This time, it chose him over Elizabeth Warren, who has laid out her own Medicare for all plan.
WASHINGTON -- The country's largest nurses' union will endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for president this week, a significant boost to his campaign from a major ally in the fight for his signature health care proposal.
The union, National Nurses United, fervently supported Mr. Sanders's last bid for the White House in 2016, and its members have been significant players in Democratic politics since then, showing up in red T-shirts to support Mr. Sanders's progressive allies in intraparty battles. They have also canvassed neighborhoods in swing congressional districts, urging voters to get behind "Medicare for all," Mr. Sanders's plan for a nationalized health insurance system.
"We know what we have done and what it takes to bring about fundamental change, and it's massive organizing and a mass movement," said Jean Ross, a co-president of the union. "Of all the candidates, Bernie is the one who understands that."
The union plans to formally endorse Mr. Sanders on Friday at a news conference in Oakland, Calif.
After being so tied to Mr. Sanders in 2016, the nurses' union was unlikely to endorse anyone else in the 2020 race. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, was the only candidate to sit for an in-person interview with the union to seek its endorsement; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called in on a video chat and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., sent a three-minute video. Union officials said they had invited former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of California to interview but each declined to do so.
Ms. Warren, another leading candidate for the nomination and Mr. Sanders's top progressive rival, has also laid out a sweeping plan for single-payer health insurance, but the union stuck with the original architect of Medicare for all.
"We enjoyed the difficulty this time around because last time the field was so barren" aside from Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ross said.
The endorsement also brings Mr. Sanders the support of the union's super PAC, a thorny issue given that Mr. Sanders, like most of the Democrats seeking the party's 2020 nomination, has disavowed support from super PACs.
In 2016 the union's super PAC spent $ 5 million backing Mr. Sanders in the primary contest against Hillary Clinton, a relative pittance in the world of super PACs (the one supporting Jeb Bush blew through $ 87 million). Still, it spent more money backing Mr. Sanders than was spent by any other super PAC on behalf of Mrs. Clinton or other Democrats in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses.
The union's super PAC "will be activated" on behalf of Mr. Sanders, said Bonnie Castillo, the union's executive director. But she said union members and the super PAC would not attack Mr. Sanders's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.
"We're not going negative," she said. "We are a very positive force. It's a reflection of who we are as a profession. We are healers."
When talking to voters, Mr. Sanders often rails against the influence of money in politics, vowing to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling in 2010 that opened the super PAC era in American politics. Since Mr. Biden dropped his resistance last month to receiving the support of such groups, Mr. Sanders has become more pointed.
"I don't need a super PAC," he said during a town hall-style event last month in Marshalltown, Iowa, in response to a question from the audience about Mr. Biden. "I am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country."
This weekend, he continued the theme, saying, "We don't have a super PAC," at a rally in Coralville, Iowa.
But Mr. Sanders did not disavow support from the nurses' union's super PAC in 2016, even as he pointed out that he did not have a super PAC of his own. On Monday, Mr. Sanders thanked the nurses' union for its support but did not address its super PAC.
"What the nurses understand is that the current health care system is not only dysfunctional but extraordinarily cruel," Mr. Sanders said in a statement relayed by his campaign. "Together we are finally going to do what should have been done decades ago and make sure that every man, woman and child in this country has quality health care as a human right."
Few major labor unions, typically significant players in Democratic Party politics, have endorsed candidates in the 2020 presidential contest. Mr. Biden kicked off his campaign in a Teamsters hall with the endorsement of the International Association of Fire Fighters. The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America backed Mr. Sanders in August. The National Union of Healthcare Workers endorsed both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren in September.
National Nurses United was born out of a 2009 merger of three smaller unions. The organization, with about 155,000 members, is a staunch proponent of liberal politics and movement-building in the Sanders mold. The union's nurses were active in providing health care to protesters at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Lower Manhattan in 2011, and the organization has lobbied forcefully for single-payer health care and a financial transaction tax.
Deborah Burger, a union co-president, said if Mr. Sanders did not win the primary the union was committed to fighting for whoever wins the party's nomination against President Trump.
"We have made a commitment to endorse Bernie Sanders," she said. "But in the end we have made a commitment to our communities that we live in that we will do whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump."

Texto completo: She had it all: A great personal story as a first-generation American, a likable personality, a solid political record, an uncommon ability to hit the ground running with ease and competence, and a golden opportunity that made her a household name and earned her an international reputation.
Then she wrote a book " and blew it.
Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor " and more recently the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations " sandblasted her carefully crafted facade and, in a transparent act of virtue signaling, stabbed two of her former colleagues and fellow Cabinet members between the shoulder blades. Her return to the public stage can best be described as a goddess ex machina , whereby she descended from the upper realms to dispense wisdom and hurl thunderbolts into the hearts of any who would deny her.
No one did. Indeed, for the past several days, Haley and her just- released memoir, 'With All Due Respect: Defending America With Grit and Grace,' have been the talk of the town. News shows have homed in on a single allegation that seems to have been designed to produce TV teasers about 'shocking revelations' " that Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state, and John F. Kelly, former White House chief of staff and a retired Marine Corps general, had tried to undermine President Trump and asked Haley to help.
More to the political point, Haley essentially launched her next act " possibly as Trump's vice-presidential running mate (with all due respect to Mike Pence), or as a 2024 presidential candidate. Like clockwork, the president tweeted kudos and encouraged followers to buy the book.
Whatever her ultimate motive, Haley clearly decided that stepping on Tillerson and Kelly was in her political interest. There can have been no other reason to drag these two honorable, accomplished men through the mud for, by her own account, trying to mitigate some of Trump's more destructive impulses.
Rather than sign on, Haley claims to have been offended by this conspiracy of good intentions. In her book and in several recent television appearances, her halo blindingly bright, Haley has said Kelly and Tillerson thought they were aiming to 'save the country' by attempting end runs around Trump.
They wouldn't have been the only ones, according to last year's anonymous op-ed in the New York Times in which the author similarly claimed that White House staffers and officials have been trying to save the country by working from within, sometimes against the president's expressed wishes, which can change in a flash.
The resurfacing of these claims " and the anonymous author's upcoming book " could help explain why good men and women continue to enter this decidedly dysfunctional White House. Being inside the White House may be a better position from which to manage the beast within.
It's a pickle. Do you ignore an immature president and take turns plugging the hole in the dike? (Hey, Haley, we could use some help over here!) Or, do you do everything in your power to avoid actions that might cause the dike to crumble? One thing you don't do, obviously, is confide in an unscrupulous, self-serving future presidential candidate.
Haley's loyalty to Trump at the expense of Tillerson and Kelly is both a hat-tip to Trump's base and a curtsy to the president. She plainly made a political calculation that people would find 'her truth' courageous and that flattery aimed at Trump would not be wasted. 'To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing, and it goes against the Constitution and it goes against what the American people want,' Haley intoned during a CBS News interview.
This would be true if said president weren't almost daily threatening to destroy order in the civilized world and didn't behave as though he were checking off the characteristics of narcissistic personality disorder. But there's an inherent irony in banking one's future on preaching loyalty through disloyalty. To what end does such a revelation, if true, warrant such tongue-wagging?
Alas, it seems that Haley, whom I've admired since before she became governor, bought her own myth and sold it cheap. Through her preening virtue, she has revealed herself to be more Lucy from 'Peanuts' than Erin Brockovich " a cartoonish fussbudget stumping for blue ribbons and bows rather than a whistleblower acting in the service of the greater good.
Sad.

Texto completo: Headnote YOUR SECRET CONSUMER SCORING FILE
As consumers, we all have "secret scores": hidden ratings that determine how long each of us waits on hold when calling a business, whether we can return items at a store, and what type of service we receive. A low score sends you to the back of the queue; high scores get you elite treatment.
Every so often, journalists lament these systems' inaccessibility. They're "largely invisible to the public," The New York Times wrote in 2012. "Most people have no inkling they even exist," The Wall Street Journal said in 2018. Most recently, in April, The Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims looked at a company called Sift, whose proprietary scoring system tracks 16,000 factors for companies like Airbnb and OkCupid. "Sift judges whether or not you can be trusted," he wrote, "yet there's no file with your name that it can produce upon request."
As of this summer, though, Sift does have a file on you, which it can produce upon request. I got mine and I found it shocking: More than 400 pages long, it contained all the messages I'd ever sent to hosts on Airbnb; years of Yelp delivery orders; a log of every time I'd opened the Coinbase app on my iPhone. Many entries included detailed information about the device I used to do these things, including my IP address at the time.
Sift knew, for example, that I'd used my iPhone to order chicken tikka masala, vegetable samosas and garlic naan on a Saturday night in April three years ago. It knew I used my Apple laptop to sign into Coinbase in January 2017 to change my password. Sift knew about a nightmare Thanksgiving I had in California's wine country, as captured in my messages to the Airbnb host of a rental called "Cloud 9."
"The heater in the room with the big couch has been running since we got here and we're not sure how to turn it off," I wrote on Wednesday afternoon.
"The air in the main house is really musty, like maybe there's a mildew or mold issue," I wrote on Thursday, then added apologetically, "Sorry to be bothering you on Thanksgiving!"
"The bathroom flooded during the rain storm. The carpet outside the bathroom is very wet," I wrote on Friday. "Ants are coming in from the interior wall of the house."
This may sound somewhat comical, but the companies gathering and paying for this data find it extremely valuable for rooting out fraud and increasing the revenue they can collect from big spenders. Sift has this data because the company has been hired by Airbnb, Yelp and Coinbase to identify stolen credit cards and help spot identity thieves and abusive behavior.
Still, the fact that obscure companies are accumulating information about years of our online and offline behavior is unsettling, and at a minimum it creates the potential for abuse or discrimination - particularly when those companies decide we don't stack up.
How to get your data
There are many companies in the business of scoring consumers. The challenge is to identify them. Once you do, the instructions on getting your data will probably be buried in their privacy policies. Ctrl-F "request" is a good way to find it. Most of these companies will also require you to send a photo of your driver's license to verify your identity. Here are five that say they'll share the data they have on you.
* Sift, which determines consumer trustworthiness, asks you to email privacy@sift.com. You'll then have to fill out a Google form.
* Zeta Global, which identifies people with a lot of money to spend, lets you request your data via an online form.
* Retail Equation, which helps companies such as Best Buy and Sephora decide whether to accept or reject a product return, will send you a report if you email returnactivityreport@theretailequation.com.
* Riskified, which develops fraud scores, will tell you what data it has gathered on your possible crookedness if you contact privacy@riskified.com.
* Kustomer, a database company that provides what it calls "unprecedented insight into a customer's past experiences and current sentiment," tells people to email privacy@kustomer.com.
Just because the companies say they'll provide your data doesn't mean they actually will.
Kustomer, for example, gave me the runaround. When I first contacted the company from my personal email address, a representative wrote back that I would have the report by the end of the week. After a couple of weeks passed, I emailed again and was told the company was "instituting a new process" and had "hit a few snags." I never got the report. When I contacted a company spokeswoman, I was told that I would need to get my data instead from the companies that used Kustomer to analyze me.
Thanks, California
Most of the companies only recently started honoring these requests in response to the California Consumer Privacy Act. Set to go into effect in 2020, the law will grant Californians the right to see what data a company holds on them. It follows a 2018 European privacy law, called General Data Protection Regulation, that lets Europeans gain access to and delete their online data. Some companies have decided to honor the laws' transparency requirements even for those of us who are not lucky enough to live in Europe or the Golden State.
"We expect these are the first of many laws," said Jason Tan, chief executive of Sift. The company, founded in 2011, started making files available to "all end users" this June, even where not legally required to do so - such as in New York, where I live. "We're trying to be more privacy conscious. We want to be good citizens and stewards of the internet. That includes transparency."
I was inspired to chase down my data files by a June report from the Consumer Education Foundation, which wants the Federal Trade Commission to investigate secret surveillance scores "generated by a shadowy group of privacy-busting firms that operate in the dark recesses of the American marketplace." The report named 11 firms that rate shoppers, potential renters and prospective employees. I pursued data from the firms most likely to have information on me.
One of the co-authors of the report was Laura Antonini, policy director at the Consumer Education Foundation. At my suggestion, she sought out her own data. She got a voluminous report from Sift, and like me, had several companies come up empty-handed despite their claims to have information on hundreds of millions of people. Retail Equation, the company that helps decide whether customers should be allowed to make a return, had nothing on me and one entry for Antonini: a return of three items worth $78 to Victoria's Secret in 2009.
"I don't really care that these data analytics companies know I made a return to Victoria's Secret in 2009, or that I had chicken kebabs delivered to my apartment, but how is this information being used against me when you generate scores for your clients?" Antonini said. "That is what consumers deserve to know. The lack of the information I received back is the most alarming part of this."
In other words, most of these companies are just showing you the data they used to make decisions about you, not how they analyzed that data or what their decision was.
'It's incredible what machines can do when they can look under every stone'
My Sift file didn't come with a credit-score-type number at the top, but many of the entries included a percentage rating as to whether the behavior was "abuse" or "not abuse," "normal" or "fraud" or "account takeover" versus"not account takeover."
When I told Tan that I was alarmed to see my Airbnb messages and Yelp orders in the hands of a company I'd never heard of before, he responded by saying that Sift doesn't sell or share any of the data it has with third parties.
"We are in the business of predicting risks for particular events at particular times, for particular fraud," he said. Sift is looking at all my online activity to make sure it's me, and not someone trying to impersonate or hack me.
"Behind the scenes, we're trying to create connections between fraudulent accounts," Tan said. To score risk, the more data Sift has, the better. It's able to use what it knows across the accounts of all its clients, so if a certain device has been used to make an order on Yelp with a stolen credit card, Sift can flag that device when it shows up on Airbnb.
"We're not looking at the data. It's just machines and algorithms doing this work," Tan said. "But it's incredible what machines can do when they can look under every stone."

Texto completo: Los Angeles • The Walt Disney Co.’s high-profile streaming service arrived with technological glitches on Tuesday, leaving thousands of subscribers across the United States logging on to find error messages instead of movies and television shows
The problem, which Disney blamed on demand, appeared to affect multiple platforms, with users on Twitter posting screenshots of error images on iPhones and complaining of issues on Android and Amazon Fire devices. More than 8,000 Disney Plus subscribers appeared to be affected around 9 a.m. Tuesday, according to DownDetector.com, which monitors online malfunctions.
“The consumer demand for Disney Plus has exceeded our high expectations,” Disney said in a morning statement. “We are pleased by this incredible response and are working to quickly resolve the current user issue. We appreciate your patience.”
Five hours later, DownDetector showed significant improvement, although some users in big cities — New York, Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles — were still having trouble using Disney Plus to stream video. Others were having problems with their passwords or upset that the Disney Plus app was difficult to find on Apple’s store. Some users reported on Twitter that their attempts to watch Disney Plus content were met with error messages, accompanied by a perplexed astronaut Mickey or a glum Wreck-It Ralph.
For others — the vast majority of members, Disney insiders insisted — the platform appeared to work just fine. And Wall Street seemed confident that Disney Plus would resolve its tech problems: Disney’s shares rose on Tuesday.
Disney Plus, which costs $7 a month (or free for a year to many Verizon customers), offers Disney, Pixar, “Star Wars” and Marvel movies; 30 seasons of “The Simpsons,” about 7,500 episodes of old Disney-branded TV shows; and much-anticipated new offerings like the live-action “Star Wars” series “The Mandalorian” and a live-action “Lady and the Tramp.”
Even huge internet companies like Facebook experience glitches. But the pressure was on Disney to make the rollout of Disney Plus seamless, in part because the company has struggled with internet ventures in the past. Disney has also heralded the streaming platform as a transformative event, moving the conglomerate into the Netflix-defined future of media and away from the cable business, which is in cord-cutting decline.
In recent months, when analysts and reporters asked Disney executives about the company’s preparedness, the response was unbridled confidence, in particular from Michael Paull, president of Disney Streaming Services. Paull, a former Amazon executive, runs the part of Disney that was formerly called BamTech. Disney paid $2.5 billion to acquire BamTech, a New York company that handles streaming for Major League Baseball and helped HBO build its video app.
“We’re confident that we’re really ready for scale — that the BamTech platform has been tested under pretty interesting circumstances, including this past Saturday night, when you had hundreds of thousands of people signing up for a pay-per-view event in a very, very concentrated time,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, told analysts on an earnings-related conference call last week.
He was referring to an Ultimate Fighting Championship event.
Earlier this year, Disney spent several months testing a trial version of Disney Plus in the Netherlands. The response was “very, very positive — not just the fact that there was an enthusiasm for the service, but we had a good sense about how people were using it,” Iger said on the call. Analysts estimate that Disney Plus will have 8 million subscribers in total by the end of December; Disney has predicted the service will grow to as many as 90 million members by 2024.
Tuesday’s rollout of Disney Plus in the United States and Canada was heavily marketed across most branches of the company, with buses at Walt Disney World in Florida covered in ads and the host of ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars” urging viewers to sign up for the service during a live broadcast.
Disney Plus is scheduled to arrive in Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico on Nov. 19. Countries across Western Europe will gain access in March, Iger said last week. It was unclear how or if Tuesday’s technical issues will affect those plans.
Some people who had Disney Plus problems Tuesday seemed understanding of Disney’s learning curve.
“I am in the middle of watching a movie and while it is playing the circle in the middle of the screen keeps spinning,” Tanessa Haddock said in a post on DownDetector’s message board. “Just a little annoying. But they have to work out all the bugs. It’s all new. It will take time.”

Juiced-ball debate looms as GMs gather

Texto completo: Watching from afar, Diamondbacks lefty Robbie Ray noticed something different about the baseballs in play during the postseason last month. For six months, the majors experienced a home run explosion. In October, Ray noticed, the opposite was true.
"They went back to the old baseballs," Ray said. "It looked like it, anyways."
The numbers support what Ray thought he saw, and the difference between the way the balls flew during the regular season with how they behaved in the postseason makes for a confusing juxtaposition as the offseason gets underway.
As baseball's general managers arrived in town on Monday for their annual meetings – they are being held this week at a resort in Paradise Valley – a question seemed to loom over the sport: What baseballs will be in play in 2020, the ones from the regular season or those in use during the playoffs?
"I do think that's a fair and real question," said a high-ranking executive with an American League team. "And I don't know."
"It is easily the biggest question of the offseason," a prominent player agent said.
Baseball didn't just set a record this past year for single-season home runs – it obliterated it, setting a new mark with 2 1/2 weeks left in the season. Ten players hit at least 40 homers, 58 hit at least 30 homers and a whopping 129 players hit 20 or more. In 2014, one player launched 40, 11 players reached 30 and 57 players hit 20.
The uptick left little doubt that something had changed with the composition of the ball. Even Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged as much when he said that while there were no major changes to the way the ball was manufactured the pill at the ball's core could be more accurately centered, thus allowing it to fly with less resistance.
However, something strange happened in October. The ball stopped carrying. Two weeks into the playoffs, Baseball Prospectus' Rob Arthur detailed how his statistical model indicated that home runs were down roughly 50 percent.
"The more aerodynamic it is, the further it's going to fly for a given exit velocity," Arthur said. "What happened was, the baseball became a lot less aerodynamic. It's hard to say why this is, but we have enough data to be absolutely sure that it happened."
Arthur said there often are fluctuations in how the baseballs perform from month to month in a season, but he said change from September to October was the most drastic on record. During the World Series, Manfred denied the idea that anything had changed.
"I can tell you one thing for absolutely certain: Just like every other year, the balls that were used in this postseason were selected from lots that were used during the regular season," he said, according to the New York Times. "There was no difference."
With baseball's offseason beginning in earnest with the GM meetings, the affair begs a question: How are clubs supposed to determine what versions of players they are acquiring if they don't know what version of the ball will be in play?
Arthur, for one, sees a potentially tricky situation, one he said "absolutely should" be a consideration as teams make decisions.
"I've been surprised in conversations I've had with front office people how little attention they seem to be paying to the baseball and the changes that have occurred," Arthur said. "But it definitely makes a difference in how you evaluate a player."
After a game in September, Ray, frustrated by a home run he thought was the product of a so-called juiced ball, sounded off to reporters, saying he wants to see more transparency from the league. He repeated that desire in an interview last week, particularly after watching fly balls he thought would have been home runs in the playoffs die short of the warning track.
"I just feel like being honest with us, being honest, telling us what you're doing to the baseball, your reasoning behind it, and players will accept it," Ray said.
An MLB spokesman said the ball is among the topics to be covered by the GMs in formal meetings this week.

Should you hire a doula?

Texto completo: Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.
When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine. l Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die. l The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, First Lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities.
"The color of your skin," Tammy Murphy said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education. With assertiveness. With help from people you trust.
And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood.
A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner.
They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family.
When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America (DONA), she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated.
"For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor.
"Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right.
Advocacy can be especially important for women of color.
As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women.
Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com that New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African-American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa. "Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors.
Alynson Sloan-Anderson, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey, said the support of a doula can mitigate some of that bone-deep stress that African-American women carry.
"It's important because it empowers black and brown women who have traditionally been underrepresented and overlooked," Sloan-Anderson said. "There's a level of trust that needs to be built up, to where they can say, 'I trust you to come into my home,' and we go in with a non-judgmental attitude, and help them use their voices and advocate for themselves to ensure their health and the health of their babies."
"I have always had women of color in my client base," Ramos said, "but I am hearing from more African-American women professionals who are reaching out in fear. I ask them, 'Why do you want a doula?' and they say, 'I am going to die. My cousin almost died. No one listened to her and she was hemorrhaging.' We have to get them to let go of the fear."
"We need an intervention," Hill said, "because doctors aren't listening, not hearing, they're just going by the book. Not everyone's body is the same."
Expanding access to doulas Under the umbrella of Nurture NJ, the state Department of Health's "Healthy Women, Healthy Families" program has provided funding for partners to hire 77 outreach workers – 40 doulas, 29 community health workers and eight community health worker supervisors – to improve the health of African-American women.

Texto completo: The principal attraction of VentiCordi Chamber Music is that its programs are built largely of works that listeners rarely encounter, except perhaps at summer festivals where string and wind players join forces to play works for instrumental combinations less common than string quartets or piano trios.
It may seem odd that mixed-timbre ensembles are so rare, but consider the logistics: a string quartet will keep all four of its players busy in every concert, but the repertory for strings and winds together is more chaotic: A program is likely to require a different combination of instruments for each piece.
For its concert Sunday afternoon at Woodfords Congregational Church, VentiCordi's directors - violinist Dean Stein of the Portland String Quartet, and oboist Kathleen McNerney, who teaches at several colleges in the area - found a way to mitigate that chaos somewhat: Prokofiev's Quintet (Op. 39), completed in 1924, and TorbjÃ¶rn Helander's Allegro Capriccioso, both scored for the unusual combination of clarinet, oboe, violin, viola and double bass, framed the program. Between them, members of the quintet split into smaller groups for Michael Haydn's Divertimento, for oboe, viola and bass; and Harold Schiffman's Duo Concertante, for violin and clarinet.
Helander, a Swedish composer born in 1971, writes in an appealing, neo-Romantic style, with an accent that calls to mind an early- to mid-20th century French style, with hints of a Russian accent; you would never have guessed that the work was completed only last year. I'm not sure how much that matters now, with composers freely combining influences and styles. In any case, Helander's Allegro Capriccioso is an engaging piece, with tightly interwoven themes and a laid-back sensibility that keeps the music's energetic undercurrents in check.
Those qualities, and Helander's gracefully melodic style, make the piece an appealing curtain-raiser, and VentiCordi's players gave it a finely polished reading before turning to the Divertimento by Michael Haydn, the younger brother of the better-known Joseph.
It's tempting to say that Divertimento hints at why Michael never attained Joseph's mythic stature. It is a skilled work of its time, with elegant dance movements, nicely-wrought variations and a bright, lively Presto finale with an especially appealing oboe line - but it lacks the sparkle and wit that enlivens so many of his brother's chamber works.
Of course, it's a Divertimento - an entertainment, meant to help wealthy patrons enjoy a social evening, and not intended for the ages - and it would be unfair to judge the composer by it, if the same could not be said of his other works (there's a popular Trumpet Concerto, for example), and if similar works by his brother weren't so much more interesting. Delightful as the performance was, there were moments when I wondered whether this six-movement, nearly half-hour work was really worth reviving in 2019.
I found Schiffman's Duo Concertante (1993) far more engaging, not least because the demands it made on the two players - Stein and clarinetist Gary Gorczyca - seemed more challenging and engaging. Schiffman's style is fairly conservative, though not so much as Helander's; his themes have a measure of chromaticism and angularity that locates them firmly in our time, but they are not so spiky as to put listeners at arm's length. After a few moments, you find yourself forgetting about the composer's melodic accent, and listening instead to the suaveness of the counterpoint between the violin and clarinet lines.
In its best moments, Schiffman's score lets both instruments sing, and Stein and Gorczyca made the most of the opportunities the composer provided. And they remained in top form when McNerney, violist Kimberly Lehmann and bassist Anthony D'Amico joined them for a focused, vigorous performance of the Prokofiev.
Much of the music's energy comes from its genesis as "Trapeze," a circus-themed ballet score that Prokofiev composed while also working on his Second Symphony. Parts of the work are steeped in that bitter harmonic edge that was so central to Prokofiev's being that it is heard even in his most cheerful work, yet Prokoviev's inventive themes, and the richness of the interplay between the instruments, give this quintet a strong appeal.
Like the Haydn, Prokofiev's quintet it is not heard often, and the VentiCordi players made a strong case for it. But if the Haydn left you doubting that a second-drawer entertainment from the late 18th century had much to say to us now, the Prokofiev's internal blend of vitality and dourness, as well as its melodic richness and technical virtuosity, left you wanting to hear it again, and soon.

Texto completo: Coeur d’Alene, Idaho • From her office next to the public computer terminals, Bette Ammon finds herself peering through a window to watch patrons moving through the Coeur d’Alene library’s nonfiction stacks.
Someone has been hiding books lately — specifically, those that explore politics through a progressive lens or criticize President Donald Trump. They wind up misfiled in out-of-the-way corners where readers will be sure not to find them.
“I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds,” the mystery book relocator wrote in a note left for Ammon, the library director, in the facility’s comment box. “Your liberal angst gives me great pleasure.”
For decades, Coeur d’Alene has navigated a delicate political landscape in northern Idaho, a conservative corner of the country where some have sought refuge from political and social changes elsewhere.
The incidents over this past year — including a missing book that was discovered only this week — were not the first time books have mysteriously disappeared. Thirty years ago, the library lost so many books on human rights to theft that they had to be placed in a locked cabinet. The latest works to be targeted cover a wide range of topics, from gun control and women’s suffrage to LGBTQ issues and how people of color fare in the criminal justice system. About half the books specifically deal with Trump.
While none of the books in the latest incidents appear to have been stolen, some have been hidden in ways that made it nearly impossible to find them when patrons wanted to check them out. They have been discovered inexplicably filed in the wrong sections, hidden behind a row of Stuart Woods novels, or shelved with the spine facing inward.
Ammon said she and other workers at the library have hunches about who might be hiding the books, but they have yet to catch anyone in the act. The perpetrator has some support in the community: After a local television station did a story about the missing books, one person called Ammon to praise whomever had hidden them, complaining that the library only carries books that represent a liberal point of view.
Ammon said she asked the caller to provide a list of books that should be in the stacks, and while the person failed to provide one, she suspects the library already has whatever might be on it.
“We serve the entire community,” Ammon said.
Behind a Lock
The library’s first battle over missing books began in the 1980s, the fallout from a series of conflicts with a group of white supremacists who had settled in the region.
Over the decades, Coeur d’Alene had become a magnet for people looking for a lower cost of living or an outdoors lifestyle away from a major city. Many moved in from California, eager to escape the traffic, crime and smog.
One of them was Richard Butler, a former engineer at Lockheed Martin in California, who bought land north of Coeur d’Alene in the 1970s to build a compound for a white supremacist group known as the Aryan Nations. The group regularly distributed flyers, staged parades around town and held annual summits that brought in neo-Nazis from around the world.
City leaders led efforts to combat the racists, who responded with an intimidation campaign that included a series of bombings in the mid-1980s.
The city was awarded a Raoul Wallenberg Civic Courage Award in 1986 for its role in combating the hate group and used funds from that prize to establish a collection of human rights literature in the library. It included books about the Holocaust, the persecution of African Americans and the history of various religions.
Then the books started disappearing.
“It was just unconscionable,” said Kathleen Sayler, a longtime member of the library’s board of trustees. The library had a limited budget, Sayler said, and the director at the time decided that the best way to protect the books was to put a lock on the floor-to-ceiling glass cabinet where they were kept. They stayed there until Ammon took over the job in 2005 and decided they should be integrated into the rest of the library’s collection.
“My theory is, why do you have something if people can’t take it and read it?” she said.
Hiding Spots
The latest wave of book disappearances started in 2018. In August of that year, Ammon got the anonymous letter in the comment box.
The note helped the library staff make sense of a recent trend of strange book wanderings. Over the months, they found books moved from prominent displays to the wrong stacks or hidden behind rows of books against a back wall, near a pillar labeled “Teen Zone.”
Some dealt with social issues, such as “The Women’s Suffrage Movement.” One book, “Guns Down,” detailed a political strategy for defeating the National Rifle Association.
And the incidents have continued.
Last month, Melissa Searle said she was restocking the shelves and noticed another book misplaced: “Punishment Without Crime,” a book about how drawn-out misdemeanor prosecutions consign the poor and people of color to unpayable fines and lost jobs. It was supposed to be out front in a prominent display with other new titles but instead was in a random area of the nonfiction stacks. On Tuesday, Searle found “The Hidden History of Guns and the Second Amendment” hidden behind other books on the bottom shelf of the fiction section.
Several books critical of Trump have recently been targeted, including “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” “Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents” and “Whose Boat Is This Boat?”
At times, because the books were missing, the library was forced to buy new copies. Later, after the missing ones were found, the library found itself with up to three copies of a few works, including “Under Fire: Reporting from the Front Lines of the Trump White House,” written by veteran correspondent April Ryan, one of the few African Americans on the White House beat.
Ammon said she and her employees have tried high-tech methods to contain the problem. The library cannot afford a full surveillance video system, but one staff member tried setting up an ordinary webcam. The overwhelming amount of footage made that untenable. Another staff member brought in a drone to fly over the top of the stacks to see if there were books hidden out of reach. Nothing was spotted.
Through it all, Ammon said, the library has managed to maintain the diversity of its shelves. In the nonfiction stacks, a book by Al Franken, the former Democratic senator, sits right next to one by Newt Gingrich, the former Republican congressman.
“The Dewey decimal system is a great equalizer,” Ammon said.
After author Rick Reilly learned that his book, “Commander in Cheat,” about Trump’s tendency to cheat on the golf course, had gone missing, Reilly announced that he was planning a visit to Coeur d’Alene to do an event.
He said he is going to bring 10 copies of his book to hide around the library for people to discover.

Texto completo: President Trump's supporters have marched out a variety of defenses as the impeachment inquiry by the Democratic House has gained momentum and painted an ever-more detailed picture of Trump appearing to pressure Ukraine to help his domestic political prospects.
Drama is building this week. Americans are expected to get their first public view of witnesses in the inquiry Wednesday and Thursday. Will the testimony persuade voters to back impeachment of the president or leave them unconvinced?
One thing's for sure: You're likely to hear a slew of defenses. And silver-tongued Republican politicians may mix more than one into a single sound bite.
So here's a brief guide to some of Trump supporters' arguments against impeachment, drawn from Globe wire services and major media reports:
The process is flawed Trump's supporters have argued that the impeachment process is flawed. Those arguments have lost some of their bite since the House held a vote on Oct. 31 formalizing the inquiry, and announced the open hearings that begin this week. A senior GOP House aide has told The Associated Press that criticizing the process is one messaging suggestion Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made to his caucus.
On Sunday, Republican senators on Sunday news talk shows said the impeachment hearings wouldn't be fair unless testimony was sought from Democratic candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter, whom Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate, and the whistleblower whose complaint ignited the entire scandal.
US Senator Rand Paul called the hearings “sort of a sham" without the testimony, while US Senator Lindsey Graham called them “a complete joke."
Democrats who have majority control of the House are not seen as likely to agree to the request.
There was no quid pro quo At the outset of the scandal, Trump and his supporters denied repeatedly there was any quid pro quo (something given or received for something else) at all.
“NO quid pro quo!" Trump has tweeted.
That argument has been undercut by the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 call to the Ukrainian president, text messages that have been released, and testimony collected by the House from top US diplomats, including William Taylor Jr., the top US envoy to the Ukraine, and US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.
The quid pro quo didn't end up producing results Some of Trump's defenders say that if Trump did demand that Ukraine investigate Joe and Hunter Biden as well as the 2016 election in exchange for the release of military aid Ukraine desperately needed, it doesn't matter because the aid was eventually released.
“I look at it this way. The aid is there, and the investigations [sought by Trump] didn't happen. So if there was a quid pro quo, it certainly wasn't a very effective one," US Representative Tom Cole said on Nov. 3 on NBC-TV's “Meet the Press."
The Ukrainians didn't know it was a quid pro quo Trump last month retweeted a comment on Fox News by US Representative John Ratcliffe, who said that no witness had “provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can't have a quid pro quo with no quo."'
The New York Times, however, has reported that word of the freezing of military aid did get to high-level Ukrainian officials.
Ambassador Sondland also testified that he told a top Ukrainian official that military aid to the country was being withheld.
The quid pro quo can't be connected directly to Trump Senator Graham has said, “Nobody has testified that there's a quid pro quo ordered by the President of the United States."
US Representative Mark Meadows has also asserted, “When I get to ask questions, and when you see all of the transcripts, you will understand there is no direct linkage to the president of the United States."
Trump's administration is too chaotic to make a quid pro quo Senator Graham last week also made the unusual suggestion that Trump's policy toward Ukraine was so chaotic a quid pro quo could not exist.
“What I can tell you about the policy toward the Ukraine — it was incoherent. It depends on who you talk to. They seem to be incapable of forming a quid pro quo," said Graham. “So no, I find the whole process to be a sham and I'm not going to legitimize it."
Trump was concerned about cleaning up corruption Trump has claimed that he cared about cleaning up corruption in Ukraine, including corrupt acts by the Bidens, whom Trump has accused of various misdeeds.
“Let me tell you, I'm only interested in corruption," Trump said last month.
But no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden has surfaced. And the most recent reports by US officials said Ukraine was making progress in stemming corruption, including a certification from a top Defense Department official in May and a report from the US Agency for International Development covering 2018, The Washington Post reported.
Trump also did not raise corruption concerns in the notorious July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the rough transcript released by the White House. And he previously showed little interest in fighting corruption overseas, or speaking out about it, CNN reported.
There was a quid pro quo, but it's not impeachable “Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy." Those were the words of White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as he seemed to acknowledge the existence of a quid pro quo in a news conference in mid-October. Hours later, he put out a statement denying he said what he said, and asserting there was “absolutely no quid pro quo."
But there are signs some Republicans are ready to acknowledge there was a quid pro quo — and then argue that it is not an impeachable offense.
“Concern is different than rising to the level of impeachment," Representative Cole said on “Meet the Press. “Look, if I believed everything the Democrats are saying, I would still say this isn't an impeachable offense."
The Washington Post reported recently that senators are also considering the same argument. “The Senate will face the question of whether that's an impeachable offense," US Senator Roger Wicker told CNN. “And I don't think the American people are going to conclude that it is."
The witnesses aren't reliable and the evidence isn't solid Trump has asserted, without evidence, that the whistleblower who ignited the firestorm of scandal has a political agenda, and argued that he or she has “no credibility." Republicans on Sunday were pressing for the whistleblower to testify.
NPR reports that most of the whistleblower's complaint “has been corroborated during closed-door depositions of administration officials, through public statements and from a rough transcript of the call itself, released by the White House."
The Republicans are also planning to argue that several key witnesses testified that they don't have firsthand knowledge of what transpired, the AP reported. That argument has lost some steam as more witnesses have testified, and text messages and the transcript have been released.
Trump has also called Lieutenant ColonelAlexander Vindman, a National Security Council official who testified in a closed-door hearing before the House, a “Never Trumper witness," and hinted he had damaging information on the decorated veteran, TIME magazine reported.
But on the day of Vindman's testimony, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “I'm not going to question the patriotism of any of the people who are coming forward."
Whataboutism US Senator Rand Paul deployed the “whataboutism" technique on Sunday's“Meet the Press."
He attempted to draw an equivalency between what Trump did and the opposition research dossier that was financed by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee and compiled by the former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele
“I'm not saying two wrongs make a right. I'm not even saying I would've done it that way. All I'm saying is, is that you're going to impeach President Trump, and you're going to give Hillary Clinton, you know, let her skate?" he said.
Paul also took the same approach in questioning former vice president Biden's own diplomacy in Ukraine in the Obama administration.
But The New York Times has reported that Biden “threw himself into what seemed like standard-issue vice-presidential stuff: prodding Ukraine's leaders to tackle the rampant corruption that made their country a risky bet for international lenders — and pushing reform of Ukraine's cronyism-ridden energy industry."

Texto completo: Q uestion : Why did the TSA put jams and jellies on the no-fly list? I think they had some for sale in the Hilo airport in small bottles, but I had bought a big bottle at the Hilo Farmers Market. If you buy a lot of small bottles at the airport, wouldn’t that constitute enough to make 12 ounces of jam? TSA confiscated my big bottle of jam. Why would they confiscate that?
Answer : To clarify, jams and jellies are not on the no-fly list. You can transport as much of them as you want in your checked luggage, but quantities are limited in your carry-on bag — which is why your big bottle was flagged at a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at the Hilo airport.
Jam (and jelly) falls under the TSA’s “3-1-1 liquids rule,” which requires that each liquid or gel in your carry-on bag be stored in a 3.4-ounce (100-ml) or smaller container and that all the liquid or gel containers fit into one quart-size plastic bag.
This rule took effect after a terror plot was thwarted in Britain in 2006. Terrorists had planned to bring liquid explosives onto planes in separate containers and combine the ingredients on board to blow up the plane.
After that thwarted plot, the TSA initially banned all liquids, aerosols, gels, creams and pastes from carry-on luggage, but later revised the rule to allow small quantities. The size of the containers was key, according to a 2007 New York Times article that quoted Kip Hawley, then the TSA director.
“With certain explosives you need to have a certain critical diameter in order to achieve an explosion that will cause a certain amount of damage,” he said, explaining that the number of 3-ounce containers that fit in a single quart-size bag lack the critical diameter.
There are exceptions to the rule, such as for liquid medicine, baby formula, baby food and breast milk. And we’ve heard from other passengers who say 3-1-1 enforcement seems inconsistent these days. But at 12 ounces, your jar of jam was nearly four times the allowed container size, and sure to be noticed. The small jars for sale at the airport likely were 3.4 ounces or less each.
If it makes you feel any better, your question is a timely one, reminding travelers to check what kind of goodies they can carry on the plane as the holiday travel season revs up. Readers can check online at 808ne.ws/tsalist; there’s a whole section devoted to food.
Also, the Hilo Farmers Market has a website (hilo farmersmarket.com) with an online store. Perhaps you can replace your lost jam by placing an order there.
Q : Can you still get a gold star after Oct. 1, 2020?
A : Yes. That date doesn’t represent the last day a person can obtain a federally compliant driver’s license or state ID, but the first day that the TSA is expected to enforce the federal REAL ID law at U.S. airports.
Passengers who want to use their driver’s license or state ID to pass through the TSA security line will need a gold star by that date, or they can use another form of acceptable identification, such as a U.S. passport.
Mahalo
I remember! Today is Veterans Day. Yesterday was the birthday of the Marine Corps. When we become old, how often have we run across a person on the street and know that their face looks familiar but cannot recall their name? But there are some names I will never forget. I can even remember their faces, very vaguely, after 70 years. Korea, 1950-1955. Ohana, the Hawaiian word for family, brotherhood, no matter who or where you come from, “You watch my back, I’ll watch yours.” I honor my company commander, first sergeant, platoon leader, platoon sergeant and all the men in the platoon. God bless them all! — P.H.

'Midway,' Surprisingly, Wins at the Box Office

Texto completo: Thanks to a weak showing for the Stephen King adaptation "Doctor Sleep," the World War II movie took the top spot.
The World War II action movie "Midway" was an unexpected winner at the box office this weekend, swooping into the lead as the horror movie that had seemed poised to take the top spot, "Doctor Sleep," instead took a snooze.
"Midway" opened to an estimated $ 17.5 million in domestic ticket sales Friday through Sunday. The movie, distributed by Lionsgate, is expected to make about $ 2.6 million more in sales during the Veterans Day holiday on Monday.
"Midway" revolves around the pivotal 1942 air and sea battle that gives the movie its name. It re-creates that fight with the help of some famous figures: Luke Evans, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson and Nick Jonas are among the members of its ensemble cast. Roland Emmerich, best known for "Independence Day," was the director.
Reviews for "Midway" were relatively lackluster: It currently holds a 41 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg called the movie "rousing and respectful in its best moments and faintly ridiculous in others."
[Read our critic's review of "Midway."]
That "Midway" topped the box office is largely a product of the humdrum response ticket buyers gave to "Doctor Sleep," a Stephen King adaptation from Warner Bros. that inadvertently lived up to its own name. The film is based on the 2013 sequel to "The Shining" novel.
Prerelease surveys that track interest indicated last week that "Doctor Sleep" was positioned to bring in $ 25 million or more this weekend. The actual response was far less robust: "Doctor Sleep" sold an estimated $ 14.1 million in tickets Friday through Sunday. That Warner Bros. had a box-office knockout a couple months ago with another King adaptation, "It Chapter Two," makes that figure all the more disappointing.
"Doctor Sleep" follows Dan, the child of the troubled couple at the center of "The Shining," who in the sequel is shown as an adult dealing with the continued fallout of the first novel's events. Ewan McGregor plays Dan in the film, which was directed by Mike Flanagan.
That the new film lives in the shadow of Stanley Kubrick's seminal 1980 version of "The Shining" made it a tricky movie to market because the studio had two distinct fan bases to handle: King's and Kubrick's. "Doctor Sleep" currently holds a 73 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
In third place was "Playing With Fire," a Paramount Pictures comedy with Keegan-Michael Key, John Cena and Judy Greer that opened this weekend to around $ 12.8 million in sales according to Comscore, which compiles box office data.
Universal's "Last Christmas," a romantic comedy directed by Paul Feig that pairs the "Crazy Rich Asians" breakout Henry Golding and the "Game of Thrones" star Emilia Clarke, opened in fourth place with $ 11.6 million.
Paramount's "Terminator: Dark Fate" rounded out the top five. But its anemic $ 10.8 million second weekend didn't reverse its fate after a bomb of an opening.

Texto completo: Iraq
6 are killed as protests continue
BAGHDAD — Iraqi security forces killed six antigovernment protesters and wounded more than 100 others on Saturday, pushing them back from three flashpoint bridges in central Baghdad, medical and security officials said. Five of the protesters were killed by live ammunition, while the sixth died after being shot in the head with a tear gas canister. The Iraqi officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The current cycle of antigovernment protests and the heavy-handed security crackdown has left more than 250 people dead. Mass protests erupted in Baghdad and across southern Iraq last month, calling for the overhaul of the political system established after the 2003 US-led invasion. The deaths occurred Saturday when demonstrators tried to reach the three bridges spanning the Tigris River to the Green Zone. (AP)
Italy
Countries vow to fight food waste
ROME — More than 70 countries have pledged to do more to cut down on the amount of food lost due to poor refrigeration. The countries signed the pledge Saturday at an annual meeting of the Montreal Protocol where ministers, government officials, and experts work on regulating chemicals used in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems that are harmful to the ozone layer. The meeting took place at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome. About one-third of the world's food is lost or wasted and the hope is that developing better methods to keep food cold while it's stored and transported will reduce waste. Experts say better refrigeration would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the harmful gases used in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. (AP)
Australia
Early wildfires are hitting hard
SYDNEY — Wildfires surging across Australia's drought-ravaged East Coast have left two people dead and destroyed more than 150 homes, officials said on Saturday, sounding the alarm for what is expected to be one of the country's worst recorded fire seasons. With summer heat waves still several weeks away, 1,500 firefighters were battling 70 fires across New South Wales, mostly north of Sydney, where massive clouds of smoke drifted east, turning skies orange. The smoke clouds were large enough to create their own weather systems, experts said. Officials said it was unprecedented to see so many fires so out of control this early in spring.

Texto completo: BY WILLIAM J. KOLE
The Associated Press
Track and field is facing a painful and public reckoning with the treatment of some female athletes.
Former teen running star Mary Cain's account this week of alleged physical and emotional abuse at the recently disbanded Nike Oregon Project is prompting more top athletes to come forward.
Amy Yoder Begley, a 10,000-meter runner, said Friday she was told she had the "biggest butt on the starting line." Kara Goucher's husband said the Olympian endured "disgusting" comments from coaches.
Cain said the all-male staff told her the way to get faster was to get thinner and thinner.
Nike says it's investigating, but the cascade of allegations that have followed Oregon Project director Alberto Salazar's four-year doping ban have called new attention to the emphasis on weight restrictions and emotional abuse.
"It's depressing, but I'm also encouraged that this message is getting out," Dr. Kathryn Ackerman, medical director of the female athlete program at Boston Children's Hospital, said Saturday. "A lot of these athletes have been really shy to share their stories."
Questions about Salazar's methods with his top U.S. runners had swirled for years before the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty last month of conducting experiments with supplements and testosterone that were bankrolled and supported by Nike.
But Cain's plaintive story of harassment and abuse while she was part of Salazar's training group, which she joined as a 17-year-old phenomenon in 2013, has emboldened other former Nike Oregon Project athletes to share their stories.
In a New York Times video essay, Cain, 23, says: "I was emotionally and physically abused by a system designed by Alberto and endorsed by Nike."
Cain said she was harangued by the staff, which had no certified nutritionist or certified sports psychologist, to lose weight and was publicly humiliated when she didn't hit targets. She said she stopped having her period for three years and lost so much bone density she broke five bones. She said she started cutting herself and having suicidal thoughts before leaving the program in 2016.
Salazar, who has denied any involvement in doping, issued a statement to The Oregonian newspaper on Friday saying: "I never encouraged her, or worse yet, shamed her, to maintain an unhealthy weight."
Nike said in a statement these are "deeply troubling allegations which have not been raised by Mary or her parents before. Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto's team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process."
The sportswear giant added it will "take the allegations extremely seriously and will launch an immediate investigation to hear from former Oregon Project athletes."
They're already talking.
Four-time Olympian Shalane Flanagan, who retired from competitive running last month to become a coach with the Nike Bowerman Track Club, tweeted to Cain that "I had no idea it was this bad." Flanagan, the 2017 New York City Marathon champion, is a longtime Nike runner but was never part of the Oregon Project.
"I'm so sorry ... that I never reached out to you when I saw you struggling. I made excuses to myself as to why I should mind my own business. We let you down. I will never turn my head again," Flanagan tweeted.
Yoder Begley, who now coaches the Atlanta Track Club, said she was kicked out of Salazar's group after placing sixth in the 10,000 meters at the 2011 national championships.
"I was told I was too fat and 'had the biggest butt on the starting line.' This brings those painful memories back," the 2008 Olympian said.
Goucher, a former Oregon Project runner who helped provide evidence for USADA's case against Salazar, said on Twitter "the culture was unbearable."
Her husband, Adam Goucher, who also ran for the group, tweeted that after she placed fifth in the 2011 Boston Marathon in a personal best of 2 hours, 24 minutes - one of the fastest times for an American woman that year, and six months after having a child - Salazar and a sports psychologist told her mother and sister she needed to lose her baby weight if she wanted to be fast again. Adam Goucher said his own weight was an issue while he trained under Salazar.
"Maybe now some of you can see why I had so much anger when we left," he wrote.
Ackerman, the Boston sports medicine specialist, is calling on Nike to fund research into healthy and medically sound training in the same way the NFL has started pouring money into concussion studies.
"There are so many great opportunities for Nike to be a leader in this," she said.

Mollie Hemingway names alleged whistleblower Eric Ciaramella on-air despite Fox News ban

Texto completo: Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway named the alleged whistleblower Eric Ciaramella on-air following a network ban on hosts and personalities doing so.
Appearing on Sunday's Media Buzz, Hemingway, who is also a senior editor for the Federalist, discussed whether or not the press should identify the whistleblower at the center of impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Despite Fox News banning employees from doing so, she said his name.
"The media should be in the business of sharing information that is in the public interest," she argued. "We're not seeing this kind of concern that the media has for this whistleblower that they have had for other people. You had CNN doxxing a grandmother because they didn't like what she put on Facebook ... you have had the New York Times out a CIA station chief in Iran. You don’t see concern when it doesn’t match their political motivation."
Host Howard Kurtz then turned to Sen. Rand Paul's calls for the press to out the whistleblower, asking the panel why the Kentucky Republican is asking the media to "do his dirty work."
Hemingway pointed to the fact that some media outlets have not only named the alleged whistleblower but also shared other revealing information about the person.
"The New York Times did all but reveal his name in September," she said. "And RealClearInvestigations has identified a man named Eric Ciaramella as the whistleblower, so it’s already out there."
Kurtz then abruptly stepped in to say, "I just want to clarify that I don't know that that is the person."
"I don’t know whether this is actually the person or not, and I don’t want to speculate about that," he added. "But there have been a few conservative outlets and commentators that have floated that name."

Ciaramella, 33, a career CIA analyst, was named as the potential whistleblower by RealClearInvestigations. He was the Ukraine director on the National Security Council during the end of the Obama administration and remained there during the early months of the Trump administration while briefly acting senior director for European and Russian affairs.
On Oct. 7, the Washington Examiner reported that Ciaramella is now a deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the National Intelligence Council under the director of national intelligence.
Earlier this week, Fox News barred hosts from naming the alleged whistleblower on the network. Likewise, production staffers were told to "not fulfill any video or graphic requests" in connection to the whistleblower's identity. However, a guest on the network mentioned Ciaramella just days later.

Texto completo: An associate of Rudy Giuliani says he warned Ukraine that the Trump administration would withhold military aid if the country didn't launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.
A lawyer for Lev Parnas told the New York Times that his client met with a representative of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government in May, during which he said the country must announce an investigation into Biden or else the White House would freeze military aid to the nation, the outlet reported Sunday.
He also allegedly told them Vice President Mike Pence would not attend Zelensky's inauguration if the investigation wasn't announced. Parnas is reportedly prepared to share his account with House impeachment investigators and is scheduled to testify in the coming days.
His claims, however, are being disputed on several fronts. Giuliani, for example, insisted, "Categorically, I did not tell him to say that." Lawyers for his partner Igor Fruman added that the claim is "false" and that they never raised the issue of aid or Pence's attendance at the inauguration.
Parnas, who was arrested with Fruman on campaign finance-related charges, has signaled that he is willing to cooperate with House Democrats' impeachment proceedings. The pair also pressured the previous president of Ukraine to investigate Biden, according to reports.
President Trump made a similar request of Zelensky during their July 25 phone call, which is now at the heart of the impeachment process as the House attempts to determine if a quid pro quo in exchange for the military aid was committed. Administration officials have argued that the aid was never held up on the condition that Ukraine open an investigation into Biden.

Texto completo: That didn't take long.
"OK, Boomer" went from a fun, harmless-even-though-it-stings-a-bit phrase to an overthought, hyperanalyzed, "declaration of intergenerational war" (Maureen Dowd's words, not mine) in a week flat.
The saying started out as a clever, if biting, retort delivered by Generation Z in response to the lame directives/opinions/hand wringings of pretty much anyone over 30.
Then the New York Times wrote about it. And NBC News covered it. And Deseret News got defensive about it. ("Generation Z is embracing this new phrase called 'OK, Boomer.' But baby boomers have something to say about that phrase. They don't like it!")
And just like that, the air started leaking out of "OK, Boomer" like a day-old helium balloon.
"Boomers hate it, gen x will mock it, millennials will enthusiastically use it to the point of exhausting it without actually inventing it," New York-based writer Rachel Syme tweeted, "and gen z has already moved on and thinks we are all nobs."
We killed "OK, Boomer."
Killing stuff is supposed to be a millennial thing, but I actually think my generation -- the one actively raising kids right now -- is pretty adept at it too. In our quest to stay connected and close to our kids, we sometimes forget that they need and deserve space to live their childhoods without us taking every one of their triumphs and travails and quips so personally.
I probably unwittingly contributed to "OK, Boomer's" early demise. Last week I wrote about how I came face-to-face with the saying when my kids and their friends were home during the Chicago Public Schools teacher strike. I thought the phrase was pretty clever -- a sign that kids are simultaneously bemused by us and eager to reject our old ways of thinking, confident they'll create a better, healthier, more equitable world than we have. And I believe they will.
But I think something a little bigger is at play here as well.
I think a lot of us, well-intentioned though we may be, fail to keep our own egos in check when we're observing and participating in our kids' childhoods.
Their grades become a measure of our parenting, rather than a measure of how well they grasped the academic material in front of them.
Their colleges become the grand finale of our 18 years of work -- the ultimate return on investment -- rather than a place for them to build on their 18 years of life so far -- and a place from which to launch into the rest of their decades.
Their sports? Oh, man. Their sports. I have watched grown-ups take a child's game and turn it into a high-stakes pressure cooker more times than I care to count. Grown-ups yelling at 15-year-old umpires. Grown-ups yelling at their kids' opponents, who also happen to be kids, of course. Grown-ups yelling at other grown-ups about who was out, what was foul, whether that kid was offside, whether that judge is biased. So very much yelling.
I have watched my son come home from various games and turn to the cold comfort of his Xbox, where he can control the wins and losses on Madden NFL 20 and no one's screaming at his teammates from the sidelines or the bleachers. I have watched, on some days, a video game become more fun than a real game played with real humans.
Are these the same forces that killed "OK, Boomer"? It all sounds a little overwrought, I realize.
But I do think it's worth asking ourselves, in any situation, but particularly in parenting: Is this really about me?
Haven't younger generations always been skeptical of older generations? Isn't "OK, Boomer" just the latest version of the '60s mantra, "Don't trust anyone over 30?" Couldn't we have shrugged this one off?
It's too late for "OK, Boomer," which has officially jumped the shark.
The other stuff though -- the bigger stuff, the stuff that takes up more time and space in our kids' hearts and schedules and futures -- I think that stuff is worth pausing and thinking hard about.
It's their childhood. We had ours. We can and should be there for as much of it as we possibly can. That's a gift and an honor. But we should also resist the urge to hold up their childhood as some kind of mirror to check our own reflections or boost our own egos.
I'm speaking to myself as much as anyone. It's tricky to find that sweet spot just before becoming overinvested, especially when you love these people more than life itself.
Maybe "OK, Boomer" can be our canary in the coal mine. Maybe "OK, Boomer" can remind us, when all else fails, to be a little better at laughing stuff off.

Texto completo: Author, entrepreneur, model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen received the Brand Genius Visionary award at the Brandweek Brand Genius Awards Gala Monday night at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa in Palm Desert.
Teigen is currently involved with multiple television projects, has a line of cookware sold at Target stores and is the author of two cookbooks.
She has also drawn the ire of President Donald Trump after blasting him on her Twitter account, which has 11 million followers.
Teigen's husband, R&B singer John Legend gave the introductory speech at the Adweek event, pointing out two tables referred to as "Team Chrissy" and quipped about some of the ideas that she shares with him.
"I've witnessed how creative and full of ideas she is," Legend said. "In fact, I keep a 'Chrissy's Ideas' folder on my phone and my laptop just to document all those random creative thoughts that come from Chrissy's beautiful mind. Some are television show concepts, some are book ideas, some are kitchen hacks, some are more practical than others. Some, I have no idea the scientific feasibility of, like clear aluminum foil."
Teigen didn't make any reference to Trump or politics. But she did say it was an honor, because she isn't the award winner of the family. She applauded the marketing professionals in attendance and praised the hard work of creating a brand.
"I think everyone in this room knows what it's like to work for somebody or with somebody, you create them, and you are able to make this entity and make this person," Teigen said. "It's incredible that people have power to do that."
Other honorees included David Rubin, chief marketing officer of the New York Times, Stephanie McMahon, chief brand officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, and Deirdre Findlay, chief marketing officer of Stitch Fix.

OK, boomer - the kids are fighting back

Texto completo: Two words have launched a thousand tweets and opened a new front in the generational wars.
Feeling completely clueless? OK, boomer.
The New York Times and NBC News last week picked up a trend from high-school halls and teens' TikTok accounts and deposited it in the national news. The Gen Z-generated phrase "OK, boomer" has turned into an epithet rallying the country's young against their forebears in collective mockery. The all-purpose reply is designed to disarm oldish people who dispense condescension dressed up as wisdom.
Your mom tells you that your peers' phones are rotting their brains, and that they should spend some time outside mowing the lawn. "OK, boomer." Your grandpa tells you that kids these days have lost all sense of civility because they yelled at Ellen DeGeneres for going to a football game with George W. Bush. "OK, boomer." Some random grump in your replies on Twitter tells you Greta Thunberg should go to school back in Sweden instead of gallivanting across the 50 states spreading the green gospel. "OK, boomer."
It's glib, it's short, and it's not at all sweet, but "OK, boomer" also reveals something about each of today's generations. So does the response the words have wrought.
The mainstreaming of a meme that was making its way onto $36 Redbubble-style sweatshirts sold by entrepreneurial 17-year-olds has, apparently, made boomers mad - which basically proves Gen Z's point. Conservative radio personality Bob Lonsberry took to the Web on Monday to not-so-patiently explain that "being hip and flip" does not excuse "bigotry," and that "boomer" is in fact "the n-word of ageism."
OK, boomer.
Then there's Gen X, dubbed by the media at various intervals as baby busters and 20-nothings. The names all imply a depressing sort of emptiness. So it's fitting that some in Gen Z seem to have forgotten that this in-between cohort exists at all and instead is lumping them in with the rest of the (relatively) elderly. Gen X is helping out by lumping themselves in with the boomers and against those ungrateful kids.
Millennials have allied with Gen Z and managed to vitiate the meme in the process by, basically, overdoing it. "OK, boomer" was fun and funny, so we said it about a million times on Twitter in the space of one day, and now it has become unfunny and lame. That's appropriate, too, for a generation that supposedly kills every good thing.
It makes sense that millennials like me are taking up arms with our Gen Z comrades - because we're the ones who have been maligned the most for the sin of our birth years. Gadgetry has stripped us of the capacity for meaningful human connection, or so the argument from self-help gurus, newspaper columnists and U.S. senators goes. The losers among us are basement-dwellers; the cool ones are profligates who refuse to contemplate the future. Blah, blah, avocado toast.
"OK, boomer" is appealing because, on the simplest level, it flips the script. Old people have been telling young people for years that they don't get it because they just haven't had the chance to learn. Now, young people have developed a cryptic code for telling old people that they're the ones who don't get it, and that failure is all the more flagrant because they have had countless chances to learn.
But the flipping is craftier than just that. What's important isn't that the kids are fighting back. It's that the kids are fighting back without really fighting at all. "OK, boomer" indicts not an argument and not an individual but an entire generation, or an entire generation's attitude - and it does it with two words dripping with dismissal. The Gen Z progenitors of this insolent slogan say they use it because they're inheriting a collapsing climate, an unequal economy and endless battles overseas that they didn't start. They're saying a lot with very little, and by saying very little they end up saying even more.
"OK, boomer" sends the message that the grown-ups have screwed up so totally, and are veering so speedily into irrelevance, that convincing them of anything is a waste of keyboard characters.
Molly Roberts writes about technology and society for The Washington Post's Opinions section.

Texto completo: If you're lucky enough to get the Smithsonian Channel, you can tune in on Veterans Day - Monday - and catch two local authors on an episode about the World War II Battle of Midway. Timothy Orr, a history professor at ODU, and Laura Orr, now education director at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum, worked with a retired naval aviator, N. Jack "Dusty" Kleiss, on "Never Call Me a Hero: A Legendary American Dive-Bomber Pilot Remembers the Battle of Midway" (HarperCollins, 2017).
Kleiss - who credited the victory not to the admirals in charge but to the pilots - died in 2016 at age 100. He's credited with sinking three ships on June 4, 1942, including two aircraft carriers, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Navy Cross and the Air Medal.
The book - the writing of which, Kleiss noted, meant he relived the battle over and over - "constitutes a remarkably detailed and comprehensive account from one of the key actors in the events of Midway," said Andrew J. Roscoe in the Naval War College Review. "It stands out as an exceptionally well-rounded military memoir."
Details: 8 and 11 p.m. (and again Wednesday at 10 a.m.).
Razor Sharp Readers: A local nonprofit and a local barbershop are welcoming a series of authors to pique kids' interest in books - specifically, African American kids, with the help of books with characters from diverse backgrounds. Parents are encouraged to bring their kids at 6:30 p.m. Nov. 19, when a Richmond author, filmmaker and philanthropist, B.K. Fulton, will be at Kinetic Kutz and Stylez in Norfolk for a reading, discussion and signing from his "Mr. Business" series of kids' books. Clever Communities in Action is the organizer.
Details: Seating is limited; RSVP to admin@CleverCommunities.org. 702 E. Little Creek Road.
Historic lighthouses: Larry Saint and Karla Smith, co-authors of "Screwpiles: The Forgotten Lighthouses" - on a type of lighthouse and lightkeepers in the Chesapeake Bay, the James River and the North Carolina sounds - will give a talk Nov. 17 at the Mariner's Museum. Screwpile foundations made possible a residential cottage atop and a cupola for the light - which the lightkeepers maintained around the clock in harsh and isolated conditions. The lighthouses, operating primarily from 1855 to the 1930s, were crucial to the golden age of steamships.

Texto completo: "There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true."
Ken Goldstein
Political scientist who conducts his own polls
With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true."

Texto completo: Appearing in Iowa with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders pushed his populist message and drew a contrast between his grass-roots support and Mr. Bloomberg's billions.
CORALVILLE, Iowa -- Bernie Sanders on Saturday unleashed his most forceful rebuke yet of Michael R. Bloomberg's potential presidential bid, warning the former mayor of New York that he would not be able to "buy this election" and chastising his plan to skip campaigning in the early states.
Speaking at a rally in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa, Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, repeatedly addressed Mr. Bloomberg by name, almost daring him to enter a Democratic primary race that has already been in progress for months.
"Our campaign is going to end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which exists in America today," said Mr. Sanders, who was joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard-bearer of the progressive left. "So tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain't going to buy this election."
He also derided Mr. Bloomberg's intended strategy of bypassing the key early voting states where so many of the current candidates are devoting time, money and resources.
"You're not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada," Mr. Sanders said. "You're not going to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California. Those days are gone."
Mr. Bloomberg on Friday took the first step toward a candidacy, filing paperwork to qualify for the ballot in Alabama. His looming entry into the race has underscored its fluidity while presenting the threat of a centrist competitor to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
As a leading progressive, Mr. Sanders could potentially benefit from a Bloomberg candidacy that siphoned voters from Mr. Biden. But Mr. Sanders displayed no eagerness to see Mr. Bloomberg in the race, and was quick to draw a direct contrast between their efforts, saying his campaign had the grass-roots support to win rather than billions of dollars in the bank.
"Bloomberg can have his billions," he said, "but that is why we are going to win this election."
The rally was Mr. Sanders's second public event of the day with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who joined him on Friday for a two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation caucus state. During a rally in Council Bluffs on Friday, both progressive politicians largely avoided making any references to Mr. Bloomberg.
Mr. Bloomberg's early moves, and his suggestion that he would follow the unconventional campaign strategy of skipping all four traditional early-state contests and instead stake his candidacy on delegate-rich primary states like California and Texas, has supplied fresh fodder for candidates like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are both campaigning on anti-elitist, progressive messages.
Earlier in the day on Saturday, at a climate change forum in Des Moines, Mr. Sanders directed a more glancing blow at Mr. Bloomberg, saying the country needed "a dynamic democracy -- a democracy where all of us play a role in shaping public policy, not some billionaire who decides that he wants to run for president of the United States because he's a billionaire."
Mr. Sanders also took a shot at Mr. Biden, who recently said he would be willing to accept support from a super PAC; his campaign, Mr. Sanders said, had no such financial vehicle.

If People Were Paid by Ability, Inequality Would Drop

Texto completo: Some may argue that top earners are simply super skilled, but that's not what the evidence suggests.
Income inequality in the United States would fall drastically if people were compensated based only on their ability.
The fundamental reason that income inequality is extraordinarily high in the United States relative to other democracies is the disparities in power across groups. Both the left and the right often miss how these disparities can play out.
The skills that really matter in the workplace are much more evenly distributed than many people assume. Most low-wage workers are underpaid relative to their measured intelligence and personality traits, and many of the highest-paid professionals -- including doctors, lawyers and financial managers -- are overpaid according to the same metrics.
Many people think that inequality is driven by irreversible trends in globalization and technological change, resulting in domination by multinational corporations and their executives.
Yet new academic research shows that most of the recent increase in income inequality has been driven by the owners of S corporations -- which typically have one or two owners -- and partnerships. These businesses are usually small regional operations focused on professional services (think law or medicine) or real estate. The most profitable pass-through businesses owned by millionaires are classified in legal services, in finance or as physician offices. These owners far outnumber executives of publicly traded companies among the nation's top earners.
In fact, the rise of inequality over the last 40 years has coincided with the decline of income from conventional corporations (so-called C corporations) as a share of national income, from 59 percent in 1980 to 42 percent.
Data from the Census Bureau are consistent with this pattern. There are more doctors in the top 1 percent of earners (15 percent of the total) than chief executives (11 percent of the total). In fact, across nearly 500 occupational categories, doctors make up the largest group in the top 1 percent.
Lawyers and financial managers make up 7 percent and 3 percent of all top earners. Dentists are among the most likely to be in the top 1 percent; they actually outnumber software developers in that group.
Some may argue that top earners, whatever their occupation, are simply super skilled. But empirical evidence shows that skills cannot explain their pay.
The actual range of worker productivity is much narrower than the range of incomes. Research from management science finds that high-performing managers or professionals are roughly 50 percent more productive than a typical worker in the same role. That's a large gap, but the salaries of many highly paid professionals -- say those in the 85th percentile of their occupational group -- are consistently at a far higher level than the median worker in the same field.
In some cases, elite professionals are able to earn more because of protection from market competition via state occupational licensing regulations. Associations representing lawyers, doctors and dentists can create costly obstacles to obtaining a license, research shows, and this blocks paralegals, nurse practitioners and dental hygienists from providing cheaper services.
Consider the measures that best predict economic performance. Cognitive ability, years of education, experience and noncognitive traits (like conscientiousness, enthusiasm and emotional stability) are all strong predictors of income and health status. Taken together, they make up much of what economists mean by human capital and consistently predict high performance in the workplace.
As part of research for my new book, "A Republic of Equals: A Manifesto for a Just Society," I calculated what each individual's income would be if she or he were paid according to the attributes listed above (using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Longitudinal Survey). Comparing actual income inequality to predicted income inequality results in a reduction from 0.44 to 0.19 as measured by the Gini coefficient of inequality. Paying people based on their fundamental skills would make the United States as egalitarian as Sweden.
The reason? The distribution of skills is far more egalitarian than the distribution of income -- and would be more equal still if access to high-quality education and skills training were more widely available.
Consider that the top 1 percent of earners in the United States score one-third of a standard deviation (or 5 IQ points) above the average adult on cognitive and workplace skills -- measured from an assessment of adults by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Not bad, but not that unusual, either: Roughly 45 percent of adults score that high. To see this from another perspective, the average African-American adult with a graduate degree demonstrates the same level of cognitive ability in this international assessment as the average person in the top 1 percent of income. Yet 99 percent of African-Americans with graduate degrees do not have incomes high enough to be in the top 1 percent.
In the early 20th century, researchers have found, African-Americans were among the most inventive people in the world as measured by their likelihood of holding a patent. Racism, of course, blocked access to markets and other opportunities. For instance, black physicians were barred in many states from entering the American Medical Association until 1968, and the American Bar Association refused membership to black lawyers in any state until 1950.
When it comes to rising inequality, those on the left tend to cast blame on multinational corporations, and they see inherent flaws in markets. Those on the right tend to believe that inequality arises from differences in talent; they are more likely to say that market outcomes are intrinsically fair.
Both tend to miss how powerful interest groups (often local ones) can distort markets, creating rules to benefit their members at the public's expense. Homeowner associations and the zoning boards that they elect routinely block legitimate market transactions in real estate, leading to higher housing prices and social segregation and isolation. (Townhomes, duplexes and apartments are essentially forbidden in many neighborhoods.) In many cases, state legislators have become dominated by regional lobbying associations, driving up the price of services. For both the left and the right, and everyone in between, it can be hard to see the true benefactors of rising income inequality: professional elites.
Beyond a commitment to equality, possible remedies include expanding access to high-quality public services like early-childhood education and community health services for needy families. But the evidence also suggests the need for expanding access to markets and defending their integrity. Both the right and left right would have to make compromises; it would seem to be a fair trade, with big gains for all.

Texto completo: When she taught first-graders in Bethesda public schools, Ann Friedman relied on activities to engage them. Playing games, reciting poetry, putting on plays - all were roads to learning how to read.
"I guess there was a desk in my classroom," Friedman said. "But I wasn't sitting down."
Friedman has employed that same approach in her latest act, as founder and primary funder of Planet Word. She describes it as an interactive museum "that will bring language to life," now under construction at the historic Franklin School on the corner of 13th and K streets NW in downtown Washington.
The museum is expected to open May 31 with 10 immersive galleries that will explore language in novel and entertaining ways, according to its founder. One gallery will boast a 12-foot, high-wattage globe where visitors can choose various languages and learn a few culturally specific words and phrases. Contemporary artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer was commissioned to create an interactive work that has hundreds of speakers programmed with snippets of famous poems and speeches. On the second floor, a quiet space offers audio of poems with the words screened on the walls. Visitors will be invited to solve puzzles, listen to poetry and paint pictures with words and encouraged to try their skills at delivering famous speeches and creating a marketing pitch. Planet Word will also have an auditorium, classrooms, a restaurant and gift shop. Admission will be free.
Think science museum - but for the humanities.
"People are going to have so much fun and be amazed by the technology and the ways we have been able to bring language to life," said Friedman, who lives in Bethesda with her husband, New York Times foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman, who serves on the museum's board of directors. Friedman is the daughter of the late billionaire shopping mall mogul Matthew Bucksbaum. She declined to quantify her net worth.
Planet Word isn't the first to tackle language and reading in a museum format - there's Mundolingua in Paris, as well as language museums in Toronto and the Netherlands, among others - and it's not the first to use high-tech games and displays to engage visitors in its subject. But it's the rare museum that combines both. It becomes the newest in a long list of attractions in this museum-rich city.
"It's a challenge for any museum to establish a foothold in a place like Washington, where we have the Smithsonian and so many great museums," said Marsha Semmel, a museum educator, author and Planet Word board member. "[Planet Word] doesn't seem like the usual idea for a museum, but I do think there are a lot of compelling reasons for people to get interested in [it]."
Friedman said Washington was the only location considered because the nation's capital is the only spot for addressing a topic of "national import."
"Our country was founded on the written word, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights," she said. "After you've visited all those word-engraved historic sites, you might like to visit a museum that shows you the broader context - not just the power of words, but the beauty and fun, too."
Washington is the right setting for highlighting the connection between literacy and democracy, she added. "A strong democracy needs a literate population. We know readers are volunteers, they are active in their communities. They vote. So we need to find additional ways to engage people with words, with reading, with books."
Although some may be surprised by the project, Friedman sees it as a logical extension of her life's work. She has supported literacy organizations with her philanthropy, and she was inspired by David Rubenstein's gifts to major Washington institutions.
"Museums can try anything; they're not hemmed in by time or curriculum requirements. So, if joke-telling or speechmaking or rapping is the key to hooking someone on reading, they can give that a try," she said. "That's what I think a museum can do. I can do that as an individual - teach in my class with 16 students - but that doesn't scale."
Friedman's project is different from the language museums that precede it. Mundolingua is a Paris museum that focuses on linguistics, while the American Writers Museum in Chicago celebrates books and reading by examining the influence of writers on American culture. There are many museums around the world dedicated to specific languages, and the National Museum of Language had a space in College Park from 2008 until 2014, when it closed for financial reasons.

"We cover every language, where [Friedman] is more into English," said NML President Greg Nedved about his organization, which still presents programs and a summer camp but exists primarily online.
Planet Word has the benefit of a wealthy patron, something the NML lacked, Nedved said. Friedman has pledged to use her own money to fund the restoration of the Franklin School, a National Historic Landmark that opened in 1869 as one of the District's first public schools. The renovation will cost more than $25 million.
That promise attracted city leaders. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and her economic development advisers selected Planet Word in 2017 as the winner of a competition to reinvent the building, which had been shuttered since 2008. Once home to the city's board of education, the school is an ideal setting for a museum focused on learning and technology. It was where Alexander Graham Bell made the first successful wireless voice transmission in 1880.
"I'm happy this building is going to live again," Friedman said. "It's going to attract people, whether they are interested in words and language or not, because they haven't been able to get inside for a decade."
The restoration suffered a setback last year when city officials halted construction after discovering parts of the protected interiors had been removed. The issue caused the opening to be delayed.

Friedman apologized for the problem, which she described as a mistake that came from her lack of experience in real estate development. The solution was to create a plan and engage with city officials regularly, she said.
"We have a plan we all agreed to, and [city officials] go on walk-throughs monthly," she said. "If we have questions, they come and help us make a decision."
Friedman has served on nonprofit boards, including the SEED Foundation and the National Symphony Orchestra, but she has no hands-on museum experience.
In 2013, she started to research her project by attending museum conferences, meeting with leaders of institutions she admired and hiring a staff, including executive director Patty Isacson Sabee. She built a board that includes investment bankers, developers, lawyers, educators, writers and museum professionals - a group with expertise in all aspects of the project, Semmel said.
"I've been so impressed by Ann's step-by-step, dogged, thoughtful process," she said, adding that Friedman and the staff have reached out to local community groups, partnered with Apple at the Carnegie Library and participated in the National Book Festival.
In addition to the board of directors, Planet Word has an advisory board that includes Harvard professors Steven Pinker and Catherine Snow, New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz, musicians Ben Folds and Paul Simon, and authors Jason Reynolds and Deborah Fallows.
Some she called out of the blue to explain her idea and ask for their assistance.

"I told them, 'You lend credibility to this project and to me,' " she said. "I needed their advice and their names."
Friedman has raised $16 million of the $20 million required to create the exhibitions and support the first year of operations. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Poetry Foundation and AT&T are among the project's major donors. The museum hired Local Projects, a firm that worked on the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, to lead the design, and Lone Shark Games of Seattle and the Solomon Group of New Orleans are contributing to the games and exhibitions.
In focusing on immersive exhibitions and interactive displays, Planet Word is following the example of the National Museum of Mathematics in New York and the Exploratorium in San Francisco. This is the future, says Malcolm O'Hagan, a founding director of the American Writers Museum in Chicago.
"The focus is on the customer, on the visitor experience," O'Hagan said. "Museums like the Smithsonian are hugely important in terms of preserving iconic artifacts. We're taking a different way to engage people - particularly young people - so they are there doing something, not just looking at things."

Texto completo: Epilogue | Dr. Philip Adler

TAMPA  Dr. Philip Adler always stood up for what he believed was best for his patients, even if his opinions didnt always sit well with his clinical colleagues.

He passed away Nov. 2 at 92 after treating three generations of Tampa Bay children. As a pediatrician in Tampa, Dr. Adler continued to see patients well into his 80s before retiring. He was known for his prominent role in desegregating hospital care in Tampa Bay.

In 1964, Dr. Adler convinced Tampa General Hospital  the regions largest public hospital at the time, and reserved for whites  to allow sick black newborns from Clara Frye Memorial Hospital in Ybor City to be transferred into its new prenatal nursery.

It would take three years for Tampa General to fully integrate, but pressure from Dr. Adler changed the hospitals mission. It would come to be known for serving Floridas poor and diverse communities.

In his private practice, too, Dr. Adler built a reputation for treating patients regardless of their ability to pay or where they came from, said Dr. John Curran, a pediatrician who retired from the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine in 2017 after 45 years.

Over the years, Phil was always an outspoken advocate for something, Curran said. He didnt always have the love of his brethren pediatricians, but he always had their respect. Whatever he did, he was certain about it.

Born in New Britain, Conn., in 1927, Dr. Adler grew up watching a pediatrician care for his sick brother. He served in World War II, and later went to the University of Vermont for medical school. He did his residency at Beth Israel and Boston Childrens Hospital, and landed a fellowship at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit before taking a job with a private practice in Tampa in 1958.

When he got the Tampa offer, Dr. Adler visited the practice and saw that it was segregated. His son, Josh Adler, said his father said he would accept the job if they desegregated the clinic. They did, and he accepted.

Dr. Adler instilled those values in his four children, his son said.

He didnt care the color of your skin or your religion or your socioeconomic status, Josh Adler said. Thats who he was. ... All he cares about at the end of the day is the kids. Anything that gets in the way of the kids and the health was a problem.

Dr. Adler started his own pediatrics practice in Tampa, across the street from the original St. Josephs Hospital, where he also held many chief administrative titles over the years. The practice became a referral center for unfunded children who were discharged from the hospitals emergency department because no one else would treat them.

In 1985, he founded The Childrens Doctor, a clinic designed for working mothers that was open on the weekends and into the evening hours.

Over the years, Dr. Adler was quoted in the New York Times, and locally in St. Petersburg Times and Tampa Tribune articles as an advocate for childhood immunizations and new surgical procedures. In the 1970s, he became heavily involved in the development of two new hospitals: St. Josephs Womens Hospital and later St. Josephs Childrens Hospital, where he practiced for decades.

Dr. Daniel Plasencia, medical director of St. Joesphs Childrens Hospital, first met Dr. Adler when he moved to Tampa in 1982.

I remember covering for him when he was out of town once, and his patients loved him, he said. He did have a strong personality and was especially passionate about immunizations.

Plasencia said Dr. Adler was influential in bringing new pediatric specialties to Tampa at a time when there was a dire need for it.

Until the day he retired, he was always in the middle of what was going on, from the quality of the neonatal unit to the physicians who practiced here, Plasencia said. He was knocking down doors to beef up services.

Dr. Adler also was active in other ways around Tampa Bay, including as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and part of the Congregation Schaarai Zedek. He was a founding trustee of the Tampa Preparatory School.

Richard Blau, an attorney with Gray Robinson in Tampa, was a patient of Dr. Adlers since he was an infant. Even after he aged out of pediatrics, Dr. Adler continued to treat him as his primary care physician.

I met my wife, who was interning at his practice as pediatric nurse, Blau said. He was the godfather of our three children. He was just a remarkable professional, and Im a better, healthier man having known him.

Texto completo: A day for comfort, sharing On Dec. 27, 2011, I received a call from my hysterical sister notifying me that our dad had taken his life. In an instant, my world changed. The pain that accompanies a loss by suicide can only be understood by a fellow survivor. In my own practice, I spend the day walking alongside others as they work to find purpose in their pain. I chose this path after experiencing the isolation that often follows a suicide loss as you work to understand a world that no longer makes sense.
One day a year, people who have lost a loved one to suicide come together to support, comfort and connect with one another. It is a place to be understood, a place to find hope, and a place to heal.
Survivor Day was originally created by an act of Congress in 1999. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention now sponsors and supports local events in order to bring suicide loss survivors together. In addition to the AFSP-produced documentary that highlights fellow survivors and their journey, we will feature a panel of individuals all impacted by suicide.
Walking alongside others continues to reiterate my purpose that was found within my pain. I am thrilled to offer a place for those to gather on Survivor Day, Saturday, Nov. 23, at the Barrington Area Library at 1 p.m. The event is free to the public, and lunch will be served to those who are registered in advance.
Jessica L. Hutchison Barrington Not a dumb voter As a conservative who voted for our duly-elected President Donald Trump, I’d like to respond to Donna F. Lambert’s recent letter. Like most letters from liberal Democrats, it’s full of generalities and no specific examples. The whole tone seems to be how dumb President Donald Trump is and, by inference, how dumb I am for voting for him and continuing to support him.
He’s on Twitter to defend himself from the daily onslaught of accusations and lies about him. So good for him. Someone needs to stand strong against the CNNs, the NBCs, the NPRs, The New York Times, The Washington Post, etc. And he’s not suing any TV shows or newspapers. He tends to the business of the U.S. every day since he only sleeps about four hours a night. Here are a few of his accomplishments: — The lowest unemployment numbers for blacks, women, Hispanics, etc. ever.
— Over 3.9 million off food stamps and contributing to society.
— A major tax cut for individuals, meaning more money in their pockets.
— A major tax cut for businesses, meaning they can expand, pay higher dividends, bring overseas profits back to the U.S.
— Making the U.S. energy independent and a net exporter of energy.
— Renegotiating trade treaties so America receives a fair shake.
— Reducing burdensome regulations put in place by un-elected bureaucrats.
— Building walls on our southern border to at least slow down illegal immigration.
— Started to rebuild the military.
— Moved the U.S. Embassy to Israel’s capital — Jerusalem.
— Implemented the First Step Act criminal reform bill.
And look who the Democrats have running for their presidential nomination: socialists, anti-capitalists, none of whom seem to like America. So who’s ill-informed?
Maybe I’m not so dumb after all.
Denis M. Bohm Mettawa Media fought him from the beginning Regarding your Oct. 29 editorial "Why isn’t this man loved?": A better headline would be "Why have liberal politicians, biased newspapers and TV stations and their minions created an atmosphere of sustained hate?" which began on the very first day after President Trumps election.
A devious plan to destroy him because their choice, Hillary Clinton, did not win. Trump did not fit their ideas. He was an outsider — not a former politician or statesman who could be manipulated by the press, big money or others who could control him to fit their wishes.
He was the enemy. So, no matter the good he accomplishes they will either not report it or twist it to make it look as negative as possible. With his programs, he has lowered unemployment to under 4%, created more jobs than we have people to fill them, presides over positive economic growth, minimized ISIS, protected our southern border even with Democrats fighting him every step, helped our trade with other nations, rebuilt our military, shut off funding to Iran and much more.
He met with military leaders in a plan to capture or eliminate the ISIS leader and butcher of multi-thousands of innocent people Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Never do these news pundits agree, praise or publish articles that reflect favorably on Trump. Never.
Collusion, obstruction, Russian spy, impeachment, etc. dominate headlines as the media does the left’s bidding. They continue even though their actions weaken our nation, divide our citizens and spread misinformation.
Dislike Trump, disagree with him etc., but surely our media has an obligation to the American people to print the truth.
Paul Saam Gurnee Political ‘gaslighting’ The American people are being "gaslighted." Gaslighting is a term often used for personal relationships, but it can also be used by politicians.
This is psychological manipulation to get control and power over another person ... spouse, co-worker, friend, or voters. This manipulation is slow and masterful, where you may not even know it for years, leading you to question your own reality.
The author of "Gaslighting," Stephanie Sarkis, also wrote about it in relation to politics. The gaslighter seeks the limelight, behaves as all-powerful, lacks empathy, envisions himself a savior, retaliates, fails to accept responsibility, detests intellectuals, idolizes money, marginalizes others, refuses cooperation, acts irrationally, uses opinions and propaganda for facts, projects onto others what he himself is, repeats lies, distracts, appoints family for loyalty, and people are expendable when no longer filling their needs.
Research gaslighting so you do not become a victim in relationships, at home, in the workplace, or in society.
Diane Crawford Arlington Heights Quoting Barr on morality?
Walter Williams shamelessly quotes even the most controversial and dubious sources so long as they buttress Williams’ controversial and dubious positions on social issues.
Case in point is Williams’ piece on the moral decline of this country, in which Williams quotes part of a speech U.S. Attorney General William Barr recently gave at Notre Dame’s Law School. Barr claimed that attacks on religious liberty are largely responsible for what he describes as a "moral decline" in this country. Mental illness and addiction are not moral or religious issues; these are medical issues. Barr’s belief that mental illness and addiction are the result of immorality or lack of religion is an ad hominem attack on those afflicted with mental illness and/or addiction.
Worse, Williams quotes Barr on morality knowing that Barr himself gave Trump clearance to separate immigrant children from their families, as well as Barr having played a key role in Trump’s scheme to withhold critical military aid to the Ukranian people unless their government played political ball with Trump.
If you want to identify the culprit of a moral decline in this country, just take a look at the long sordid history of the Trump administration, in which Mr. Barr has played a key role.

Frank Bruni: What I learned when I stabbed myself 52 times

Texto completo: Of all the aphorisms ever inscribed on greeting cards and stitched onto throw pillows, the most frustrating is that ubiquitous snippet of the Serenity Prayer.
“God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the difference,” it says, suggesting that the difference is objective — that there’s a discernible, even clear line between reasonable hope and pitiable delusion, between premature and mature surrender. Sometimes there isn’t. Sometimes it just won’t come into focus.
I thought about this every time I stabbed myself.
“Stab” is maybe a bit dramatic, but it’s not too far off. Twice weekly for the past six months, I jabbed myself with a needle, pumped half of a syringe of fluid into my stomach or one of my thighs, occasionally felt a sting, a few times drew blood and always wondered if I was being brave or silly, determined or just plain obstinate.
I was participating in a clinical trial of an unproven treatment for my rare disorder. As I’ve mentioned in this column before, I had a kind of stroke of the optic nerve behind my right eye two years ago; ever since, a dappled, impenetrable fog obscures its vision. With that eye, nothing will come into focus, and its intrusion on my intact left eye sometimes slows my reading, muddies my thinking, leaves me with a woozy feeling.
Doctors told me off the bat that there was no remedy and, worse, a 20% chance that my left eye would be similarly afflicted. I was forced to contemplate — am forced to contemplate — going blind.
And I had decisions to make, starting with whether to be part of an earlier trial, in which a different drug would be injected three times, with a month between injections, directly into my ravaged eye. It represented hope, sure, but a slender, theoretical hope, with obviously painful drawbacks. I said yes.
The drug did nothing for me — and, I later learned, did nothing for so many others that the maker of the drug pulled the plug on the tests.
Then I had to decide about the six-month trial, the one that involved 52 injections — one every Friday and every Tuesday, or as close to that schedule as I could keep. The needles in this case were thinner, to be plunged into infinitely less sensitive body parts, but I would have to do the plunging myself. There would be vials of the drug (or a placebo) in my refrigerator, syringes in my kitchen cupboard, a sharps container on the kitchen counter. I said yes again.
And about two months in, I definitely noticed a change — in the speed (45 seconds!) with which I could transfer the fluid from vial to syringe, banish the air bubbles, pierce my flesh and have everything cleaned up. Like many people with diabetes and women receiving fertility treatments, I’d become a self-puncturing whiz, a human pincushion extraordinaire.
But my right eye’s vision? Same as it was at the start. Same as now, at the end of the six months: a blotchy, blurry joke. Here’s rooting for the left eye, because I’m out of spares.
But the rest of me is not the same, not remotely, and many of the changes are positive. Or at least I can spin them that way, and that’s maybe the main thing you learn when you stab yourself 52 times: While you have no control over much of what befalls you, you have plenty of control over your perspective on it, your attitude about it.
You can rage pointlessly at the lot you’ve drawn and the hardships you’re confronting or you can take note of, and pride in, the way you’re taking them in stride and moving forward, forward, forward. At one point during the second trial, I sent a text message to a colleague to explain that I was running five minutes late for our scheduled phone call “because I have to impale myself with a big needle.” That was TMI, and hyperbolic to boot, but I figured I was entitled to it under the circumstances. When God gives you lemons, take a bow.
I even, in a strange way, came to look forward to my injections: They set me apart, giving my life its own signature rhythm, its own particular grit. They also demonstrated how a scary oddity can become a humdrum, reflexively executed bore. In that way, they gave me solace. It turns out that I’m tougher — more durable — than I knew.
We all are. “Starfish can regrow limbs,” said a new friend of mine, one of several people with vision impairments whom I had the privilege of meeting only after — and only because of — my own vision loss. “But that’s nothing compared to what human beings can do.” He became legally blind in his 30s, is now in his 70s and has learned to use his hearing, memory and other faculties to navigate Washington, where he lives and works full time. We’re an unfathomably adaptable species. But you learn that only when you’re forced to adapt.
You come to a fork in the road, and you choose between wallowing in self-pity and taking a good, hard look around you. I took the look and, with my cyclops vision, saw how many of the people in my orbit were struggling, how many were bumping up against limits more daunting than mine, how many summoned a grace that gave me something to aspire to, something to emulate. This wasn’t as clear to me before, and I found myself thinking less about blindness in my future and more about the blindness in my past.
During the many tedious hospital visits that were part of my clinical trials, I crossed paths with hundreds of people with afflictions worse than mine. There were patients too young to be going through what they were, patients too weak to move much and patients whose faces were frozen in a grimace of pain. Many had spent much more time in that joyless warren of endless hallways that reeked of disinfectant and dread, and they put me in my place. I still have the ability to maintain an overfull work schedule, to earn a living, to run with my dog in the park. And the 80% chance that I won’t go blind leaves plenty of slack in the knot in my stomach.
I pick up on or tune in to details that I previously didn’t. Not long ago I was at a college to give a speech and was told that one of the top school officials might or might not come backstage to say hello: It depended on her back and her mobility. She indeed showed up. And after we traded the usual courtesies, I thought: We can go on like this for another 10 minutes, or we can have a more meaningful conversation.
I asked her, tentatively, about her health. And for more than 10 minutes, she opened up about her frequent physical ordeals, her surgeries and how she’d learned to cope by focusing on the good days and remembering that the bad ones were never permanent. I felt a connection to her. I was inspired.
Would we have had this exchange many years ago, before my own misfortune? I doubt it. I don’t just see differently now. I listen differently. I hear more. It’s as if I possess this new, extra sense in compensation for the imperiled one. It grew with each injection. It grows still.

Texto completo: Un fiscal asistente del condado de Harris, Texas, fue despedido este viernes tras rechazar investigar un caso de intento de agresión sexual a un preso de una cárcel por considerar que la víctima era un inmigrante ilegal.
Kim Ogg, la fiscal de este condado, en el que se incluye Houston, anunció que tomó la decisión de cesar al funcionario después de que se llevara a cabo una investigación interna. “Preguntar a una víctima acerca de su estatus migratorio está mal, va en contra de nuestras políticas y no podemos tolerarlo”, afirmó en un comunicado.
Los hechos ocurrieron en la noche de Halloween, según The New York Times. Un preso de una cárcel de la metrópoli texana desnudó su miembro e intentó acercarse a otro detenido contra su voluntad, lo que hizo que la víctima gritara pidiendo ayuda.
Un policía intervino y separó a los dos hombres. Después, denunció lo acontecido a la oficina de la Fiscalía del condado de Harris. El agente creía que se abriría una investigación por intento de agresión sexual y que se aplicara ese cargo al presunto autor, un hombre arrestado por supuestamente conducir ebrio.
Pero las cosas no fueron así. El fiscal asistente John Denholm, quien recibió la denuncia del agente, le preguntó si la víctima era un inmigrante regular o no y si estaba dispuesto a testificar.
El policía le dijo que no le parecía una información relevante, pero alegó que el agredido parecía ser de México. Denholm entonces rechazó la denuncia al pensar que se tratara de un indocumentado.
El caso salió a la luz tras la denuncia de un sindicato y generó gran alboroto en Houston, una ciudad con fuerte presencia de hispanos y donde la policía considera una prioridad evitar cuestionar a víctimas y testigos sobre su condición migratoria. Como explica The Washington Post, un policía presentó la demanda ante otro fiscal. Denholm fue reasignado a otras tareas.
Pero dos sindicatos de funcionarios de aplicación de la ley, al menos un legislador estatal y la Liga de Ciudadanos Latinoamericanos Unidos, un grupo nacional de defensa de los latinos, pidieron el despido del fiscal al considerar insuficiente que se le reasignara o se determinara una sanción disciplinaria contra él. El viernes, la fiscal Ogg decidió escuchar estas criticas.
Denholm trabajaba en la oficina de la Fiscalía del condado de Harris desde enero de 2017. Anteriormente estuvo de teniente de la Oficina del Alguacil del mismo condado. El presidente de una organización de agentes locales indicó al Houston Cronicle que ya en otras ocasiones Denholm rechazó casos y tuvo encontronazos con funcionarios de aplicación de la ley.
En un email de este viernes, el ya ex fiscal asistente dijo al Post que sabía quién había formulado las acusaciones que llevaron a su despido y pareció dar a entender que la versión de la policía sobre este caso era incorrecta.

Texto completo: The world, not just the U.S., is experiencing severe political polarization: Britain, Chile, Italy, Lebanon, Israel, Turkey, Greece, Germany, Brazil, etc.
My wife and I returned recently from Britain, a country basically divided in two on the edges with little in the middle. We talked to people on both sides, virtually all of whom understood the division but had little idea on how it would come out.
This is the age of uncertainty, but it has a definite shape. We see it in the current presidential race. It has a basic structure, but it is mystifyingly complex. On the simple level it consists of nationalism versus internationalism, where nationalist President Donald Trump and his Republican loyalists confront establishment Democratic internationalists.
Both sides also have their internal divisions, that is, Republicans include business, government, and non-governmental internationalists and Democrats have many domestic reformers, even nationalist revolutionaries such as U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
This raises a wild card in the presidential race. What if a nationalist far-left Warren or Sanders captures the nomination to battle nationalist Trump? My next column, backed by lots of poll data, will suggest answers.
For now, let's assume front-runner internationalist Joe Biden challenges nationalist Trump. How will this come out? We'll start by exploring the beginning of this great divide.
The early years of this century found the internationalists ascendant, a continuation of the first President Bush, then the Bill Clinton years through those of the second Bush and Barack Obama. Then the political divide burst on the country with the Trump versus Hillary Clinton contest.
A very big dent by Trump was inflicted on internationalism, an era born at the end of the Cold War. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, it seemed as if the whole world could and would get along. No longer an era of us versus them, the threat of World War III vanished. International cooperation was in the air: the unification of Germany, the all-encompassing World Trade Organization, unity against terrorism, treaties on the Iran nuclear program, climate change, trade [NAFTA, TPP], and the explosion of international business. As my acquaintance, Tom Friedman of the New York Times wrote, "The World Is Flat." Globalism emerged triumphant.
Surprisingly to many, a reaction spawned by internationalism burst onto the United States and the world - populist nationalism. It propelled Trump to the White House. Globalism produced lots of enemies; many people felt left out. The world became too big, complex, and less American. And who ran it? Moneyed elites and their partners in politics, media, government, and corporations.
Who was left behind? An influx of non-white immigrants squeezed working-class whites here and around the world. For many, their country was being lost. Their political leaders weren't working for the common man or woman, only for themselves.
Nationalism became their populist refuge. And those who represented and propagandized it became their heroes. The powerless attached themselves to the emerging powerful.
Trump, even though part of the elite appeared to reject that status. It won him key Electoral College rust belt and Southern states to put him in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He glories in being their supreme leader.
Convincing these alienated American voters that the Democratic presidential candidate can cure their angst and anger with needed reforms will determine the results next Nov. 3. Failure to do so probably ensures four more years of Donald Trump.
Stay tuned.

It’s me, the one person waiting for the anonymous Trump book before changing my mind

Texto completo: Previous reviewers of this book have wondered: Who is this book for? Who has so entirely missed the plot of the past four years as to require this dire 'WARNING' by an anonymous Trump (Resistance) official? 'The ideal reader would seem to be an undecided voter who has lived in a cave for the past three years, and is irresistibly moved by quotations from Teddy Roosevelt and solemn invocations of Cicero,' wrote Jennifer Szalai in the New York Times.
Well, I am here to say: It is I! I am the person. I have not lived in a cave, although because of an incident I cannot describe thanks to a prolonged ongoing legal battle with Pat Sajak, I have been cryogenically frozen since 1987 and only just woke up. I had been reserving judgment on Donald Trump for the past four years because I had a very large stack of old Reader's Digests to get through, and I have only just now finished them. Or I was trapped in the ice three winters running with dwindling supplies after my ill-starred decision to continue north in search of the Passage. Actually, it is that I said to myself, 'This standard Republican is not getting up from this armchair until he finishes 'Infinite Jest'!,' which must have been three years ago now. Perhaps I was briefly ensorcelled by trolls? Anyway, it certainly wasn't the cave thing, I know that!
This is the act of courage I have been waiting for. Frankly, books with names on them make me nervous. People with names can be identified and found wanting. Anonymous is untainted by personality or motive. I am picturing Anonymous as maybe a benevolent ghost who has been trapped in the Oval Office and forced to witness all this. Or maybe Spartacus. Or " Odysseus? Indeed, Anonymous is one of my favorite writers, and I've always been struck by his range; he wrote many limericks that I love. I will say I was disappointed by the lack of limericks in this book.
It actually makes me feel more confident, not less, that this person has no name. I know plenty of people with names who work in the Trump administration, and, frankly, I don't think very much of them. If one of them were to write a book, I would not give it the time of day, which, again, I do not know, because I have been otherwise engaged for the past few decades.
Having said that, that this comes from someone working in the White House particularly compels me. People who wanted Trump to fail might well object to him on principle. But people who wanted him to succeed " them I can trust. People unmoved after Charlottesville for whom the turning point was that Trump did not sufficiently honor John McCain's legacy. People who stayed when all others had fled, to keep what I now learn is a burning, rat-infested ship at least afloat, if not pointed even roughly in the right direction. The resistance, as it were, from within. Those are people from whom I want to hear the bad news.
And it certainly doesn't sound like good news! Trump hates it when people take notes? This brought me up short, but I thought: Perhaps he will be able to retain everything that happens in his sharp, steel trap of a mind. But then it turns out, if you keep reading, his mind is not like a steel trap at all. It is like a steel trap only in that if you tried to administer an intelligence test to a steel trap, the trap would not do very well and might injure you in some way.
On top of that, I learned that the president is, in private, a pretty nightmarish boss and a pretty bad sexist. At this stunning news, I called my wife, Solveig, who had waited for me all those years. I read these passages aloud, but somehow she did not seem as shocked as I expected. And when I told her that he even wanted to get rid of judges, that it was so bad that a group of senior officials in the presidency ALMOST RESIGNED (but then decided not to), she just sort of sighed heavily and left the room.
I am glad that someone " or, I guess, No One " is here to tell us these things. I, for one, am stunned.

Airbnb announces plan to verify all listings, hosts

Texto completo: Amid growing concerns about its rental listing platform, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said the company will start verifying all hosts and listings on its platform.
The news comes after a Vice investigation, published last week, uncovered a "nationwide web of deception" where a person or organization was able to exploit Airbnb's rules through phony listings and fake reviews undetected by the company.
Also last week, five people were shot and killed at a Halloween party held in an Airbnb rental in Orinda, California, that specifically prohibited parties. The party was advertised on social media and had more than 100 people in attendance.
On Saturday, in response to the Orinda shooting, Chesky announced on Twitter that the company would ban "party houses," and shared several measures the company would take to combat unauthorized parties and weed out "abusive host and guest conduct."
At the New York Times DealBook Conference on Wednesday and in an email to staffers, Chesky went further, announcing stronger measures and more details about how the company will rebuild trust in its platform to seemingly address both scams and house parties.
Airbnb will start verifying all 7 million listings on its platform, with the goal of reviewing every home listing and host by Dec. 15, 2020. The verification process will seek to vet the accuracy of photos, addresses and listing details as well as inspect for quality standards such as cleanliness, safety and basic home amenities.
The effort will involve "essentially a combination of the company and the community," Chesky said on stage.
"So, we're going to use technology, we're going to use guests, we're going to basically get a confidence score, but we're going to make sure that we can stand behind every single listing, every single host."
While many platforms outsource content review work, a spokesperson for Airbnb said the review team will be internal.
Chesky also said Airbnb would launch a "guest guarantee" on Dec. 15, 2019, for those who arrive at listings that don't match their descriptions on the platform, as well as create a 24/7 "neighbor hotline" staffed with people internally that are "trained by police chiefs" to deal with complaints in a timely manner. Chesky first teased the concept of creating a rapid response team on Saturday.
In the email to staffers, Chesky said the company has retained some law enforcement veterans to help with the training program and protocols for the hotline, including the former chief of police of Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. It is slated to launch by the end of this year.
Chesky reiterated that the company will conduct additional reviews of high-risk reservations. As an example, Chesky said at the conference a high-risk reservation would be a single person booking a 10-room home in the city in which they live for one night.
It's unclear how many people the company will need to hire to meet the new promises. Chesky called the measures "a significant investment."
"Many of us in this industry over the last 10 years are going from a hands-off model... to realizing that's not really enough, that we have to take more responsibility for the stuff on our platform," Chesky said. "I think this has been a gradual, maybe too gradual, transition for our industry."
Chesky said the updates do not impact the company's plans to go public in 2020.
"We are investing for the long-term," Chesky said. "Ultimately we're in the business of trust so we have to make these investments to protect our users."

Texto completo: As states and communities rush to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products linked to vaping, Carol McGruder races from town to town, urging officials to include what she calls “the mother lode of all flavors”: menthol.
McGruder, co-chair of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, has tried for years to warn lawmakers that menthol attracts new smokers, especially African Americans. Now that more officials are willing to listen, she wants them to prohibit menthol cigarettes and cigarillos, not just e-cigarette flavors, to reduce smoking among blacks.
McGruder and other tobacco control researchers are using the youth vaping epidemic — and the vaping-related illnesses sweeping the country — as an opportunity to take on menthol cigarettes, even though they are not related to the illnesses.
“We started to see that vaping is something that we could leverage in order to deal with this whole menthol issue,” said Valerie Yerger, an associate professor of health policy at the University of California-San Francisco.
Menthol is a substance found in mint plants that creates a cooling sensation and masks tobacco flavor in both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Those properties make menthol more appealing to first-time smokers and vapers, even as they pose the same health threats as non-menthol products and may be harder to quit.
Nearly nine out of 10 African American smokers prefer mentholated cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But even as tobacco control activists see opportunity, some African Americans, including smokers, fear discrimination. They predict that banning menthol will lead to a surge in illicit sales of cigarettes and result in additional policing in communities that already face tension with law enforcement.
Joseph Paul, director of political and civic affairs at City of Refuge Los Angeles, a church with about 17,000 members in Gardena, Calif., spoke at a board of supervisors meeting in September against a proposed flavor ban in Los Angeles County that was adopted a week later.
If officials truly wanted to end youth vaping, he later told California Healthline, the ordinance should have targeted only vape flavors and exempted adult smokers and their menthol cigarettes.
“Menthol cigarettes are very popular in the black community, my people smoke menthol cigarettes,” he said.
The Los Angeles County ban prohibits sales but not possession of flavored e-cigarette products, menthol cigarettes and chewing tobacco in the unincorporated area of the county, inhabited by about 1 million people. Shops have until April to clear their shelves of flavored tobacco products.
Paul warned that people will start selling menthol cigarettes illegally: “It’s supply and demand.” That will make the community more vulnerable to police harassment, he said.
In New York City, when officials proposed a ban on menthol cigarettes earlier this year, which has yet to be acted upon, the Rev. Al Sharpton made a similar argument against the measure: Banning menthol would lead to greater tensions with police in black communities.
“I think there is an Eric Garner concern here,” the civil right rights activist told The New York Times in July, referring to the well-known case of a 43-year old black man who died in a chokehold in 2014 while being arrested by New York City police on suspicion of selling single cigarettes.
The flavor bans that are currently sweeping the country have more to do with e-cigarettes than menthol cigarettes.
That’s because a mysterious vaping-related illness has sickened more than 2,050 people nationwide and led to at least 39 deaths. In California, at least 150 residents have fallen ill and at least three have died, according to the California Department of Public Health.
Most of those illnesses have been associated with vaping cannabis products, and yet politicians’ urge to adopt flavored tobacco bans continues.
In July 2016, Chicago became the first major U.S. city to ban menthol cigarette sales, but it limited the prohibition to within 500 feet of schools.
Of the more than 200 communities in the country that restrict or ban the sale of flavored tobacco, fewer than 60 include restrictions on menthol cigarettes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
Aspen, Colo., will ban all flavored nicotine products, including menthol cigarettes, effective Jan. 1. A few communities in Minnesota already have such bans in place. In California, close to 50 communities restrict or ban flavored tobacco products; of those, more than 30 include restrictions on menthol cigarettes. Notably, San Francisco banned menthol cigarettes along with all flavored tobacco products in 2018, before banning all vapes and e-cigarettes earlier this year.
At the national level, the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of flavors in combustible cigarettes in 2009, but exempted menthol. Last November, the agency proposed a ban on menthol-flavored combustible cigarettes, calling their use among youths “especially troubling,” but it has not yet taken action.
Then the Trump administration said in September it would soon ban all flavored e-cigarette products, but it may now be backing away from banning mint and menthol.
Menthol, which was first added to cigarettes in the 1920s, is as old-school as it gets when it comes to flavored tobacco, yet it hasn’t prompted action in the way that vape flavors such as cotton candy and strawberry-melon have. That’s because vaping was embraced by a specific population: affluent white teens, Yerger said.
Big Tobacco aggressively pushed menthol cigarettes on black youths in the 1950s and 60s, and now some people consider Kools and Newports part of black culture, McGruder said.
McGruder and others point out that the tobacco industry has supported and funded civil rights groups and causes, forming relationships with prominent black leaders such as Sharpton. Big Tobacco acknowledged that it has contributed to Sharpton’s organization, the National Action Network, and similar groups.
McGruder said it’s difficult for the African American community to contradict respected male civil rights and religious leaders, so when they argue that menthol bans will lead to criminalization, the community listens.
But Bobby Sheffield, a pastor and vice president of the Riverside County Black Chamber of Commerce, said the criminalization argument is a scare tactic.
“We’re not trying to have anyone incarcerated because they have this product in their possession,” Sheffield said. His organization, which represents local businesses, started campaigning this year for menthol bans in California’s Inland Empire, including the cities of Riverside, San Bernardino and Perris.
Some smokers understand the need to keep tobacco out of the hands of children, but they don’t think it’s fair to include menthol cigarettes.
“It’s stupid. Now they’re trying to act like menthol cigarettes are the problem. These have been around for a long time,” said April Macklin of Sacramento, who smokes Benson & Hedges menthols. She smoked when she was younger, quit, and started again three years ago.
The city of Sacramento will ban the sale of flavored tobacco, including menthol cigarettes, effective Jan. 1.
Macklin, 53, said she might just quit because she won’t smoke anything other than menthol. But even with a ban in place, she doubts menthol cigarettes will be gone for good. “I’m sure people will figure something out,” she said.

Texto completo: The author of the anonymous book being published this month by a “senior Trump administration official” compared President Trump to a child based on his ability to handle the responsibilities of the Oval Office.
This author is the same anonymous Trump official who published an opinion piece in the New York Times last year, alleging that there is a group of administration officials working against the president's interest and agenda.
The book, titled A Warning, describes the president as “a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport,” according to an excerpt that was published by the Washington Post Thursday.
The author also claimed that senior officials have woken up "in a full-blown panic" over the president's tweets.
“It’s like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him,” the author writes. “You’re stunned, amused, and embarrassed all at the same time. Only your uncle probably wouldn’t do it every single day, his words aren’t broadcast to the public, and he doesn’t have to lead the U.S. government once he puts his pants on.”
Excerpts of some of the claims in the book have already been repudiated. In one claim, the author wrote that Vice President Mike Pence would be supportive of the idea of invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office.
"FAKE NEWS," Pence's press secretary Katie Waldman tweeted after the excerpt was published.

Push meets pushback on anti-tech fervor

Texto completo: Washington • Thomas Lambert, a professor at the University of Missouri’s law school, gave his former colleague Josh Hawley a warning before Hawley became a senator in January.
Lambert had been wary of Hawley’s decision in 2017, as Missouri’s attorney general, to open an antitrust investigation into Google, saying he didn’t see the state’s logic for the case. While he wished Hawley well in Congress, and said he was glad they were friends, Lambert also noted that he would continue to speak out when he disagreed with the senator’s policy positions.
“And he said, ‘I assume you mean on things like tech,’ ” Lambert recalled recently. “And I said, ‘Well, mainly.’”
Their interaction highlights a deepening divide in Washington and around the country. The rising movement in the United States to consider charging the country’s biggest tech companies with violating antitrust laws is running headlong into powerful and well-funded conservatives and libertarians committed to pushing back on those efforts. They include academics like Lambert; lawmakers like Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah; and groups like the Koch political network and others that are connected to the tech companies themselves.
These conservatives have largely dominated antitrust law for decades, leading to few breakups of big companies or blocked mergers. Although their ranks have dwindled somewhat in the last year, as anti-tech arguments have become more bipartisan, they still occupy positions stretching from Capitol Hill to campuses around the country.
But their power and influence have never been tested like this. The House Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and almost every state attorney general’s office is investigating at least one of Silicon Valley’s giants. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made breaking up the tech giants and other corporate behemoths a prominent part of her presidential campaign.
Hawley, a Republican who was on the faculty at the University of Missouri’s law school with Lambert, has helped lead the efforts in Congress to rethink how the government handles the big tech companies. He recently told Facebook’s chief executive that he should voluntarily spin off two of his company’s most valuable services.
“I firmly believe that antitrust scrutiny is warranted,” Hawley said.
His actions have pushed Lambert to deliver on his earlier warning, which Hawley says he does not remember.
“This thinking is dangerous for conservatives,” Lambert recently tweeted after Hawley brushed off his libertarian foes. He has also repeatedly pushed back on Big Tech’s critics, recently denouncing their “snobbery and know-betterism.”
At the center of the debate is a legal standard used to decide antitrust cases for decades. Judges and regulators often ask whether a dominant company is harming consumers and usually hang their analysis on whether prices have gone up or down.
Some proponents of looking aggressively at the tech companies argue that existing laws are adequate and that the government just needs to enforce them correctly. At least one major regulator appears sympathetic to that argument.
“I think the antitrust laws are flexible,” Makan Delrahim, the top antitrust official at the Justice Department, said recently at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal. He added that it was important for the laws to be “vigorously enforced.”
Other proponents of tough action say Congress should modify existing laws to institute a new test for monopoly cases, like factoring in the effect that a company’s dominance has on workers or competitors. Still others see a solution somewhere in between.
“What has happened is the spectrum has stretched a bit,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a group that favors strong enforcement of the traditional approach to antitrust. The organization has received funding from some tech companies.
Some of the conservatives resisting the push for antitrust action say many problems with large Silicon Valley companies have nothing to do with competition. They point, for example, to concerns about privacy and accuse Big Tech’s critics of applying antitrust laws to solve a problem better suited to new data regulations.
Others say efforts to change how the government polices competition are moving too fast. Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, has written a draft paper arguing that the movement to change the law “has emerged out of virtually nowhere to claim a position at the bargaining table over antitrust reform and the future of the antitrust enterprise.” Thibault Schrepel, a professor at the Utrecht University School of Law, has said human flourishing “should be enhanced by applying reason to antitrust law; not fears, not feelings, not sentiments, not intuitions.”
The tech giants back many similar arguments. Both Facebook and Google have financed a slate of groups that support current antitrust law.
Lambert and Schrepel are both affiliated with the International Center for Law & Economics, a research nonprofit that has received financing from Google, Amazon and Facebook, among other major companies. Geoffrey Manne, the center’s leader, said that its affiliates were not paid but that some “have received honoraria for conferences or travel assistance, or grants to support their work, as have some nonaffiliates.” Lambert also sits on the organization’s board — a position for which, he says, he is not paid.
On Capitol Hill, Lee has led the defense of existing antitrust law.
As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, Lee has held a series of hearings over the last two years at which he or his witnesses have questioned the calls to rethink antitrust law. He was also quick to question the purpose of the House Judiciary Committee’s inquiry into the market power of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, accusing the panel of trying to perform a role best left to law enforcement agencies.
Lee has been accused of letting money influence his views on the subject. The Google Transparency Project, a nonprofit that tracks the tech giant’s connections to government, recently raised questions about whether he was influenced by donations from Google and its allies.
Lee dismissed those accusations as “paranoid fantasy.” (The Google Transparency Project has received funding from Oracle, a Google competitor.)
Recently, the antitrust holdouts have found a new ally in industrialist Charles Koch. The Koch-affiliated Americans for Prosperity ran digital ads this year urging senators and attorneys general to stick to the current approach to antitrust.
Still, many of those arguing to keep the legal status quo acknowledge that the debate has shifted, with their opponents’ position becoming rapidly more mainstream.
Lee said last month that the pushback was “not necessarily going to get you a lot of favorable publicity.”
The debate can take on a heated and personal tone. At a conference this spring, soft-spoken legal academic Tim Wu responded to doubts raised by Tyler Cowen, an economist, about whether America has dangerous levels of corporate concentration by saying it was like arguing with someone who believes the Earth is flat. Another speaker at the same event compared one critic of the antimonopoly position to a climate change denier.
The enmity goes both ways. Some conservatives have applied a dismissive nickname to the efforts to rethink the existing laws: hipster antitrust.
The holdouts may have one long-term advantage: For now, they say, federal judges are likely to agree with them. Antitrust doctrine is largely settled in court, and judges largely support it. Crane, the Michigan professor, noted that those judges could take a long time to change their ways.

“Over the last two or three years, there has been something of a shift,” he said. “Only time will tell whether it proves to be a momentary fad or something more significant.”

Texto completo: I recently had two experiences in which folks reached across the political aisle. Respect and patience were displayed. Assumptions were minimized; stereotypes were not enlisted. These experiences did not occur in some exotic place, or even in the eastern, purplest part of North Dakota. These experiences happened in central-western North Dakota -- namely, in Bismarck and Dickinson.
One of said experiences was my participation in a panel on the New York Times' 1619 Project, held by the Dickinson State University College Republicans. My fellow panelists were Dr. Eric Grabowsky (the club's faculty adviser), Dr. Donald F. Johnson of North Dakota State University, and Casey Buchmann, a 2018 Democratic-Nonpartisan League candidate for the Public Service Commission. The 1619 Project's writers argue that the arrival of African slaves to American colonies should be considered the true beginning of our nation. I am sure you can imagine how a panel like this could go horribly wrong. Yet, the College Republicans and their adviser ensured that it was professional, open and interesting.
The other significant experience was this month's First Friday gathering of the BisMan chapter of the North Dakota Women's Network. At this gathering, women of both parties discussed the importance of women running for local and statewide office. Women who had previously run for office emphasized how critical it was to give and receive encouraging words during election campaigns, including across the aisle.
Thus, these inspiring bipartisan interactions were not achieved through avoiding discussion of politics or parties. We can choose to be gracious ambassadors of our political party even while openly acknowledging difference.
I'm not suggesting we look the other way while contempt and ugliness rule the day in Washington. What I am asking is that we see the full humanity of ordinary North Dakotans who identify with a different political party than our own. A group called "Better Angels" -- an organization of citizens "uniting red and blue Americans in a working alliance to depolarize America" -- defines depolarization in the way I'm using the term. Luke Phillips explains it as less about enforcing moderate views and more about "rebuilding social ties and relationships across partisan divides, and reducing individuals' sense of disgust for people of opposing political opinions."
I'm not scaling back my pro-union stance -- or my belief in inclusive public education -- to achieve some comfortable type of centrism. But I can show respect to someone who is skeptical of the labor movement, or who believes that private/charter schools are the answer to North Dakota's challenges. That someone is still a resident of my state, a citizen of my country and a human being. Practicing this kind of depolarization has never been easy, but the right thing to do is often the harder thing to do. I write these words to keep myself accountable as much as I write them to persuade readers like you.
Most of us barely even chose our political affiliation. Political scientists have firmly demonstrated that we usually adopt the same party identity as our parents. If your party identity deviates from that of your family, you are bucking the trend. Furthermore, with only two large, mainstream, statewide parties, the GOP and the Dem-NPL will serve as the catch-all parties for most. While belief systems exist along a multifaceted political spectrum, we're mostly dumped into two crude buckets. We're adopting labels that obscure within-party diversity as well as cross-party agreements. How invested in these labels should we really be?
Looking toward 2020, we should borrow from the examples set by DSU's College Republicans and BisMan's Women's Network chapter. We don't have to conceal or erase our differences to center our shared humanity.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's campaign said he "just about dragged" Gov. Matt Bevin across the finish line of Tuesday's election after the incumbent governor lost to Democrat Andy Beshear, and Republican leaders have been quick to defend him.
Trump tweeted late Tuesday the "Fake News will blame Trump" for Bevin's loss, but Republicans have credited the president for Bevin picking up several points after Trump's visit to Kentucky on Monday night, including Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
"No one energizes our base like @realDonaldTrump," McDaniel tweeted Tuesday. "In Kentucky, the governor was down 17 points. President Trump helped lift the entire ticket, winning 5 of 6 statewide races so far!"
Is the president to thank for keeping the race close?
Bevin trailed Beshear by about 5,100 votes after all were counted. He requested a recanvass Wednesday afternoon, alleging unspecified "irregularities" had occurred during the election.
But polls in the weeks leading up to the election had Bevin and Beshear deadlocked in the race. A Mason-Dixon survey in mid-October found Bevin and Beshear tied at 46% each.
A Republican National Committee spokeswoman told The New York Times that McDaniel's tweet was referring to a poll by Targoz Market Research on FiveThirtyEight showing Beshear was ahead by 17 points in mid-October.
However, FiveThirtyEight gave the pollster a grade of "C/D" for its reliability, "below average."
Most other polls showed the race much closer than 17 points, including the Republican Governors Association survey, which reportedly showed Bevin leading Beshear by 2 points two weeks before the election.

Texto completo: HAMPTON -Growing up in Iowa, Nikole Hannah-Jones had a few a-ha moments about the year 1619 and its significance.
One really hit home during high school. A teacher tasked with cramming a couple hundred years of black history into four months of lessons gave the future journalist the book "Before the Mayflower: A History of the Negro in America, 1619-1962" by Lerone Bennett.
Published more than a decade before Hannah-Jones was born, it proved quite a revelation, especially on page 29, where she first saw mention of the year.
"I just remember being struck that we have grown up knowing about the Mayflower and 1620 but had never heard of the White Lion," Hannah-Jones reflected. "And it came a year earlier, and arguably had much more momentous cargo than the Mayflower did."
Hannah-Jones, 43, now a magazine writer with the New York Times, was speaking about the first "20-and-odd Africans" who arrived aboard the White Lion ship to the English colonies 400 years ago. Their presence not only changed the colony, but should be considered the actual birth of America, she believed.
Years later, those original revelations ultimately led to the "The 1619 Project"- a series of essays, poems, images, podcasts and other multimedia that strives to recast the narrative of those first-generation Africans through a modern lens.
Hannah-Jones, who spearheaded the Times' project, discussed the nearly six-month effort Wednesday during a student-led interview program at Hampton University's Scripps Howard School of Journalism.
She pitched the project to editors in February. The idea was less a retrospective and more about how the vibrations of past events still have repercussions today.
"As the anniversary was approaching, I understood that most Americans have never heard of the year 1619," Hannah-Jones told attendees Wednesday in a packed auditorium.
"And just like everything else about the black experience ... this anniversary was likely on a path without any notice or any acknowledgment in most places. And here I am with the New York Times ... and I can do something about it. ... And that's when I decided that I was going to pitch our project to force us not to tell a history of slavery, but actually talk about the modern legacy of slavery."
The project, with research from several scholars and dozens of contributing journalists, centered on slavery, anti-racism and the contributions of black Americans, she said.
"Most of us have been taught that the only thing you've ever contributed to this country was our labor," Hannah-Jones said. "We contributed far more than that."
A focal point of the project, in addition to highlighting that America is "a nation founded on the enslavement of one-fifth of our population," she said, and a developed caste system to justify it, was to take an aspect of modern American life most people would think had nothing to do with slavery and show, through scholarship, how it's connected.
"The history we learn is as much about what is in there and what is not. This project is about what is not," she said before the event. "We've been largely left out of that narrative or marginalized in that narrative. And as a result, marginalized as a people. And confronting the truth of that is the only way that will allow us to actually do something about it. I hope ... what students or any reader will take from this is that this is not something in the past.
"Slavery ended 150 years ago, but the architecture of it is still with us."
The Times published the comprehensive 98-page magazine in mid-August, ahead of events around Hampton Roads and elsewhere commemorating the 400th anniversary of those first-generation Africans' landing to the English colonies.
Since, Hannah-Jones has been touring HBCUs around the country to discuss the project.
"This is where it all began. And what is kind of amazing about Hampton is this is the place where slavery began, but also its where liberation began," she said.
On Wednesday, HU senior Randall Williams interviewed Hannah-Jones and moderated a Q&A session that followed.
The auditorium bustled with activity, students making their way in and out of a packed auditorium, while others watched from the overflow seating area in the hallway.
For Williams, 21, reading the report was one huge a-ha moment. The Midwestern said he learned more in those 98 pages than perhaps he learned in all of elementary school.
"I'm just consistently shook," Williams said. "It answered all a lot of questions I didn't even know I had."
Williams said with so much of African American history hard to embrace, reading the report added layers of understanding and context.
"It doesn't make you feel guilty while reading. And that's a big thing," Williams said. "I think that's the beautiful thing about the entire piece."
Amanda Harvey, 19, a biology major, appreciated Hannah-Jones' message to remind African Americans of their role and the American culture they helped established.
"As black people we are still trying to build ourselves up ... but we are still 100,000 steps behind. It's still kind of that slow progression," Harvey said.

The high cost of 'cancel culture'

Texto completo: The other day, former President Barack Obama caused some excitement in the social and professional media when, during an Obama Foundation event, he chided people on the left - especially on college campuses - who try too hard to be "woke" and think the best way to be an activist is to "cast stones" on Twitter over minor transgressions. The comments were widely reported as a critique of "cancel culture."
Obama never used the phrase, but cancel culture - the trend of shunning or shaming people for perceived offenses against progressive morality - has been the subject of much discussion. Over the weekend, The New York Times ran a long feature story about people who belong to an informal network of the "canceled." (For the record, I am briefly mentioned in it.) 
Some people vigorously dispute that cancel culture exists - or argue that, if it does, it's a good thing. In a Times op-ed, Ernest Owens, a young African-American journalist, scolds Obama for being an out-of-touch scold and argues that the cancel brigades aren't bullying people but standing up to those who bully the vulnerable. A recent Washington Post opinion piece by Brooklyn-based writer Aaron Freedman contends that cancel culture is nothing more than democracy - people using the freedom to "collectively express their disapproval" of some individuals and their behavior or speech.
In fact, few would disagree that certain individuals deserve vocal disapproval, public scorn or even loss of access to platforms - former Hollywood tycoon and accused serial predator Harvey Weinstein being the most notable example. It's all a matter of proportionality.
Maybe comedian Shane Gillis was rightly dropped by "Saturday Night Live" over videos in comedy monologues that include racial slurs. But should pop music and art critic Art Tavana, one of the people profiled in the Times feature on the "canceled," have lost his column with the L.A. Weekly and contracts with several major magazines because a handful of feminists on the internet were upset by his article discussing the sex appeal of musician Sky Ferreira and more generally the role of sexiness in pop music?
Should Katie Herzog, a writer for the Seattle weekly The Stranger, be slammed as a "transphobe" - not only online, but in stickers showing up in the streets of Seattle - because she has written about people who choose to reverse their gender transition?
There is nothing new about attempts to punish or silence people for expression deemed bad. And it's certainly not only the left that does it. Quite a few conservatives wanted to cancel television star Ellen DeGeneres when she came out as gay in 1997.
But misgivings over cancel culture are proliferating for two reasons. One, social media have enabled quick mobilization that makes it easy to target a person over a trivial or even nonexistent offense. Two, the rapid and chaotic evolution of social norms makes it very likely that people will be targeted over opinions on issues that are far from settled, or offenses that just became offensive. At a campus conference I attended last month, a student denounced a speaker for "racist" language over the word "Hispanic" - in use by the Census Bureau.
Do some foes of cancel culture whine about being criticized? No doubt. Use of the term should be limited to cases in which there is at least a serious attempt to silence someone or damage someone's career. But that still leaves us with plenty of cases. And even if the "canceled" recover, we all lose when political discourse and artistic expression are chilled as a result.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Vice President Mike Pence returned to New Hampshire on Thursday to file to place the name of his boss – President Donald Trump – on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot.
And the vice president made some news during his stop at the Secretary of State's office in the State House.
Pence blasted a new report suggesting he had considered supporting the use of the 25th Amendment to have President Trump removed from office.
And on the day that a foreign policy aide to the vice president was testifying in front of the Democrats' House impeachment inquiry, Pence emphasized that neither he nor the president did anything wrong in their dealings with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Speaking with the Monitor and other news organizations after the filing ceremony, Pence dismissed “without qualification” rumors that he considered invoking the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Pence's comments came hours after the anonymous author of an upcoming anti-Trump book reportedly cited anonymous sources to declare that the vice president would support the 25th Amendment to have the president removed from office. Huffington Post obtained an excerpt of A Warning, which is written by the unnamed senior Trump administration official who penned a scathing attack on the president in an anonymous New York Times op-ed last year.
The vice president told the Monitor that “when those rumors came out a few years ago, I dismissed them then. I never heard any discussion in my entire tenure as vice president about the 25th Amendment. And why would I? I mean the record that we're celebrating today here in New Hampshire, the record that we're going to be taking all across this country is a testament to President Donald Trump's leadership.”
And the vice president took aim at the author, saying “it's just appalling to me. If there's someone in our administration or served in our administration who doesn't support this president, doesn't support his agenda, they should do the honorable thing and resign.”
As Pence filed in New Hampshire, Jennifer Williams – his special adviser for Europe and Russia – was behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. The White House had tried to prevent Williams from appearing or limiting her testimony, but she complied with a subpoena served by the majority House Democrats. Williams was on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky.
The president has come under fire over the phone conversation, in which he asked Zelensky to look into the dealings of former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine. Biden is one of the top Democrats aiming to challenge Trump in next year's election. Fueled by whistleblower complaints, a transcript of the call released by the White House and the testimony of numerous witnesses, Democrats have argued the president was asking a foreign country to try interfering in a U.S. election.
Adding to the controversy was the fact that before that phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was put on hold. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, Trump repeatedly has insisted that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no “quid pro quo” and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”
Pence told reporters “the American people have the transcript of the president's call and they can see that there was no quid pro quo and the president did nothing wrong.”
The vice president, who's remained on the periphery of the issue to date, stressed “in all of my discussions with President Zelensky, we focused exclusively on President Zelensky's efforts to end corruption in Ukraine and also to enlist more European support ... I know as the facts continue to come out, people will see that the president did nothing wrong, that the focus of our administration, all of my contacts with President Zelensky, were in the national interest.”
New Hampshire was Trump's first primary victory. His crushing win over a large field of 2016 GOP rivals launched him toward winning the nomination and eventually the White House.
Pence filed on behalf of his boss – continuing a tradition of the vice president filing in New Hampshire on behalf of an incumbent president running for re-election. Then-vice president Joe Biden traveled to New Hampshire in 2011 on behalf of President Barack Obama, as they ran for re-election in 2012.
“For this small town boy from southern Indiana, it's a very humbling day for me,” Pence stressed. “To be able to be here today in the first-in-the nation primary state to be able to have the privilege to adding his name to the ballot is a great honor to me.”
Pence highlighted “the level of enthusiasm across America for President Trump and for what he's been able to do for the American people.”
But there's plenty of speculation the vice president will run for the top stop in 2024. Pence told reporters “I'll keep you posted.”
Adding the speculation, Pence made a pit stop after his State House visit. He greeted customers at Manchester's century-old Puritan Backroom restaurant – a must-stop for generations of White House hopefuls.
Kasich partially closesdoor to 2020 run
Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich – back in New Hampshire for the first time in the year – mostly – but not entirely – closed the door on Thursday to a primary challenge against the president. Kasich, who finished second to Trump in the 2016 New Hampshire Republican presidential primary, said he won't file to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot.
“What it looks like for me at this point and time is there is no path. We're only eight days away from the filing deadline here and I don't intend to file because I don't see a path.”
But the very vocal Trump critic didn't totally shut the door to running in 2020, saying he doesn't know what the future will bring.
“There might be a path that I stumble across sometime soon,” Kasich noted. “I don't know what will happen in this election cycle.”
And he didn't rule out a 2024 run, noting “I don't know what will happen in this election cycle. I know this – in the next election cycle I will be younger than the three leading candidates that are running for president today in the Democratic Party, so that's always a possibility.”
Lewandowski says2020 decision coming soon
Potential U.S. Senate candidate Corey Lewandowski says a decision's coming soon on whether he'll jump into the race for New Hampshire's GOP U.S. Senate nomination. The winner of next September's primary will face off in a year against two-term Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.
Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign manager and cable news surrogate, who remains a close outside adviser and loyalist to the president, was at the Secretary of State's office for the visit by Pence.
Lewandowski said, “I'll make my decision by the end of the year, looking at the political climate, looking at my best ability to help this president get re-elected and looking at my family's commitments of what a Senate race does, so I'll make this decision by the end of this year, one way or another to get into this race.”
Three Republican candidates are already in the race – retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc, former N.H. House Speaker Bill O'Brien, and self-made millionaire attorney Bryant “Corky” Messner.
Lewandowski is currently a key cable-news surrogate for the president as Trump pushes back against the House impeachment inquiry.
Asked if he could run for the Senate and continue his efforts on behalf of the president, he said, “I think there's an opportunity to continue to be an advocate for the president against this narrative that he did something wrong as it relates to this impeachment process. But running for the Senate is a full-time job.”
But he added that, “I love a fight and I think if I would run against Jeanne Shaheen, it would be unlike any race she's seen before.”

Texto completo: Senior Trump administration officials considered resigning en masse last year in a "midnight self-massacre" to sound a public alarm about President Trump's conduct, but rejected the idea because they believed it would further destabilize an already teetering government, according to a new book by an unnamed author.
In "A Warning" by Anonymous, obtained by The Washington Post ahead of its release, a writer described only as "a senior official in the Trump administration" paints a chilling portrait of the president as cruel, inept and a danger to the nation he was elected to lead.
The author - who first captured attention in 2018 as the unidentified author of a New York Times opinion column - describes Trump careening from one self-inflicted crisis to the next, "like a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport."
The book is an unsparing character study of Trump, from his morality to his intellectual depth, which the author writes is based on his or her observations and experiences. The author claims many other current and former administration officials share his or her views.
The 259-page book - which was published by Twelve, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group, and goes on sale Nov. 19 - does not re-create many specific episodes in vivid detail, which the author writes was intentional to protect his or her identity.
At a moment when a stream of political appointees and career public servants have testified before Congress about Trump's conduct as part of the House impeachment inquiry, the book's author defends his or her decision to remain anonymous.
"I have decided to publish this anonymously because this debate is not about me," the author writes. "It is about us . It is about how we want the presidency to reflect our country, and that is where the discussion should center. Some will call this 'cowardice.' My feelings are not hurt by the accusation. Nor am I unprepared to attach my name to criticism of President Trump. I may do so, in due course."
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham derided the book as a "work of fiction" and its anonymous author as a "coward."
"The coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies," Grisham wrote in an email. "Real authors reach out to their subjects to get things fact checked - but this person is in hiding, making that very basic part of being a real writer impossible. Reporters who choose to write about this farce should have the journalistic integrity to cover the book as what it is - a work of fiction."
Earlier this week, the Justice Department warned Hachette and the author's agents, Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of Javelin, that the anonymous official may be violating a nondisclosure agreement. Javelin responded by accusing the administration of seeking to unmask the author.
The author's Sept. 5, 2018, op-ed in the Times, headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration," depicted some senior officials as a bulwark protecting the country from the president's reckless impulses. Trump denounced it at the time as treasonous.
In the book, the author repudiates the central thesis of the column: "I was wrong about the 'quiet resistance' inside the Trump administration. Unelected bureaucrats and cabinet appointees were never going to steer Donald Trump the right direction in the long run, or refine his malignant management style. He is who he is."

The author describes senior officials waking up in the morning "in a full-blown panic" over the wild pronouncements the president had made on Twitter.
"It's like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him," the author writes. "You're stunned, amused, and embarrassed all at the same time. Only your uncle probably wouldn't do it every single day , his words aren't broadcast to the public, and he doesn't have to lead the US government once he puts his pants on."
The book depicts Trump as making misogynistic and racist comments behind the scenes.
"I've sat and listened in uncomfortable silence as he talks about a woman's appearance or performance," the author writes. "He comments on makeup. He makes jokes about weight. He critiques clothing. He questions the toughness of women in and around his orbit. He uses words like 'sweetie' and 'honey' to address accomplished professionals. This is precisely the way a boss shouldn't act in the work environment."
The author alleges that Trump attempted a Hispanic accent during an Oval Office meeting to complain about migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
"We get these women coming in with like seven children," Trump said, according to the book. "They are saying, 'Oh, please help! My husband left me!' They are useless. They don't do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something."
The author argues that Trump is incapable of leading the United States through a monumental international crisis, describing how he tunes out intelligence and national security briefings and theorizing that foreign adversaries see him as "a simplistic pushover" who is susceptible to flattery and easily manipulated.
After the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, the author writes, Trump vented to advisers and said he would be foolish to stand up to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
"Do you know how stupid it would be to pick this fight?" Trump said, according to the book. "Oil would go up to one hundred fifty dollars a barrel. Jesus. How [expletive] stupid would I be?"

The book contains a handful of startling assertions that are not backed up with evidence, such as a claim that if a majority of the Cabinet were prepared to remove Trump from office under the 25th Amendment, Vice President Pence would have been supportive.
Pence denied this on Thursday, calling the book "appalling" and telling reporters, "I never heard anything in my time as vice president about the 25th Amendment. And why would I?"
One theme laced throughout the book is Trump's indifference to the boundaries of the law. The author writes that Trump considered presidential pardons as "unlimited 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards on a Monopoly board," referring to news reports that he had offered pardons to aides.
As he ranted about federal courts ruling against some of his policies, including the 2017 travel ban, the author writes, Trump once asked White House lawyers to draft a bill to send to Congress reducing the number of federal judges.
"Can we just get rid of the judges? Let's get rid of the [expletive] judges," the president said, according to the book. "There shouldn't be any at all, really."
The author portrays Trump as fearful of coups against him and suspicious of note-takers on his staff. According to the book, the president shouted at an aide who was scribbling in a notebook during a meeting, "What the [expletive] are you doing?" He added, "Are you [expletive] taking notes?" The aide apologized and closed the notebook.
The author also ruminates about Trump's fitness for office, describing him as reckless and without full control of his faculties.
"I am not qualified to diagnose the president's mental acuity," the author writes. "All I can tell you is that normal people who spend any time with Donald Trump are uncomfortable by what they witness. He stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information, not occasionally but with regularity. Those who would claim otherwise are lying to themselves or to the country."

Trump’s big mistake worthy of censure

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — On Jan. 20, 2017, The Washington Post reported that “The effort to impeach President Donald John Trump is already underway.” Even before Trump took the oath of office that day, Democratic groups were looking for a pretext to remove him from office.
They thought they would get one from special counsel Robert Mueller. Instead, Mueller found that Trump did not conspire with Russia to steal the 2016 election. But rather than capitalize on that moment of vindication, Trump decided to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and give Democrats the pretext they had been looking for — by asking Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden.
Democrats can’t believe their luck. Unlike Russia, this time Trump actually did something wrong. The president’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not “perfect,” as Trump repeatedly claims. A USA Today-Suffolk University poll finds that only 30% of Americans believe there was nothing wrong with the call. But the same poll finds that just 38% think it was an impeachable offense, while 21% say it was wrong but not impeachable.
That means most Americans agree with Democrats that Trump did something wrong, but only a minority believe his misconduct rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. Worse still for Democrats, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, 53% of Americans believe that their impeachment inquiry is politically motivated. And in six key swing states likely to decide the 2020 election, voters oppose removing Trump from office by a margin of 53% to 43%, according to a New York Times-Siena College survey.
So, unless some bombshell evidence emerges to turn public opinion decisively in favor of impeachment, Trump will not be removed from office. Impeachment would be a purely symbolic act.
So why not drop impeachment and censure him instead?
There is precedent for doing so. In 1834, the Senate voted to censure President Andrew Jackson (whose portrait Trump has proudly hung in the Oval Office) over his stonewalling of a congressional investigation into Jackson’s decision to shut down the Second Bank of the United States. If Congress voted to censure Trump, it would make him only the second president in history to have been so explicitly reprimanded.
The House could easily pass such a censure resolution and might even do so with a bipartisan majority. Right now, House Republicans feel no pressure to vote for impeachment, and Senate Republicans feel no pressure to convict, because most Americans agree with them that Trump’s conduct is not impeachable. They know that, if anything, impeachment poses a greater political danger to Democrats, putting at risk 31 House seats held by freshman Democrats in districts Trump carried in 2016.
But by censuring instead of impeaching the president, Democrats could easily turn the political calculus against the GOP. The Post reports that a growing number of Republicans are ready to acknowledge that the president did use military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to investigate the Biden family but that “the president’s action was not illegal and does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.” To oppose a censure resolution, Republicans would have to argue not just that the president’s misconduct does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense, but that there was no misconduct at all. Clearly there was, and Americans know it. Censure would put public opinion squarely on the Democrats’ side and put Republicans in a political bind.
A bipartisan censure vote would ultimately be more damaging to Trump than impeachment along party lines. The impeachment inquiry is energizing Trump voters, who believe Democrats are trying to invalidate their votes by removing Trump from office. Censure would take away that argument. It would be dispiriting to Trump’s base, especially if some Republicans joined Democrats in voting to rebuke the president. Trump would be furious at a bipartisan vote of censure.
The Senate would not be required to take up a censure resolution passed by the House, but so what? Jackson’s censure was passed by only one house of Congress. If the House censured the president, and the Senate failed to even vote on the resolution, it would look very bad for Republicans.
Will Democrats do it? Probably not. Their ravenous base wants to brook no compromise. But because impeachment will be nothing more than an act of censure anyway, why not actually censure Trump and pressure some Republicans to vote against their president? Then leave the decision of whether to remove Trump from office where it belongs — in the hands of the American people next November.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg might be running for president in the Democratic Party. That should be exciting for ... well, it's hard to say.
The billionaire and former mayor of New York is apparently dispatching staffers to start gathering signatures.
As first reported by the New York Times' Alexander Burns, Bloomberg sent staffers to Alabama, which has a Friday deadline for candidates to enter the 2020 race and begin the process of qualifying for the ballot.
If Bloomberg decides to actually run (he may just be buying time before making a decision later), it's hard to see who will be climbing aboard the Bloomberg train.
New York City liberals? That didn't work out so well for current Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Gun control fanatics? Beto O'Rourke wanted to ban the AR-15, one of the most popular rifles in the country. Soon after, he admitted his floundering campaign was going nowhere and promptly dropped out.
Identity politics-obsessed liberals? Bloomberg is just another old white man but without the Obama connection and black support that Joe Biden has.
As MSNBC host Chris Hayes said on Twitter, "Who will speak for the billionaires?" But even that group is already covered by billionaire climate change activist Tom Steyer.
That basically leaves just nanny state liberals. Want to ban sugary drinks, fatty foods, and vaping? Bloomberg is your man. Are there enough people on board the "banned-wagon" to boost him past seasoned politicians such as Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren? Maybe enough to get on the primary debate stage, although even that is doubtful, but not the general election stage.
There's no reason for Bloomberg to run. He'll have little impact on the race. It's just another way for a bored billionaire to waste his money.

Paul Krugman: Now it is the centerists who are out of touch with reality

Texto completo: Will the Democratic presidential nomination go to a centrist or a progressive? Which choice would give the party the best chance in next year’s election? Honestly, I have no idea.
One thing I can say, however, is that neither centrism nor progressivism is what it used to be.
There was a time when arguments between centrists and progressives were framed as debates between realism and idealism. These days, however, it often seems as if the centrists, not the progressives, are out of touch with reality. Indeed, sometimes it feels as if centrists are Rip Van Winkles who spent the last 20 years in a cave and missed everything that has happened to America and the world since the 1990s.
You can see this in politics, where Joe Biden has repeatedly declared that Republicans will have an “epiphany” once Donald Trump is gone, and once again become reasonable people Democrats can deal with. Given the GOP’s scorched-earth politics during the Obama years, that’s a bizarre claim.
You can also see it in economics. There are many reasonable criticisms you could offer of Elizabeth Warren’s economic proposals. But the one I keep seeing is that Warren would turn America into (cue scary music) Europe, maybe even (cue even scarier music) France. And you have to wonder whether people who say such things have paid any attention to either Europe or America over the past few decades.
Just to be clear, Europe does have big economic problems. But they’re not the ones such people seem to imagine.
When people say such things, they seem to have in mind a picture of the U.S.-Europe comparison that did seem to have some validity in the 1990s. In that picture, nations with large social spending and extensive government regulation of markets suffered from “Eurosclerosis,” persistent lack of jobs.
Employers, the story went, were reluctant to expand both because of high taxes and because they feared not being able to fire workers once hired. At the same time, workers had little incentive to accept jobs because they could live off generous social programs.
Europe also seemed to be lagging in the adoption of new technology: For a while, the U.S. surged ahead in making use of the internet and information technology in general, leading to arguments that Europe’s high taxes and regulation were discouraging innovation.
But all of that was a long time ago. The jobs gap has largely vanished; adults in their prime working years are actually more likely to be employed in Europe, France included, than they are in America.
Any gap in the adoption of information technology has also long since vanished; households in much of Europe are as or more likely to have broadband than their U.S. counterparts, partly because the U.S. failure to limit providers’ monopoly power has led to much higher prices for internet access.
It’s true that European nations have lower GDP per capita than we do, but that’s largely because, unlike most Americans, most Europeans actually have significant vacation time and hence work fewer hours per year. This sounds like a choice about work-life balance, not an economic problem.
And on that most fundamental of indicators, life expectancy, the U.S. has fallen far behind: French residents can expect, on average, to live more than four years longer than Americans. Why? Universal health care and policies that mitigate extreme inequality are the most likely explanations.
Now, I don’t want this to sound like praise of all things European. The nations on the euro remain terribly vulnerable to financial crises, because they’ve adopted a shared currency without a shared banking safety net; only the heroic leadership of Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, avoided a catastrophic collapse of the euro in 2012.
Europe also suffers from persistent weakness in demand because key players, Germany in particular, have an obsessive fear of deficits, even when the European economy desperately needs stimulus.
These are big problems, severe enough that I wouldn’t be surprised if Europe is the epicenter of the next global crisis. But the problem with Europe is not that its social programs are too generous and its governments too intrusive. If anything, it’s almost the opposite: Europe’s economy is vulnerable because a combination of political fragmentation and ideological rigidity has left its politicians unwilling to be Keynesian enough.
The point is that centrists who point to Europe as an illustration of the bad things that happen when you’re too enthusiastic about pursuing social justice are stuck decades in the past. Modern European experience actually vindicates progressive claims that we can do a lot to make America fairer without destroying incentives. And even Europe’s problems make the case for more government intervention, not less.
By all means, let’s talk about whether “Medicare for all,” wealth taxes and other progressive proposals are actually good ideas. But trying to shoot them down by going on about how terrible things are in France is a sure sign that you have no idea what you’re talking about.

Texto completo: James Butler, de 48 años, y Michelle Butler, de 46, una pareja de New Hampshire, viajaban el mes pasado por Texas presuntamente rumbo a Florida. Nunca llegaron a destino: sus cuerpos fueron hallados la semana pasada trágicamente enterrados en una playa del sur de Texas, días después de desaparecer.
El caso se investiga como homicidio, y las autoridades están siguiendo pistas para resolverlo. Un avance significativo se dio a conocer este miércoles, cuando informaron de que un hombre acusado de robarles un carro fue detenido en México y extraído después a Estados Unidos.
A principios de esta semana, la Policía lanzó un aviso público para dar con Adam Curtis Williams , quien fue fotografiado mientras cruzaba la frontera sur por Eagle Pass, Texas, a bordo del vehículo que utilizaron los Butler, según cuenta KIII TV.
Curtis, de 33 años y procedente de Utah, viajaba junto a una mujer identificada como Amanda Noverr, informan varios medios. Su supuesta fuga terminó cuando la policía mexicana lo interceptó en el estado de Jalisco. El momento de la detención hasta el momento no ha sido concretado.
El sospechoso de robar el vehículo utilizado por la pareja asesinada fue extraditado este miércoles a EEUU, según KRIS TV, medio local de Corpus Christi, Texas, localidad cercana a la playa de la Isla del Padre donde la semana pasada se encontraron sin vida los cuerpos de los Butler.
Actualmente el hombre se encuentra bajo custodia en la cárcel del condado de Kleberg, Texas.
La mujer que viajaba con Curtis, por su lado, se quedó en México, supuestamente con un menor, según las autoridades. También el vehículo robado fue tomado en custodia allí.
The New York Times afirma que Jaime Garza, el agente encargado de informar este miércoles sobre los avances de la investigación no especificó si se considera a Curtis sospechoso de matar a la pareja asesinada.
El pasado martes, las autoridades dijeron que podría haber más gente involucrada en el homicidio. Para hallar los cuerpos de los Butler, desaparecidos desde mediados de octubre, los investigadores usaron la localización de un celular que habían utilizado. No hay detalles actualmente disponibles sobre cómo murieron.
Se piensa que la pareja de dirigía a Fort Laudale, Florida. “Nos alegra escuchar que se realizó un arresto y estamos a la espera de lo que sigue”, dijo la hermana de James Butler, Debbie Van Loon, a la televisora WMUR-TV de Manchester, Nuevo Hampshire.

Texto completo: En septiembre, el recién llegado presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, se enfrentaba a una difícil decisión: ceder antes las demandas del Presidente Donald Trump y hacer pública una investigación contra sus enemigos políticos o rechazarlas y perder la tan necesaria ayuda militar .
Solo Donald Trump podía desbloquear la ayuda, según le habían dicho dos senadores estadounidenses, y el tiempo se estaba acabando. Si los casi $400 millones de dólares no se desbloqueaban antes del 30 de septiembre, podría perder la cantidad completa, según publicó este jueves The New York Times.
A través de mensajes de WhatsApp y reuniones en Kiev, la capital ucraniana, los altos cargos del gobierno estuvieron varios días tratando de resolver el dilema. La política exterior ucraniana siempre había tratado de no entrar en los debates partidistas estadounidenses pero la ayuda militar del país norteamericano era, según el Times, vital en la guerra contra las fuerzas separatistas prorrusas . Este conflicto armado se ha cargado unas 13,000 vidas desde que comenzó en 2014.
La balanza para Zelensky se estaba inclinando cada vez más para lo que parecía inevitable y su equipo ya se estaba preparando para anunciar públicamente las investigaciones . Una decisión “fatídica”, de acuerdo al diario neoyorquino, ya que el presidente ucraniano había ganado las elecciones con una plataforma anticorrupción que apostaba por el fin de las investigaciones con motivos políticos.
El círculo cercano al presidente Zelensky se comenzaba a “inclinar hacia lo que le habían pedido”, dijo al Post Petro Burkovskiy, un alto cargo de la Fundación de Iniciativas Democráticas. Según él, estaban dispuestos a hacerlo a pesar del riesgo de perder el apoyo bipartidista en Estados Unidos .
El principal convoy de Trump a Ucrania, Gordon Sondland reconoció el martes en su testimonio en el Congreso que la administración Trump había retenido la ayuda militar para presionar a Zelensky a hacer pública dos investigaciones . Una de ellas apuntaría a la familia Biden y a sus hipotéticas presiones para destitutir al fiscal ucraniano que llevaba la investigación sobre la empresa de gas Burisma, en cuya junta directiva estuvo Hunter Biden. La otra iría destinada a acusaciones no probadas de que había sido Ucrania, y no Rusia, la que había intervenido en las elecciones 2016 a favor de Hillary Clinton.
En la llamada telefónica del 25 de julio, que provocó el inicio de la investigación para juicio político, Zelensky garantizó en privado a Trump que su gobierno examinaría dichos asuntos . Sin embargo, lo que Trump en realidad quería era un anuncio público que mermara la popularidad de su principal rival político Joe Biden.
Fue en septiembre cuando Sondland, a quien Trump designó como embajador de la Unión Europea, dijo que no había muchas posibilidades de que la ayuda llegara si no había anuncio público . Lo que Trump quería era que el presidente ucraniano hablara en CNN, según declaró el principal diplomático estadounidense en Ucrania, William B. Taylor Jr.
Después de eso, el gobierno ucraniano acordó que Zelensky hiciera públicas las investigaciones el 13 de septiembre en una entrevista en la mencionada cadena. Pero los eventos en Washington le salvaron de tener que hacerlo. El bloqueo de la ayuda militar se había filtrado y el Congreso estaba alborotado. Así que Trump ordenó enviar la ayuda y Zelensky rápidamente suspendió la entrevista .
Desde entonces, el gobierno de Trump ha tratado de justificar que la ayuda militar no estaba condicionada de ninguna manera alegando que se había enviado sin declaración alguna del gobierno de Ucrania

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , a Democratic presidential candidate, proposed a bill that would extend school hours from at least 8 a. m. to 6 p. m.
The Family Friendly Schools Act would alter the traditional school day to align with parents’ work hours, according to a news release Harris' office released Wednesday.
“My mother raised my sister and me while working demanding, long hours,” Harris said in a statement. “So I know firsthand that for many working parents, juggling between school schedules and work schedules is a common cause of stress and financial hardship. "
The bill would award grants to schools serving low-income families to provide “academic, athletic or enrichment opportunities” with “community partners. "
It would prohibit schools from closing during staff development days, unless a comparable "enrichment activity" was provided free.
The bill would not mandate teachers, school administrators and staff to work additional hours. Additional hours would be "compensated fairly. "
The proposal was met with a mixed response: Some praised the policy for offering after-school programs "that already exist in schools with affluent PTAs," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg tweeted Wednesday.
Others on Twitter criticized it as a stopgap to a larger problem of workers having to extend their workdays and called for more accommodations for workers with children.

Warren’s health plan would help Trump win

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — With the fact of serious ethical breaches by President Trump all but demonstrated, most elected Republicans do not seem to be struggling with their consciences over impeachment. They wrestle, instead, with a more practical challenge: continuing to support a corrupt man without appearing too corrupt themselves.
This is not the kind of political objective that encourages idealism and attracts young people to public service. Instead, the torch has been passed to a new generation of shills and rationalizers, frightened of their own mercurial leader, intimidated by an angry base and dedicated to maintaining the blessing of presidential fundraising for their campaigns.
The main occupation of the GOP at this point in history is the defense of public corruption, which is a particularly insidious form of corruption. Those who excuse Trump’s abuses of power will not escape his taint.
And yet — at this low point of presidential character and congressional GOP courage — perhaps the most politically talented Democratic challenger to Trump in 2020, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is 6 points behind the president in Michigan, even with Trump in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and 4 points behind Trump in Florida (according to recent surveys by The New York Times Upshot and Siena College).
This should horrify Democrats. One of the most exciting, substantive, compelling voices in their presidential field would stand a good chance of reelecting Donald Trump. And this is not a problem that can be solved through good speeches and clever advertising. The weak points that Trump would exploit are the centerpieces of Warren’s campaign — the very reasons that Democrats are falling for her.
The health care issue symbolizes the problem. In producing her recent funding plan for “Medicare for All,” Warren doubled down on ending private health insurance in America. This ideological boldness is precisely what many Democrats like about her. But now Warren has very little flexibility to make her plan seem less disruptive and frightening in a general election against Trump. “You can’t unring that bell,” says William Galston of the Brookings Institution.
This presents three difficulties. First, Warren is proposing to hugely expand the role and reach of government in our lives, and to spend an additional $20.5 trillion (or more) over 10 years, at a time when trust in government is near an all-time low. Her plan to socialize — there is no other word for it — the health insurance industry fights against a swift current of public skepticism.
Second, Obamacare — which Warren proposes to replace — has stabilized over time. Though it never achieved what its champions promised, it has reduced the number of uninsured Americans and provided some useful lessons for the next rounds of reform. This argues in favor of incremental changes — of the kind former Vice President Joe Biden proposes — rather than the dramatic transformation of a system that would displace insurance arrangements for tens of millions.
Third, Warren’s contention that Medicare for All can be created without middle-class tax increases remains questionable, in spite of her recently released, 26-page funding proposal. In Galston’s view, the Warren approach relies on optimistic cost and revenue estimates that the Urban Institute and others have sharply disputed. It doesn’t account for the likely responses of corporations and wealthy individuals to massive tax increases. It assumes huge cuts in defense spending and the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. And it assumes that rural hospitals can meet their costs based on 110% (or less) of current Medicare payments.
When Biden was asked about Warren’s funding approach, he replied: “She’s making it up.” There is serious evidence to support that charge — and it will be Warren’s burden to answer it during the Nov. 20 debate.
The main question that Warren faces as a candidate is this: Can she eventually transform her public image from being a progressive populist to being a mere populist? Her health care proposal indicates she cannot. Trump’s charge of Socialism — more accurately, SOCIALISM! — may seem hyperbolic. But it is more likely to stick when a candidate proposes to abolish all private health insurance, put a government bureaucracy in charge, and spend an additional $2 trillion a year on her ambitions.
It is always tempting to view the weakness of a political opponent as an opportunity to gain total ideological victory. But in the case of Trump, this would be a blunder. If the 2018 midterms are any indication, the president has shed supporters at the more moderate edges of his coalition. And they will be attracted by stability and incrementalism, not disruption and radicalism — no matter how principled and well explained.

Key witness cites quid pro quo with Ukraine

Texto completo: Washington • A crucial witness in the impeachment inquiry reversed himself this week and acknowledged to investigators that he had told a top Ukrainian official that the country would most likely have to give President Donald Trump what he wanted — a public pledge for investigations — in order to unlock military aid.
The disclosure from Gordon D. Sondland, an ally of Trump who is the United States ambassador to the European Union, confirmed his role in laying out a quid pro quo to Ukraine that conditioned the release of security assistance from the United States on the country’s willingness to say it was investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and other Democrats.
That admission, included in a four-page sworn statement released Tuesday, directly contradicted his testimony to investigators last month, when he said he “never” thought there was any precondition on the aid.
“I said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,” Sondland said in the new statement, which was made public by the House committees leading the inquiry, along with the transcript of his original testimony.
Sondland’s disclosure appeared intended to insulate him from accusations that he intentionally misled Congress during his earlier testimony, in which he frequently said he could not recall key details and events under scrutiny by impeachment investigators.
The question of a quid pro quo is at the heart of the impeachment investigation into Trump, which turns on whether the president abused his power when he asked a foreign power to target his political rivals.
The new information surfaced as the House committees also released a transcript of their interview last month with Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine.
Rushing to complete their final round of requests for key witnesses before they commence public impeachment hearings, the panels also scheduled testimony Friday by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who quickly said he would not comply. And two more administration witnesses who had been scheduled to testify Tuesday — Michael Duffey, a top official in the White House budget office, and Wells Griffith, a senior aide to Energy Secretary Rick Perry — failed to appear.

Texto completo: Steven J. Hayes, quien cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por una masacre familiar en Connecticut, está recibiendo terapia hormonal en prisión como parte de una transición de género.
El recluso discutió su plan de cambio de sexo durante una serie de entrevistas telefónicas recientes con Joe Tomaso para el podcast “15 Minutes With…”, informó The New York Times.
Hayes, de 56 años, se encuentra en la prisión estatal Greene en Waynesburg, Pensilvania, después de ser transferido en 2016 como parte de un acuerdo interestatal.
Cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por los asesinatos de Jennifer Hawke-Petit (48) y sus dos hijas, Michaela (11) y Hayley (17), cometidos el 23 de julio de 2007.
“Hay muchos problemas con (mi) presentación como mujer”, dijo Hayes en el podcast. “Mucha gente lo acepta, pero en esta instalación, hay muchos racistas y fanáticos en el personal y no están contentos con eso. Hay dos de nosotros aquí que somos femeninas”.
Hayes todavía usaba el nombre Steven en el podcast, y no dijo cómo prefería ser llamado.
Afirmó tener un diagnóstico médico de disforia de género, en el que la apariencia externa de una persona no se alinea con su estado mental y emocional, y un problema recurrente de drogas.
“Soy transgénero”, dijo Hayes. “Me diagnosticaron a los 16 años con trastorno de identidad sexual. Mi familia nunca lo reconoció y nunca fui tratado”.
Maria Finn, portavoz del Departamento de Correcciones de Pensilvania , dijo que no podía comentar sobre un preso específico, pero comentó que había 222 personas transgénero en instituciones penales estatales.
Finn dijo que el sistema penitenciario estatal no paga las cirugías de afirmación de género, pero gasta $60 mil dólares al año en total y hasta $600 por interno en medicamentos para tratar a quienes tienen disforia de género. Los costos anuales de atención médica promedian $5,582 por recluso, según la vocera.
Además de la terapia hormonal, Hayes habló en el podcast de tratar de obtener “otras cosas” como parte del proceso de transición de género, pero no dio más detalles.
Originalmente Hayes recibió la pena de muerte por la invasión del hogar de Hawke-Petit, junto con un cómplice, Joshua Komisarjevsky, cuya apelación de condena será juzgada por la Corte Suprema de Connecticut.
Ambos fueron condenados a cadena perpetua después de que Connecticut abolió la pena de muerte en 2012, enojando a los partidarios de la pena capital y a los defensores de las víctimas, quienes dijeron que la derogación tenía la intención de ser prospectiva y no aplicable a los reclusos que ya estaban en el corredor de la muerte.
En el ínterin, Hayes se convirtió en judío ortodoxo en la cárcel.
Durante el podcast, expresó su remordimiento por los asesinatos y criticó la apelación de Komisarjevsky.
“No hay defensa para lo que hicimos”, dijo. “No quiero formar parte de este juicio. La familia ya no merece pasar por esto”.
Hayes y Komisarjevsky rastrearon a Hawke-Petit y sus dos hijas desde un supermercado cercano hasta su casa en Cheshire (Connecticut), donde las víctimas fueron retenidas como rehenes, agredidas sexualmente y rociadas con gasolina antes de que su casa fuera incendiada.
Antes de matarlas, Hayes obligó Hawke-Petit a ir a un banco local, donde retiró $15 mil dólares, mientras Komisarjevsky esperaba en la casa de la familia con las dos hijas, de 11 y 17 años.
El único sobreviviente del ataque, el Dr. William Petit Jr., un endocrinólogo que era el esposo y el padre de las víctimas, fue brutalmente golpeado con un bate de béisbol durante la invasión. En 2016 fue elegido miembro de la Cámara de Representantes del estado, por el Partido Republicano.
Hayes habló de haber tenido una recaída de drogas y estar en dificultades financieras en el momento de la invasión de la casa. “No era un monstruo”, afirmó sobre el triple homicidio.

Texto completo: Mary Anne Fidati Eggleston, 76, of Waverly, enjoyed great success in her life as a gifted entrepreneur, generous philanthropist and was a respected businesswoman in Northeast Pennsylvania for decades.
She worked tirelessly as a director/vice president at Pagnotti Enterprises and its subsidiary companies where she played an integral role in re-energizing and revitalizing the businesses that her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., founded in 1934. In addition, her entrepreneurial footprint lives on today in the water filtration industry at both Carbon Sales Inc. and the Unifilt Corp., where she was both a founder and corporate officer.
Born in Scranton on July 29, 1943, she was the daughter of the late F. Robert and Marie Pagnotti Fidati.
Mary Anne graduated from Marywood Seminary and attended Wheeling College, Wheeling, W.Va.
Mary Anne passed away Oct. 5 at Allied Skilled Nursing following a courageous battle with cancer.
Mary Anne was involved in a number of local organizations, sat on numerous boards and participated in philanthropic efforts throughout her life. A true pioneer, she was one of the first women to be admitted to the Westmoreland Club, Wilkes-Barre, and was a founding board member at the Luzerne Foundation. Mary Anne was a board member at King’s College, where she was instrumental in the formation of the King’s College Family Business Forum and also sat on the board at Friendship House. She was an original Everhart Museum board member when the community board was formed, played a significant part in the restoration of the mineral exhibit at the museum and was recognized as the honoree in 2015 at the Everhart Museum Summer Solstice event.
Mary Anne is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Bubba and Tracy Eggleston, and her two grandchildren, Elle and Brett, around whom her world revolved. She is also survived by her sister, Judy Fidati Haudenschield, and Jeff Haudenschield and their two sons, David and Christopher. Judy truly considered Mary Anne to be both a sister and mother to her, as David and Christopher fondly thought of her more as their grandmother than as their aunt. They were her closest relatives living locally and were a primary reason she fought so hard to survive.
Even during her time at Allied, she still always looked forward to being a part of as many milestones as possible in the lives of her family and her businesses. She cherished her friends from near and far, and always loved sharing stories about the fun times she had enjoyed throughout her life with her cousins.
Strongly influenced by her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., and his larger than life personality, she was a dynamic woman who was determined in business, yet even incredibly more caring and sensitive in her family life. She had a realistic way of looking at the world and her intuitive ability to quickly judge people’s characters was truly amazing and always spot-on. Some of her greatest pleasures were her time with family, gourmet cooking, reading the Sunday edition of The New York Times and watching college and professional football. She was an avid Penn State fan.
We appreciate the superior efforts of the staff at Allied Services and of her caregivers, Kathy, Keith and Melissa, who offered personal attention, compassion and love to Mary Anne over the last few years.
In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary Anne’s honor to Project Koru at https://secure.givelively
.org/donate/project-koru/mary-anne-eggleston
-memorial, the Everhart Museum, The Fund for Luzerne County at The Luzerne Foundation, or a charity of your choice.
Please join us in a celebration of Mary Anne’s life to be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Glenmaura National Golf Club, 100 Glenmaura National Blvd., Moosic.
Arrangements have been entrusted to Lawrence E. Young Funeral Home and Cremation Services Inc.

Don't believe what you read; If you heed pollsters and pundits (except this one), your head won't stop spinning.

Texto completo: If we've learned anything from the presidential election of 2016, it is that polls are unreliable and pundits are imperfect prognosticators.
When it comes to presidential elections, to borrow a quote from the great screenwriter William Goldman, " Nobody knows anything."
Nothing definitive anyway.

"Donald Trump is not going to win Michigan," was the 100% certain headline on a Nov. 7, 2016, New York magazine column by Jonathan Chait. "And," Chait added on Twitter, "I am frankly offended that people even think that this is a possibility."
A day later, Trump won a stunning upset in Michigan. Yes, he took the state by the narrowest margin of victory it had ever seen in a presidential election. But he won.
"Relax, Donald Trump can't win," was the patronizing headline on a June 2016 essay by Jon Wiener in the Nation. "Even before you get to his campaign's incompetence and lackluster fundraising, the numbers just aren't on his side."
Overconfident Democrats relaxed a little too much.
By the time they understood their Blue Wall was as flimsy as Trump's promise to bring back the American coal industry, it was too late.
Maybe some numbers weren't on Trump's side -- the popular vote, for example.
But the only numbers that mattered -- the electoral college numbers -- were most definitely on his side.
So here we are, almost three years into his disastrous, 20-lies-a-day administration, with a much-deserved impeachment looming alongside the 2020 presidential campaign.
Trump is a deeply unpopular incumbent who nevertheless manages to inspire fanatical support in his extremely loyal base, and we don't yet know who will face him next year. The Democratic primary may be well underway, but the presidential race has yet to really begin.
And yet, some folks in the opining business can tell you with great certainty why, for instance, the 2020 race is the Democrats' to lose (Bill Maher). Others will aver that Trump has it all but sewn up already, or will win in a landslide (Moody's).
They will tell you that Trump-weary swing voters are looking for moderate Democrats like Joe Biden who can play nice with Republicans and bring a steady hand back to American foreign policy.
They may tell you why nominating Elizabeth Warren would portend disaster for the Democrats. Or why nominating her is the only way to flush Trump from the White House and back to the swamp where he belongs. (Well, Florida, anyway.)
They will tell you the electorate wants progressive Democrats with game-changing ideas like "Medicare for all." They will tell you that Medicare for all is too radical for Americans.
Warren's fatal flaw, they say, is that she has not said how she will pay for Medicare for all. And then, when she finally put out her plan, they say it's not realistic.
They will tell you that Hillary Clinton lost because she was too cozy with Wall Street. They will tell you that Warren can't win because Wall Street hates her.
They will tell you that, in general, the American people are happy with their health insurance, whereas in reality, most people say they are happy with their healthcare, not with their insurance companies. Bernie Sanders is going hoarse pointing out this discrepancy.
It's axiomatic that the only polls that really matter are the polls conducted in swing states. That's because most states are firmly blue or red.
But, as we have seen in the recent past, states swing.
Barack Obama won Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida in 2012. Four years later, all those states went for Trump.
On Monday, the New York Times published a swing state poll that found Trump's chances in 2020 to be very strong. In hypothetical matchups against Trump, former Vice President Biden fared the best, followed by Sen. Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Warren of Massachusetts.
The poll also raised what the New York Times described as the "fraught questions of 'likability'" that could plague Warren, the only woman among the top contenders.
The story quoted a 26-year-old Florida woman who said she voted for Trump in 2016 but won't vote for him in 2020. She won't vote for Warren though, because female presidential candidates are, in her words, "super unlikable." She added: "There's just something about her [Warren] that I just don't like."
I've called out this rank, if internalized, sexist formulation in previous columns. "There's just something about her I don't like" represents the double standard that plagues all female candidates. And, frankly, that makes me despair for my daughters.
But the election is an entire year, and an entire impeachment inquiry, away.
A Democratic nominee will emerge at some point next year -- hopefully sooner rather than later -- and the real contest will be on. Today's hypothetical matchups will be meaningless by then. Voters looking for reassurance in punditry and polls should remain skeptical of the barrage of conflicting information.
Anything could happen. I mean, come on, it already has.

No evidence found for Trump claim of 'whimpering'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - It was a vivid scene worthy of the ending of a Hollywood thriller, the image of a ruthless terrorist mastermind finally brought to justice "whimpering and crying and screaming all the way" to his death. But it may be no more true than a movie script.
In the days since President Donald Trump gave the world a graphic account of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's last minutes, no evidence has emerged to confirm it. The secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the regional commander who oversaw the operation that killed the leader of the Islamic State all say they have no idea what the president was talking about.
Four other Defense Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share details of the raid, said they had seen no after-action reports, situation reports or other communications that support Trump's claim. Nor did they have any indication that Trump spoke with any of the Delta Force commandos or ground commanders in the hours between the Saturday night raid and his Sunday morning televised announcement.
One American official who is deeply familiar with the operation dismissed the president's version of events as mere grandstanding. Another senior official briefed extensively on the mission said, "I don't know how he would know that. It sounds like something he made up." The surveillance drone video Trump watched in the Situation Room had no audio.
The White House has provided neither corroboration nor explanation of the president's account. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, dismissed . "trying to pick apart the details of the death" of the leader of the Islamic State. "Is it not possible to just celebrate that a terrorist, murderer and rapist has been killed?" she asked in an email.

Barrington subdivision ‘nicest place’ in Illinois

Texto completo: Barrington’s Fox Point subdivision is the nicest place in Illinois, according to a national publication that, as an example of the community’s generosity, cites a time when residents rushed to help neighbors whose belongings were placed on the front lawn during an eviction.
That and other instances of neighborly kindness helped land Fox Point on Reader’s Digest’s third annual 50 Nicest Places in America list. Columbiana, Ohio, wound up as the overall champion on the list, as decided by a nine-judge panel that included Reader’s Digest Editor in Chief Bruce Kelley and David Brooks, a New York Times columnist and the Aspen Institute’s executive director.
Built in the late 1960s, the 411-home Fox Point spans Cook and Lake counties and features a private lake, a pool, tennis courts and social activities.
Bob Lee, a 40-year Fox Point resident, said the amenities bring residents together and allow them to get to know each other.
"You still are a neighborhood," Lee said.
"You still see your neighbors."
Barrington village Trustee Mike Moran, who serves as the Fox Point Homeowners Association’s board president, said residents tend to be engaged there. Scores can be found walking in the mornings or on weekends on a road that loops around the lake, which lends itself to socialization.
"It’s a very family-run community," Moran said. "It’s nothing to have second and third generation move back into the neighborhood with their own kids after growing up in that neighborhood. It’s all about the family."
How Fox Point’s neighbors care for each other in times of need caught Reader’s Digest’s attention. One instance occurred in January 2018, when a couple in their 90s and their daughter were evicted from their house.
Fox Point resident Jack Keenan helped get the ball rolling after learning from his wife that furniture and other possessions filled much of the family’s front lawn on the 200 block of Surrey Lane when the eviction process began. At least 60 residents responded on a weekday to Keenan’s post on a neighborhood blog and filled a semitrailer with the items so the family could beat a deadline to be off the property or have whatever remained placed in a trash bin.
Reader’s Digest also noted how Fox Point residents displayed an outpouring of inclusiveness and support for a gay couple who in December 2018 reported to Barrington police that their rainbow pride flag was removed from a pole and replaced with a U.S. flag.
Neighbors brought meals to Casey Handel, Zadette Rosado and their two daughters. Many in Fox Point also placed miniature rainbow flags on their mailboxes.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker discussed the Fox Point response in his January inauguration address.
Reader’s Digest’s third annual, crowdsourced "nicest places" list is described as the publication’s response to an era of cultural and political divides. About 1,000 submissions were received about places across the country where people are kind and civility is winning.

Texto completo: DENVER - A man who repeatedly espoused anti-Semitic views has been arrested in a plot to bomb a historic Colorado synagogue, federal officials said Monday.
The co-conspirators in the plot turned out to be undercover agents, who arrested the man shortly before he planned to bomb the synagogue early Saturday, according to court documents.
Richard Holzer was arrested Friday in Pueblo just after the agents brought him what he believed were two pipe bombs along with 14 sticks of dynamite to blow up Temple Emanuel. The explosives were incapable of causing damage, authorities said.
Holzer, 27, described what he thought were explosives as "absolutely gorgeous" and said they should go ahead with the attack overnight to avoid police, the court document said.
Holzer, who lives in Pueblo, briefly appeared in court Monday in handcuffs. He told U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen Mix that he understood the charge against him, and she scheduled his next court date for Thursday. She granted his request for a public defender.
The foiled plot is the latest attempted attack against a synagogue in the U.S. in just over a year.
In October 2018, a shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh killed 11 people and became the deadliest attack on Jews in modern U.S. history.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, Holzer's arrest is the 13th time someone has been arrested on accusations of plotting attacks or making threats against the Jewish community since then.
Border Patrol agent shoots, kills gunman who opened fire
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. - A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed a gunman who opened fire about a mile from the border with Mexico, immigration officials said.
The agent approached a group of four people early Monday, and one of them pulled out a gun and started shooting, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The agent fired back, hitting the man, who died at a hospital. No agents were hurt during the shooting in Sunland Park, a suburb of El Paso, Texas.
No additional information was released, including the names of the agent and gunman. The CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating the shooting.
New Mexico State police and FBI also are investigating, Albuquerque FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said.
DOJ sends letter to publisher of book by anonymous writer
NEW YORK - The Justice Department has sent a letter to the publisher and literary agency of the anonymous government official whose book is scheduled to come out Nov. 19. The letter raises questions over whether any confidentiality agreement has been violated and asked for information that could help reveal the author's identity.
The publisher, Hachette Book Group, responded by saying it would provide no additional information beyond calling the author a "current or former senior official."
The book, "A Warning," is by the official who wrote an essay published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of President Donald Trump.
Advice columnist sues Trump
for calling sex assault claim a lie
NEW YORK - An advice columnist for Elle magazine who has accused President Donald Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s sued him Monday, saying he defamed her by calling her a liar whom he had never even met.
E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit, filed Monday in New York, says Trump "smeared her integrity, honesty and dignity - all in the national press" when he responded to her allegations, first broached in a New York magazine article this past June.
A message requesting comment was sent to a law firm that has represented Trump in other cases.
Carroll is among over a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or sexual assault, or both, predating his presidency.
Texan in school shooting said to be unfit for trial
HOUSTON - The trial for a teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a Texas high school will be delayed while he receives mental health treatment, his attorney said Monday.
The news comes after three experts - one for the defense, one appointed by the court and one picked by prosecutors - found Dimitrios Pagourtzis incompetent to stand trial, said Nick Poehl, one of Pagourtzis' attorneys.
Kevin Petroff, the first assistant district attorney for Galveston County, said his office was working to meet with all families of the victims before making any statement.
Pagourtzis, 19, is charged with capital murder in the May 18, 2018, attack at Santa Fe High School, which is 50 miles southeast of Houston. His trial was set to start Feb. 18. Because he was 17 at the time of the attack, he is not eligible for the death penalty.
'King Perry' pleads guilty
in $115 million Ponzi scheme
SCRANTON, Pa. - The fraudster called himself "King Perry," and for a while he lived like royalty.
Perry Santillo masterminded an investment scam that collected more than $115 million from 1,000 investors around the country, using some of the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle of cars, casino junkets and houses in multiple states, according to federal securities regulators.
The Ponzi scheme collapsed, and Santillo, of Rochester, New York, is likely to trade his fancy duds for prison attire when he is sentenced on criminal conspiracy and fraud charges.
He appeared Monday in federal court to plead guilty to a federal fraud charge, having already entered a guilty plea last month to similar charges in Rochester. Each charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.
In Oklahoma: A jury Monday found an Oklahoma City police officer guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a suicidal man who was threatening to set himself on fire.
The jury deliberated 5 1/2 hours before finding Sgt. Keith Sweeney guilty in the Nov. 15, 2017, death of Dustin Pigeon, 29, and recommending a 10-year prison sentence. Second-degree murder is punishable by 10 years to life in prison.
Sweeney was among officers who found Pigeon doused in lighter fluid and threatening to set himself on fire in a courtyard. Prosecutors say Sweeney shot Pigeon after another officer fired a bean bag. An affidavit says Pigeon was unarmed and did not pose a threat when he was shot.
Caption: Thousands of Spaniards protest Monday in Madrid after five men accused of raping an unconscious 14-year-old girl in 2016 were sentenced to 10 to 12 years behind bars last week for sexual abuse instead of assault or rape. Protests were held in over 40 cities.

Attack of the Wall Street Snowflakes

Texto completo: Why can't financial tycoons handle criticism?
Given all the recent focus on health policy, you might think that the medical-industrial complex would be heavily involved in the Democratic primary race, going all-out to block Elizabeth Warren. And a coalition of drug companies, insurers and hospitals is indeed running ads attacking "Medicare for all."
But the health industry's political role has been relatively muted so far. Partly this may reflect realism: Even if Warren becomes president, the chances of getting Medicare for all through Congress are small. It may also reflect the surprising openness of doctors to reform. While the American Medical Association still officially opposes single-payer, at a recent meeting, 47 percent of the delegates voted to drop that opposition.
No, the really intense backlash against Warren and progressive Democrats in general is coming from Wall Street. And while that opposition partly reflects self-interest, Wall Street's Warren hatred has a level of virulence, sometimes crossing into hysteria, that goes beyond normal political calculation.
What's behind that virulence?
First, let's talk about the rational reasons Wall Street is worried about Warren. She is, of course, calling for major tax increases on the very wealthy, those with wealth exceeding $ 50 million, and the financial industry is strongly represented in that elite club. And since raising taxes on the wealthy is highly popular, it's an idea a progressive president might actually be able to turn into real policy.
Warren is also a big believer in stricter financial regulation; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was highly effective until the Trump administration set about gutting it, was her brainchild.
So if you are a Wall Street billionaire, rational self-interest might well induce you to oppose Warren. Rationality does not, however, explain why a money manager like Leon Cooperman -- who just two years ago settled a suit over insider trading for $ 5 million, although without admitting wrongdoing -- would circulate an embarrassing, self-pitying open letter denouncing Warren for her failure to appreciate all the wonderful things billionaires like him do for society.
Nor does it explain why Cliff Asness, another money manager, would fly into a rage at Warren adviser Gabriel Zucman for using the term "revenue maximizing" -- a standard piece of economic jargon -- describing it as "disgustingly immoral."
The real tell here, I think, is that much of the Wall Street vitriol now being directed at Warren was previously directed at, of all people, President Barack Obama.
Objectively, Obama treated Wall Street with kid gloves. In the aftermath of a devastating financial crisis, his administration bailed out collapsing institutions on favorable terms. He and Democrats in Congress did impose some new regulations, but they were very mild compared with the regulations put in place after the banking crisis of the 1930s.
He did, however, refer on a few occasions to "fat cat" bankers and suggested that financial-industry excesses were responsible for the 2008 crisis because, well, they were. And the result, quite early in his administration, was that Wall Street became consumed with "Obama rage," and the financial industry went all in for Mitt Romney in 2012.
I wonder, by the way, if this history helps explain an odd aspect of fund-raising in the current primary campaign. It's not surprising that Warren is getting very little money from the financial sector. It is, however, surprising that the top recipient isn't Joe Biden but Pete Buttigieg, who's running a fairly distant fourth in the polls. Is Biden suffering from the lingering effects of that old-time Obama rage?
In any case, the point is that Wall Street billionaires, even more than billionaires in general, seem to be snowflakes, emotionally unable to handle criticism.
I'm not sure why that should be the case, but it may be that in their hearts they suspect that the critics have a point.
What, after all, does modern finance actually do for the economy? Unlike the robber barons of yore, today's Wall Street tycoons don't build anything tangible. They don't even direct money to the people who actually are building the industries of the future. The vast expansion of credit in America after around 1980 basically involved a surge in consumer debt rather than new money for business investment.
Moreover, there is growing evidence that when the financial sector gets too big it actually acts as a drag on the economy -- and America is well past that point.
Now, human nature being what it is, people who secretly wonder whether they really deserve their wealth get especially angry when others express these doubts publicly. So it's not surprising that people who couldn't handle Obama's mild, polite criticism are completely losing it over Warren.
What this means is that you should beware of Wall Street claims that progressive policies would have dire effects. Such claims don't reflect deep economic wisdom; to a large extent they're coming from people with vast wealth but fragile egos, whose rants should be discounted appropriately.

A health-care plan to get Trump reelected

Texto completo: With the fact of serious ethical breaches by President Trump all but demonstrated, most elected Republicans do not seem to be struggling with their consciences over impeachment. They wrestle, instead, with a more practical challenge: continuing to support a corrupt man without appearing too corrupt themselves.
This is not the kind of political objective that encourages idealism and attracts young people to public service. Instead, the torch has been passed to a new generation of shills and rationalizers, frightened of their own mercurial leader, intimidated by an angry base and dedicated to maintaining the blessing of presidential fundraising for their campaigns.
The main occupation of the GOP at this point in history is the defense of public corruption, which is a particularly insidious form of corruption. Those who excuse Trump's abuses of power will not escape his taint.
And yet - at this low point of presidential character and congressional GOP courage - perhaps the most politically talented Democratic challenger to Trump in 2020, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), is six points behind the president in Michigan, even with Trump in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and four points behind Trump in Florida (according to recent surveys by the New York Times Upshot and Siena College).
This should horrify Democrats. One of the most exciting, substantive, compelling voices in their presidential field would stand a good chance of reelecting President Trump. And this is not a problem that can be solved through good speeches and clever advertising. The weak points that Trump would exploit are the centerpieces of Warren's campaign - the very reasons that Democrats are falling for her.
The health-care issue symbolizes the problem. In producing her recent funding plan for Medicare-for-all, Warren doubled down on ending private health insurance in the United States. This ideological boldness is precisely what many Democrats like about her. But now Warren has very little flexibility to make her plan seem less disruptive and frightening in a general election against Trump. "You can't unring that bell," says William A. Galston of the Brookings Institution.
This presents three difficulties. First, Warren is proposing to hugely expand the role and reach of government in our lives, and to spend an additional $20.5 trillion (or more) over 10 years, at a time when trust in government is near an all-time low. Her plan to socialize - there is no other word for it - the health insurance industry fights against a swift current of public skepticism.
Second, Obamacare, which Warren proposes to replace, has stabilized over time. Though it never achieved what its champions promised, it has reduced the number of uninsured Americans and provided some useful lessons for the next rounds of reform. This argues in favor of incremental changes - of the kind former vice president Joe Biden proposes - rather than the dramatic transformation of a system that would displace insurance arrangements for tens of millions.
Third, Warren's contention that Medicare-for-all can be created without middle-class tax increases remains questionable, in spite of her recently released, 26-page funding proposal. In Galston's view, the Warren approach relies on optimistic cost and revenue estimates that the Urban Institute and others have sharply disputed. It doesn't account for the likely responses of corporations and wealthy individuals to massive tax increases. It assumes huge cuts in defense spending and the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. And it assumes that rural hospitals can meet their costs based on 110 percent (or less) of current Medicare payments.
When Biden was asked about Warren's funding approach, he replied: "She's making it up." There is serious evidence to support that charge - and it will be Warren's burden to answer it during the Nov. 20 debate.
The main question that Warren faces as a candidate is this: Can she eventually transform her public image from being a progressive populist to being a mere populist? Her health-care proposal indicates she cannot. Trump's charge of socialism - more accurately, SOCIALISM! - may seem hyperbolic. But it is more likely to stick when a candidate proposes to abolish all private health insurance, put a government bureaucracy in charge and spend an additional $2 trillion a year on her ambitions.
It is always tempting to view the weakness of a political opponent as an opportunity to gain total ideological victory. But in the case of Trump, this would be a blunder. If the 2018 midterms are any indication, the president has shed supporters at the more moderate edges of his coalition. And they will be attracted by stability and incrementalism, not disruption and radicalism - no matter how principled and well explained.

Texto completo: The Justice Department notified the publisher of the upcoming anonymous tell-all book about President Trump that the author could be breaching non-disclosure agreements.
In September 2018, an anonymous individual claiming to be a member of the Trump administration penned a New York Times op-ed discussing the resistance inside the president’s network.
That same anonymous author now has plans to write a book titled A Warning to provide more information about personal conversations from the White House.
In response to the book announcement, the Department of Justice warned the publisher notifying the author that he or she may be breaching “one or more nondisclosure agreements” signed prior to working in the White House.
The letter, which was sent to the literacy agency Javelin and Hachette Book Group and obtained by CNN Business, cast doubt that the book was authored by a “senior official” and warned the author against publishing.
"If the author is, in fact, a current or former 'senior official' in the Trump Administration, publication of the book may violate that official's legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements, including nondisclosure agreements that are routinely required with respect to information obtained in the course of one's official responsibilities or as a condition for access to classified information," wrote Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt.
Hunt added that any information that could violate those agreements must be submitted for “pre-publication review.” He requested copies of the author’s non-disclosure agreements, dates of employment, or proof that the author had not signed non-disclosure agreements — any of which would likely provide enough information to identify the author.
Javelin issued a response, claiming that the book will move ahead without delay, no matter the department’s objection.
"Our author knows that the president is determined to unmask whistleblowers who may be in his midst. That's one of the reasons A Warning was written," they wrote in the statement. "But we support the publisher in its resolve that the administration's effort to intimidate and expose the senior official who has seen misconduct at the highest levels will not prevent this book from moving forward."
Hachette Book Group also declined to provide the department with any information, writing, “Hachette is not party to any nondisclosure agreements with the U.S. government that would require any pre-publication review of this book.”
The book is slated to hit stores on Nov. 19.

Texto completo: La semana pasada se hizo oficial: las investigaciones para un posible juicio político al presidente Donald Trump fueron formalizadas por los demócratas, liderador por Nancy Pelosi , en la Casa de Representantes. Los republicanos votaron en contra, aunque no tienen una ruta clara de cómo defender al mandatario.
El presidente Trump califica el proceso de una “cacería de brujas”, tal como lo hizo con las investigaciones sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016 y ha endurecido su postura contra Pelosi, al pedirle que se dedique a atender asuntos relacionados con su Distrito electoral, en San Francisco, California, en lugar de andarlo investigando.
“Creo que Nancy Pelosi se ha vuelto loca y creo, francamente, que debería regresar a su hogar en San Francisco” , expresó el mandatario en conferencia afuera de la Casa Blanca el domingo.
A pesar de sus críticas, el proceso avanza en el Comité de Inteligencia, liderado por Adam Schiff . A continuación el contexto general para entender en qué momento se encuentra esta batalla política y legislativa.
1. La llamada.- El 25 de julio, el presidente Trump tuvo una llamada telefónica con su homólogo de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky , a quien felicitó por su reciente elección, pero hizo una petición, “un favor”: reabrir una supuesta investigación contra Hunter Biden , hijo del exvicepresidente Joe Biden , por su relación con una empresa gasera de aquel país, además de determinar si el fiscal encargado de ese caso fue despedido ante la presión del exvicepresidente. La llamada fue escuchada por un selecto grupo del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.
2. Petición y ofrecimiento.- Tras informarse que el presidente Trump pudo haber incurrido en alguna falta al pedir a un gobierno extranjero investigar a un ciudadano estadounidense, especialmente a un rival político camino a las elecciones 2020, el republicano negó haberlo hecho. Para demostrarlo pidió que se diera a conocer la transcripción de aquella conversación. Sin embargo, a pesar de que la reproducción publicada el 25 de septiembre por la Casa Blanca no era fiel , en ella se establece una petición de indagar al exvicepresidente Biden y a su hijo, además de que el presidente Trump ofrece colaboración a través de su abogado personal, Rudy Giuliani , y el fiscal general, William Barr .
3. Un informante.- Esta nueva batalla ante el Congreso comenzó cuando un informante anónimo alertó sobre los dichos del presidente Trump en aquella llamada. La identidad de esa persona sigue protegida y se descarta dar a conocer su nombre, pero The New York Times afirmó que se trata de un agente de la CIA que fue brevemente enviado a la Casa Blanca. El presidente Trump exige que diga de quién se trata. Mark Zaid , uno de los abogados del informante, pidió a los Comités de Inteligencia de la Cámara y del Senado proteger a su cliente .
4. Dos testigos clave.- De los testigos que han rendido testimonio a puerta cerrada ante los investigadores de la Cámara destacan dos: el embajador en funciones de Estados Unidos ante Ucrania, Bill Taylor , quien afirmó haber alertado sobre mensajes, donde en forma explícita se indica que los fondos para Ucrania estaban siendo retenidos por la Administración Trump hasta que el Kiev accediera a abrir una investigación que pudiera perjudicar a Biden y al Partido Demócrata. El otros es el teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , el principal experto en Ucrania del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, quien dijo ante la Cámara que en la transcripción de la Casa Blanca de la llamada se omitieron palabras o frases cruciales, como el nombre de la compañía de energía que empleó Hunter Biden en su junta directiva, la cual es Burisma Holdings. El presidente Trump amagó dar a conocer información sobre Vindman, luego de ese testimonio.
5. Los siguientes pasos.- La aprobación en la Cámara de las investigaciones ayudaría a la Casa Blanca a colaborar, aunque expertos adelantan que no será fácil. El demócrata Schiff indicó que ahora el procedimiento permitirá audiencia abiertas, un abogado interrogará a los citados hasta por 45 minutos, los miembros del Comité podrán hacer preguntas posteriores y también se harán públicas las transcripciones de las declaraciones. Los primeros cambios se verán esta semana, cuando se den a conocer las transcripciones de las audiencias en privado. La intención de los demócratas es votar por un juicio político a mediados o finales de diciembre.

SAY NO TO SOCIALISM CAPITALISM CAN BE GEARED TO HELP OUR KIDS

Texto completo: You may be happy with the state of the U.S. economy, but many young people aren't. And as a result, a lot of them are embracing political extremism.
A recent poll by YouGov finds that half of all millennials - and even more of the generation that follows them - distrust capitalism. Seventy percent of millennials say they'd be willing to vote for a socialist.
It's taken us almost 250 years to build this country, and we could wreck it in a single generation. At this rate, we will. In order to prevent the looming disaster, we need to be clear on what has gone wrong.
The reason capitalism is increasingly discredited and socialism increasingly popular is that for too many young people, our current system isn't working.
"Go to college," we tell them. "You'll be successful if you do." But too often, that advice is outdated, if not an utter lie. Many of our kids wind up impoverished by the experience, their dreams thwarted forever.
The reason is debt. Forty-five million Americans now labor under student loans. The average debt burden is $37,000. For professional degrees, it's far more. Overall, 2 million Americans owe more than $100,000 each in student loans. Imagine starting your first job with that hanging over you.
Keep in mind, college debt isn't like ordinary debt. Thanks to a well-funded lobbying campaign, student loans can't be erased by bankruptcy. They last forever. Many of today's college freshmen can expect to spend their working lives paying interest on loans that, in the end, didn't help them at all.
No wonder young people aren't getting married, buying homes or having children. They can't afford to. No wonder so many support Bernie Sanders. If this is capitalism, they don't want any part of it.
The irony, of course, is that the only people benefiting from this system are on the far left: college presidents with multimillion-dollar salaries, highly paid university administrators and tenured professors of non-binary feminist poetry and other perverse and pointless academic "disciplines."
As a group, these are, without question, some of the least impressive people in our country. Yet they're the only ones coming out ahead in the deal. They're feasting on our children's debt and on the generous subsidies taxpayers provide for higher education in America. An entire generation of Americans is enslaved to interest payments so that some left-wing academics can have lifetime employment making our country worse. That's the arrangement. And for the rest of us, socialism. That's what we're going to get out of it.
There's got to be a better way. Some on the left have proposed forgiving student debt entirely, which is to say sticking American taxpayers with the bill. If there's one thing that could make this terrible situation worse, it's that.
Taxpayers didn't cause this problem. They shouldn't be punished any more than they already have been. The corrupt higher education establishment concocted this scam. They spend tons of money lobbying in Washington to keep it going. They should now pay to fix it. Harvard's endowment is $40 billion. Yale's is $30 billion. Let's start there.
These massive endowment funds are built tax-free, meaning they're subsidized by average American taxpayers. To make matters worse, the universities often aren't even using these endowments to help their students. They keep building larger and larger endowments, essentially for bragging rights. Most tax-free foundations are required to pay out 5% of their total funds each year for charitable activities. That's how they justify the tax-free treatment.
And who's exempt from this? Universities. They just grow the money with no requirement that they ever help a single student.
How can anyone justify this? How does this make sense? Congress could easily pass a law to make universities pay down 5% of their endowments per year like every other nonprofit foundation is required to. Who would be against that? Only the higher education lobbyists who spend millions every year protecting this insane system.
We need to move the crushing financial burden of student debt off the shoulders of middle-class families and 22-year-olds and back onto the people who've gotten rich from it. That's an idea every sensible person can support. And there's a political payoff for any politician wise enough to adopt it.

Did Warren pass the Medicare test?

Texto completo: Last week I worried that Elizabeth Warren had painted herself into a corner by endorsing the Sanders "Medicare for All" plan. It was becoming obvious that she couldn't stay vague about the details, especially how to pay for it; and some studies, even by center-left think tanks, suggested that any plan along these lines would require large tax hikes on the middle class. So what would she come up with?
Well, the Warren plan is now out. And I'd say that she passed the test. Experts will argue for months whether she's being too optimistic - whether her cost estimates are too low and her revenue estimates too high, whether we can really do this without middle-class tax hikes. You might say that time will tell, but it probably won't: Even if Warren becomes president, and Dems take the Senate too, it's very unlikely that Medicare for All will happen any time soon.
Nonetheless, Warren needed to show that she was working the problem. And she did. She brought in real experts like Donald Berwick, who ran Medicare during the Obama years, and Betsey Stevenson, former chief economist at the Labor Department. And they have produced a serious plan.
How does the Warren plan expand Medicare to cover everyone without raising taxes on the middle class? There are four main components.
First, the Warren team argues that a single-payer system would provide significant savings in overall medical costs - more than other studies are assuming. Some of these would come from bargaining down prices, especially on drugs. Others would come from a reduction in administrative costs.
Are these savings plausible? Well, America does pay incredibly high prices for drugs compared with other countries, and the complexity of our system imposes a huge administrative burden - not just the overhead of insurance companies, but the sheer number of people doctors and hospitals have to employ to deal with multiple insurers.
And we should note that even with these assumed cost savings, U.S. health spending per capita would remain far above that of other advanced countries. So there's a casefor optimism here.
Second - and the cleverest item in the plan - the Warren team would basically require employers who are now offering health insurance to their employees to pay the cost of that insurance to the government instead. Bear in mind that large employers are already required by law (specifically, the Affordable Care Act) to provide insurance. So this would just redirect those funds.
Third, state and local governments currently spend a lot on health care, mainly but not only through their share of Medicaid spending. The Warren plan would require "maintenance of effort," basically requiring that states continue to spend that money, but on supporting a national plan.
Finally, even with all this there's a significant budget hole. Warren's team argues that this can be closed in two ways: some further taxes on corporations and large fortunes, andstrengthening the IRS, which we know fails to collect large amounts of legally owed taxes, principally from people with high incomes, because Republicans have starved the agency of resources.
Am I enthusiastically endorsing this plan? No. I still think that a public-option-type plan, which lets people buy into Medicare, would have a better chance of actually becoming reality - and may well be where a President Warren actually ends up if she gets to the White House. And the plan's optimism on costs and revenues could be wrong.
But this is a serious plan that reflects hard thinking. In particular, it's nothing like the snake oil that passes for policy analysis on the right, whether it's the continual insistence that tax cuts pay for themselves or Paul Ryan budgets that assumed that discretionary spending could be cut to Calvin Coolidge levels.
So what has Warren achieved here? Realistically, her health care plan is more aspirational than her other plans. Enhanced financial regulation and universal child care are things she might well be able to accomplish if she not only wins, but wins big, next year. Medicare for All, not so much. And may I say, it would serve the public well if these topics - plus climate change! - got more attention in future debates, and health care a bit less.
Warren's task was, instead, to counter criticism that she was being evasive on a big issue. I think she has met that challenge.

Noxious Undertow in President's Feed: Conspiracy-Mongers, Racists and Spies

Texto completo: In September, an obscure Twitter account promoting a fringe belief about an anti-Trump cabal within the government tweeted out a hashtag: #FakeWhistleblower.
It was typical for the anonymous account, which traffics in far-right content and a conspiracy theory known as QAnon, some of whose adherents think that satanic pedophiles control the "deep state." The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently labeled QAnon a potential domestic terror threat.
Still, that did not stop others, including a Republican congressional candidate, from quickly picking up the hashtag and tweeting it. Within a week, hundreds of QAnon believers and "MAGA" activists had joined in, posting memes and bogus reports to undermine the complaint by a government whistle-blower that President Trump had pressed Ukraine's leader for dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son.
Then Mr. Trump tweeted the hashtag himself.
Such is the frenetic life cycle of conspiracy-driven propaganda, fakery and hate in the age of the first Twitter presidency. Mr. Trump, whose own tweets have warned of deep-state plots against him, accused the House speaker of treason and labeled Republican critics "human scum," has helped spread a culture of suspicion and distrust of facts into the political mainstream.
The president is also awash in an often toxic torrent that sluices into his Twitter account -- roughly 1,000 tweets per minute, many intended for his eyes. Tweets that tag his handle, @realDonaldTrump, can be found with hashtags like #HitlerDidNothingWrong, #IslamIsSatanism and #WhiteGenocide. While filters can block offensive material, the president clearly sees some of it, because he dips into the frothing currents and serves up noxious bits to the rest of the world.
By retweeting suspect accounts, seemingly without regard for their identity or motives, he has lent credibility to white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigots and obscure QAnon adherents like VB Nationalist, an anonymous account that has promoted a hoax about top Democrats worshiping the Devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.
"I've been retweeted by the President of the United States, President Trump!" replied VB Nationalist, who gained thousands of followers after the high-level boost and took it as a sign of encouragement, adding, "Tell me again, how he doesn't care about us."
To assess this unprecedented moment, The New York Times examined Mr. Trump's interactions with Twitter since he took office, reviewing each of his more than 11,000 tweets and the hundreds of accounts he has retweeted, tracking the ways he is exposed to information and replicating what he is likely to see on the platform. The result, including new data analysis and previously unreported details, offers the most comprehensive view yet of a virtual world in which the president spends significant time mingling with extremists, impostors and spies.
Fake accounts tied to intelligence services in China, Iran and Russia had directed thousands of tweets at Mr. Trump, according to a Times analysis of propaganda accounts suspended by Twitter. Iranian operatives tweeted anti-Semitic tropes, saying that Mr. Trump was "being controlled" by global Zionists, and that pulling out of the Iran nuclear treaty would benefit North Korea. Russian accounts tagged the president more than 30,000 times, including in supportive tweets about the Mexican border wall and his hectoring of black football players. Mr. Trump even retweeted a phony Russian account that said, "We love you, Mr. President!"
In fact, Mr. Trump has retweeted at least 145 unverified accounts that have pushed conspiracy or fringe content, including more than two dozen that have since been suspended by Twitter. Tinfoil-hat types and racists celebrate when Mr. Trump shares something they promote. After he tweeted his support for white farmers in South Africa, replies included "DONALD IS KING!" and "No black man can develop land."
The president gets some of his questionable material on Twitter from the 47 accounts he follows that show up in his feed, a curated timeline of tweets that come mostly from his family, celebrities, Fox News hosts and Republican politicians, some of whom in turn follow Twitter accounts that promote QAnon or express anti-Islam or white nationalist views.
QAnon-related accounts have potentially migrated to the president's iPhone courtesy of retweets by Donald Trump Jr., the Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo and the conservative commentator Eric Bolling, all of whom Mr. Trump follows. The younger Mr. Trump has also retweeted Russian intelligence operatives pushing divisive stories about immigration and voter fraud.
Trolls and fringe elements quickly figured out that the best way to reach Mr. Trump is to appeal to his ego. Last year, an anonymous account with a profile photo of the actor Kurt Russell and posts promoting QAnon tagged Mr. Trump in a tweet, declaring, "You're the greatest President of my lifetime, Sir." It was not really Mr. Russell, but Mr. Trump retweeted it with a "Thank you!," helping the account add 2,900 followers that day, before Twitter eventually suspended it.
Authentic or not, the most fervent MAGA and QAnon accounts -- at least 23,000 of his followers have QAnon references in their profiles -- form a dependable Greek chorus that exploits the tricks of the medium to amplify the president's message. Mr. Trump benefits from the activism of his online supporters and the platform's algorithms, which tend to reward the most partisan content within digital communities.
But the constant exposure to the worst elements of social media poses risks. Clint Watts, a former F.B.I. agent and a cybersecurity expert who studies propaganda campaigns on social media, said the time Mr. Trump spent on Twitter "gives you an amazing opportunity to game the president."
"You are very clearly capable of using Twitter to entice and influence this president," he said. "You can distort the guy's views from your house."
Since the dawn of the internet, the nation's leaders have been largely sheltered from the storm of disinformation and bile that churns on its fringes. Social media barely existed during Bill Clinton's presidency, George W. Bush's reference to "the Google" betrayed his unfamiliarity and Barack Obama chafed at being denied an iPhone but agreed to it.
But with the arrival of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Twitter managed to connect the ultimate seat of power to the darkest corners of the web for the first time. There is little evidence that Mr. Trump harbors concerns about promoting accounts that traffic in fake or inflammatory material.
The White House declined to comment for this article and turned down an interview request with the president. But at a White House "social media summit" in July that brought together far-right activists and provocateurs, Mr. Trump expressed appreciation for the fodder he sampled on Twitter.
"The crap that you think of," he said, "is unbelievable."
Mastering the Craft
The path to #FakeWhistleblower stretches back to a seminal conspiracy theory in Trump World: #FakeBirthCertificate.
Mr. Trump's campaign to sow doubts about Mr. Obama's birthplace, as he was considering running for president himself in 2012, showcased his talent for propagating a useful lie. It also overlapped with his growing presence on Twitter.
When his account was created in 2009, the three-year-old platform was just beginning to extend its reach beyond a community of journalists, techies and other early adopters. Over time, as high-profile public figures joined and Twitter allowed for longer messages, its influence grew as a forum for people to comment in real time about live events, world leaders to make official pronouncements and celebrities to interact with fans. Twitter said earlier this year that it had 126 million daily active users.
For Mr. Trump, a Twitter account quickly proved useful for promoting himself, sounding off about politics and, eventually, amplifying his attacks on Mr. Obama. By the time he started tweeting the birther smear in November 2011, his fans had already been doing the same, creating memes and hashtags like #FakeBirthCertificate, first used for that purpose in April 2011 by a supporter who cited Mr. Trump in the tweet.
After Mr. Trump started tweeting on his own in early 2013 -- he previously had help from an assistant -- he was soon recycling misinformation. He retweeted an anti-Obama account that had tweeted at him, "The birth certificate that you forced Obama to show is a computer generated forgery." And he spun conspiracies within conspiracies, tweeting: "How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's 'birth certificate' died in plane crash today. All others lived."
Mr. Trump's experience using Mr. Obama as a punching bag made him adept at weaponizing what he found on Twitter when he decided to run for president. As his following grew, so did his ability to give prominence to objectionable material and -- intentionally or not -- those responsible for it.
In early 2016, he twice retweeted an obscure white supremacist account, @WhiteGenocideTM, that had directed a tweet at him ridiculing Jeb Bush, an opponent in the Republican primary. The since-suspended account, which regularly posted neo-Nazi propaganda and listed its location as "Jewmerica," gained hundreds of followers in the days after Mr. Trump's retweets.
By the time he faced off against Hillary Clinton, a perfect storm had coalesced on a more polarized and partisan Twitter -- bringing together activists and trolls practiced at spreading conspiracy theories and hate, and Russian intelligence operatives seeking to foment discord. A how-to manual titled "Advanced Meme Warfare" circulated online with instructions for creating material to help the Trump campaign by trashing the Clintons.
"The idea is to stack up so much doubt, emotional appeals, and circumstantial evidence ON TOP of facts that we create a landslide of anti-Hill sentiment that permeates through society," it said.
As memes ricocheted around Twitter, Mr. Trump frequently retweeted them and made use of hashtags like #CrookedHillary. After he won the election, Mr. Trump was asked if he would continue being combative on Twitter once he settled into the White House. In an interview with "60 Minutes," he defended his tweeting as "nothing you should be ashamed of," but pledged to change his tone as president.
"I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all," Mr. Trump said. "I'm going to do very restrained."
Dark Undercurrents
The implications of Mr. Trump's Twitter habit became apparent early in his presidency. In short order, he was railing about "fake news," questioning the findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and peddling the fiction that millions of illegal ballots had cost him the popular vote.
Beyond his own tweets, the president stepped up his practice of retweeting others, sharing anti-Muslim videos posted by a British far-right figure who had been retweeted by Ann Coulter. (He later stopped following Ms. Coulter after she criticized him for not making progress on the Mexican border wall.)
That episode highlighted one of the ways the president sees information on Twitter. His feed regularly contains tweets from his son, Donald Jr., who follows and retweets alt-right figures like Stefan Molyneux, a Canadian who pushes "white genocide" conspiracy theories and has promoted white nationalists on his YouTube channel.
The younger Mr. Trump has also followed Lauren Southern, another Canadian right-wing activist who has promoted the "great replacement" theory that white populations are being overrun by nonwhite immigrants with the help of global elites. In May, the president retweeted a post in which she complained that far-right voices were being suspended on social media.
Six people the president follows -- including Dan Scavino, the White House social media director -- in turn follow Terrence K. Williams, a comedian who has been retweeted by Mr. Trump frequently. Among the retweets was a phony smear claiming that a Muslim congresswoman had partied on the anniversary of Sept. 11, and a conspiracy theory linking the Clintons to the suicide of the imprisoned sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Beyond the people he follows, there is another potential pathway to the president on Twitter -- his "mentions," the surging stream of tweets and replies that are directed at him by tagging his handle.
Fake accounts that Twitter identified as being run by foreign intelligence agencies have made frequent use of this tactic to try to get his attention: Russian accounts targeted Mr. Trump with tweets making the false assertion that Russia did not hack the Democratic National Committee's emails. A Chinese account directed a tweet at him calling CNN "goofy commies." And an Iranian account heckled him, saying, "Every morning that American people wakeup, they are nervous about your new tweets."
The odds of his seeing a tagged post amid the deluge are slim, in part because Twitter's algorithms try to screen out objectionable material and his account may employ filters. Some of his Twitter activity is also managed by Mr. Scavino. Still, Mr. Trump spends time looking at tweets that mention him or hashtags that interest him.
The content he chooses to retweet is similar to his own: mostly partisan attacks and praise for himself, with occasional inflammatory material mixed in. While it is not always clear whether his retweets are intended to endorse their authors, the president is effectively launching those accounts into the public eye.
On St. Patrick's Day last March, while awaiting the conclusion of the Mueller report, Mr. Trump went on a daylong Twitter tirade, batting out more than 30 tweets that appear to have come from extended immersion in the streams flowing through his account.
The morning dawned with a 6:01 a.m. barb from Donald Trump Jr. -- "So many stains on the #GhostofJohnMcCain" -- presaging several tweets from the president an hour later attacking the deceased senator over old grudges. At the same time, amid a rapidly building flood of mentions, there was a plea directed at him to "reverse the replacement" of white people, a tweet from an account with an anti-Semitic name demanding Fox News undo the suspension of the host Jeanine Pirro for anti-Muslim comments, and hundreds of references to QAnon.
The president shared a conspiracy-minded post by William Craddick, a right-wing writer who peddled the "pizzagate" hoax that Democratic politicians secretly ran a child-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizzeria. "Russiagate," Mr. Craddick wrote, "was designed in part to help the UK counter Russian influence by baiting the United States into taking a hard line against them." And Mr. Trump sent out a tweet by Jack Posobiec, another pizzagate promoter, linking to a news story about Latino gang members stabbing and burning a teenager.
By nightfall, Mr. Trump had retweeted an obscure QAnon follower who, a few weeks earlier, had pushed the Democratic-pedophilia smear. His retweet of that account -- whose profile image is a stylized "Q" wearing a red MAGA hat -- drew notice on the online message boards of 4chan, which were abuzz with speculation that the president had tacitly approved of QAnon theories.
The binge ended at 9 p.m., when Mr. Trump tweeted, "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Promoting Conspiracies
QAnon entered the public consciousness in October 2017, when someone using the code name "Q" began posting on 4chan, claiming to have secret knowledge of a conspiracy within a Democrat-controlled "deep state" to oust Mr. Trump in a coup.
According to Q's groundless theory, Mr. Trump was aware of the plot and was quietly working to unravel it with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, using the Russia investigation as a cover to sweep up the perpetrators through mass arrests. The most extreme adherents of what became known as QAnon -- short for "Q Anonymous" -- also postulate that the deep state is part of a global network of corrupt elites involved in Satanism, pedophilia and cannibalism.
Remarkably, this conspiracy would migrate from the dark fringes of social media and into conservative political circles, where it took root among a segment of Mr. Trump's most fervent supporters. People holding Q signs have shown up at Trump rallies, and the "Q" symbol found its way into a "Women for Trump" 2020 campaign video.
Last year, two QAnon disciples were arrested in separate episodes, and in May the F.B.I. included QAnon in an intelligence bulletin warning of potential violence stemming from "anti-government, identity-based and fringe political conspiracy theories," particularly as the 2020 election approaches.
There are few places where QAnon's visibility has been greater than on Twitter, where Mr. Trump has helped propagate it. Although Mr. Trump does not follow any QAnon-related accounts, some in his Twitter circle do.
Bill Mitchell, a conservative podcaster who promotes QAnon, is followed by nine people whom the president follows and has potentially appeared in his feed more than a dozen times. The president has frequently retweeted him, including one post advancing the discredited suggestion that Mr. Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump's phones in 2016.
In an email to the Times, Mr. Mitchell said he considered the president's retweets "a hat-tip without an overt endorsement." He believes that the president is deliberately provocative on Twitter to keep political enemies off balance and unable to "think strategically," he said.
"Through his tweets, President Trump keeps the Democrats and media in a perpetually heightened emotional state, in this case offense and anger," he wrote, adding that he respected QAnon's leaders as "patriots and Trump supporters."
More than 50 accounts that have QAnon references in their profiles -- and dozens more that do not but also promote the conspiracy -- appeared among those followed by Donald Trump Jr.; Ms. Bartiromo; Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee; Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser; Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio; and a handful of others who are all, in turn, followed by the president.
There is no indication that these people, who collectively follow thousands of accounts, are aware of the QAnon presence that lurks there, much less support it.
But the potential for QAnon accounts to appear in the presidential feed underscores the viral nature of disinformation on Twitter, where a tweet can hatch on the fringes, hopscotch through layers of accounts and, aided by hashtags and bots, gain wide currency.
On Thursday evening, a QAnon promoter tweeted an unsubstantiated yarn that years ago he overheard a key witness in the impeachment inquiry bad-mouthing America and talking up "Obama & globalism." QAnon accounts passed it around, and by the next morning it had been retweeted by Mr. Posobiec, who in turn was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr. -- in less than 24 hours, the story had wormed its way into the president's Twitter circle.
And it has happened before. During a busy Sunday morning of tweeting in August, Ms. Bartiromo retweeted an anonymous account called @QBlueSkyQ that had posted a series of conspiratorial messages about the Russia investigation, along with a video snippet of her Fox interview with George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide arrested in the scandal.
Even a glance at @QBlueSkyQ's profile would have revealed that it was a die-hard QAnon account. It has tweeted doctored images and fake memes promoting a falsehood that top Democrats sexually torture children to harvest adrenochrome -- a chemical derived from adrenaline -- for a life-extending elixir. The @QBlueSkyQ retweet was one of at least a half-dozen times Ms. Bartiromo helped circulate such accounts, though none of the posts dealt with the QAnon conspiracy directly. Ms. Bartiromo declined to comment.
QAnon accounts have also been retweeted by Mr. Bolling, a former Fox News commentator. Mr. Bolling said that he had no idea any account he retweeted was connected to QAnon, and that it was unfair to expect him to "vet every account that I retweet."
"I wouldn't have done it had I known," he said. "I have nothing to do with QAnon."
Mr. Bolling retweeted an anonymous QAnon account called @K12Lioness several times, most of it partisan political material and all unrelated to the Q conspiracy. But in between the run-of-the-mill tweets that caught his attention, the account was also pumping out vile memes and messages from the deepest fringes of the QAnon universe, like this post in June:
"The Democrats have lost their minds (adrenochrome) eating baby parts. MY GOD Americans WAKE UP!!"
Deploying the Trolls
Mr. Trump was two weeks from his inauguration in January 2017 when he tweeted, "So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers?"
It would be the start of a relentless campaign, continuing to the present, to dispute that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. Eventually, the narrative would merge with another -- that Mr. Biden intervened in Ukraine to protect his son's business interests -- in the now-infamous phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine's president to search for the D.N.C.'s email server, implying without evidence that it was somewhere in his country.
That effort began within days of Mr. Biden's official campaign announcement in April, when a Trump supporter tweeted a meme of Mr. Biden with the words, "China & Ukraine, Quid Pro Joe." The post prompted another Trump fan to put a hashtag to use: #QuidProJoe. The #QuidProJoe and #FakeWhistleblower hashtags had both been created years earlier for issues unrelated to Mr. Biden and Ukraine, but were dusted off and put into service by Trump supporters.
The #QuidProJoe hashtag remained relatively dormant until a few weeks later, when it was retweeted seven times by a pro-Trump, bot-like account that cranks out more than 100 tweets a day, including QAnon and fervent anti-Democratic material. The hashtag steadily gained currency, and by September, when news erupted of the whistle-blower complaint filed a month earlier, it was part of a growing arsenal of social media tools seized on by Mr. Trump's supporters, including Donald Jr.
A slew of hashtags -- nearly all of them created by anonymous, unverified accounts, some connected to QAnon -- have been deployed on Twitter in recent months attacking the impeachment inquiry, and in particular Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee. Many have crude names, like #LyingSackOfSchiff, #SchiffForBrains and #FullOfSchiff.
So far, none of those hashtags has gotten a presidential tweet. But every day, Mr. Trump offers his Twitter fans reason for hope.
On Oct. 19, between tweeting "Shifty Schiff is Corrupt" and retweeting an anonymous account that regularly traffics in alt-right and Russian propaganda, the president tweeted out a fresh hashtag being pushed by his supporters: #StopTheCoup.
Twitter went wild.
The New York Times reviewed every tweet and retweet sent by President Trump from Jan. 20, 2017, through Oct. 15, 2019. Retweets include those with and without comment. The Times reviewed each account retweeted by Mr. Trump and determined whether the account was verified or not. The Times then evaluated the unverified accounts to determine whether they had been suspended by Twitter or had tweeted conspiracy theories.

Texto completo: WOOSTER – His books all started with just a sketch, Richard Cowdrey, a New York Times best-selling artist, told an audience of students from seven school districts in the tri-county area at the Wooster campus of Ohio State University on Friday.
Cowdrey was one of 12 authors and illustrators speaking to about 400 third- through eighth-grade students at the Buckeye Book Fair’s first Young Authors Conference at Shisler Center and Fisher Auditorium, where the 32nd annual Buckeye Book Fair, featuring 100 authors, is being held Saturday from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Admission is $2.
“My favorite thing to draw has always been animals,” Cowdrey said.
Today, as a result of his interest, talent and God’s grace, he said, he is associated with two popular animal icons — Marley, a yellow Labrador retriever made famous in books and in films; and Fiona, a hippo who was born prematurely at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Gardens and who became famous on the Internet and in Cowdrey’s series of books.
Cowdrey himself followed Fiona’s development online and suggested making her into the subject of a children’s book. After submitting drawings of Fiona to a publishing company, Cowdrey was rewarded with a contract and a best-selling book. The hippo, who Cowdrey said gained 970 pounds in her first year of life, is the heroine of three books, including “A Very Fiona Christmas.”
Cowdrey told his young audience he has a specific purpose for speaking at schools and events around the country.
“There is somebody in every audience who might be like me,” he said, telling them as a child and young adult he “was always drawing, always in my own world.”
“Maybe you’re not the best student,” he said, noting he was “far from a straight-A student ... but you have something that’s in your heart.”
A sketch is “a promise of something more,” author and illustrator Will Hillenbrand said. “Small breakthroughs lead to big breakthroughs. Mistakes actually teach me.”
Further illustrating the process of craftsmanship, Hillenbrand, who has published about 70 books for young readers, said, “A line is a dot that went for a walk,” quoting one of his favorite artists, Paul Klee. “I hope to invite you to your own journey.”
To those in the audience who want to be authors, Mary Kay Carson, a non-fiction children’s book author, said, “That is just so fabulous.”
But a writing career isn’t one she originally pursued.
“I was a kid who likes animals and science,” she said, and ultimately a college biology major who became an author. “I like to go out and do things and see things for myself.
“There is no right or wrong answer,” Carson said. “Writing is about sharing and understanding. Writing about something is a great way to understand it.”
Michelle Houts, author of picture and chapter books for children, lined up student volunteers in a series of nine chairs to illustrate how a book progresses from an idea to a bookstore.
Each one was given a role and a prop to represent a particular point along the route – writer, agent, publisher, editor, art director, illustrator, marketing director, proofreader, book seller or librarian.
One young lady, identified by her peers as one who would meet Houts’ definition of “picky,” was given a distinctive pair of glasses for her job as proofreader.
“You can’t miss anything,” Houts told her.
“How would you feel if this book got published with mistakes in it?” she asked her panel.
“I’d want a refund,” one young man responded.
Teachers and editors share a common characteristic, she told students. “They only want our stories to get better,”
It can be a little overwhelming,” she admitted, recalling a 15-page letter from an editor who told her on page one “everything she loved” and the other 14 areas that needed work.
Julia Wiesenberg, executive director of the Buckeye Book Fair, said she hopes to expand the Young Authors Conference in its first year this year, to a two-to-three day workshop with additional schools participating next year.
Andrew Johnson, a consultant for Tri-County Educational Service Center, said the ESC has combined its previous Young Authors Conference, held at The College of Wooster, with Buckeye Book Fair’s new conference.
This way, Johnson said, “We can get so many more authors,” as well as make educational sessions more individualized by grade levels.
“We also hope it brings in the community,” he said, with the consistent objective “to get kids reading and writing.”

New Charges Draw a Plea Of Not Guilty From Loughlin

Texto completo: Ms. Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, have continued to maintain their innocence as prosecutors' counts against them have grown.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, a fashion designer, have pleaded not guilty to new bribery charges prosecutors have brought against them in the college admissions scandal, signaling that they intend, at least for now, to keep fighting the case.
Prosecutor have accused Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli of paying $ 500,000 to get their two daughters designated as recruits to the University of Southern California women's crew team as a way to ensure their admission to the school.
The couple have maintained their innocence, even as Hollywood gossip magazines have reported that Ms. Loughlin is increasingly worried about what will happen. In contrast, the other Hollywood actress ensnared in the case, Felicity Huffman, who was accused of paying $ 15,000 to cheat on her daughter's SAT, pleaded guilty and has already completed her prison sentence. (Ms. Huffman was sentenced to 14 days, but served only 12, including the day she was arrested.)
Prosecutors originally charged roughly three dozen parents arrested in the case with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. After Ms. Huffman and roughly a dozen other parents agreed to plead to that count, prosecutors added money laundering charges against the remaining parents, including Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli. Then, last week, they added the new charge, of federal programs bribery, which can carry a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Lawyers involved in the case have said prosecutors brought the new charges in part out of frustration with the sentences given out in the case so far, which have ranged from probation to five months in prison, and have all been less than what prosecutors had asked for.
In a statement issued on Oct. 22, the United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Andrew E. Lelling, said the new charges were "the result of ongoing investigation in the nationwide college admissions case."
"Our goal from the beginning has been to hold the defendants fully accountable for corrupting the college admissions process through cheating, bribery and fraud," Mr. Lelling said.

Texto completo: We’re enjoying a relatively robust economy, and folks are happy with that. My investment portfolio is up, and barring a financial collapse, I’m probably good to go. Why should I care about Constitutional thinking by Alexander Hamilton over 200 hundred years ago?
No president has ever been impeached and removed from office by the Senate. Arguably, President Nixon might have been in the early 1970s had he not resigned. Yet today — and for the past generation or so — partisanship trumps all ethical behavior.
President Trump consulted with Russian President Vladimir Putin but not Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi regarding the Seal execution of the ISIS leader, Al-Baghdadi.
Trump possibly might be given a free ride if he did indeed shoot a person on Fifth Avenue — as he jokingly suggested — if he did not do it in a particularly vicious way. But if he acted especially cowardly and it involved children, he might have been held accountable, and perhaps have his wrist slapped. Attorney General Bill Barr would have the children’s family indicted for starting a conspiracy.
The Constitution was drafted in a time when political parties were not officially recognized. The president and vice president were often political rivals. And the colonies were nervous about a strong leader, who could become a king or emperor.
Trump’s actions meet the framework of Hamilton’s concerns of a president colluding or conspiring with a foreign government.
Yet how do we resolve the unwavering, “drink the Kool-Aid” position from the party he represents? Or should we care? What if the economy were lousy? It wouldn’t matter. They would come up with something else.
I am struck by the unprecedented reaction of our “professional” cadre of diplomats and military experts who risk their careers to express outrage at this administration’s steps, especially in White House telephone calls and secret diplomatic exchanges with Putin. This includes senior officials, e.g. former Secretary of State Jim Mattis and former Chief of Staff John Kelly, both four-star generals. But the lower tier of both political appointees, representatives to the National Security Council and diplomats is an impressive collection.
We live in a dangerous world, and in some ways it is more dangerous than at the end of the Cold War when there were roughly 70,000 nuclear bombs stashed between the nuclear powers and targeted to major population centers. Now we’re down to just under 14,000 with 3,750 operational (by treaty). We are on the cusp of nuclear proliferation with Iran, North Korea, and others adding to the mix. And the U.S. and Russia are embarking on a military upgrade and possibly a Cold War re-emergence.
Trump is not responsible for this, nor were former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama. It’s in our collective DNA.
I spent much of my career assessing the effects of nuclear power plant meltdowns and the effects of nuclear weapons testing. I’m not sure we could tolerate even one thermonuclear explosion in New York City or Los Angeles or Washington. Hundreds or thousands would destroy life for a long, long time.
The concept of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) was used not as a particularly good idea during the Cold War but as a last resort after reason and everything else failed.
It only worked — and surprisingly so — because leadership in the United States and Russia were “rational” enough to avoid stumbling or bumbling into a major confrontation. But presidents recognized the need to keep the military and diplomats in the loop.
What our military leaders — whether by anonymous letters to the New York Times by members of his cabinet, by anonymous whistleblower reports, or recently by direct testimony to the House Intelligence Committee — are saying is that the check on the inability for exclusive self-servingness of this administration has been removed, and we are in extreme peril.
There are always nuances to a complicated impeachment process, including in this instance that because the elections are only a year away, why not let the voters decide. My sense of recent news events is that things are rapidly spiraling out of control, and Trump could do irreparable harm to our national interests in the time remaining.
I base this on recent statements by retired Gen. Kelly, the length of the ongoing controversy, e.g. publishing the “Adult in the Room” letter in the New York Times, and now the obviousness of collusion between Trump and Putin. Pelosi’s “all Roads lead to Putin” comment rings true. We haven’t had time to digest giving up our position in Syria and the Middle East to Russia. But it ranges from bad to very bad. It looks dicey for the fate of Israel in the mid to long term.
Impeachment, like MAD, may not be the best option, but given the circumstances we have to start some place. Doing nothing endangers everybody.

Texto completo: Russia has been testing new disinformation tactics in an enormous Facebook campaign in parts of Africa, as part of an evolution of its manipulation techniques before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Facebook said Wednesday that it removed three Russian-backed influence networks on its site that were aimed at African countries including Mozambique, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya.
The company said the online networks were linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian oligarch who was indicted by the United States and accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election.
Unlike past influence campaigns from Russia, the networks targeted several countries through Arabic-language posts, according to the Stanford Internet Observatory, which collaborated with Facebook to unravel the effort. Russians also worked with locals in the African countries to set up Facebook accounts that were disguised as authentic to avoid detection.
Some of the posts promoted Russian policies, while others criticized French and American policies in Africa. A Facebook page set up by the Russians in Sudan that masqueraded as a news network, called Sudan Daily, regularly reposted articles from Russia's state-owned Sputnik news organization.
The effort was at times larger in volume than what the Russians deployed in the United States in 2016. While the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency posted on Facebook 2,442 times a month on average in 2016, one of the networks in northern and central Africa posted 8,900 times in October alone, according to the Stanford researchers.
"They are trying to make it harder for us and civil society to try and detect their operations," Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said of the Russian actions.
The campaign underlined how Russia is continuing to aggressively try different disinformation techniques, even as it has come under scrutiny for its online interference methods. By spreading the use of its tactics to a region that is less closely monitored than the United States and Europe, researchers said Russia appeared to be trying to expand its sphere of influence in Africa, where it has started distributing propaganda and building a political infrastructure.
Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and a former Facebook executive, said the campaign had implications for the United States before next year's presidential election.
He said it was highly likely that Russian groups were already using the same model of working with locals in the United States to post inflammatory messages on Facebook. By employing locals, he said, Russians did not need to set up fake accounts or create accounts that originated in Russia, making it easier to sidestep being noticed.
"We will see a model where American groups are used as proxies, where all the content is published under their accounts and their pages," Stamos said.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa —⁠ 2020 Democrat Pete Buttigieg called for generational change as his campaign surges in Iowa, evoking the image of another candidate once considered too inexperienced for the White House: former President Barack Obama.
"I will not waiver from my commitment to our values or back down from the boldness or our ideas. But I also will not tire from the effort to include everyone in the future we are trying to build," the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said. “We will fight when we must fight. But I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point. The point is what lies on the other side of the fight."
While taking shots at President Trump's "divider in chief" rhetoric, Buttigieg, 37, told the Iowa Democratic Party's fall fundraiser, the Liberty and Justice Celebration, the first time he visited the state was to campaign for Obama in 2008.
In another reference to Obama, Buttigieg dismissed critics of the 44th president's "hope and change" message.
“And talking about hope and belonging, if it sounds optimistic for a time like this, call it optimistic, but do not call it naïve, because I believe these things not based on my age but my experience," he said.
Buttigieg, a Harvard and Oxford graduate who was a McKinsey consultant before serving in Afghanistan as a Navy reserve officer, would be the first millennial and openly gay president should he win the Democratic nomination and a general election against President Trump.
The mayor shrugged off criticism he would struggle against a combative incumbent next year.
"We know that he’s going to do everything he can to hold onto power. But if you nominate me, his playbook isn’t going to work this time around," he said. "I did not just come here to end the era of Donald Trump. I am here to launch the era that must come next."
Buttigieg rose in a new New York Times/Siena College Iowa poll released Friday, with 18% support. His share of the vote puts him behind Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont but ahead of longtime front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden.

David Brooks: Impeach Trump. And then move on.

Texto completo: Is it possible that more than 20 Republican senators will vote to convict Donald Trump of articles of impeachment? When you hang around Washington, you get the sense that it could happen.
The evidence against Trump is overwhelming. This Ukraine quid pro quo wasn’t just a single reckless phone call. It was a multiprong several-month campaign to use the levers of American power to destroy a political rival.
Republican legislators are being bludgeoned with this truth in testimony after testimony. They know in their hearts that Trump is guilty of impeachable offenses. It’s evident in the way they stare glumly at their desks during hearings; the way they flee reporters seeking comment; the way they slag the White House off the record. It’ll be hard for them to vote to acquit if they can’t even come up with a non-ludicrous rationale.
And yet when you get outside Washington, it’s hard to imagine more than one or two GOP senators voting to convict.
In the first place, Democrats have not won widespread public support. Nancy Pelosi always said impeachment works only if there’s a bipartisan groundswell, and so far there is not. Trump’s job approval numbers have been largely unaffected by the impeachment inquiry. Support for impeachment breaks down on conventional pro-Trump/anti-Trump lines. Roughly 90% of Republican voters oppose it. Republican senators will never vote to convict in the face of that.
Second, Democrats have not won over the most important voters — moderates in swing states. A New York Times/Siena College survey of voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin found that just 43% want to impeach and remove Trump from office, while 53% do not. Pushing impeachment makes Democrats vulnerable in precisely the states they cannot afford to lose in 2020.
Third, there is little prospect these numbers will turn around, even after a series of high-profile hearings.
I’ve been traveling pretty constantly since this impeachment thing got going. I’ve been to a bunch of blue states and a bunch of red states (including Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah). In coastal blue states, impeachment comes up in conversation all the time. In red states, it never comes up; ask people in red states if they’ve been talking about it with their friends, they shrug and reply no, not really.
Professor Paul Sracic of Youngstown State University in Ohio told Ken Stern from Vanity Fair that when he asked his class of 80 students if they’d heard any conversation about impeachment, only two said they had. When he asked if impeachment interested them, all 80 said it did not.
That’s exactly what I’ve found, too. For most, impeachment is not a priority. It’s a dull background noise — people in Washington and the national media doing the nonsense they always do. A pollster can ask Americans if they support impeachment, and some yes or no answer will be given, but the fundamental reality is that many Americans are indifferent.
Fourth, it’s a lot harder to do impeachment in an age of cynicism, exhaustion and distrust. During Watergate, voters trusted federal institutions and granted the impeachment process a measure of legitimacy. Today’s voters do not share that trust and will not regard an intra-Washington process as legitimate.
Many Americans don’t care about impeachment because they take it as a given that this is the kind of corruption that politicians of all stripes have been doing all along. Many don’t care because it looks like the same partisan warfare that’s been going on forever, just with a different name.
Fifth, it’s harder to do impeachment when politics is seen as an existential war for the future of the country. Many Republicans know Trump is guilty, but they can’t afford to hand power to Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.
Progressives, let me ask you a question: If Trump-style Republicans were trying to impeach a President Biden, Warren or Sanders, and there was evidence of guilt, would you vote to convict? Answer honestly.
I get that Democrats feel they have to proceed with impeachment to protect the Constitution and the rule of law. But there is little chance they will come close to ousting the president. So I hope they set a Thanksgiving deadline. Play the impeachment card through November, have the House vote and then move on to other things. The Senate can quickly dispose of the matter and Democratic candidates can make their best pitches for denying Trump reelection.
Elizabeth Bruenig of The Washington Post put her finger on something important in a recent essay on Trump’s evangelical voters: the assumption of decline. Many Trump voters take it as a matter of course that for the rest of their lives things are going to get worse for them — economically, spiritually, politically and culturally. They are not the only voters who think this way. Many young voters in their OK Boomer T-shirts feel exactly the same, except about climate change, employment prospects and debt.
This sense of elite negligence in the face of national decline is the core issue right now. Impeachment is a distraction from that. As quickly as possible, it’s time to move on.

Texto completo: The artillery barrages of World War I were long dormant when Gen. John Pershing readied an award for a wounded combat veteran. The soldier took shrapnel to the chest in the brutal Seicheprey campaign in France, survived gas attacks and caught a German scout.
Pershing, the commander of U.S. forces in the war, summarized his valor in a speech and pinned a medal to the soldier, who did not say a word that day in July 1921.
"He merely licked his chops and wagged his diminutive tail," The New York Times wrote of Stubby, a Boston bull terrier already famous as a four-legged version of Sgt. Alvin York.
This weekend, another dog was added to the hall of canine heroes: A Belgian Malinois that tore after Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a darkened tunnel in Syria. Baghdadi killed himself with a suicide vest as the dog closed in, and the pup suffered minor wounds before returning to duty.
A photo of the dog, assigned to the Army's secretive Delta Force, was posted by President Donald Trump, who said the dog did "a GREAT JOB" in the raid. The dog's name is classified, Trump and the Pentagon said, though Newsweek reported its name is Conan (after the comedian, not the barbarian).
That very good boy is part of a long, scruffy line of war dogs that have served alongside U.S. troops for more than a century. And in each major campaign, dogs have become remarkably agile on battlefields as some of the most fearsome and effective weapons.
"They have to adapt the same way humans adapt," said Rebecca Frankel, the author of "War Dogs: Tales of Canine History, Heroism and Love." As long as combatants plant their feet on soil, Frankel told The Washington Post, "dogs are the best nonhuman partners on the ground."
But the United States was slow to learn that. While dogs in the Civil War were brought in as mascots, they were helpful in ad hoc ways, like finding sources of water.
In World War I, the Russians and Germans were using dogs on the battlefield before the Allies, Frankel said, until British commander Lt. Col. Edwin Hautenville Richardson, already a noted dog training expert, lobbied for their use. "The affection for a master and the love of reward" is a powerful tool, he wrote.
War dogs proved themselves as uncanny messengers when communications were compromised. Dogs, after learning a trench line, could rush messages at vital moments of attack. A small retriever named Darkie sped through 7 miles of bombardment in 55 minutes to deliver a message. One dog finished its mission after its jaw was nearly severed by a bullet.
"Their will to complete a mission is pretty unflappable," Frankel said.
Other dogs were shot and enemy troops would try to lure them with food to prevent them from delivering their messages. But their training compelled them to stay with their friendly handlers, Frankel said.
Stubby was injured by enemy gas, and after becoming especially sensitive to the poison, he roused troops awake with barks and bites, according to the Smithsonian, which now houses Stubby as a stuffed exhibit.
But dogs were not used for their full battlefield potential until World War II, Frankel said, after formal training was provided, and dogs were donated by civilians through the program Dogs for Defense.
Suddenly family pets from five breeds -- German shepherds, Belgian sheep dogs, Doberman pinschers, farm collies, and giant schnauzers -- were on battlefields helping U.S. troops on sentry duty.
They could sniff out enemy troops at a range of 1,000 yards -- a useful tactic to flush out Japanese troops lurking in underbrush, Frankel noted in her book.
Chips, perhaps the most famous dog of World War II, was shot in the face after rushing an enemy machine gun position in Sicily. He was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart. He later bit Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower on the hand before returning to his family in New York.
His family noted the trauma evident in Chips. The dog "doesn't seem to wag his tail as much before going to war," the Times reported then, according to Frankel.
In the jungles and rice paddies of Vietnam, an elusive enemy guerrilla force made patrol and detection dogs an even more fundamental asset. Handlers adapted by sending their dogs out in front on long leashes, and a tight hold indicated few dangers around.
But if the dog stopped and the leash sagged, it meant enemy troops could be nearby, Frankel said, with the dog's head turning toward the threat.
Working dogs were not utilized in meaningful ways in Iraq until several years after the 2003 invasion, when improvised explosive devices became the signature enemy weapon in Iraq and later in Afghanistan.
Bomb sniffing dogs were sped to combat zones to help. By 2010, the Pentagon spent $19 billion on technology to combat IEDs that were killing and maiming troops by the thousands.
But U.S. troops still found only about half of IEDs on patrol. That number jumped to 80% when dogs were involved, Wired reported then.
"Dogs are the best detectors," Lt. Gen. Michael Oates conceded in a briefing.
Now war dogs are most prominent in Special Operations raids. In 2011, a dog named Cairo accompanied Navy SEALs on the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.
Troops navigating IED-laced objectives rely on dogs to sniff out bombs. But they also use the jarring, ferociously fast attack of dogs to terrify would-be threats, like Conan. In the case of a handler and their dog, "the enemy now has two threats," Frankel said.
But they can't stay on the battlefield forever. When military dogs are retired, finding a suitable home is challenging, Frankel said. Sometimes they live with their former handlers, whose companionship helps them recover with their time in combat, Frankel said.
After delving into the war dog world for her book, she took a shining to a Belgian Malinois named Dyngo. He served three tours of duty in Afghanistan. He was awarded a Bronze Star.
But at Frankel's home in Washington, Dyngo wanted to keep working after he retired. He had to relearn how to be a normal dog.
"He carries on," Frankel said. "He's like a little tank."

Texto completo: His "Same Time, Next Year" ran for years on Broadway, was made into a movie and is often described as one of the most-produced plays in the world.
Bernard Slade, a writer who created the enduring 1970s television series "The Partridge Family," among other shows, and wrote one of the most successful plays in Broadway history, "Same Time, Next Year," died on Wednesday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 89.
His daughter, Laurie Newbound, said through a spokeswoman that the cause was complications of Lewy body dementia.
Mr. Slade was a stage actor and theatrical producer before he turned his attention to writing. After substantial success in Canada, he signed a contract with Screen Gems to write three television pilots a year.
With Harry Ackerman he created "Love on a Rooftop," a romantic comedy seen on ABC in the 1966-67 season. He fared somewhat better as a creator of "The Flying Nun," which premiered in 1967 and ran for three seasons, advancing the career of its young star, Sally Field.
"The Partridge Family," a comedy about a musical family that finds success as a pop band, made its debut in September 1970, with Shirley Jones as the matriarch and David Cassidy playing the resident heartthrob.
"While in Canada I had written a television play called 'The Big Coin Sound,' which was about a vocal group," Mr. Slade recalled in his memoir, "Shared Laughter" (2000). "Then one night I happened to catch a family group called the Cowsills on 'The Tonight Show.' Since 'The Sound of Music' was enormously popular at the time, I thought the combination of original music and comedy could be very effective in a television series."
The producers originally thought of casting some members of the Cowsills, but, as Mr. Slade put it, they "didn't really fit into any of the characters that I had written," and so Ms. Jones, Mr. Cassidy, Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce and others were cast as Partridges. The resulting show ran for four seasons on ABC, made a teenage idol out of Mr. Cassidy, spawned hit records and became a touchstone of 1970s kitsch.
Mr. Slade wrote a number of the show's 96 episodes, but by the end of its run he had become disenchanted with television and had turned his attention back to his original interest, theater. In 1975 he found spectacular success with "Same Time, Next Year," a two-hander about a man and a woman, each married to someone else, who are having a very particular type of affair, meeting just once a year at the same inn.
The play, with Ellen Burstyn and Charles Grodin constituting the opening-night cast and Gene Saks directing, ran for almost three and a half years. Clive Barnes, reviewing the premiere in The New York Times, was ecstatic.
"It is a delicious and very moral kind of immoral play," he wrote. "It has wit, compassion, a sense of humor and a feel for nostalgia -- who could ask for anything more? It restores one's faith in the possibility of a commercially styled Broadway hit -- for here is a play clearly geared for popularity that does not for one moment talk down to its audience."
Mr. Slade's first Broadway credit, it was nominated for a Tony Award for best play.
"Same Time, Next Year," which ran for 1,453 performances on Broadway and had name actors replacing the original stars over the years, became a staple of theaters large and small and is often described as one of the most-produced plays in the world. Mr. Slade adapted it into a 1978 movie, which starred Ms. Burstyn and Alan Alda. It was nominated for four Oscars.

Part of the appeal of the play is that Mr. Slade made it more than merely a gentle romance. As its characters meet year after year, they change in ways that reflect the changing times.
"What puts the final icing on Mr. Slade's wonderfully confectioned cake," Mr. Barnes wrote, "is the way in which he contrives to give us a social history of the United States during the past quarter‐century. His eye and ear for salient detail are sure, and the period feel is assisted by the evocative use of nostalgic tapes (speeches, songs, sports broadcasts of the period) between the scenes. Clever, clever, Mr. Slade."
Bernard Slade Newbound was born on May 2, 1930, in St. Catharines, Ontario, about 13 miles from Niagara Falls. His parents, Frederick and Bessie Newbound, were British, and in 1935 they returned to England. During World War II the family moved around constantly because of wartime evacuations; young Bernard attended 13 schools in seven years.
At 18 he returned to Canada, settling in Toronto and taking a job "working in a customs cage stamping little cards that came out of nowhere and went he knew not whither," as Macleans magazine put it in 1975. He answered an ad for summer-stock actors, leading to numerous roles onstage and on television and radio in Canada.
In 1953 he married Jill Foster, an actress who had responded to that same summer-stock ad, and they ran a theater in Vineland, Ontario, for a time.
Mr. Slade's writing credits in the early 1960s included several installments of the Canadian anthology series "Playdate" and "Encounter." In 1964 he relocated to Los Angeles. In addition to his early breakthrough, "Love on a Rooftop," he wrote 17 episodes of the popular comedy "Bewitched" in the mid-1960s.
In the early 1970s he created and wrote episodes of "The Girl With Something Extra," which also starred Ms. Field, and "Bridget Loves Bernie."
In David Cassidy's autobiography, "Could It Be Forever? My Story" (2007), Mr. Slade is quoted explaining the origin of the family name in his best-known TV show.
"The show was originally called 'The Family Business' and later changed to 'The Partridge Family,"' he said. "I went to school in England and played on the soccer team. The center-half was a guy named Partridge, which, as it turned out, was not that uncommon a name. But at the time I thought it was unusual and it seemed fitting."
Mr. Slade began writing "Same Time, Next Year" while waiting in an airport, sketching out the first scene on airline stationery. He wrote many other plays as well. One of them, "Tribute," about a man who learns he has leukemia, opened on Broadway in June 1978. It starred Jack Lemmon and ran for 212 performances. Mr. Lemmon also starred in a 1980 film version.
Mr. Slade had another Broadway success with "Romantic Comedy," which opened in October 1979 with Mia Farrow and Anthony Perkins leading the cast.
"Writing for theater is very public," Mr. Slade told The Times as that play was getting ready to open. "You put it on the line each time. Elsewhere you're as good as your best play, but in America you seem to be only as good as your last."
"Romantic Comedy" ran for almost a year, but Mr. Slade's last Broadway effort, "Special Occasions" in 1982, was a flop. It starred Richard Mulligan and Suzanne Pleshette, who was then well known from the popular 1970s TV series "The Bob Newhart Show."
"It's not nearly as amusing as 'The Bob Newhart Show,"' Frank Rich wrote in The Times, "it's just longer and more sparsely populated."
It closed after the opening-night performance.
Mr. Slade's wife died in 2017. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a sister, Shirley Rabone; a son, Chris Newbound; and four granddaughters.
In 1975, as he was transitioning out of TV writing, Mr. Slade acknowledged having some trepidation early in his career about the types of things he was writing.
"The closest I came to being embarrassed is when I wouldn't tell people the title of what I was working on," the Macleans article quoted him as saying. "I was ducking into doorways when I'd see friends. I mean, I did not want as an epitaph, 'He Created The Flying Nun."'

Texto completo: A new series tells a coming-of-age story based loosely on the life of Emily Dickinson. And an adaptation of a recent Broadway play hits Netflix.
What's Streaming
DICKINSON Stream on Apple TV Plus. Emily Dickinson is imbued with teenage angst and a vocabulary that includes words like "dude" and "sick" in this series debuting Friday as one of the first shows on Apple's new streaming service. "Dickinson," which stars Hailee Steinfeld as a version of the 19th-century poet, reimagines Dickinson as a patriarchy-fighting millennial who throws ragers, relentlessly pursues her creative impulses and hangs out with a personification of death played by the rapper Wiz Khalifa. She also rebels against her overbearing father and has a romance with her future sister-in-law. In a recent interview with The New York Times, the show's creator, Alena Smith, described "Dickinson" as "a coming-of-age story about a radical young female artist who was ahead of her time." The tone calls to mind teen dramas like "Riverdale." Part of the idea, Smith said, is to consider Dickinson through a modern lens. "If she wasn't that well understood in her time," Smith asked, "can we understand her better in ours?"
FOR ALL MANKIND Stream on Apple TV Plus. About eight decades after the poet at the heart of "Dickinson" died, NASA landed astronauts on the moon. That's the real history, anyway: In this alternate history sci-fi series, also debuting on Apple's new service, the U.S.S.R. beat NASA to the punch. The show imagines how that outcome might have shaped both space exploration and America itself in the years after.
AMERICAN SON (2019) Stream on Netflix. Those who couldn't make it to Broadway around the beginning of this year to see Kerry Washington star in "American Son" have another chance, thanks to this film adaptation of that intense play. Washington reprises her role as Kendra Ellis-Connor, a mother who goes to the police for help finding out what happened to her missing 18-year-old son. Those circumstances reunite her with her estranged husband, Scott (Steven Pasquale, also reprising his role), and provide the setup for a story that asks hard questions about race, gender, class and police brutality. The goal of the play, Washington told The Times before its 2018 opening, is to "step into some truth."
What's on TV
IN THE LONG RUN 10 p.m. on Starz. Idris Elba created and stars in this semi-autobiographical British comedy series, set in the Hackney borough of London in the mid-1980s. Elba plays Walter, a family man whose rascally younger brother, Valentine (Jimmy Akingbola), moves in after leaving the brothers' native Sierra Leone. Signs that Valentine will bring a new energy into his brother's life begin on his very first night in London, when Valentine feeds his adolescent nephew palm wine.
TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (1991) 5 p.m. on BBC America. With Linda Hamilton and California's most toned former governor (sorry, Jerry Brown) back in a new "Terminator" movie this weekend, now is a good time to revisit this first sequel in the franchise. The original, THE TERMINATOR (1984), is also an option -- it's airing at 5 p.m. on Syfy.

Texto completo: Timothy Morrison, a National Security Council aide, said a top diplomat close to President Trump suggested a military aid package for Ukraine was conditioned on investigations into his political rivals.
WASHINGTON -- A senior National Security Council aide on Thursday confirmed a key episode at the center of the impeachment inquiry, testifying that a top diplomat working with President Trump told him that a package of military assistance for Ukraine would not be released until the country committed to investigations the president sought.
In a closed-door deposition, the aide, Timothy Morrison, also said he had been told of a September call between Mr. Trump and the diplomat, Gordon D. Sondland. In that conversation, the president said he was not looking for a quid pro quo with Ukraine, but then went on to "insist" that the country's president publicly announce investigations into Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son and other Democrats.
William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, spoke of his alarm about the conversations during his private testimony last week, saying that he had been briefed about them by Mr. Morrison, the senior director for Europe and Russia for the National Security Council. Mr. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, has also given investigators a more limited account of his call with Mr. Trump. Mr. Morrison's confirmation of the conversations could be important for House Democrats as they seek to build their impeachment case against Mr. Trump. A publicly available, reconstructed transcript already shows that Mr. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine during a July 25 phone call to undertake the investigations of Democrats. Investigators are trying to establish whether Mr. Trump used $ 391 million in security aid and a coveted White House meeting with Mr. Zelensky as leverage in a pressure campaign to secure the inquiries.
But Mr. Morrison, a Trump political appointee and a former longtime Republican congressional aide, resisted making the kind of sweeping, often damaging judgments about what was taking place that Democrats have heard from other witnesses, and Republicans emerged calling him the most favorable witness they had heard from so far.
In his opening remarks, obtained by The New York Times, he did not draw conclusions about Mr. Trump's involvement in the pressure tactics, pointing back repeatedly to Mr. Sondland, whose involvement in Ukraine policy he said he "did not understand." In subsequent testimony, he said he did not view the July phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky as illegal or improper, but he found it striking enough to ask the National Security Council's chief lawyer, John Eisenberg, to review it, in part out of a concern that a summary might leak out.
He did so, Mr. Morrison testified, because he worried about how disclosure of what was said in the call "would play out in Washington's polarized environment," how it could affect bipartisan backing for Ukraine in Congress, and "how it would affect the Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship."
Rather than ascribe a political motive to the pressure campaign against Ukraine, as some witnesses have, Mr. Morrison characterized the behavior he saw as bad foreign policy of the sort that could potentially squander a "once-in-a-generation opportunity" afforded by the election of Mr. Zelensky, who campaigned as a reformer who would crack down on rampant corruption.
"Ambassador Taylor and I had no reason to believe that the public release of the security sector assistance might be conditioned on a public statement reopening the Burisma investigation until my Sept. 1, 2019, conversation with Ambassador Sondland," Mr. Morrison said. "Even then I hoped that Ambassador Sondland's strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by the leaders of the administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security."
Mr. Morrison's testimony came as Democrats were moving to wrap up their closed portion of their inquiry in the coming week or so. As he met with investigators, they muscled through a resolution on the floor of the House endorsing the inquiry and laying out a path to move their work into the open and begin a debate over impeachment articles in the coming weeks. Republicans uniformly opposed the measure, which they said fell short of redeeming an illegitimate, politically motivated crusade by Democrats to undo the 2016 election.
Mr. Morrison appeared under subpoena despite a White House directive not to, according to an official involved in the inquiry who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. He told colleagues Wednesday on the eve of his appearance before impeachment investigators that he would leave his post.
Mr. Morrison has been weighing leaving the council for some time. He told investigators that he did "not want anyone to think there is a connection between my testimony today and my impending departure."
He was the second White House official to testify before the inquiry this week, following Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a Ukraine expert at the National Security Council.
Mr. Taylor testified last week that Mr. Morrison had informed him in early September of a meeting in Warsaw between Mr. Sondland and a top aide to Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Sondland told the Ukrainian aide that the United States would provide the security assistance package only if Mr. Zelensky committed to investigate allegations related to Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.
Mr. Sondland claimed in testimony that he failed to appreciate that Burisma was directly tied to Hunter Biden.
Mr. Morrison did depart in one respect from that account, telling investigators that he remembered Mr. Sondland's remarks slightly differently. He thought Mr. Sondland said Ukraine's prosecutor general, not Mr. Zelensky, needed to open the inquiry.
Mr. Taylor also testified that, a few days later, Mr. Morrison told him that he had learned of a conversation between Mr. Sondland and Mr. Trump that Mr. Morrison had said gave him a "sinking feeling." In it, Mr. Trump had told Mr. Sondland that he was not asking for a "quid pro quo" from Ukraine, but then went on to "insist" that Mr. Zelensky publicly announce an investigation into both the Bidens and an unproven theory that Democrats had colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 elections.
Mr. Morrison told investigators that he first learned that Mr. Trump and people around him might have motives beyond official United States policy when he took over as senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council from his predecessor, Fiona Hill.
"Dr. Hill told me that Ambassador Sondland and President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, were trying to get President Zelensky to reopen Ukrainian investigations into Burisma," he said. "At the time, I did not know what Burisma was or what the investigation entailed."
He said he later worked to persuade Mr. Trump to release the security aid. Mr. Trump froze the aid in July and kept it that way until September, despite the objections of officials at the Defense and State Departments who viewed it as a crucial resource to help Ukraine in its military conflict with Russia.
"Ambassador Taylor and I were concerned that the longer the money was withheld, the more questions the Zelensky administration would ask about the U.S. commitment to Ukraine," Mr. Morrison said.
Mr. Morrison said he did not have reason to believe Ukraine's leaders knew the aid had been suspended until it was publicly reported at the end of August.

Texto completo: Not even O. Henry could have conceived of a story with this much irony.
The New York Times published an error-riddled opinion article on Oct. 31 attacking Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for refusing to censor error-riddled political content posted by any of the social media website’s estimated one billion active users. In other words, the New York Times failed to fact-check an op-ed complaining about Facebook’s supposed failure to fact-check the world.
At the heart of the op-ed’s complaint is Zuckerberg's assertion that Facebook is not in the business of censoring its users. In fact, the Facebook founder alleged recently to do so would be a violation of the principles of the First Amendment. The author of the New York Times op-ed, none other than The Social Network screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, disagrees. The screenwriter believes that now is the perfect time for massive tech conglomerates headed by people he dislikes personally to start policing online speech.
If only Sorkin had not made so many factual errors in the piece.
His op-ed claimed originally that his Academy Award-winning portrayal of Facebook’s founding was released in 2011. It was not, as a lengthy New York Times editor’s note now clarifies. Sorkin’s movie was released in 2010.
I am not sure how the guy who won an Academy Award for The Social Network screwed that one up, but OK.
The op-ed, titled “Aaron Sorkin: An Open Letter to Mark Zuckerberg,” claimed also, “The law hasn’t been written yet — yet — that holds carriers of user-generated internet content responsible for the user-generated content they carry, just like movie studios, television networks and book, magazine and newspaper publishers.”
Sorkin added, “Ask Peter Thiel, who funded a defamation suit against Gawker that bankrupted the site and forced it to close down. (You should have Mr. Thiel’s number in your phone because he was an early investor in Facebook.)”
This latter part also is not true. The lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker was an “invasion of privacy lawsuit, not a defamation suit,” as the New York Times now notes in its correction of the anti-Zuckerberg op-ed.
Sorkin’s commentary also claimed originally that half of all Americans say their main source of news is Facebook. This is false, according to the New York Times. That number is more like 40%, and those people say only that they get news from Facebook, not that it is their main source.
Lastly, because it is funny, the West Wing creator ends his op-ed with these self-indulgent paragraphs — because he really does not know any other way:
Most people don’t have the resources to employ a battalion of fact checkers. Nonetheless, while testifying before a congressional committee two weeks ago, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked you the following: “Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?” Then, when she pushed you further, asking you if Facebook would or would not take down lies, you answered: “Congresswoman, in most cases, in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves.” Now you tell me. If I’d known you felt that way, I’d have had the Winklevoss twins invent Facebook.
Zuckerberg himself responded Thursday with the following quote from Sorkin’s astonishingly bad 1995 drama The American President:
America isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship. You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say: You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then, you can stand up and sing about the land of the free."
That is going to leave a mark, on both The Social Network screenwriter and the New York Times.
At least we can say now that The Newsroom is no longer the worst thing that Sorkin has inflicted on the American press.

"The Library Book"
by Susan Orlean
Simon & Schuster ($28)
In 1986, a fire at the Los Angeles Public Library consumed 400,000 books and damaged 700,000 more. Over thirty years later, the mystery remains: was this arson? Journalist Susan Orlean investigates the legendary fire. She visits library departments; delves into the evolution of libraries; studies arson and the history of library fires; attempts to burn a copy of a book; and re-examines the case of Harry Peak, long suspected as the arsonist. Along the way, she reveals the importance of these buildings and why we need them.
"Art Matters"
by Neil Gaiman
William Morrow & Co. ($19.99)
"Art Matters: Because Your Imagination Can Change the World" is a timely embodiment of this remarkable multi-media artist's vision—an exploration of how reading, imagining, and creating can transform the world and our lives.

So Albus Dumbledore enlists Newt, who agrees to help once again. This second screenplay from J.K. Rowling, illustrated with art from MinaLima, includes delightful nods to the Harry Potter stories. Ages 10 and up.

by Jessica Townsend
Little, Brown BYR ($17.99)
The heart-pounding sequel to the New York Times best-seller and number 1 Kids' Indie Next Pick "Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow," as heroine Morrigan battles a new evil.

Critics: Plan would undermine third parties

Texto completo: ALBANY - Critics took on a powerful state commission Tuesday for considering a proposal they said would limit or end the influence of minor parties such as the liberal Working Families Party, which has challenged Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic Party he leads.
Nassau County Democratic chairman Jay Jacobs, one of Cuomo's appointees to the Public Financing Commission, proposed changing "fusion voting" to require that political parties attract thousands more voters before they can maintain their permanent line on statewide ballots. The commission could also decide to ban fusion voting, which allows a major party candidate to seek cross-endorsement by a minor party because in New York, all votes count toward the candidate's total. 
The proposal became a hot topic in Buffalo during the fourth and final hearing of the commission.
The panel is charged with developing a voluntary system of using state funds to help pay for political campaigns, but Cuomo and other legislative leaders also tasked the commission with looking at the merits of fusion voting. The system provides the liberal Working Families Party influence with the Democratic Party and the Conservative Party influence with the Republican Party.
Jacobs, however, proposes that minor parties face a much higher bar before they can secure a permanent place on the ballot. He said minor parties should have to attract up to 250,000 votes - five times the current threshold - to qualify for an automatic line on ballots, in a proposal first reported by The New York Times.
That could knock the Working Families Party off the automatic ballot line they've held for decades. In 2018, the Working Families had endorsed activist/actress Cynthia Nixon for governor against Cuomo. Cuomo defeated Nixon in the Democratic primary, but the challenge angered many of his supporters.
In an interview after Tuesday's commission hearing, Jacobs said he's not committed to a 250,000-vote threshold, but minor parties need to attract some higher level of votes to appear on ballots automatically. Without that automatic line, minor parties face an expensive and laborious task of securing petitions statewide to secure a ballot line in each election cycle.
Several speakers at Tuesday's hearing said the proposal is aimed at punishing or eliminating the liberal Working Families Party, which ran a candidate against Cuomo 2018 and has battled with more centrist Democratic Party leaders.
"Fusion voting is basic to our democratic system," said Phil Rumore, the longtime Buffalo Teachers Federation union president and a founding member of the Working Families Party. "Eliminating fusion voters allows the would-be dictators to prevail."
On this point, the Working Families Party members had some unlikely support from state Republican Party Chairman Nick Langworthy.
Cuomo is "extracting retribution on the Working Families Party, who had the audacity to support Cynthia Nixon for governor of New York," Langworthy said at the hearing.
Jacobs denied the effort is aimed at hurting the Working Families Party, which he said has tried to portray him as a tool of Cuomo. Instead, Jacobs said, minor parties need to show they are legitimate forces and that 50,000 votes every two years is too low a bar. He would also require minor parties to meet a new, higher threshold every two years, which could be difficult in an off-year election without any statewide candidates on the ballot.
Cuomo defended the concept Tuesday.
"This is all politics on steroids," Cuomo said at an event in Manhattan. "Everyone has their own politics and are trying to maximize their own political advantage."
The commission plans another meeting Nov. 14 in Westchester as well as another potential meeting Nov. 15. A final meeting is set for Nov. 25. It's report is scheduled to be final on Nov. 27, the day before Thanksgiving, and will become law 20 days later unless the Legislature returns to Albany and changes

The Navy SEALs' crisis of character

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned."
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade – who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times – Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one dealing with posing with a dead body.
According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons." Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond."
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven – the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid – reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

Texto completo: Las autoridades fronterizas estadounidenses arrestaron el año pasado en la frontera a más niños no acompañados que en cualquier otro periodo registrado , según los datos publicados este martes. Esta cantidad supera incluso la alta cifra de menores que, durante la era Obama , trataban de cruzar a tierra estadounidense sin ningún adulto.
Los agentes migratorios capturaron a un total de 76,020 menores -la mayoría centroamericanos – que viajaban sin sus padres en el año fiscal que terminó en septiembre. De acuerdo a la información de la oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés), esta cifra supone un aumento de un 52% respecto al año fiscal anterior.

The New York Times informa de que el crecimiento ha sido parecido en México . El gobierno del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, que encrudeció sus medidas migratorias tras las presiones y amenazas de Donald Trump, detuvo a 40,500 inmigrantes menores que se dirigían al norte sin compañía de adulto alguno. La sumas de las detenciones de niños en ambos países asciende a 115,000.
Casi 25 menores que habían puesto rumbo al norte dijeron en entrevistas con The Times conocer a los peligros que enfrentaban con el viaje y que; si los agarraban; podían acabar hacinados en instalaciones sucias de cualquiera de los dos lados de la frontera. Además, no son ajenos a los agresivos intentos de Trump de bloquear la inmigración que llega por la frontera sur. Aún así, decidieron correr el riesgo para escapar de la pobreza, la falta de oportunidades y violencia .

Texto completo: Over a long weekend recently, you could see three Komische Oper productions by Barrie Kosky, including a new staging of Henze's rarity "The Bassarids."
BERLIN -- Barrie Kosky may be the most interesting opera director of the past decade.
At the Komische Oper Berlin here, where Mr. Kosky has been the artistic director since 2012, he has reintroduced lesser-known pieces to the repertory. But there have been glosses on familiar works, too: a Monteverdi cycle, for example, and a charming take on "The Magic Flute" that has toured the world.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
And he has had successes away from this home base. As the first Jewish director invited to the Bayreuth Festival, Mr. Kosky created a meta version of "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" that placed Wagner himself onstage, held up to scrutiny at the Nuremberg trials. His production of Offenbach's "Orphée aux Enfers," at the Salzburg Festival this summer, Zachary Woolfe wrote in The New York Times, heightened that operetta's cynicism "to preposterous hilarity."
Yet it is here in Berlin where you can binge the capaciousness of his vision. During a long weekend this month, I saw revivals of Mr. Kosky's comedic stagings of Oscar Straus operettas that had been largely neglected before he brought them to the Komische. There was also a coolly visionary new production of Hans Werner Henze's "The Bassarids." (A video of the premiere is available, with English subtitles, at operavision.eu though April 12.)
Henze's 1965 opera, with a haunting English libretto by W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is so rare, any production is welcome. But does an adaptation of Euripides' "The Bacchae" -- the story of a dull king who loses his head to Dionysus -- belong at a comic opera house?
Mr. Kosky has an answer. He keeps the staging austere, as if it were in a Greek amphitheater. And the mood is often serenely surreal -- at least until the production second-guesses Henze by reinserting the opera's Intermezzo, which the composer cut after the world premiere. That section includes teasing, nearly burlesque music that dramatizes the spell-like states of Dionysus' latest cult members, and provides a useful contrast with the choral exclamations and orchestral pandemonium that otherwise lends this work its gravity. (Vladimir Jurowski, conducting the Komische's orchestra, made that satirically minded 1965 Intermezzo work alongside the experimentalism of Henze's final 1992 revision of the rest of the score.)
With a broad, slightly bawdy staging of the Intermezzo -- in which the royal family, under Dionysian sway, plays dress-up and enacts a story about Adonis -- Mr. Kosky allows his audience greater access to the human hallucinations that presage the opera's bloody climax. Mortals, he seems to say, are predisposed to dreams, and thus to the irrational; only a slight push is needed. Dionysus' task, then, is all too easy: When King Pentheus joins the cult, wearing one of his mother's dresses, it makes more sense abstractly than matter-of-factly, as it is in the version without the Intermezzo.
At the performance I saw, the tenor Sean Panikkar was powerful yet sometimes honeyed as Dionysus. The German mezzo-soprano Tanja Ariane Baumgartner's English wasn't always clear, but as King Pentheus' mother, Agave, her creamy sound had no trouble inhabiting the character's states of arrogance, inebriation and horror. They joined a cast that included several Komische veterans -- including the punchy bass of Jens Larsen as Cadmus; the oaky baritone of Günter Papendell as Pentheus; and the laser-beam soprano of Vera-Lotte Boecker, playing the king's aunt.
Also on offer was athletic dancing -- appropriate in the context both of Henze's opera, and of the Komische, which specializes in operettas, like Straus's 1923 "The Pearls of Cleopatra," that make generous use of Weimar-era strut and sizzle.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Dagmar Manzel, reprising the role of Cleopatra this month, indulged cabaret textures, like the use of arid exhalations for the character's vamping put-ons. (Amplification helped every dramatic rasp hit the back row.) She also has more bell-like notes, fit for exultation, though, and smoky timbres full of irony.
The contrast between those modes was heightened even more during Ms. Manzel's performance in Straus's "A Woman Who Knows What She Wants!," from 1932. Though this production was radically spare -- consisting of only a single wall and door -- it was the highest-energy offering of the weekend. Ms. Manzel and her co-star, Max Hopp, executed the central conceit of Mr. Kosky's staging: two singers playing all the roles in a tale set backstage at a theater. (Each singer dived out of sight just long enough to put on a new costume before reappearing.)
Straus composed "A Woman" around the time he was writing soundtracks for the filmmaker Ernst Lubitsch. Among his Hollywood contributions was music for the tune "Jazz Up Your Lingerie," from "The Smiling Lieutenant."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Bernard Grun's biography of the composer, "Prince of Vienna," explains how, despite Straus's admiration for American musical forms, he didn't think he would ever write a great jazz song. Even so, the push and pull of tempos throughout the Komische's production of "A Woman," conducted by Adam Benzwi, brought to mind some theatrical numbers by Harlem stride pianists.
Ms. Manzel used the varying speeds to find even more moods in this Straus operetta than she had in "Cleopatra." Most moving was her character's sense of impending obsolescence, whenever the music slowed down a bit. (You can hear that same dramatic acuity in her 2014 album for Deutsche Grammophon, mostly devoted to the songs of Friedrich Hollaender.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This three-night run -- a journey from the bittersweet in "A Woman," to the tragic in "The Bassarids" and the comic in "Cleopatra" -- was a testament to the house Mr. Kosky has built in his time with the Komische. Lots of directors take chances. And plenty like a variety of musical styles. But what makes a Kosky production come across is the execution: joyful, rigorous.
Mr. Kosky steps into the less-demanding role of Hausregisseur, starting with the 2022-23 season. (In that post, he'll direct two productions per season, for a five-year term.) But, while opera fans can, they should make the trip to Berlin to take in the best of his work so far -- starting with the Komische Oper Festival next summer.

Texto completo: A guitarist and singer, Mr. Barrere also wrote or co-wrote some of the critically acclaimed band's best-known songs.
Paul Barrere, a guitarist, singer and songwriter best known for his long tenure with the rock band Little Feat, formed in 1969 and known for its distinctive blend of musical influences, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 71.
The band announced his death, at U.C.L.A. Medical Center, on its website. No cause was given, but Mr. Barrere had learned a few years ago that he had liver cancer.
Little Feat never reached the upper echelons of rock stardom and never had a hit single. But it became a staple on album-oriented FM rock radio with infectious songs like "Dixie Chicken" and "Sailin' Shoes," and it attracted both critical acclaim and a fiercely loyal following.
The band's sound was distinctive, if hard to categorize -- it mixed, Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote in 1991, "New Orleans rhythm and blues, country, hard rock, and touches of funk and jazz."
Mr. Barrere was not an original member; he had auditioned as a bassist when the band was being formed but was passed over for Roy Estrada -- who, like the band's lead singer, lead guitarist and chief songwriter, Lowell George, had worked with Frank Zappa. (The other original members were the keyboardist Bill Payne and the drummer Richie Hayward, who died in 2010.) "As a bassist," Mr. Barrere later said, "I make an excellent guitarist."
After Mr. Estrada left the band in 1972, it grew from a quartet to a sextet with the addition of Mr. Barrere on rhythm guitar and vocals as well as Kenny Gradney on bass and Sam Clayton on percussion. The reconstituted Little Feat incorporated a strong dose of New Orleans funk into what had been essentially a country-rock approach. The resulting sound, as captured on the new lineup's first album, "Dixie Chicken" (1973), won the band a legion of new fans, although chart success remained elusive.
Mr. Barrere wrote or co-wrote some of Little Feat's best-known songs, including "All That You Dream," "Time Loves a Hero" and "Old Folks Boogie." He occasionally sang lead, although Mr. George remained the band's focal point. Mr. George died in 1979, and Little Feat broke up that year.
Mr. Barrere went on to work with the group the Bluesbusters and recorded two albums as a leader, but he was largely inactive until Little Feat reunited in 1987. To fill the gap left by Mr. George's death, the band added two members, and Mr. Barrere began doing more of the lead singing and songwriting, as well as taking more of the guitar solos.
Little Feat has remained together ever since, with relatively few changes in personnel, and recently toured in celebration of its 50th anniversary. Mr. Barrere did not take part in the tour but had said that he hoped to rejoin the band next year.
Paul Barrere was born in Burbank, Calif., on July 3, 1948. His parents, Paul and Claudia Barrere, were actors who both worked under the professional name Bryar.
His survivors include his wife, Pam, and three children, Gabriel, Genevieve and Gillian.
"I think that the main thing about Little Feat," Mr. Barrere told the website Best Classic Bands this year, "is that it's been described as a musicians' band. And the most important part of it is the music itself."
Elaborating on the band's freewheeling approach to improvisation, he added: "The opportunities are endless as far as soloing. The arrangements pretty much stay the same, but not exactly the same. I think it's a testament to the fact that all the cats can play."

Texto completo: Un funcionario de seguridad nacional de la Casa Blanca dará declarará este martes ante los legisladores que investigan el impeachment a presidente Donald Trump. El alto cargo, un veterano de la guerra de Irak, escuchó la llamada de Trump al presidente ucraniano y advirtió de a su superior que el mandatario estadounidense había solicitado a su homólogo ucraniano algo “perjudicial para los intereses estadounidenses” .
Según adelantó The New York Times, que tuvo acceso a un borrador de la declaración, el teniente coronel Alexander S. Vindman escuchó a Trump pedir al ucraniano Vlodymyr Zelensky que investigara a uno de sus principales rivales políticos .
El veterano, que es el máximo experto en Ucrania que hay en el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, notificó en dos ocasiones el modo en el que Trump y su círculo más cercano estaba tratando a Ucrania . El documento al que accedió el Times señala que el comportamiento del gobierno carece de lo que Vindman considera “sentido del deber” .
El teniente coronel sera el primer cargo de la Casa Blanca que escuchó la conversación entre Trump y Zelensky el 25 de julio y que testificará ante el equipo encargado de la investigación que puede llevar al presidente a un juicio político. La llamada entre ambos mandatarios es precisamente la razón que llevó a la presidenta de la Cámara Baja, Nancy Pelosi, a anunciar el inicio del proceso contra Trump. Sin embargo, la Casa Blanca había anunciado que no participaría en la consulta .
“Pensé que no era apropiado exigir que un gobierno extranjero investigue a un ciudadano estadounidense y estaba preocupado por las consecuencias [que tendría sobre] el apoyo del gobierno estadounidense a Ucrania”, dice el coronel Vindman en su declaración. En la llamada que escuchó, Trump presionó a Zelensky para que ordenara una investigación a Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter por los negocios que este último tenía en su país.
“Me di cuenta de que si Ucrania realizaba una investigación sobre los Biden y Burisma, probablemente se interpretaría como una táctica partidista “, continúa explicando el veterano. En su texto, Vindman hace hincapié en que su preocupación era que este país del este de Europa perdiera el apoyo de los partidos republicano y demócrata “que hasta ahora ha mantenido”.
En agosto, publica el Times, a petición de sus superiores en el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, el coronel redactó un memorando para reiniciar la ayuda de seguridad que EEUU había retenido de Ucrania, pero Trump se negó a firmarlo.

IT'S 'JUSTICE' FOR ISIS SCUM; Trump reveals the end of 'whimpering,' trapped terror chief Baghdadi in U.S. takedown

Texto completo: President Trump on Sunday announced the bloody takedown of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a U.S. military operation in Syria that cornered the terror lord in an underground tunnel, where he detonated a suicide vest that killed him and three children.
"Last night, the United States brought the world's No. 1 terrorist leader to justice," Trump said from the Diplomatic Room at the White House just before 9:30 a.m.
"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead."
Trump said Baghdadi was chased into a "dead-end tunnel" by dogs, including one who was injured.
Baghdadi was "whimpering and screaming and crying all the way," claimed Trump, who watched the operation live in the White House Situation Room on Saturday night with several senior officials and military leaders.
At least 50 soldiers reportedly led by members of the army's elite Delta Force landed from helicopters and blew holes into the side of Baghdadi's ISIS compound to avoid known booby traps, in a raid the president marveled was "as though you were watching a movie."
Baghdadi's body was mutilated by the blast and subsequent tunnel cave-in, but he was positively confirmed by DNA as the target of the raid.
"He spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him," Trump said.
"Baghdadi's demise demonstrates America's relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders and our enduring commitment" to the defeat of ISIS," Trump said. "These savage monsters will not escape their fate and they will not escape the final judgment of God."
No U.S. service members were killed in the raid, which was reminiscent of when Navy SEALs in 2011 took out Al Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan during the Obama administration.
The initial tip that helped track down Baghdadi in a village in northwestern Syria controlled by rival Al Qaeda groups came from one of his wives and a courier arrested and questioned over the summer, The New York Times reported, citing two unnamed American officials.
Armed with that tip, the CIA worked with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials in Iraq and Syria to pinpoint his precise hideout, the Times reported.
Trump kept House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other congressional leaders in the dark about the Saturday night operation.
The president, the subject of an impeachment inquiry by Democratic-led House committees into the White House withholding military aid to Ukraine, appeared to suggest the congressional leaders couldn't be trusted.
"Washington leaks like I've never seen before," Trump said at the White House. "There's no country in the world that leaks like we do. And Washington is a leaking machine. And I told my people, we will not notify them until our great people are out - not just in, but out. I don't want to have them greeted with firepower like you wouldn't believe."
Trump declined to reveal his full contact list, but said he was in touch with at least Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) before he spoke Sunday morning.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, lamented the break in past protocol of alerting the House speaker and minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees.
"In terms of notifying the Gang of 8, that wasn't done," Schiff said.
In a question period, Trump also conceded he intends to secure Syrian oil fields.
"The oil is so valuable for many reasons," he said. "It fueled ISIS, No. 1. No. 2, it helps the Kurds, because it's basically been taken away from the Kurds. And No. 3, it can help us. We should be able to keep some also."
The U.S. "may have to fight for the oil," he added. "It's OK." Anyone trying to take the oil will have a "helluva fight" on their hands, he vowed.
Baghdadi, who took command of ISIS in 2010 and has been in hiding for five years, hasn't been seen publicly since July 2014 when he spoke in Mosul, Iraq. Multiple reports alleged that Baghdadi had been injured during various strikes over the years, but most were unconfirmed.
Diane Foley, the mother of James Foley, a 40-year-old journalist in Syria who was kidnapped and beheaded by ISIS militants in 2014 as the first American killed by the terrorist organization, said she was "grateful" to the president and "brave troops."
"I hope this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups and pray that captured ISIS fighters will be brought to trial and held accountable," she told CBS.
Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, called it a joint operation.
"Successful & historical operation due to joint intelligence work with the United States of America," he tweeted Sunday morning.
Trump said Baghdadi had been under surveillance for "a couple weeks" before Saturday's raid.
Several plans were scrapped before the final assault on the compound.
"He died like a dog. He died like a coward," Trump said. "The world is now a much safer place."
During the raid, U.S. Special Forces were also able to retrieve documents and other information from Baghdadi's compound that Trump said will help determine future ISIS plans.
"Today's events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists until their brutal end," he said. "Baghdadi and the losers that work for him, and losers they are, had no idea what they were getting into."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Tall grasses glow in the afternoon sunlight. The last bees and butterflies of the season hover over goldenrod and asters. Silver orbs that look like alien spacecraft shimmer nearby.
The wild-looking meadow is not in a rural outpost but sandwiched between a sewage plant - the orbs are the tanks - and a parking lot packed with tractor-trailers. The plants perch on the roof of a film studio in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, beside a Superfund toxic-waste site.
As bird and insect populations plummet, sounding new alarms about the health of the natural world, one promising arena where humans can help is also a surprising one: cities. In New York, scientists and officials are calling for residents and companies to do their part, with projects as ambitious as the rooftop meadow and as simple as choosing native plants for home window boxes.
For some species, scientists say, cities can be more hospitable than rural and suburban areas because fewer lawns and farms mean fewer pesticides. The green roof in Brooklyn, Kingsland Wildflowers at Broadway Stages, draws endangered monarch butterflies, a panoply of birds and wild bees that are native to New York City but threatened by what scientists have called an “insect apocalypse.”
Measures to help wildlife survive in, and migrate through, cities overlap with those needed to protect people from the effect of climate change and the related flooding.
Green roofs like the one in Greenpoint, for instance, are expected to multiply under a city law that is set to take effect next month and will require new buildings to be topped with green spaces or solar panels. Either measure can help reduce carbon emissions and rising temperatures; green roofs also reduce stormwater runoff. The 730 green roofs in New York cover just 60 of the city’s 40,000 rooftop acres, according to the Green Roof Researchers Alliance.
“Cities have so much potential for creating natural habitats,” said Alixandra Prybyla, science director for the Honeybee Conservancy, a group that is expanding its activities to include the protection of wild bees.
There are 2.9 billion fewer birds in the United States and Canada than there were 50 years ago. Over 20 years, America’s monarch butterfly population has declined 90%, and the number of bumblebees has dropped nearly as much. The declines could be a harbinger of broader ecological collapse, and the disappearance of pollinating creatures threatens the food supply.
But in the same way that “wildlife corridors” created by countries like Indonesia and India have helped protect large animals like tigers, smaller spaces in cities can be corridors and archipelagoes of green space for birds and insects.
Much of New York City’s potential in this regard remains untapped, experts say. But the law taking effect next month could change that.
With it, New York will join cities like Chicago, Denver and San Francisco, which use requirements or tax incentives to promote the development of green roofs. New York state also recently increased the value of the tax abatements it offers for such roofs in some city neighborhoods.
Real estate groups argue that requiring green roofs is too expensive and burdensome for property owners. The solution that environmental activists consider ideal - charging properties for the amount of stormwater runoff they produce and creating incentives for installing green roofs to reduce such runoff - is often called a “rain tax” by opponents.
New Yorkers often think of animals in the city as out of place, if not nuisances, like the swarm of bees that divebombed Times Square in summer 2018. People also tend to view cityscapes mainly as obstacles for wild species, like the birds that get stuck circling the Sept. 11 tribute lights.
But many animals thrive in urban settings, adapting to them over generations, or using them creatively, like Prybyla’s favorite, a hive of honeybees that started producing red honey. It turned out that the bees had discovered vats of red syrup in a maraschino cherry factory in Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood.
“We want to challenge what people think belongs in an urban ecosystem,” said Guillermo Fernandez, the Honeybee Conservancy’s executive director. “People think only the hardiest rat or pigeon could live in our city, but then we start hearing about hawks and even sometimes deer and coyotes roaming through.”
The Greenpoint project can have a calming effect on humans, too. School visits, community science projects and parties regularly bring workers and residents to the roofs.

Texto completo: For the last five weeks, the British actress and playwright Zawe Ashton has been zipping back and forth between West 45th Street and Lower Manhattan. She has gone from speaking the words of her character Emma in an acclaimed Broadway revival of Harold Pinter's "Betrayal" to watching her own words brought to life by a cast of others in her play "for all the women who thought they were Mad" at Soho Rep.
"It's like doing a boxing match and then swimming the Channel," she joked recently over breakfast at a French cafe in Chelsea, dressed stylishly in a black dress with luminescent buttons and billowing sleeves, her glasses perched carefully on her nose.
Everything seems to be falling into place for Ashton, who also released her first book this year and starred with Jake Gyllenhaal in the dark art-world satire "Velvet Buzzsaw."
Her play, which began previews the same day it opened at the Hackney Showroom in London, has its New York premiere on Oct. 27 and has already been extended. But the moment was a long time coming.
Ashton, who grew up in London and whose mother moved from Uganda to England as a teenager, wrote "for all the women" 11 years ago, when she was just 24. She delivered the draft by hand to the Royal Court Theater, the culmination of her participation in the theater's young writers program. But the experimental play has had multiple starts and stops since then.
It features a constellation of women ranging in age from 8 to 65, and is based on months of research Ashton did on the myriad ways the British health system has failed black women, particularly when it comes to mental health and overmedication.
The career-focused protagonist, Joy, begins to fall apart after witnessing a woman falling past a window, presumably to her death.
Joy soon starts taking pills prescribed by a doctor. The other women surrounding her are a mixture of contemporary and ancestral voices. At times they serve as a kind of African-inspired chorus, interjecting and instructing Joy; their poetic text is influenced by Ugandan lullabies among other sources.
The script, though set in Britain, feels relevant in the United States in light of recent disturbing data about black women's health, including their significantly high maternal mortality risk.
Ashton is both accepting and frustrated by the decade that it took for the play to find a home.
"When I'm thinking about it in the most positive way possible," she said, "I believe it had to brew and had to find its time and find its zeitgeist and find its conversation, which is very much a conversation that's happening now in the U.S. in regards to the black female body."
"And then when I'm more my cynical 35-year-old self, I wish this could have just been produced earlier, at its most pure. Because it's had a lot of face-lifts, it's been handed around to many theatrical institutions and brilliant minds and it has changed a lot on the way."
She went on: "Everyone has wanted to make this play make much more sense. They wanted to turn it into a much more linear and literal document and that was never what it was. My 24-year-old self wrote it in 24 hours. I don't say that in a boastful way -- I say it as an invitation to understand what it's like when things you've deeply intuited for a long time, even as a young person, are suddenly unlocked. That's what happens when you are 24. You get married in a night -- you break up in a night -- you change countries in a night. "
She declined to offer too direct a connection between the material and her own experiences, but admitted she was influenced by women she has known and said the voices of the characters had been floating in her head for some time.
The nonlinear, destabilizing nature of the piece appealed to Sarah Benson, the artistic director of Soho Rep, which regularly takes chances on formally experimental works, recently including "Fairview," which won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in drama.
"It can only happen in theatrical form, this melding of content," Benson said. "She's making vivid something that black women have experienced for decades."
Whitney White, who is directing the Soho Rep production, said the play's abstractions make sense for the current moment in New York theater.
"Refracted black conscience is hot right now," she said. "New writers, emerging writers are chopping and screwing all our lives, and spewing it out in an interesting, visceral way."
White said that often black women who are misdiagnosed or overprescribed drugs don't report what they're going through and can be demonized by the medical field. "There's stigma. It's unfortunate and it's real and it happens," she said.
Even as Ashton gets ready for her own play's debut, she is still performing eight times a week in "Betrayal," where Ben Brantley in The New York Times praised her "breakout" turn as a vulnerable, world-weary wife caught in a love triangle between her husband (Tom Hiddleston) and his best friend (Charlie Cox).
Despite the intense schedule, Ashton said she's finding strength and inspiration in Pinter.
"He's not concerned with the truth, necessarily, in art and I love that," she said. "You're supposed to stumble across it in the dark every night. Good writing shouldn't be wrapped in cellophane. It should be open to the elements and full of maggots and it should be left to grow and deepen and fester. I hang on to that."
In New York, she has found rare moments of solace wandering Chelsea and the halls of the Guggenheim, spending time with the Basquiats. She sees herself aligned "with the poets or the writers during the jazz era, more improvisational, truly collaborative. I'm in a nostalgic place, and I'm in America trying to figure it out."
Lingering after breakfast, Ashton said she finally knows herself well enough to trust her instincts. No longer does she believe, she said, that there can be real distance between the person and the creative artist.
"It's closed up since I've gotten older.," she explained. "I can't be in a situation where I feel distanced, othered, underrepresented, cross-questioned, put down, unseen as a person or as an artist and pretend that I will be O.K. That's suppression I have released myself from."
Finally seeing her play onstage is part of that release. "Eleven years of this group of women in this play not having an audience to commune with has been a phantom limb," she said. "I can't wait to see it soar or fail. I just need to see it."

Texto completo: On Oct. 26, 1958, Pan American World Airways made the first commercial nonstop flight from New York to Paris. A marching band played John Philip Sousa as guests boarded the plane, where 111 passengers supped on cuisine from Maxim's in Paris. Twenty-five years later, the airline commemorated the voyage by inviting celebrities like Eartha Kitt and the boxing champ Floyd Patterson to Paris in one of the original Boeing 707 jets. Once there, the crew was feted at a party.
Pan Am went out of business in 1991. But for many, it is still synonymous with luxury air travel. And while the 1958 journey was not the first trans-Atlantic flight by an airline, it was perhaps the most significant, according to news reports at the time. Pan Am helped usher in the era of commercial jet travel with daily flights to London and Paris that ultimately made it easy for tourists -- not just wealthy patrons -- to see the world.
"It was a game changer," said Gabriella Williams, a librarian at the University of Miami who oversees the digitization of one of the largest collections of Pan Am brochures, magazines, advertising and financial reports. "More people could afford to get on planes. The dawn of the jet age implemented economy class."
Pan Am's status as a cultural icon persists nearly three decades after the airline collapsed under crushing debt. There are Pan Am items for sale on eBay, including travel bags, cutlery and captain's wings. It continues to be memorialized in television, movies and documentaries. The Pan Am Historical Foundation offers travel tours to Morocco, Iran and Egypt.
Ms. Williams said half the visits to the university's special collections libraries, where the Pan Am catalog is housed, were from people interested in the airline.
"The brand, at one point, was the biggest in the world," she said.
Pan Am flew its first international flight in October 1927, and went on to become the most recognizable American airline, known for elegant service, dashing pilots and adventurous travel. Earlier that year, Pan Am's founder, Juan T. Trippe, had merged three airlines to form the company after receiving a contract from the United States Postal Service to deliver mail between Key West, Fla., and Havana. Pan Am delivered 250 pounds of mail to Cuba on its first trip. Within a year, it would establish regular service to the island nation.
Trippe had a flair for marketing and public relations. In 1928, he hired the pilot Charles Lindbergh, who had become world famous a year earlier when he made the first solo nonstop flight between New York and Paris, as a consultant. Lindbergh was to explore new routes in South America, Europe and Africa for the airline. By the early 1930s, Pan Am had expanded service throughout the Caribbean and Latin America.
Pan Am acquired China Airways Federal in 1933, which allowed the airline to expand into China. That year, Trippe, who was born in 1899 in Sea Bright, N.J., the son of an investment banker, was featured on the cover of Time. But air travel was expensive then, mostly for business executives and the well-to-do. Airlines sought to differentiate themselves with first-class service, not with low fares, as airlines do nowadays. Consider this: The 1958 flight to Paris cost economy-class passengers $ 489.60, or about $ 4,350 today.
"They competed by who offered the most frills," Ms. Williams said.
That meant a large part of the population was forced to stay home. Edward S. Trippe, Juan Trippe's son, recalled his first 14-hour flight to Europe on a DC-6, an airplane made by the Douglas Aircraft Company. "It was all first-class," said Mr. Trippe, who is the chairman of the Pan Am Historical Foundation. "We slept in bunks we pulled down above our seats. It was a luxury event."
It was in 1958, though, that his father and airline executives embarked on what would become the golden era of jet travel, fueled, in large part, by new technology that made it possible to fly long stretches without having to refuel. In 1955, Pan Am purchased a number of Boeing 707s, the first commercially successful airliners to be manufactured. Mr. Trippe said his father wanted to open up international markets and lower airfares.
"He wanted a new generation who were able to see where their ancestors were born," Mr. Trippe said. "Pan Am had an international character. Its whole image was London, Hawaii, Africa, Japan, Rome. The advertising conjured up these images. You could go there."
Pan Am was later beset by troubles. High fuel prices in the 1970s hobbled the industry. In 1988, a bomb exploded on a trans-Atlantic flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 people onboard. The company declared bankruptcy in 1991.
The flight on Oct. 26, 1958, took more than seven hours. It had been scheduled to continue on to Rome after Paris, but was canceled after the Italian government imposed a new surcharge on jet airfares, according to an article in The New York Times. Of the success of the New York-to-Paris flight, The Times said, "A long procession of commercial jet flights is lining up behind it."
Mr. Trippe was on the 25th-anniversary flight. He said he remembered seeing the actress Maureen O'Hara, who later owned her own seaplane company, aboard the plane. "The jet age propelled us into a new era," he said. "It shrunk the world."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A top diplomat told impeachment investigators on Saturday that he repeatedly pressed top State Department leaders, in vain, to defend the United States ambassador to Ukraine in the face of false attacks that he said were orchestrated by the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The account by Philip T. Reeker, the acting assistant secretary in charge of European and Eurasian Affairs, underscored the bewilderment in American diplomatic ranks over the State Department's decision in May to recall Marie L. Yovanovitch, a highly respected career diplomat and the top American official in Ukraine, months before her term was up.
Mr. Reeker's testimony, which lasted about eight hours and was delivered behind closed doors, also showcased the degree to which senior State Department officials were aware that Mr. Giuliani, who had no formal government role, was an important player on issues involving Ukraine.
But Mr. Reeker shed little light on the question at the heart of the impeachment inquiry: whether President Trump pressured the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for his own political gain, according to several people familiar with his testimony.
Another key diplomat testified this week that Mr. Trump had withheld an Oval Office meeting and $ 391 million worth of military aid in an effort to force Ukraine to publicly announce that his country was investigating Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Ukraine desperately needed the aid, which had been approved by Congress, to fight pro-Russian forces waging a separatist war in eastern Ukraine.
But Mr. Reeker, a meticulous if plodding witness who showed up with and repeatedly referred to a thick binder of documents, testified that he had not been privy to those discussions. "An honest assessment by both sides is that there were no aha moments for either side," Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, said outside the closed hearing room in the bowels of the Capitol.
The unusual weekend interview suggested the fast-moving impeachment inquiry could be accelerating as it enters its second month. House Democrats have scheduled six more depositions with potentially consequential witnesses in the coming week. They plan to conduct more than one interview a day in an effort to clear the way for public hearings later this year.
Democrats have been under intense pressure from Republicans accusing them of hiding the proceedings from the public. But the three committees leading the inquiry were encouraged by a federal judge's ruling on Friday that the inquiry was legally legitimate and that, despite recent precedent, it was not necessary for the full House to vote to authorize it.
Nonetheless, stronger resistance may be in the offing as the inquiry edges toward Mr. Trump's inner circle. Investigators have subpoenaed Charles M. Kupperman, Mr. Trump's former deputy national security adviser, to testify Monday.
After the White House said it would invoke a legal claim of absolute immunity to block Mr. Kupperman's testimony, Mr. Kupperman filed a lawsuit, asking a federal judge to rule on the matter. Other senior White House officials could follow suit.
In a terse letter sent Saturday to Mr. Kupperman's lawyers, Democrats said the House did not recognize the White House's legal claims as legitimate. They ordered Mr. Kupperman to testify on Monday or risk adding to evidence that Mr. Trump is obstructing Congress and should be held in contempt.
Mr. Trump continued on Saturday to rail against the inquiry, dismissing it on Twitter as "just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it." He also claimed that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader who initiated the impeachment inquiry in September, was neglecting her San Francisco district, which he described as a hellscape of environmental and sanitary violations.
Mr. Reeker's testimony on Saturday was the latest by roughly a dozen witnesses, many of whom were ordered by the administration not to cooperate but confronted with subpoenas complied anyway.
Mr. Reeker took charge of the State Department's activities in Europe and Eurasia this March, dividing his time between Washington and Europe. A 27-year veteran of the foreign service, he had been posted around the world, including in Iraq, Germany, Italy, Hungary and Macedonia. Friends described him as a consummate diplomat, who, as one put it, "never says any word more or any word less than he should."
Mr. Reeker testified that it was immediately clear to him that President Trump had been relying on two other officials to carry out his policy toward Ukraine: Gordon D. Sondland, a Republican fund-raiser who had been named ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine. Mr. Sondland was one of seven ambassadors who reported to Mr. Reeker.
Mr. Reeker also testified that he understood that Ms. Yovanovitch, the ambassador in Kiev and a longtime colleague, was under attack by Mr. Giuliani and his allies. Among their accusations, the ambassador's critics claimed that she was disloyal to the president -- charges that Mr. Reeker considered completely spurious.
In a March 31 email obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Reeker told T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, an adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that casting Ms. Yovanovitch as a "liberal outpost" was a "fake narrative" that "really is without merit or validation."
Mr. Reeker testified that he pressed both Mr. Brechbuhl and David Hale, the third-ranking State Department official, to release a public statement supporting Ms. Yovanovitch. An administrative aide later informed him that no statement would be issued.
Mr. Reeker also supported a subsequent unsuccessful effort by a senior State Department diplomat, Michael McKinley, to issue a public statement in support of Ms. Yovanovitch when details about her ouster became public this fall. Mr. McKinley told congressional investigators this month that he resigned as a senior adviser to Mr. Pompeo partly because the department's leaders failed to defend Ms. Yovanovitch in the face of false accusations.
Although he did not interact directly with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Reeker testified that he had been aware of his role in pushing out Ms. Yovanovitch, according to one person familiar with his account. But he did not complain directly to Mr. Pompeo, that person said.
Mr. Reeker's testimony followed a gripping account this week from William B. Taylor Jr., who took over as the top American diplomat in Ukraine after Ms. Yovanovitch left. Mr. Taylor testified that Mr. Sondland told him Mr. Trump had refused to release the military aid or meet with the Ukrainian leader until Mr. Zelensky announced that the Biden family was under investigation.
Hunter Biden, the son of the former vice president who hopes to challenge Mr. Trump for the White House next year, served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Mr. Trump also wanted Ukraine to investigate whether the country had helped Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016.

Texto completo: As an undergrad at Harvard, Stephen Norberg's idea of fun was a keg party - with root-beer-filled kegs. Home-schooled in a small town in Missouri, he was never a huge drinker, and his keggers were an attempt, he says, to create "an alternative to alcohol to reduce peer pressure to drink by underage students." After graduating in 2006, he moved to Washington and decided to "pursue my dream of creating my own unique and delicious root beer."
Soon, he was manufacturing and bottling his craft soda out of TasteLab, a food incubator in Northeast Washington. He named his start-up Thunder Beast, a term for bison among Plains Indians, who made a sassafras drink that was a precursor to root beer. Norberg developed more root beer flavors as well as a cream soda, and started selling his drinks in Harris Teeter and other stores in four states and the District.
But this quirky, entrepreneurial story took a bizarre and nightmarish turn in early 2016 when Thunder Beast landed in the crosshairs of Monster Beverage Corp., an energy drink manufacturer worth $32 billion that claims to make "the meanest energy drink on the planet," geared to "athletes, musicians, anarchists, coeds, road warriors, metal heads, geeks, hipsters, and bikers." It's also known in the intellectual property trade press as the world's biggest "trademark bully," which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) defines as "a trademark owner that uses its trademark rights to harass and intimidate another business beyond what the law might be reasonably interpreted to allow."
Monster Energy Co., a subsidiary of Monster Beverage, has a trademark for "Monster Energy," its core line of drinks; for its slogan "Unleash the beast"; and for its logo of a letter "m" drawn with a claw. The company petitioned the USPTO to cancel Norberg's trademark registration for Thunder Beast, arguing that its name is too similar to Monster's slogan and would confuse consumers.
In protest, Thunder Beast started using the phrase "Fight monsters" on its website and on its bottles. Norberg also retained Eve Brown, a Boston attorney who has represented eight other businesses targeted by Monster. Her first client was MonsterFishKeepers, a group for fish hobbyists that Monster Energy said used a logo that looked too similar to its claw mark. MonsterFishKeepers was able to keep its name but lost the right to its logo. Her other clients include Brad Eastman, who used his first initial and last name - Beastman - as a name for his tea company, and B-52s lead singer Fred Schneider, who has marketed coffee called Monster Blend. Those cases are pending. In total, Monster has initiated over 1,000 trademark cases that have either gone to court or been reviewed by USPTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, according to the agency.
Monster Energy's lawyers did not return phone and email requests for comment about the Thunder Beast case. But Lynda Zadra-Symes, a partner with its longtime law firm, Knobbe Martens, said in a 2018 case against a Florida company selling Monster Mobile auto tools: "Monster's strong intellectual property rights transcend energy drinks and are enforceable against a broad spectrum of goods."
Monster Energy doesn't always win. It unsuccessfully went after the NBA's Toronto Raptors for using a clawed-up basketball as its logo, and Disney for its 2013 film "Monsters University." But the company frequently still gets what it wants. The cost of litigation was too much for Justin Drazin, author of "Albert and the Amazing Pillow Monsters," an illustrated book for kids ages 3 to 8, intended to allay fears of the dark. "I had to bow to their demands," Drazin told me. "I had written a second and third book in the series, but they were never published because of the Monster debacle." Monster had argued his book's title was too similar to the drink company's name.
Monster is not alone in its zealous approach to trademark protection. Apple Inc. has claimed trademark infringement by a sandwich shop, an Ohio accounting business and a pencil maker. Trademark bullying is pervasive enough that, in 2010, President Barack Obama signed legislation mandating a Commerce Department study of the practice. But the resulting report, which cited Monster's unsuccessful claim against a Vermont brewery, failed to come up with meaningful recommendations, and "not much has been done since the report was issued," says Victoria Phillips, co-founder of an intellectual-property law clinic at American University's Washington College of Law. "Trademark enforcement is important to protect businesses," she adds. "It's only when there's overreach by companies that it becomes a problem."
For Norberg, his battle with Monster is far from over. Last year, just before the trademark office was expected to rule on Monster's case against Thunder Beast, Monster withdrew its petition and filed a separate lawsuit against Thunder Beast in California for alleged "fraudulent and malicious" conduct that it claimed resulted in "irreparable injury." In its complaint, Monster argues that Norberg intentionally tried to mislead the public and that the phrase "Fight monsters" is also trademark infringement; the company is demanding not-yet-specified monetary damages.
At an August hearing in the case in Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge André Birotte Jr. told Monster's attorney: "I don't know why we're here, other than you're trying to crush this root beer company out of business." Birotte had sent the case to mediation in May, but the two sides remained far apart. He sent them back for a second round of mediation in October. Norberg expects that to fail, and a trial is scheduled for January.
For Monster, all this legal wrangling may just be the cost of doing business. But for the soft-spoken Norberg, it has had a much darker, more personal effect. "I expected the legal battle to be challenging, but nothing really prepared me for it," he told me. "I've taken out loans and sold equipment. Money I would have invested in product development and marketing has been spent to defend myself. My marriage has been overshadowed by this desperate struggle. On a bad day, this feels crushing and hopeless." So far, he has spent $65,000 on legal bills, more than his profits from the past three years.
Nonetheless, Norberg is philosophical. "Trademark bullying is part of a much larger problem in our culture," he says. "Bullying happens whenever someone with power decides that they can take something from someone they deem weaker than themselves. So, I really want my legal battle to count for something, and I hope I can join others to be part of a larger discussion about flaws in our current legal system and how we can help small businesses who are being bullied."

Heisler: Lakers have hopes, but Clippers are seeing dreams come true

Texto completo: We’re off and running in the capital of professional basketball.
It’s not just local fans who think that way with the Lakers back … they hope … and the Clippers at unprecedented heights of expectation.
All NBA metrics point this way. So many media outlets have moved correspondents here, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay called Los Angeles “the Hemingway’s Paris of NBA dorks.”
Meanwhile, StubHub listed the leaue’s most in-demand teams, which started with:
1. Lakers.
2. Clippers.
As it turned out when No. 1 played No. 2, it was no contest. The opener was a Clippers home game – and one of the most eagerly awaited in franchise history – but so many Lakers fans bought up the place, TNT’s Reggie Miller guessed they made up two-thirds of the crowd.
When the Clippers brought Kawhi Leonard out before tipoff to welcome the crowd, there were audible jeers.
Leonard already knew the deal here. When he was shown on the Jumbotron at a recent Rams game, he was booed a lot more loudly there.
Not that hurt feelings proved a problem. Kawhi outscored the supposed prince of the city, LeBron James, 30-18, as the Clippers eased to a 112-102 victory.
James sniffed afterward, “It’s not a rivalry,” which is correct. The teams are playing for an NBA title, not local bragging rights, which are soon forgotten, even if it wasn’t the most gracious thing Bron could have said under the circumstances.
Of course, it’s a good thing for the Lakers it’s not a rivalry because they’d be losing it, having gone 5-24 against their crosstown, uh, neighbors since the start of the 2012-13 season – so long ago that Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard were here.
Last week’s handful of games is, of course, only that, offering no proofs.
Nevertheless, however mixed the portents, they sum up the local teams’ relative positions.
The Lakers have reason to hope again with Anthony Davis’ arrival confirming their status as a destination for stars.
They retain their place as local darlings after decades of excellence, above not only the ugly duckling Clippers but the market’s old-time faves, the Dodgers and Rams.
The Clippers have most of the advantages that have been earned lately, starting with a managerial mismatch.
From an afterthought run by Coach Doc Rivers doing double duty, the Clippers have built the NBA’s hottest front office with GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, with a deep staff of highly regarded young officials like Michael Winger and Trent Redden who turned down offers from other teams.
Meanwhile, the Lakers have to show they’re past last spring’s meltdown when Magic Johnson fled and Jeanie Buss and her friends and family took over.
Lakers fans still wince at the thought of West yearning to return in 2017, being left out in the cold and going, instead, to the Clippers.
Suggesting that unrest continued to bubble last summer, Jerry’s son, Ryan, another highly regarded young Lakers staffer, joined the Clippers.
Oh, and Ty Lue, the Lakers’ top coaching candidate before turning them down, is now an assistant on Doc Rivers’ staff.
The Clippers are deeper than the Lakers … and perhaps everyone else … with everyone solid in their roles from Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac to Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
Leonard slides seamlessly into his role as the starters’ missing No. 1 option, able to create shots out of nothing.
The injured Paul George, another two-way star, will add his own dimension upon his return with voluminous three-point shooting – he was No. 3 in makes last season, behind James Harden and Steph Curry – that will keep the floor spread wide open.
At the end of halves and fourth quarters, Kawhi and PG will meld with the crack second unit led by Sweet Lou and Trez.
Old dynamics are changing in the West. Five-time defending conference champion Golden State had dominated the Clippers, but that’s over as the Clips showed, routing the Warriors 141-122 in the opening of sparkling, stunned Chase Arena.
“This is not a one-off,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “This is the reality.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, will need time with a new coaching staff and nine new players, experimenting with James at point guard while awaiting the return of key pieces Kyle Kuzma and Rajon Rondo.
This means showing the necessary poise, although they couldn’t have set the bar much lower.
It was a year ago at this time that they started 1-4 and Johnson called coach Luke Walton in for a loud reproach that the press reported, decibel by decibel, turning Luke into a lame duck.
We still don’t know the whole story, but LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, was already criticizing Walton privately but widely, including to Commissioner Adam Silver, who acknowledged it (“I think he said something along the lines that ‘Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.’”)
This almost certainly came from James and was conveyed to Johnson, which is presumably what tripped out Magic into airing out Luke, and there went their season.
In other words, Frank Vogel had better not take his time to get this working, or do stuff Bron doesn’t like.
Everywhere but here, the rise of the underdog Clippers is as big a story as the saga of the once-majestic Lakers – or bigger.
Eight New York Times writers, asked to make predictions, all picked the Clippers to come out of the West.
Four of the eight picked the Clippers to win the title, with three picking the 76ers.
Five picked Frank to be executive of the year.
Five picked Williams as sixth man of the year and one picked Harrell.
With all the local star power, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, The Athletic, Fox and NBA.com have moved correspondents here. ESPN has an entire bureau on the beat.
“These days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A.,” The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis wrote. “Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves’ unsuccessful wooing of D’Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.”
For sure, this is where it’s happening.
Now, to see what “it” is.

Texto completo: William Barr suffered a double-whammy just in time for the weekend.
A federal judge dealt a significant blow to Barr on Friday by ordering him to give Democrats access to all grand jury material from the Mueller investigation - a court setback that came as the Trump-loyal attorney general also faced criticism over revelations that his review of the Russia probe has turned into a full-fledged criminal inquiry.
Beryl Howell, the chief judge for the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C., gave Barr's Justice Department until Wednesday to give the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee all redacted parts of former special counsel Robert Mueller's 448-page report as well as all underlying grand jury evidence, exhibits and transcripts.
The judge poked holes in arguments by Barr's attorneys that they couldn't divulge Mueller's most secret findings because the Democrats who requested them are just conducting an impeachment inquiry, not a "judicial" proceeding.
"DOJ is wrong," Howell stated bluntly in a two-page ruling.
She said that Democrats, as part of their ongoing impeachment inquiry, may need Mueller's confidential grand jury evidence, even though their probe has shifted away from the special counsel's findings and is now primarily focused on President Trump's attempts to pressure Ukrainian officials into investigating Joe Biden and other political rivals before the 2020 election.
"In carrying out the weighty constitutional duty of determining whether impeachment of the president is warranted, Congress need not redo the nearly two years of effort spent on the special counsel's investigation, nor risk being misled by witnesses, who may have provided information to the grand jury and the special counsel that varies from what they tell (Congress)," Howell wrote.
Barr has long sought to keep Mueller's most sensitive findings under wraps.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler - whose committee led the impeachment inquiry when it was mostly focused on Mueller's findings - said Congress will make use of the special counsel's grand jury evidence as part of the probe into whether Trump should be removed from office, even if it is currently zeroing in on the Ukraine scandal.
"The court's thoughtful ruling recognizes that our impeachment inquiry fully comports with the Constitution and thoroughly rejects the spurious White House claims to the contrary," Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. "This grand jury information that the administration has tried to block the House from seeing will be critical to our work."
Hours before Howell's ruling, Barr faced intense heat over news that his department's politically-charged review of the "origins" of the Russia investigation had been upgraded to a criminal inquiry.
The new designation, which was first reported by The New York Times, means the Justice Department is effectively investigating itself in a criminal context.
It also gives Barr's handpicked investigator, U.S. Attorney John Durham, the ability to summon a grand jury, subpoena witnesses and even file charges against prosecutors and others who worked on the FBI's initial investigation into Russian election interference, which paved the way for Mueller's special counsel probe.
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who leads the current rendition of the impeachment inquiry, said the escalation raises "profound new concerns" that Barr's Justice Department "has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge."
"If the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the president with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage," Schiff said in a statement.
Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said his panel has already covered the ground Barr is now moving in on.
"We've found nothing remotely justifying this," Warner tweeted. "He needs to come before Congress and explain himself."
Warner's Democratic colleague from Oregon, Sen. Jeff Merkley, was floored.
"Barr's job is attorney general of the United States. The UNITED STATES. He's not Donald Trump's PR flunky. Is this really happening or is this just the latest episode in some bizarre TV series?" Merkley tweeted.
Republicans and Barr himself have long floated unsubstantiated conspiracy theories suggesting the FBI acted out of political animus against Trump when it launched its initial counterintelligence probe into whether Russia was conspiring with the president's 2016 campaign.
Trump has claimed all aspects of the Russia investigation was part of a "witch hunt" meant to take him down.
Despite such claims, Mueller's extensive final report makes clear the FBI launched its initial inquiry after it discovered that several Trump campaign officials had extensive ties to Russian government operatives.
One campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, was even told by a Kremlin-linked professor in a London bar in April 2016 that Russia had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, according to Mueller's report.
Within months of that meeting, Russian government operatives released those and other emails hacked from Hillary Clinton's campaign in a deliberate effort to hurt her campaign and boost Trump's 2016 bid, according to a unanimous assessment by the U.S. intelligence community.
After Trump fired ex-FBI Director James Comey, who supervised the first Russia probe, Mueller was appointed special counsel to pick up where the bureau had left off.
Mueller's investigation went on to secure indictments against 34 people and three companies, including guilty pleas from Trump's campaign manager, deputy campaign manager, campaign foreign policy adviser, first national security adviser and personal lawyer.
In another development, John Bolton, the ex-White House security chief who was fired by Trump, is reportedly set to get the last laugh by spilling the beans to the impeachment inquiry.
The walrus-mustached hawk is in talks over giving testimony to the Democratic-led investigation, CNN reported, in what would be a bombshell appearance that could be most devastating blow yet to Trump.

Texto completo: This week, Melbourne-based reporter Livia Albeck-Ripka worked with producer Lynsea Garrison to make a two-part series about the relatives of ISIS fighters. You heard the story of Kamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter and grandchildren are detained in Syria. But there are many others. We asked Livia to tell us about her experience meeting these family members:
When I first met Kamalle Dabboussy earlier this year, he insisted that nearly everything he told me remain off the record.
For months, Kamalle had been quietly trying to convince the Australian government to bring home his daughter and three grandchildren from the Al-Hol camp in Syria, where the families of ISIS fighters are detained. He was leading a contingent of more than a dozen Australian relatives, all holding a similar dark secret. Few of them wanted to talk.
We met at a Lebanese restaurant on the waterfront of an inner-western suburb of Melbourne, where, in a haze of hookah smoke, Kamalle strategized with the relatives of other detained women and a lawyer who had been assisting them. It was a few weeks later when, frustrated by the government's inaction and desperate to get their loved ones home, they finally decided to go public.
First, Kamalle's story aired on national media. Following President Trump's announcement to pull troops from northeastern Syria, he held news conferences and did radio interviews, and allowed The Times to trail him to Parliament House in Canberra, Australia's capital.
Eventually, the other families began to open up, too.
Among them were John Crocket and Samer Safar, the grandfather and father of Janai Safar, a 26-year-old detained with her 3-year-old son in the Al-Hol camp. According to previous reporting by the Australian media, Janai chose to join the Islamic State, but she has since contested this.
When I met her family at a Sizzler restaurant outside Sydney last week, Samer said his daughter and grandson were in grave danger, and should come home. "My grandchild is not a terrorist," he said.
John, an 86-year-old Korean War veteran, said that even if his granddaughter had willingly joined, she deserved due process and to be tried in Australia. "I've done my bit for my country, so let the government do something for me, to bring my granddaughter back," John said. "That's all I want."
As of today, while governments around the world debate the question of what they owe to citizens who joined a regime repudiating Western values, the Australian women and children remain in the camp.
Many of you have asked us to continue following what happens, and we will. I'll stay in touch with Kamalle and the other families, and when there's news, we'll bring you the story.

The thing about Bernie
In today's episode, you heard our producer Jessica Cheung's conversations with supporters of Bernie Sanders at his rally in New York. We asked Jessica what struck her most about these interactions:
"To some, the differences between Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's candidacies may appear relatively small. Both are liberal populists, campaigning on the overhaul of an economic system they believe is not working for lower- and middle-income families. But when I went to the Sanders rally on Saturday, I was surprised by how, to his base, the gulf between these two candidates is vast -- more than I realized. Sanders's supporters insisted to me that these candidates are not similar, many of them contrasting the consistency of Sanders's record with that of Warren, who was a Republican until 1996. They cited his protests during the civil rights movement; they cited her past work with corporations in legal cases. And some suggested that because of Warren's past, she couldn't be trusted (a claim Warren, of course, rejects). In their telling, only Bernie Sanders could truly transform our economic system.
"But when I asked one voter, Andy Schwartz, about Sanders's ideological purity, he resisted the term. 'I don't know if it's even pure. We don't like that word. Because pure then becomes purity test -- we don't actually believe that purity tests are being applied to various Democratic candidates by people on the left. It's about your ideas, your programs, your political record and your vision for this country. This isn't a purity test,' he told me. 'We're in a competitive primary election."'

What we're listening to
Who: Neena Pathak, producer of "Still Processing"
What: "MOONFACE," an audio fiction podcast
I want to like audio fiction. But with a lot of contemporary audio fiction, I don't feel anything. And I get hung up on one thought: This isn't real.
As someone who loves consuming fiction, this is a frustrating thought. Tommy Orange's novel "There There" made me cry. The movie "Us" terrified me, and the show "Succession" almost made me anxiety-puke. None of these stories are real (unless "Succession" is maybe too real?), but they made me feel so much.
That's why I've been excited about "MOONFACE," an audio fiction series by James Kim -- because it made me feel. It's the story of a Korean-American guy named Paul who is trying to be honest, about his sexuality and his ambitions, with himself and his dear ones.
The sound design is cinematic. You will notice this in the first five minutes of the first episode, which, spoiler alert, features a sex scene. But the loud, steady club beat juxtaposed with the gentle hesitation in Paul's voice makes you viscerally experience something unexpected: his vulnerability. Pulling off this scene in a way that evokes empathy rather than cringing is no small feat.
Another place where the series excels is in the dialogue between Paul and his immigrant mom. Their difficult conversations, traded between his broken Korean and her broken English, highlight a truth that many children of immigrants know too well -- that while we'll never fully understand or be understood, it can still be worth it to try.
I believe in fiction. I believe in letting a story take me on a journey that helps me reflect on some aspect of my life or the world, even if for just a moment. "MOONFACE" does this in six carefully crafted episodes that make you feel both the fear and the freedom of becoming.

It's Giuliani On the Phone, But He Might Not Realize It

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer and a key figure in the impeachment inquiry, managed to inadvertently telephone an NBC News reporter at 11 p.m. one night this month and leave a lengthy voice message filled with snippets of an overheard conversation.
In the muffled recording -- left on Oct. 16 with the NBC reporter Rich Schapiro -- Mr. Giuliani, the chairman of a security consulting firm, can be heard discussing business in Turkey and Bahrain. At one point, speaking with a pair of unidentified men, Mr. Giuliani declares: "The problem is we need some money."
Nearly 10 seconds of silence tick by before Mr. Giuliani clarifies: "We need a few hundred thousand."
It was not the first time that Mr. Giuliani had left remnants of a conversation on Mr. Schapiro's phone. In a voice mail message left in September, he can be heard railing against the family of Joseph R. Biden Jr., suggesting with no evidence that he knows of corrupt activities by the former vice president.
Calls and texts to Mr. Giuliani seeking clarity about the messages went unreturned on Friday. And Mr. Schapiro, in an appearance on MSNBC, said he had tried without success to ask Mr. Giuliani about the unusual recordings.
"I have yet to receive an intentional or unintentional call back," Mr. Schapiro said.
Given Mr. Giuliani's sensitive role in the impeachment inquiry, and his taste for the spotlight, there was some speculation that the messages could have been staged. But based on reactions from the Washington press corps who cover him, Mr. Giuliani, 75, is an accomplished inadvertent caller. On social media, the Giuliani stories began to flow.
"Everyone has a good Rudy butt dial story," Josh Dawsey, a Washington Post White House reporter, wrote on Twitter. "I've heard him on what sounded like a plane, at the airport, at what sounded like a bar."
Jonathan Swan, a White House reporter for Axios, had another story. "He once texted me a voice memo recording of himself talking to a guy," Mr. Swan recalled. "I couldn't make any sense of it or figure out how he managed to text me a recording in advertently."
David Martosko, a journalist at The Daily Mail, remembered once bumping into Mr. Giuliani and a Fox News producer at a Washington television studio. "He was just finishing telling her a story," Mr. Martosko wrote on Twitter, referring to the producer. "It ended with: 'And I butt-dialed him! Can you believe it?"'
Accidents aside, Mr. Giuliani relies heavily on his telephone to communicate. He is a frequent texter and often eager to engage with reporters. In a recent parlor game of sorts in Washington, journalists posted pictures of their smartphone conversations with the former New York mayor.
Oliver Darcy, a CNN media reporter, joked on Twitter last week that it was "starting to feel like I might be the only reporter not texting with" Mr. Giuliani.
Inadvertent phone calls have yet to join the pantheon of legendary reporting methods. But the smartphone era is young.
"I can tell you," Mr. Schapiro said on MSNBC on Friday, "I did not go to sleep that night expecting to wake up in the morning with a three-minute voice mail message from Rudy Giuliani."

Leonard Pitts: Time to make peace with some memories

Texto completo: When, at Mamie Till’s insistence, the coffin was opened, she saw her son’s right eyeball sitting on his cheek, dangling by the optic nerve.
Let that single grisly detail stand in for all the rest. Let it speak to the savagery two white men unleashed upon the body of a 14-year-old black boy named Emmett Till.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
On Saturday, a new marker was dedicated at the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi, from which his body was fished in August of 1955. This is the fourth such memorial to Till, a Chicago boy who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered for supposedly getting fresh with a white woman at a local store.
The first marker wasn’t installed until 2008. It disappeared. The next two were shot full of holes. The new one is said to be bulletproof, with protective glass and reinforced steel. It weighs 500 pounds and will reportedly be monitored by video cameras transmitting to the internet.
Even so, one wonders how long it will last. Where race is concerned, after all, white resistance to memory is often mulish. Black resistance too, sometimes. As Jessie Jaynes-Diming, a member of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, recently told NPR, “Whites and blacks came to our meetings and (said) ‘Why are you all bringing this up? Why don’t y’all let that die?’”
John Whitten would agree. A former county prosecutor, he was 7 years old when his namesake father defended the killers in court. Till, he told NPR, “came down here and got in trouble — overstepped his bounds to a degree some folks thought. And they cured him of his problems. I think all these folks are stirring crap up. Every day, somebody’s dragging up the race card. Somebody saying we have racial disparity here. If nobody would stir that damn pile of stuff up, it wouldn’t stink.”
It is, yes, a crude and atavistic assessment. But, though others would likely use more oblique language, Whitten speaks the hearts of many white people when he says these are things we shouldn’t “stir.” For example, he speaks for Newt Gingrich who, in August, denounced a New York Times project on the history of slavery as “a lie.” And for the Montgomery, Alabama, nurse who complained last year to Britain’s Guardian newspaper that a new lynching memorial is “just stirring up something.”
If some African Americans resist these stories because of the pain, many whites resist them because of the stain — the smudge on self-image, the blot on conscience, the blemish on the mythology of white virtue and innocence. They feel indicted by memory, so they try to kill it. “It’s hard not to be embarrassed,” a then-20-year-old white guy named Ryan Price told me in 2011. We had just sat through a documentary, “The Murder of Emmett Till.”
In watching the movie, he said, “You get to the point where you almost want to change your skin color so you can show how much you care about issues of race, how much you care about the overt hatred and vitriolic discrimination of the past and today. Of course, you can’t change your skin color, but you can be an ally to those who are marginalized in society, and that’s something it really spurs me to do.”
That young man’s words inspired me — not only his willingness to grapple honestly with his feelings, but his determination to use those feelings for good. If more of us had courage like his, a simple commemorative sign would not have to be bulletproof or weigh 500 pounds. And history would not be a threat but, as he puts it, a spur. Unfortunately, too many of us have not courage, but cowardice. They seek to murder memory. But you see, memory fights back.
So maybe they should make peace with it instead.

Texto completo: The Des Moines Symphony opens its Pops Series with "Havana Nights" at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Des Moines Civic Center.
Hailed as a leading interpreter of classical Spanish song by NBC Latino and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, star soprano Camille Zamora and the Mambo Kings join the Des Moines Symphony for an evening of Latin jazz from Spain and Cuba.
The evening includes orchestral and vocal selections from the Spanish Zarzuela period combined with the Afro Cuban rhythms of the Mambo Kings.
In collaboration with artists ranging from Yo Yo Ma to Sting, Zamora has garnered acclaim for her interpretations of repertoire ranging from Mozart to tango. She is known for her "dignity and glowing sound" (The New York Times) in "luminous, transcendently lyrical" performances (Opera News) that "combine gentility and emotional fire" (The Houston Chronicle).
The Mambo Kings have earned national acclaim for their explosive blend of Afro Cuban rhythms and jazz improvisation. From the burning rhythms of Tito Puente to the rhythmic playfulness of jazz great Dave Brubeck, the Mambo Kings celebrate the sizzling music of Latin America and the United States.
"We are thrilled to open the fifth year of our Pops Series with Havana Nights," said Des Moines Symphony music director and conductor Joseph Giunta. "Our Pops concerts have allowed us to welcome new audiences into the concert hall, while giving our regular patrons a new, exciting experience. When they feel the sizzle and heat of this concert, I guarantee audiences will be dancing in the aisles of the Civic Center."
Single tickets start at $35 and are available at dmsymphony.org and at the Civic Center Ticket Office. Single ticket prices are subject to a $5 increase on the day of the concert.

Our view: Navy SEALs wrestle with a crisis of character

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned."
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade -- who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times -- Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. And Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one that involved posing with a dead body.
According to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons."
Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. The Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership.
So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond."
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven -- the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid -- reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

Texto completo: It was another sad milestone in the decline of John McCain's faithful sidekick into President Trump's Lickspittle Lindsey.
Not quite two weeks ago, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) vowed to be Trump's "worst nightmare" and called the Syria pullout "irresponsible," a "stain on America's honor" and the "biggest blunder of his presidency." He introduced legislation to sanction Turkey for invading Syria.
Trump's reply? "I am the boss." He publicly advised Graham to focus on other things - in particular, to go after Trump's accusers.
Trump loyalists, led by Donald Trump Jr., launched a social media campaign against Graham, demanding he step up his attack on the impeachment process. Trump summoned Graham to lunch at the White House on Thursday to drive home the point.
And Lickspittle Lindsey obeyed. First, he said he was "impressed" that Trump is "thinking outside the box" on Syria. He reportedly shelved sanctions legislation. And on Thursday afternoon, he marched into the Senate TV studio to unveil a resolution attacking House Democrats over their impeachment proceedings.
"The attempted impeachment of President Trump is out of bounds," he inveighed. "Star-chamber-type inquiry . . . a runaround . . . off-script . . . wrong . . . a rogue action . . . very dangerous." He chopped the air. "If we were doing this, you'd be beating the shit out of us!" he shouted to a live television audience.
He even talks like Trump now.
Could he be any more shameful? Well, he held his news conference in the Capitol on Thursday afternoon at the same time the body of Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), a leader of the impeachment inquiry until his death last week, lay in state nearby. Cummings was the first African American lawmaker so honored, and impeachment proceedings halted out of respect. Graham didn't.
This came two days after Graham, defending Trump, said impeachment "is a lynching in every sense." Um, because an innocent Trump is being murdered by a racist mob solely because he has orange skin?
On Wednesday, Graham criticized House Republicans who stormed into a secure room shouting to disrupt impeachment proceedings. He said they were "nuts," adding: "That's not the way to do it." Soon after came his inevitable tweet: "CORRECTION . . . I understand their frustration and they have good reason to be upset."
Rounding out Graham's week of walk-backs, Graham had told Axios he might consider impeachment if "Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo." On Tuesday, Trump-appointed acting ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. detailed such a quid pro quo between Trump and the Ukrainian president trading military aid for political dirt. And Graham? He dismissed it as "hearsay."
Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice called Graham a "piece of [same s-word Graham used]" during a podcast interview this week. Rather than join Graham and Trump in public vulgarity, I prefer to think of Graham as the weakest man in Washington. For years, he imitated McCain's maverick streak. But he was no maverick. After McCain's death, Graham found himself a new father-figure.
Graham famously called Trump a "nut job" and a "jackass" during the 2016 campaign. But Graham calculated that avoiding a primary fight required him to become Trump's golf buddy. Graham told the New York Times Magazine's Mark Leibovich that his courtship of Trump was "to try to be relevant." Instead, Lindsey O. Graham put the "O" in oleaginous.
Graham played down his hawkish line on Iran after a Trump scolding. After the Mueller report came out, Graham used his Judiciary Committee chairmanship to echo Trump's talking points and to spread falsehoods. Graham bravely promised there would be "holy hell to pay" if Trump fired Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Trump later fired Sessions; Graham defended it.
He is now walking back his impeachment views. Twenty years ago, as a Clinton impeachment manager, Graham said a president's failure to comply with subpoenas was impeachable because it "took the power from Congress." Now, the Trump administration is ignoring subpoenas wholesale - and Graham is attacking the lawmakers who issued them.
In his Thursday news conference, Graham couldn't quite bring himself to exonerate Trump: "I don't want to comment on substance," he said. "I'm not here to tell you that Donald Trump has done nothing wrong." He merely raged against procedures, arguing, "The process in the House today, I think, is a danger to the future of the presidency."
ABC News's Terry Moran reminded him that during Watergate, lawmakers took depositions behind closed doors before there was an impeachment resolution, just as the House is doing now.
Graham did not dispute this.
CNN's Ted Barrett reminded him that during the Clinton impeachment, House Republicans took private depositions before public hearings. "Why was it okay then and not now?"
"The inquiry itself became very public," Graham replied.
And so will this one - leaving Graham looking foolish once more.

This Jew doesn't tremble

Texto completo: Zeev Jabotinsky, the famed writer, political theorist, and Zionist leader, instinctively sympathized with other ethnic and national minorities against the Russian Empire’s program of forced assimilation and Russification. That sympathy was not always requited; in Poland, his open palm was met with a clenched fist.

“I absolutely refuse to understand how one can take account of the national demands of a people that refuses in principle to reckon with the Jewish people’s national rights,” a frustrated Jabotinsky wrote in 1913. As he saw it, reciprocity was a prerequisite for forming a political alliance. “In politics, considerate behavior is inadmissible unless it is mutual. For there can be only two options: either all nationalities have an equal right to their cultures and the national sentiments of each are sacred and inviolable, or there are no such rights at all, in which case the national sentiments of the Poles are as little sacred as those of the Jews. Equality is for all or for none.”

Today, the American Jewish community demands no such reciprocity; it tolerates and even encourages movements that reject Jewish particularism. The result is a disaster for U.S. Jews, who are overwhelmingly left-of-center and highly politically engaged — and thus used as instruments in their own erasure by the commissars of Leftist identity politics, who regard Jews as white oppressors who must atone for their “privilege.” Few non-right-wing Jews call attention to this trend. That is what makes Bari Weiss’ book, How To Fight Anti-Semitism, both intellectually refreshing and useful.

“Whereas once it was enough to criticize Israeli government policy, specifically its treatment of Palestinians, now Israel’s very existence must be denounced,” Weiss writes. “Whereas once it was enough to forswear the Jewish Defense League, now the very idea of Jewish power must be abjured. Whereas once Jewish success had to be explained, now it has to be apologized for. Whereas once only Israel’s government was demonized, now it is the Jewish movement for self-determination itself.”

Weiss laments the Left’s demand that Jews shed their “stubborn particularism” as a prerequisite for political belonging: “Jews are welcome so long as they undertake a kind of secular conversion by disavowing many or most of the things that actually make them Jewish.”

Weiss’s book is not merely about Left anti-Semitism: Its section on right-wing Jew-hate comes first. But by covering all kinds of anti-Semitism, Weiss makes a threefold contribution to the debate. First, because she is a liberal, her condemnation of left-wing bigotry comes with more credibility. Second, because she is a staff editor and writer at the New York Times, her words reach those who might not otherwise hear them or who might not take them seriously if they weren’t coming from the Times. And third, because Weiss seeks to be politically comprehensive, shining the hot lights on all sides, she effectively de-politicizes anti-Semitism by taking it out of the realm of partisan finger-pointing.

Weiss’s ecumenical approach helps us understand strains of anti-Semitism that are frequently ignored by the media. Right-wing anti-Semitism is fairly straightforward. The tiki torch Nazi poseurs in Charlottesville chanted “The Jews will not replace us”; it doesn’t take a Talmudic debate to figure out what animates them. But the belief — expressed by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, the communications director for Rep. Ilhan Omar, and other Democrats — that anti-Semitism is an exclusively right-wing phenomenon is not only wrong but dangerously so. “There were 1,879 incidents of anti-Semitism in America in 2018, according to the anti-Defamation League. Just 13% of them (249) were carried out by members of white supremacist groups,” Weiss says.

In de Blasio’s New York, Orthodox Jews are experiencing a frightening wave of violence the city has done nothing to stop. “The fact that the victims are most often outwardly identifiable, i.e., religious rather than secularized Jews, and the perpetrators who have been recorded on CCTV cameras are overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, inverts the perpetrator-victim dynamics with which most national Jewish organizations and their supporters are comfortable,” wrote Armin Rosen at Tablet. “A close look at these cases reveals no apparent connection to neo-Nazis, the alt-right, Donald Trump, jihadism, the BDS movement, or any other traditional cause of anti-Jewish behavior.”

How To Fight Anti-Semitism is tightly argued and clocks in at just about 200 pages. What it’s able to accomplish in that time is remarkable, but it really shines in two areas. The first is dispensing with the lazy defense of anti-Zionism as distinct from anti-Semitism. As Weiss shows, it really is a form of anti-Semitism.

Israel “exists. It is not an abstraction.” So pointing to the history of Jews opposed to the theoretical Jewish state in the early part of the 20th century is dishonest. The latest polls find 95% of Jews have favorable views of Israel, so the number of Jewish anti-Zionists is practically a rounding error. There’s a reason for this: Since Israel’s founding in 1948, being an anti-Zionist has meant not merely opposing the establishment of a Jewish state but supporting the existing Jewish state’s destruction. “The kumbaya of the anti-Zionist dream guarantees a very bloody reality, and anti-Zionists should be forced to defend it,” Weiss writes. Anti-Zionists are conspicuously focused on being “anti” the existence of only one state: the Jewish one. While Weiss acknowledges that some legitimate criticism of Israel gets unfairly labeled as anti-Semitism, she notes that it is more often the case that anti-Zionists are trying to launder Jew-hatred as criticism of Israeli policy. “To be an anti-Zionist in Poland before the Holocaust is one thing. To be one today is something else entirely,” she says. “It is not to be ideologically opposed to an idea. It is to be against the largest Jewish community on the planet.”

Weiss has famously become the target of an insane degree of online spite — not from random folks on the internet but from fellow journalists and commentators, as well as activists. Her book shows why: She consistently forces her antagonists to face the realities of their positions instead of letting them hide behind abstractions.

The other great triumph of the book is the final chapter, which fulfills the promise of the title: “How To Fight.” She tears into the defensiveness that leads so many Jewish Americans to fight on their accusers’ terms. She approvingly quotes a former Columbia student (Weiss is also an alumnus): “A man calls you a pig. Do you walk around with a sign explaining that, in fact, you are not a pig? Do you hand out leaflets expostulating in detail upon the manifold differences between you and a pig?”

Weiss counsels Jews to stop negotiating the terms of their own existence. She also quotes former British Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks: “Non-Jews respect Jews who respect Judaism, and they are embarrassed by Jews who are embarrassed by Judaism.” Likewise, she asks readers to call out anti-Semitism, “especially when it’s hard” to do so. That means criticizing minorities, such as Ilhan Omar, who regularly use anti-Semitic tropes, rather than letting the fear of being called a racist intimidate you into silence.

Weiss tells readers to “expect solidarity.” As Jabotinsky recognized a century ago, it’s not “equality” if you’re not given equal standing. “We should not make a deal that requires us to erase ourselves,” Weiss writes. She advises other members of the tribe to “lean into Judaism,” not toward secularization and assimilation.

When, in 1982, then-Sen. Joe Biden tried to cajole Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin by holding U.S. aid to Israel over Begin’s head, the prime minister reportedly responded, “I am not a Jew with trembling knees.” Bari Weiss has picked up Begin’s baton in compelling fashion with a timely warning against a Judaism that trembles at the knees.

Texto completo: Bárbara Vale y su hijo Jason Vale, ex campeón de lucha libre, fueron arrestados ayer en Queens (NYC) por cargos de fraude por supuestamente vender el elixir de albaricoque en Internet como una cura para el cáncer.
La dama de 77 años y su hijo de 51 fueron arrestados por la federal Administración de Drogas y Alimentos (FDA) y las autoridades del Servicio Postal (USPS), en su casa en Queens.
El Departamento de Protección Ambiental (DEP) de la ciudad de Nueva York estuvo en escena debido a los barriles llenos de líquido encontrados en la casa.
Bárbara Vale apareció en la corte el miércoles por la tarde, donde fue liberada con una fianza de $100 mil dólares, informó NBC News.
Su hijo Jason fue llevado al hospital después del arresto por un problema médico no revelado y no compareció ante el tribunal. El juez lo contactó por teléfono y le informó las mismas condiciones de su fianza de $100 mil dólares.
Según una denuncia penal, desde al menos enero de 2013 el dúo madre-hijo “ha estado operando un negocio en línea a través de un portal llamado “Apricotsfromgod.info“, desde el cual los consumidores pueden comprar diversos productos”.
La queja continúa diciendo: “Uno de estos productos es la amigdalina, un glucósido que se encuentra en el núcleo o las semillas de la mayoría de las frutas y se conoce con frecuencia como “Laetrile” o “Vitamina B-17”. Mientras que algunas personas creen que Laetrile puede tratar y controlar el cáncer, la FDA no respalda esta afirmación”.
Según la denuncia, en 2002 Jason fue acusado de intentar engañar a la FDA y distribuir laetrile, entre otros cargos. Posteriormente fue condenado en 2003 y cumplió cinco años de prisión, según los fiscales.
En 2008 el diario New York Times describió a Jason como un sobreviviente de cáncer que atribuía su recuperación al poder de las semillas de albaricoque.

Texto completo: La Casa Blanca está instando a las agencias federales a cancelar sus suscripciones a los diarios The New York Times y el Washington Post .
La secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Stephanie Grisham, dijo este jueves en un comunicado que “no renovar las suscripciones de todas las agencias federales supondrá un importante ahorro para los contribuyentes “. “Cientos de miles de dólares”, asegura la presidencia que las instituciones nacionales dejarían de gastar.
The Wall Street Journal fue el primero en dar a conocer las intenciones de la presidencia, pero previamente el presidente Donald Trump había señalado que la Casa Blanca debería “acabar” con las suscripciones que tenga a ambos diarios . Tump ha criticado ampliamente a ambas publicaciones desde que fue candidato a las elecciones 2016.
“The New York Times, que es un falso periódico, ni quiera lo queremos en la Casa Blanca nunca más. Probablemente vayamos a prescindir de él y de The Washington Post“, dijo Trump en Fox News la tarde del lunes. “Echas un vistazo a The New York Times y […] al tipo de reportajes que hacen… Y todo resulta ser incorrecto “, añadió el presidente.
A pesar que Grisham aseguró que la supresión de estas suscripciones significarían un ahorro de “cientos de miles de dólares”, no está claro cuantas agencias federales están suscritas al Times y el Post y, por tanto, tampoco el dinero que el gobierno gasta en los diarios.

Texto completo: El Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) ha cambiado la revisión que realiza de la pesquisa sobre posible interferencia rusa en las elecciones de Estados Unidos a una investigación formal penal.
La revisión que el Fiscal General William Barr ordenó sobre los orígenes de la investigación sobre posibles vínculos entre la campaña de Trump de 2016 y Rusia ahora se ha convertido en una investigación criminal, dijo a POLITICO una fuente familiarizada con el asunto.
La investigación, realizada por el fiscal estadounidense de Connecticut, John Durham , se inició como un esfuerzo de Barr por responder preguntas no especificadas que tenía sobre por qué el FBI comenzó la investigación de contrainteligencia que finalmente llevó al nombramiento del asesor especial Robert Mueller.
Sin embargo, la escalada de la investigación de Barr de una revisión administrativa a un asunto penal significa que los actuales y antiguos funcionarios del FBI y del Departamento de Justicia enfrentan la posibilidad de cargos criminales, derivados de algún aspecto de su trabajo en la investigación de Rusia.
La designación de la investigación de Durham como una investigación criminal también aumenta enormemente su poder para recopilar información , abriendo la posibilidad de citaciones del gran jurado para registros y testimonios.
La medida seguramente complacerá al presidente Donald Trump, quien se ha quejado durante mucho tiempo de que fue espiado durante la campaña de 2016, a pesar de la falta de evidencia para respaldar esa afirmación. Trump también acusó a la administración Obama y a los funcionarios del FBI de traición, por sus acciones en la investigación de Rusia.
Los ex funcionarios habían expresado su reiterada preocupación por la investigación de Durham en las últimas semanas, diciendo que había indicios de que se estaba expandiendo más allá de una típica retrospectiva sobre cómo se manejaban los asuntos de alto perfil. La conversión de la investigación a una investigación criminal fue reportada por primera vez el jueves por el New York Times.
Las revisiones administrativas generalmente son realizadas por la Oficina del Inspector General (OIG) del Departamento de Justicia, que ha pasado más de un año investigando el contenido de las solicitudes de la Ley de Vigilancia de Inteligencia Extranjera que el FBI y el Departamento de Justicia presentaron para Carter Page , un especialista de la industria energética que había servido como asesor de campaña de Trump.
La investigación de Durham parece ser más amplia que la investigación de la OIG, aunque el alcance completo de su investigación sigue sin estar claro.

Texto completo: The author of an anonymous column in The New York Times in 2018, who was identified as a senior Trump administration official acting as part of the "resistance" inside the government, has written a tell-all book to be published next month.
The book, titled "A Warning," is being promoted as "an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency" that expands upon the Times column, which ricocheted around the world and stoked the president's rage because of its devastating portrayal of Donald Trump in office.
The column described Trump's leadership style as "impetuous, adversarial, petty, and ineffective," and noted that "his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed, and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."
The author of the column, which was titled "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" and was published Sept. 5, 2018, was known to the Times but identified by the Times only as a senior official in the Trump administration. The person has not been publicly identified.
Trump lashed out at the anonymous author after the column's publication. The president questioned both whether the author existed and whether the author had committed treason. He also demanded on Twitter that the Times turn over "the GUTLESS anonymous person" to the government "at once." The Times did not.
The forthcoming book will list the author as "Anonymous." Although the person does not reveal their identity in the book, they will discuss the reasons for their anonymity, according to people involved in the project.
"Picking up from where those first words of warning left off, this explosive book offers a shocking, firsthand account of President Trump and his record," reads a statement about the book's release.
The book will be published on Nov. 19 by Twelve, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group. It comes at a treacherous period for Trump, as the House continues its fast-moving impeachment inquiry into the president's alleged abuse of power.
There is no modern historical parallel for a firsthand account of a sitting president written in book form by an anonymous author. Many senior government officials, including some who served in the Trump administration, have written books under their own names. Many more have shared information with journalists on the condition of anonymity, perhaps most famously the official known as Deep Throat who was a key source for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's reporting in The Washington Post on the Watergate scandal.
The 1996 publication of "Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics" caused a sensation in part because of the anonymity of its author, who was later revealed to be columnist Joe Klein. The book was a work of fiction, although its characters and events mirrored Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.
The anonymous author of "A Warning" did not take an advance and intends to donate some of the royalties to nonprofit organizations that focus on government accountability and supporting truth-tellers in repressive countries, including the White House Correspondents' Association, said literary agent Matt Latimer, who represented the author along with Keith Urbahn.
Latimer and Urbahn represented fired FBI director James Comey and former White House aide Cliff Sims for their memoirs from their time in the Trump administration.

GOP senator criticized for posting debunked image
MINNEAPOLIS — Representative Ilhan Omar has condemned a Republican state senator from North Dakota who posted a long-debunked photo on his Facebook page that purports to show the Minnesota Democrat holding a weapon at an Al Qaeda training camp.
Omar, a naturalized US citizen who was born in Somalia and is one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, blasted state Senator Oley Larsen's post, which also led to calls Tuesday from the Senate's top Republican and GOP Governor Doug Burgum to apologize and relinquish a state Senate leadership position.
"This is pure propaganda designed to stir up hate and violence," Omar tweeted Monday night. ". . . Facebook's unwillingness to crack down on hate speech and misinformation is not just threatening my life, but our democracy."
The image Larsen posted has been debunked by several sources since it appeared on social media this summer. It's an Associated Press photo taken of a female Somali army recruit at a Mogadishu military training campus in 1978, four years before Omar was born in 1982.
In the comments accompanying his post, Larsen also called Omar an "elected terrorist" and asked his followers to "share it everywhere."
Facing mounting criticism, though, Larsen removed the photo Monday. And by Tuesday morning, his Facebook feed — minus the image — was full of attacks on him for posting it and accusing him of bigotry.
On Tuesday, the North Dakota Senate's majority leader, Republican Rich Wardner, called on Larsen to apologize and give up his position as the state Senate's president pro tempore, a post in which he presides over sessions when the lieutenant governor is absent.
"At this point, I'm not calling for his resignation from the Senate, but if he continues with this, I will have to rethink that," Wardner said.

Esper recuses himself over son's work with bidder
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has recused himself from a high-profile review of the Pentagon's controversial JEDI cloud computing infrastructure because his son is employed with one of the contract's initial bidders, a Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday.
Moving forward the review is to be handled by deputy defense secretary David Norquist "out of an abundance of caution," Defense spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement e-mailed to reporters.
"Although not legally required to, [Esper] has removed himself from participating in any decision making following the information meetings, due to his adult son's employment with one of the original contract applicants," he wrote.
The statement did not say which company Esper's son works for, how that information came to the Secretary's attention, or why he didn't recuse himself earlier.
It is the latest conflict of interest allegation to present problems for the JEDI contract, which seeks to centralize the military's computing infrastructure in the hands of a tech company, allowing US military agencies to harness the most advanced innovations Silicon Valley has to offer.
Amazon and Microsoft are the only companies eligible to win the massive award, after Oracle and IBM were cut from the competition. Amazon is widely seen as a front-runner.

Oct. 23, 1919: Supreme Court Action Ends Prolonged New Mexican Litigation
... The New York Times in an editorial entitled "A Victory for a Free Press," stated, "Congratulations are due to the Santa Fe New Mexican and its editor, E. Dana Johnson," and quoted with approval Judge Holloman's holding that "under our theory of government, the rights of freedom of speech and of the press are essential to public welfare."
Oct. 23, 1969: Santa Fe's Housing Authority Wednesday night offered a compromise to opponents of an earlier plan. The new plan calls for dispersing 200 proposed units of public housing.
Leo Murphy, chairman of the Housing Authority, told a packed City Council chamber audience the authority withdrew its earlier proposal to build 200 units proposed in the west end and submit a new proposal calling for construction of 100 units for the elderly and small families on the VanderSys Nursery property off Camino Alire.
Oct. 23, 1994: A nighttime robber armed with a pistol cruised through downtown Santa Fe on Saturday, terrorizing pedestrians and forcing one woman to hide in some bushes and scream for help.
Six muggings between midnight and 2 a.m., and another at 7 p.m., are believed to have been committed by the same person.

Texto completo: Re “Terranea Resort, in Rancho Palos Verdes, introduces new panic buttons in lead up to ballot measure” (Oct. 24):
I’m glad to see that Terranea Resort President Terri Haack has provided panic buttons to the hardworking housekeeping workers at Terranea.
The resort also claims they pay their workers at least $15 an hour. If this is true, why not codify these policies so that workers will be guaranteed this protection against sexual assault and a base pay of $15, no matter who the management is? Measure B would do just that.
Terranea has spent an alarming amount of money and energy trying to defeat this measure that they claim to already live up to. This is money that would be better spent implementing these commonsense protections and paying their workers fairly.
Terranea has been promoting their Saints and Sinners Halloween Party. In my opinion, the saints are the hotel workers who work long hours cleaning up after and waiting on hotel guests and making Terranea the place visitors love so much and are willing to pay top dollar for. The sinners? That’s for you to decide.
Ultimately, Measure B’s fate will be decided by residents of Rancho Palos Verdes. If I lived there, I would vote yes.
— Janice Hahn,

We’ve seen this before
The year is 1971. Bumbling burglars break into the Democratic campaign office to get dirt on behalf of a Republican president. The cast: Richard Nixon, H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy, Charles Colson, John Dean, Archibald Cox, a whistleblower, and the Washington Post. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
Fast forward to 2019. Bumbling Republican president shakes down the president of Ukraine to get dirt on Democrat opponent.
The cast: Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Stephen Miller, Mike Pompeo, William Barr, Robert Mueller, a whistleblower and The New York Times. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
We’ve seen this movie before. The latest news is just a preview of a sequel. In the previous movie, many of the characters ended up in prison or ignominy. So should many characters in this sequel. Exception, impeach and convict Trump.

Whistleblower claim Ukrainians were aware by early August of military aid freeze confirmed: Report

Texto completo: Ukrainian officials were aware of a freeze on U.S. military aid by the first week of August, according to a new report, contradicting claims by U.S. officials that the Ukrainians were not aware of the freeze until the end of the month.
Ukrainian officials being aware of the military aid pause by early August would confirm another part of the complaint filed on Aug. 12 by a yet-unknown intelligence community whistleblower.
“As of early August, I heard from U.S. officials that some Ukrainian officials were aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy,” the Ukraine whistleblower wrote. “But I do not know how or when they learned of it.”
These unnamed members of Ukraine’s government were told the freeze was no accident and were directed to reach out to acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to fix the problem, according to records obtained by the New York Times. Mulvaney said he didn’t speak with any Ukrainians about it.

Officials both in the U.S. and Ukraine previously asserted Ukraine didn’t know about the pause on aid until a Politico article made the freeze public on August 28, but the new report Wednesday stated there are documents and interviews which tell a different story. A new report from the Associated Press on Wednesday stated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was worried about pressure from President Trump to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden as early as the first week of May.

William Taylor, the Acting Ambassador to Ukraine, testified Tuesday that he was told on Sept. 1 that “everything,” including military aid, was contingent upon a public announcement from Zelensky that his country would investigate both alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election as well as Burisma Holdings, an energy company that paid Joe Biden’s son Hunter $50,000 per month to sit on its board.

Trump responded on Twitter on Wednesday morning by quoting Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe, tweeting that “neither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld” and that “you can’t have a quid pro quo with no quo.”

But the new report from the New York Times suggests at least some in the Ukrainian government were aware of the hold on aid for weeks while Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, and U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland pushed Ukraine to investigate a variety of issues. Meantime, State Department diplomats repeatedly communicating to the Ukrainians the Trump administration’s desire for Zelensky to publicly declare his intent to launch probes into 2016 and the Bidens.

The whistleblower wrote that officials at the Office of Management and Budget — run by Mulvaney — stated in July 23 and July 26 meetings that “the instruction to suspend this assistance had come directly from the President.” Trump’s controversial phone call with Zelensky took place on July 25. During that call, Trump asked Zelesnky for a “favor,” which was to look into a CrowdStrike conspiracy theory and alleged Ukranian involvement in the 2016 election, immediately after Zelensky expressed interest in purchasing anti-tank weaponry, known as Javelins. Trump urged Zelensky later in the call to investigate “the other thing,” referring to allegations of corruption related to the Bidens.

Taylor testified on Wednesday that a National Security Council call on July 18 included OMB staffers claiming they’d been instructed “not to approve any additional spending of security assistance for Ukraine until further notice.”
The New York Times reported that discussions between the U.S. and Ukraine in early August “did not explicitly link the assistance freeze to the push by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani for the investigations” but that those talks touched on the need to alert top Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak, who was talking with Giuliani and State Department diplomats about the Trump administration’s desire for investigations.
Zelensky repeatedly said he felt no pressure from Trump, saying “nobody pushed me” and there was “no blackmail.”
Mulvaney is named in the New York Times as the go-to for Ukrainian officials after, in a rare press conference last Thursday, Mulvaney admitted that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine partly because the president wanted Ukraine to investigate the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s servers.
Mulvaney said the hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid for Ukraine “was held up temporarily” for three “completely legitimate” reasons: “the corruption in the country, whether other countries were participating in support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice.”

Republican silence key to Trump in 2020

Texto completo: Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine met with The Enquirer editorial board last week, primarily to discuss his now scaled-down gun legislation.
The most important thing I gleaned from him was the insight he provided into the 2020 presidential election.
President Trump is going to win a second term.
And it will be because of sycophantic behavior in the Republican Party. The GOP leaders we count on to be a counterbalance aren't saying much. That includes DeWine, Sen. Rob Portman and Rep. Steve Chabot – all of whom voted to impeach or remove President Clinton from office.
Carl Weiser, who runs political coverage for The Enquirer, asked the governor what did he think of President Trump asking a foreign country to investigate a political rival. DeWine answered deftly.
"It's certainly not something I would have done," he said.
And yes, the governor supports the president's reelection, he said.
I was flummoxed.
DeWine declined to comment on the president's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Instead, he deflected the question like the seasoned politician he is. After all, he has held some form of public office since the 1970s, including two U.S. Senate terms before becoming attorney general and governor.
DeWine cited Trump's appointing conservative judges to federal benches as a positive. He could also throw in the strength of the economy, surely a plus.
DeWine then encouraged us to move on to Ohio topics, like the toll vaping is taking in the state.
Hmph.
This GOP has become the party of Trump, even though the way he governs and makes decisions seem wacky, counter-intuitive and erratic, and that's being generous. Is this still your grampa's GOP? It's not mine.
The Republican Party I joined a long time ago was the party rooted in the legacy of Lincoln. It was a party of ideas. It was the party of fiscal responsibility, freedom and liberty. It was the party of job creation and free enterprise and personal responsibility. It was the party of a strong defense. It has been on the wrong side of recent history on civil rights and social justice.
I thought that was Gov. DeWine's party, too.
The GOP is now the party of Donald J. Trump, who boasted he could shoot someone in the "middle of 5th Avenue" in New York City and not lose support. He builds up and destroys people on Twitter. He has publicly asked foreign governments to investigate a political rival.
DeWine is the opposite of this. He is a steady, thoughtful dealmaker who is skilled in the art of compromise. He is a practicing Catholic who is not loud or pretentious. He has been married to one wife, Frances, for more than 50 years.
If President Trump is going to win reelection, he will need to carry Ohio. And DeWine knows his constituents. It's the Ohio voters in small towns, in the suburbs and rural areas who like Trump.
Trump country is DeWine country, too.
Given another year before the presidential election, I wonder if today's breathless bluster around impeachment will seem like very old news on Election Day.
A poll released Oct. 21 by the New York Times/Siena College shows that voters in the six states that are most likely to decide the 2020 election oppose removing Trump from office but support the impeachment inquiry introduced last month by House Democrats.
In other words, rough him up a little, but don't hurt him too badly. What's the point?
Former Gov. John Kasich is the only Ohio Republican politician I have seen who has dared to oppose the president on substantive issues. He was quickly dispatched during the 2016 election.
No good politician wants to be at the receiving end of Trump's Twitter steamroller, especially our old-school Republican governor who has been around long enough to know when to hold them, fold them or walk away.
That's one of the reasons he adjusted his gun bill, so that the legislation could pass, at least, two months after that horrible mass shooting in Dayton when the urgent notion was to "Do Something!"
So, let's get back to that vaping crisis.

Aces likely won't be impacted by Minor League overhaul proposal

Texto completo: The Reno Aces are more than likely staying in Triple-A baseball and staying in Reno.
The story last week by Baseball America about sweeping changes coming in professional baseball prompted concerns about the Reno Aces leaving or shifting to a different classification.
The article said Major League Baseball wants to decrease the number of minor league teams, from 160 to 120. According to the article, Major League Baseball is considering eliminating up to 42 minor league teams and inviting independent teams in Sugar Land, Texas and St. Paul, Minnesota to join an MLB-affiliated league.
There are no signs the changes would impact the Reno Aces, the Triple-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks, according to reports.
The Reno Aces play in the Pacific Coast League. The report, according to Baseball America, says MLB is proposing to completely reorganize the full-season minor leagues.
There would still be Triple-A, Double-A, high Class A and low Class A, but those four levels would be completely reworked to make more sense geographically.
The story said that in Triple-A, the Pacific Coast League would shift from 16 teams to 10. The International League would grow to 20 teams. The 14-team low Class A South Atlantic League would be turned into a six-team league with a new Mid-Atlantic league springing up.
Branch Rickey, president of the Pacific Coast League, told the RGJ he has not seen any proposals for changes and that he is sure there will always be 30 Triple-A teams. Rickey wrote in an email to the RGJ:
"I am inclined to summarize that there are 30 Triple-A teams today; I certainly envision there will be 30 a year from now; there will be 30 ten years from now, etc. "There was a realignment of our classification in 1998 from 3 leagues to 2 leagues to accommodate MLB expansion from 28 to 30 teams and the need to meet a corresponding expansion at our level compounded by our new geographic distribution.
"The PCL has seen no specific proposals from the current talks that would prompt me to say there are impending changes that lie ahead."
The Baseball America story said MLB thinks some stadiums are not up the the standards they would prefer. The Professional Baseball Agreement (PBA) between Major League Baseball and minor league teams expires at the end of next season. MLB has proposed consolidating its minor league structure so that more than three dozen cities with affiliated minor league teams would lose those teams, according to Baseball America.
But the most vulnerable teams are those in the Appalachian League, Northwest League and New York-Penn League, a report in the New York Times said.
The report by the Times said MLB is committed to change "because officials believe about one-fourth of the minor league teams are not operating at a high-enough standard for major league athletes."

Texto completo: Facebook's latest foes: nearly every U.S. state.
A state-level antitrust investigation into the social networking giant now has the backing of a bipartisan group of 47 attorneys general, New York Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday.
The Democrat launched the probe last month with seven other states and the District of Columbia. It focuses on whether Facebook's dominance is stifling competition, limiting choice for consumers and costing advertisers.
The group of attorneys general also worries about Facebook's handling of customer data, Ms. James said. That drew scrutiny after firms were able to harvest information in attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.
The group backing the probe now includes 21 Democratic attorneys general, including Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania; 18 Republicans; and independents from 39 states and Guam.
Secret official's book
The anonymous writer behind the "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" op-ed published last year in The New York Times has written a forthcoming tell-all book.
Publisher Twelve Books announced Tuesday that the book, "A Warning," will offer "an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency." The publisher said the book's author is the same anonymous senior Trump administration official who wrote a Sept. 5, 2018, op-ed that claimed members of the administration were working to counter the president's "erratic" instincts and "amorality."
In the essay, the author wrote: "The dilemma - which [President Trump] does not fully grasp - is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations."
Actress, others charged
"Full House" actress Lori Loughlin, her fashion designer husband and nine other parents faced new federal charges Tuesday in a scandal involving dozens of wealthy parents accused of bribing their children's way into elite universities or cheating on college entrance exams.
A grand jury in Boston indicted the parents on charges of trying to bribe officials at an organization that receives at least $10,000 in federal funding. In this case, they're accused of paying to get their children admitted to the University of Southern California.
The charge of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery carries up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
Teen shoots classmate
A 17-year-old gunman shot a classmate twice in the torso outside a high school in Santa Rosa, Calif., on Tuesday. The victim then crawled into a car and rushed to a hospital, while the gunman walked calmly into class, where his teacher did not realize anything was amiss, police said.
The shooting at Ridgway High School began as a argument between the two teens, police Capt. John Cregan said.
Neither the 16-year-old victim nor the suspect have been identified by police. The victim was in stable condition at a hospital Tuesday afternoon and was expected to survive.

Texto completo: A television mainstay, he was also a playwright. His best-known play, "Norman, Is That You?," flopped on Broadway but went on to international success.
Sam Bobrick, who created the enduring NBC high school sitcom "Saved by the Bell," and whose play "Norman, Is That You?" reached audiences around the world after it fizzled on Broadway in 1970, died on Oct. 11 in Los Angeles. He was 87.
His wife, Julie Bobrick, said he died in a hospital two days after having a stroke.
Mr. Bobrick was already a television stalwart, having written for "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour," "The Andy Griffith Show" and "Get Smart," when, in 1988, he created and wrote the pilot for "Good Morning, Miss Bliss," a Disney Channel show about a teacher in Indianapolis, played by Hayley Mills, and some of her students.
After "Miss Bliss" was canceled a year later, NBC picked up the show, retained some of the cast (but not Ms. Mills), renamed it "Saved by the Bell" and moved its setting to California.
"Saved by the Bell" followed a group of loudly dressed teenagers who were mentored, and sometimes disciplined, by a principal played by Dennis Haskins. The show, whose cast included Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Tiffani Thiessen, Dustin Diamond, Lark Voorhies, Mario Lopez and Elizabeth Berkley, portrayed high school with a lighthearted irreverence that appealed to young audiences.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
New episodes of "Saved by the Bell" aired on Saturday mornings until 1992, and the show was widely syndicated after that. It inspired two spinoff shows, two TV movies, an Off Broadway musical and a pop-up restaurant in West Hollywood. A new "Saved by the Bell" series, starring Mr. Lopez and Ms. Berkley as adult versions of their characters, is slated to appear next year on Peacock, NBC's new streaming service.
Mr. Bobrick parted ways with "Saved by the Bell" early on to work with the producer Grant Tinker on "The Van Dyke Show," a sitcom that starred Dick Van Dyke and his son Barry. It was canceled after one season.
"In two years Grant Tinker is out of business," Mr. Bobrick told The Kansas City Star in 2000. "Nothing worked for him, whatever the reasons. And 'Saved by the Bell' ran 10 years and created an empire. It's in every country.
"So you know nothing. You never know what the right move is."
That sentiment applied to the plays Mr. Bobrick wrote with Ron Clark, whom he had worked with on the Smothers Brothers show. Their first Broadway collaboration was the 1970 comedy "Norman, Is That You?"
"Norman, Is That You?," which was directed by George Abbott and starred Lou Jacobi, Maureen Stapleton and Martin Huston, followed a Midwestern dry cleaner who visits his son in New York after his wife leaves him, and discovers that his son is gay and living with a boyfriend.
"It seems to be one of those nasty, smug little plays smirking continually at recognition of their own cleverness, as if they had an in-built air of self-satisfaction engulfing them," Clive Barnes wrote in his review in The New York Times.
"Norman" closed on Broadway after just 12 performances, but its run was far from over. It became a favorite in regional theaters in the United States, with productions that starred Milton Berle, Harvey Korman and Hans Conried, among others; ran for years in Paris and traveled to Spain, Scandinavia, Poland, Germany and Yugoslavia; and became the first feature film directed by George Schlatter, the producer of "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In." The movie, starring Redd Foxx, Pearl Bailey and Michael Warren, was released in 1976.
The Times reported in 1977 that "Clark and Bobrick have earned about $ 500,000 each from 'Norman' -- and no Broadway soothsayer ever thought that would happen."
Samuel Bobrick was born in Chicago on July 24, 1932, to Jack and Minnette (Marcus) Bobrick. His father owned an Army surplus store, and his mother was a postal worker. The Bobricks were Jewish, and after an anti-Semitic attack on him in his Chicago school, his family said, he moved to stay with grandparents in Benton Harbor, Mich., where he graduated from high school in 1950.
He served in the Air Force from 1951 to 1955, editing the newspaper at a base in Wilmington, Ohio. In 1956 he completed a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
After graduating, Mr. Bobrick moved to New York, where he became a songwriter. His most successful song was "The Girl of My Best Friend," which he wrote with Beverly Ross and which Elvis Presley recorded in 1960.
He began writing for radio and television and in 1962 moved to Los Angeles, where he worked on shows like "Captain Kangaroo," "The Flintstones" and "Bewitched."
Despite his long career in television, Mr. Bobrick considered himself primarily a playwright, and he continued writing plays until his death. In 2011 the Mystery Writers of America honored him with an Edgar Award for best play for "The Psychic," about a struggling writer who poses as a psychic and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery. The play, with comedic touches, was performed at the Falcon Theater (now the Garry Marshall Theater) in Burbank, Calif., in 2010.
Mr. Bobrick married Jeanne Johnson in 1963. They divorced in 1990, and in 2000 he married Julie Stein. In addition to his wife, with whom he lived in Los Angeles, he is survived by two daughters, Lori Donner and Stefanie Bobrick Owen; a son, Joey; a brother, Edward; a sister, Carole Swerdlove; and two grandchildren.
Mr. Bobrick and Mr. Clark collaborated on three more Broadway plays: "No Hard Feelings" (1973), which starred Eddie Albert, Stockard Channing and Nanette Fabray; "Murder at the Howard Johnson's" (1979), with Bob Dishy and Joyce Van Patten; and "Wally's Cafe" (1981), with James Coco, Rita Moreno and Sally Struthers, in her Broadway debut.
None of them ran for more than 12 performances, but all have since been produced on other stages.
"They all bombed on Broadway," Mr. Bobrick said. "And they've all traveled around the world making money entertaining the people. I would rather have that."

Texto completo: A panel at the Walker on Sunday asked, “Is local news dying?” On the panel were New York Times deputy national editor Jamie Stockwell; Rebecca Colden, former publisher of the Warroad Pioneer, a Minnesota weekly in northern Minnesota that closed in May after 121 years; Richard Fausset, an Atlanta-based New York Times national correspondent who chronicled the end of the Warroad Pioneer; and Suki Dardarian, senior managing editor and vice president at the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
Much of the discussion focused on the Pioneer, just one of more than 2,000 newspapers that have closed down or merged in the past 15 years, leaving 200 U.S. counties without newspapers. Visibly moved, Colden recalled vowing that “the paper is not going to die on our watch … and it did.” She didn’t like letting people down. But it’s not as if she didn’t warn them this was coming, as far back as 2017. “Nobody believed it would happen,” Colden said. “The Pioneer had always been there. … They thought there would be a savior.”
The Pioneer’s demise was “a death by familiar cuts,” Fausset wrote in his article. He spent nine days in Warroad at the very end, watching and reporting. “It was heartbreaking,” he said. The women of the Pioneer (the remaining staff of three was all women) had been doing “the hardest work in journalism, the most essential work in journalism – being boosterish about their community and also telling the truth about their community … The next time there’s a problem [in Warroad], there will be no fair arbiter, no place to share the news.” Fausset wryly noted that “anyone who wants to bilk a small community, now is the time, because nobody’s watching.”
A rare success story in newspapers today, the Star Tribune did find a savior – in Glen Taylor, the billionaire local businessman and Minnesota Timberwolves owner who bought the paper in 2014. Dardarian said that Taylor “could not bear the thought of the state not having a paper.”
Currently the Star Tribune is the fifth largest newspaper in the country, but it can’t stand still. It needs more subscribers. “At one point,” Dardarian said – and this was back when advertising revenue was still healthy – “subscriptions paid for the ink. We’re trying to get enough subscriptions to pay for the newsroom.”
Like any paper still alive – including the New York Times – the Star Tribune is reinventing itself, shifting revenue streams, seeking more ways to earn money (events, T-shirts, Homer Hankies) and moving to a digital model. “More people are stepping in to help,” Dardarian said, including nonprofits like the Knight Foundation. She gave a shout-out to MinnPost, one of the first digital news sources in the United States. BTW, Dardarian’s husband, Peter Callaghan, covers state government for MinnPost, which turns 12 this year.
While the Warroad Pioneer had an unhappy ending, the New York Times and the Star Tribune are robust. And the final questioner in the Q&A that closed the panel was a ray of hope. He introduced himself as the editor of his school newspaper, and the audience applauded. We talked to him briefly before the event began. He’s a sophomore at a charter school in Minnetonka. Starting the paper was his idea.
The picks
Now through Sunday at the Playwrights’ Center: PlayLabs. The annual festival of new plays in development includes Sofya Levitsky-Weitz’s “Cannabis Passover,” Dan O’Brien’s “New Life” (the conclusion of his trilogy), and Marvin González De León’s “Pan Genesis,” a comedy that examines what it’s like to live in a female-forward, sex-positive society. Now in its 36th year, PlayLabs gives playwrights 30 hours of workshop time with a team of collaborators and two public readings with time for rewrites in between. More than 70% of the plays featured in PlayLabs over the past decade have gone on to production. New this year: “Artists Take Action: The Climate Crisis,” a discussion led by Tim Guinee, founder of Climate Actors. FMI. All free, but RSVP.
Tonight (Tuesday, Oct. 22) at the Walker: “Northern Style: A Conversation with GQ Magazine’s Jim Moore.” The Walker hosts a number of interesting conversations. Next up, and likely more cheery than “Is Local News Dying?”: a talk based on a new coffee-table book, “Hunks and Heroes: Four Decades of Fashion at GQ.” Author Jim Moore is a Minnesota native who served as GQ’s creative director for 40 years. He’ll share fabulous images, stories behind them, and how growing up here helped him become an international man of fashion and style. Allison Kaplan, editor-in-chief of Twin Cities Business, will moderate. 5 p.m. cocktails and book signing, 6 p.m. program. In the Walker Cinema. Free, but RSVP.
Tonight at Magers & Quinn: Markus Zusak. The author of the international bestseller “The Book Thief” is out with his latest, “Bridge of Clay,” a New York Times best-seller that has been praised as “monumental,” “unforgettable,” “gorgeous,” and “so palpable you can all but feel the blood, sweat and tears that went into crafting the story.” This will be Zusak’s only stop in Minnesota. 7 p.m. Free.
Wednesday at Northrop: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. No tickets are currently available for this event – the 2019 Esther Freier lecture, presented by the Department of English at the University of Minnesota. But if you’re on or near the East Bank campus, it’s worth a try to stop by Northrop and try your last-minute luck. Nigerian novelist Adichie is a multiple prize-winning author whose 2009 TED Talk, “The Danger of a Single Story,” is one of the most viewed of all time. 7:30 p.m. on the Carlson Family Stage in the big room. Free.
Wednesday at a bigaplex near you: Bruce Springsteen’s “Western Stars.” See Springsteen’s new concert film before it opens in theaters later this week, with a bonus: a behind-the-scenes look including never-before-seen footage and previously unreleased music. “Western Stars” is the Boss’ first studio album in five years and the first to be backed by a 30-piece orchestra – Springsteen with strings (and horns). Screenings at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. Go here and type your ZIP in the box to find your theater. Ticket prices vary by location. P.S. One critic who didn’t especially care for the album changed his mind after seeing this film.
Thursday at the Textile Center: Artisan Textiles and Indigo with Aboubakar Fofana. Indigo is quite possibly the world’s oldest textile dye, in use since the early Neolithic period. Born in Mali, raised in France, Fofana is a multidisciplinary artist and designer who is internationally known for his indigo-dyed textiles and for reinvigorating and redefining West African indigo dyeing techniques. Fofana will be present at this pop-up show and sale to share a few words about his work. Go for the glorious blues and maybe bring home a pillow cover. 5-7 p.m. Free, but RSVP.
Friday through Sunday at Dreamland Arts: “Motherlanded.” Estimates vary, but starting in the 1990s, somewhere between 80,000 and 90,000 Chinese babies were adopted by American families. Julia Gay was adopted in 1996. In her solo show “motherlanded,” directed by Sun Mee Chomet, Gay uses poetry, memoir, and movement to honor the women in her life – her adoptive mother, her birth mother, the older woman who owned the Chinese restaurant she frequented as a child – and to share pivotal moments, including her return to China and the spot where she was found as a baby. Gay is an actor, dancer, playwright, comedian and teaching artist, a member of Ananya Dance Theatre and a Playwrights’ Center affiliated writer. 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. FMI and tickets ($10-20 sliding scale). Closes Oct. 27.

Texto completo: Un reporte de The New York Times hecho por la periodista Paulina Villegas afirma que los residentes de Culiacán apoyaron la decisión del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador de liberar a Ovidio Guzmán López, alias “El Ratón” .
El texto destaca que aunque analistas y medios nacionales y extranjeros cuestionaron la liberación del hijo de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , quienes vivieron la violencia desatada en Culiacán, Sinaloa, consideran que fue la mejor opción.
“Los residentes de Culiacán, la capital del estado de Sinaloa y el lugar de nacimiento del cártel, no comparten esos sentimientos. Dicen que la decisión salvó vidas” , indica la autora del texto, quien realizó una crónica de los días posteriores a los hechos violentos.
La historia expone los resultados del enfrentamiento y el miedo generalizado entre la población.
“Las huellas de la violencia estaban en todas partes. Los agujeros de bala golpearon edificios gubernamentales, restaurantes y hogares, e innumerables residentes llevaron consigo el trauma de lo que habían vivido ”, indica.
Las acciones del Cártel de Sinaloa provocaron terror entre los residentes de la capital.
“En los días posteriores al asedio de la ciudad de Culiacán por el Cártel de Sinaloa, los residentes se sintieron aliviados: alivio de que el terror haya terminado”, indica el Times. “Que más personas no murieron”.
La postura de los “culichis” coincide con la del presidente López Obrador, quien ha defendido la decisión de liberar a Guzmán López, a fin de de evitar más muertes.
“Ningún criminal vale más que una vida” , habría dicho el mandatario, quien este martes reconoció que desconocía que había un operativo para detener a “El Ratón”, aunque un día después de los enfrentamientos había dicho que respaldó la liberación del hijo de Guzmán Loera.

A misstep or a calamity for credibility — an assessment of Trump's Syria pullback

Texto completo: As the bloody consequences of President Trump's recent actions in Syria continued to ricochet across the region, experts back home clashed over what it all meant. Was his sudden decision to withdraw troops from the country a historic error that would gravely damage American credibility? Or was it just another misstep in America's foreign policy in a tumultuous region?
Early Monday morning, dozens of American military vehicles drove out of Syria and protesters gathered to register their alarm and anger, hurling rocks and potatoes at the departing tanks, according to The New York Times.
“The Americans are running away like rats!" one protester shouted.
At the very least, many experts agreed that Trump's actions were reckless.
“No one has a silver bullet for what should happen in northeastern Syria," said Peter Krause, a professor of political science at Boston College and author of the book “Rebel Power: Why National Movements Compete, Fight, and Win." But, he said, the president's hasty move and “the seeming lack of foresight or coordination" involved would lead to a string of negative consequences for the region and for the United States.
The main repercussion for the United States, he said, is “first and foremost this whole concept of American credibility."
Earlier this month, Trump ordered the withdrawal of the roughly 1,000 American troops along the Syrian border who were acting as default peacekeepers between Turkey and Kurdish forces. The move left those Kurdish forces, vital American allies in the fight against ISIS, abandoned and facing brutal attacks from Turkey.
The withdrawal has been widely condemned as a gift to such US foes as Iran, Russia, and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, all of which seek to fill the power vacuum. The House passed a bipartisan rebuke of Trump's action, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, wrote a critical op-ed in the Washington Post calling the withdrawal “a grave strategic mistake."
Many scholars and diplomats agreed, emphasizing that it would hurt America's ability to make promises in the future.
“The US had committed to the Kurds, had worked with the Kurds," Krause said. “They pulled out with basically no warning. That's not exactly holding to your word."
But, Krause said, the concept of credibility is nuanced and can be broken into two distinct parts. First, capability — if a country says it will do something, can it practically achieve it? The capabilities of the United States have not dwindled because of the withdrawal of troops from Syria, he said; so that aspect of American credibility remains intact.
The second part, he said, is believability — if a country says it will do something, will other countries believe it? It is this aspect, in Krause's view, that has taken a significant blow from the abandonment of the Kurdish forces.
Other experts agreed that while the American military's capacities remain the same, its diplomatic leverage has diminished.
Trump has “earned the reputation of a leader who does not keep his commitments and who leaves our friends when the going gets tough," Nicholas Burns, a career diplomat and former ambassador who teaches at the Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in an e-mail from Australia. “He has done enormous damage to our reputation globally."
Some scholars said that while an eventual withdrawal from the area was not a bad idea, Trump moved with reckless haste.
“US withdrawal is in principle a good decision, but the modality has been entirely wrong-headed: too abrupt, leaving allies in the lurch and enabling the Turkish invasion," Valentine Moghadam, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Northeastern University, wrote in an e-mail.
One of the most prominent concerns among diplomats and scholars is that the United States will struggle to form alliances with other countries in the future and will be forced to face down challenges alone.
“Everybody is watching, and everybody is seeing that the US is the one who gives up on its allies," said Ibrahim Al-Assil, a scholar at the Middle East Institute. Already Russia has swept into northeastern Syria, streaming video from an abandoned US base where Pringles and animal crackers were left by the Americans in their swift departure, according to The New York Times. The message to onlookers is clear: The United States abandons its friends. Russia sticks around.
By Assil's count, the Trump administration was the third successive administration to weaken American credibility in the region, which had already suffered from George W. Bush's bungled Iraq War and Barack Obama's failure to quickly respond to Syria's crossing of his “red line" by using chemical weapons.
“What's going on now is very bad, but it didn't start now," Assil said.
As for whether the damage would last, some scholars questioned predictions of long-term catastrophe.
“I think that the claims of this doing irreparable damage to our credibility are greatly overstated," said Andrew J. Bacevich, the president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
Bacevich said the Trump administration's treatment of the Kurds in this instance was “disgraceful." But he pointed to nearly a hundred years of betrayals and realignments internationally, including the United States turning on Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese Nationalist commander who had helped fight World War II, in the late 1940s; John F. Kennedy's betrayal of the Cuban rebels whom the United States had trained, in the 1960s; and the US abandonment of the South Vietnamese after the Vietnam War appeared to be unwinnable.
It was not even the first time that the United States had abandoned the Kurds, one of the largest ethnic groups in the world without a state.
“This is not an unprecedented episode in American statecraft," Bacevich said. “In every instance, it was possible to rebuild American credibility. You do that by not making a habit of betrayal."

Texto completo: The board of WeWork, the cash-starved purveyor of shared office space, could choose between two competing financial rescue packages as early as Tuesday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. One is being offered by SoftBank, and another from a financial consortium led by JPMorgan Chase.
SoftBank, a Japanese technology giant that is already the largest outside shareholder in WeWork, is offering to take a controlling stake by accelerating a $ 1.5 billion investment it had planned to make next year and by buying up to $ 3 billion in shares held by other investors, two people said. SoftBank is also offering to put together loans totaling $ 5 billion from a consortium of financial institutions, including itself.
JPMorgan's proposal consists of several parts, including new bonds, some of which would carry high interest rates, according to a person with knowledge of its plans. That package could add up to roughly $ 5 billion.
The potential cash infusion comes at a critical time for WeWork, which scrapped an initial public offering last month after Wall Street balked at its huge losses -- it had an operating loss of $ 1.4 billion in the first six months of the year on revenue of $ 1.5 billion.
WeWork's charismatic chief executive, Adam Neumann, was ousted shortly before the I.P.O.'s withdrawal as skepticism about the company's long-term viability mounted. There was also investor concern about an unconventional corporate governance structure that gave Mr. Neumann enormous control.
Under the SoftBank proposal, Mr. Neumann would relinquish the control he still has over WeWork as its largest individual shareholder and step down from the company's board, giving up his position as nonexecutive chairman, according to two people with knowledge of the transaction. It was not clear how large a stake Mr. Neumann would retain in WeWork if SoftBank took control of the company.
Once one of the world's most celebrated start-ups, WeWork was valued by SoftBank at $ 47 billion in January but had considered selling shares in its initial public offering at a valuation as low as $ 15 billion. SoftBank's latest offer to the company values it at a little less than $ 8 billion.
Under Mr. Neumann's leadership, the company expanded so fast that it is the largest private tenant in Manhattan and a major force in London, San Francisco and other big cities.
In recent weeks, it has been seeking to raise billions of dollars to keep going. In its I.P.O. filing, WeWork said it had $ 2.5 billion in cash at the end of June but also revealed that it was burning through hundreds of millions of dollars every month.
SoftBank, which has invested about $ 10.5 billion in WeWork, has more than its investment in the company at stake. A collapse of WeWork could hurt SoftBank's efforts to raise a second Vision Fund, a sequel to its roughly $ 100 billion technology investment fund.
JPMorgan also has extensive ties to WeWork. It was one of the lead underwriters of the aborted I.P.O. and has made large loans to Mr. Neumann. The bank had been leading talks with WeWork to renegotiate a $ 6 billion financing package that was tied to the public offering.
WeWork's need for cash is behind the urgent efforts. The company's rapid expansion requires a steady stream of money to pay rent and refurbish new locations.
In the 18 months through the end of June, WeWork used nearly $ 4 billion to fund operations and expand into new spaces. It could not have done all of that without a huge flow of cash from SoftBank.
The I.P.O. and loans contingent on the offering were expected to raise as much as $ 10 billion. WeWork must now try to get by with a much smaller financial infusion.
Some Wall Street analysts had estimated that WeWork would run out of cash by the middle of next year at its recent growth rate. But other experts say the company is already facing a financial squeeze.
Vicki Bryan, chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said WeWork might have been able to tap into only $ 1.5 billion of the $ 2.5 billion that it said it had at the end of June. Use of the rest of the money appears to be restricted because it included customer security deposits or because it was held by the company's subsidiaries, she said.
In the first half of this year, WeWork consumed about $ 1.5 billion. If the company has continued to spend money at that rate, it may have depleted most of its unrestricted cash.
If it ends up taking control of WeWork, SoftBank would need to make some tough decisions quickly. It could seek to halt WeWork's expansion to reduce expenses. The co-chief executives who replaced Mr. Neumann have started cutting costs and have moved to shut down or sell some divisions and assets, including a private school in Manhattan.
But that may not be enough to stabilize the business. SoftBank may also have to start shutting down WeWork's least profitable spaces and lay off large numbers of employees. The company employed more than 12,500 people at the end of June.

Texto completo: A young woman, staring at the positive pregnancy test on her bathroom counter, tries not to cry.
She flips through contacts on her phone, hovering between her mom, dad, and sister. In the end, she takes the elevator downstairs and talks to her doorman.
About halfway through the first episode of Amazon Prime's Modern Love, viewers learn that this first story isn't about romance, really. It's about familial love. The new show is based on the New York Times column "Modern Love," which publishes stories from various contributors with unique experiences in dating or parenthood. It may be "modern," but the message of the show is often more time-honored than you might think.
The first episode is based on author Julie Margaret Hogben's 2015 column, "When the Doorman Is Your Main Man." Hogben writes about getting pregnant by a man who eventually fades out of her life. When she decides to keep the baby, the doorman in her apartment building is perhaps her biggest ally. “He upheld and honored me for my choice, and protected my dignity and self-esteem," she writes.
Hogben and her doorman, Guzim (Guzmin in the show), had a two-hour conversation the night she found out she was pregnant. In her column, Hogben doesn't elaborate on what was said, but their conversation in Modern Love ends with a beautiful celebration of life.
Hogben's character in the show, Maggie, worries that she won't be up to the challenge, saying, “I can’t bring a baby into the world with a man that I don’t love or trust, you know. A baby needs two parents. A baby needs a mom and a dad.”
Guzmin dismisses her concerns as "conservative nonsense," adding that if she chooses to have an abortion, "No one is going to judge you." But despite the show's disclaimer, it's clear Maggie never wants to give up her baby, and Guzmin doesn't want her to either.
"Do what you wish," he says. "But don’t do it because you’re scared. You must own your actions in life. … A village brings up a child, and New York is a very great village.”
Getting back on the elevator, Maggie tries one more effort to argue with Guzmin, who has always frowned upon her deadbeat suitors. “You have made such a big thing out of protecting me from all these bad men," she says, "and now it’s like you’re encouraging me to live life alone.”
“But," he explains as the elevator doors close, "you’re no longer alone.”
Though the show goes to lengths to demonstrate that Maggie doesn't have to keep her baby, it's clear that her life is better off for doing so. In her column, Hogben writes, "My baby was a gift.”
Even before Maggie gives birth, she and Guzmin see the baby in her womb as a baby, not a mere clump of cells. When she rides home on a bike one day, Guzmin demands to know why she would take such a risk. She may be wearing a helmet, but, “That little child, only the size of a small fish, is he wearing a helmet?” he asks.
Maggie then shows him the ultrasound photos she's just picked up. She points out the baby’s spine, then its head.
“It’s like the whole universe in there,” Guzmin says, in awe.
Overall, "When the Doorman Is Your Main Man" is a delightful short story, and it's guaranteed to make a large number of viewers cry, especially when the camera pans at the end to Guzmin's desk, where he keeps the ultrasound photo years after Maggie and her daughter leave the city. Modern Love may not have intended to share a message about the dignity of human life inside the womb, but simply by telling Hogben's story, the show can't help but reveal life's value.
Maggie makes the powerful choice to keep her child, but importantly, she might not have done so if it weren't for a friend who promises to support her each step of the way.
“My daughter held a special affection for Guzim," Hogben writes, "almost as if she understood the role he had played as someone who welcomed her into this world with open arms, an open heart, ready and willing to guard and protect her, just as he had guarded and protected her mother.”

PRESS, DO YOUR JOB GIVE HUNTER BIDEN THE TRUMP TREATMENT

Texto completo: The press hates Donald Trump. That's not a newsflash. The bias the press shows toward most Republicans turns to outright hostility when it comes to Mr. Trump. Once you've convinced yourself your opponent is an evil racist, it's not hard to justify doing anything you can to stop him. Many in the press corps have admitted this. Most haven't, but it's definitely the prevalent attitude in the dominant liberal media. How can we have a fair election in this environment? That question is coming to a head now with regard to Joe Biden and his son's alleged corruption.
The Biden campaign has decided that their best strategy for handling allegations of corruption is to shame the press out of covering it. They have labeled any such allegations against Mr. Biden as Trump-inspired conspiracy theories and pushed newsrooms in an unprecedented way to ignore them. So far, it's largely working.
But based on the agreed facts known to date, it's clear there's something worthy of investigation when it comes to Hunter Biden's shady foreign business dealings. Here's what we know:
Hunter Biden received massive payments from shady foreign companies. Nobody denies this. He has had a turbulent and troubled professional career. From admitted substance abuse to an involuntary military discharge for drug use to failed companies, it hasn't been a good run for him. The Bidens' claims that Hunter was hired for corporate governance expertise don't pass the laugh test. He has absolutely zero track record of any such expertise.
Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company, paid both Hunter and his business partner Devon Archer a total sum allegedly in the millions of dollars over a number of years. Chinese private equity firm BHR reportedly sold Hunter's company a 10% stake for $420,000. This seems like a remarkable discount for a firm managing over $2 billion in assets and therefore likely raking in tens of millions of dollars in fees every single year.
Barring some other explanation - not offered to date - it sure seems that the only reason these deals took place was to curry favor from or influence over Joe Biden or other top government officials around him. To be clear, the fact that foreign firms wanted to hire his son to influence Joe Biden does not mean that Joe Biden was himself corrupt at all. It could be that these firms went into these deals in hopes of influencing Mr. Biden and that Mr. Biden, in the end, never did anything wrong.
There's only one thing to date that we're pretty certain Mr. Biden did wrong, and even that is likely not illegal. Mr. Biden flew his son Hunter to China in December 2013 on Air Force Two. On that trip, Mr. Biden met with the founder of BHR. Weeks later, BHR apparently closed on a deal for a $1.5 billion investment from Chinese state-backed investors. This all happened while Mr. Biden was the Obama administration's point man on China. Allowing Hunter to tag along with him to China on an official visit, where all this went down, at a minimum showed very bad judgment on Mr. Biden's part.
Was there anything more than bad judgment to these shady-looking Biden business dealings? Nothing more has been proven to date. The question at this stage isn't whether corruption has been proven but whether it's worth investigating. A functioning press corps would be all over this story. Maybe there's nothing more to it. But until someone thoroughly investigates, we won't know.
A massive number of Americans do not trust the media. The best way to counteract that is for the media to do its job.
But today, we have a very different situation. The entire establishment press corps, under direct pressure from the Biden campaign, has concluded that these clearly dubious business dealings are not worthy of investigation at all. Conclusory statements that there's no "proof" of corruption have been copy-pasted into every Biden article in The New York Times and The Washington Post since this story first broke. That's not enough.
It's time for the press to do its job and get to the bottom of why in the world these foreign companies paid Hunter Biden millions of dollars. Did they get anything back for their investment? It'd be nice to know.

Texto completo: Andrzej Zulawski's final film is streaming on Kanopy. And a mini-series starring Helen Mirren makes its debut.
What's Streaming
COSMOS (2015). Stream on Kanopy. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The final film directed by the great Polish director Andrzej Zulawski adapts Witold Gombrowicz's 1965 ontologically unsettling novel. "Mr. Zulawski, following Gombrowicz's lead, blithely discards narrative logic, and delights in finding images that will do justice to this writer's manic inventiveness," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "Some images are hauntingly grotesque -- like the dead birds hanging across paths in a forest -- while others seem to pulse with occult, Buñuelian sexual and religious significance." The film's images revolve around Witold (Jonathan Genet) and Fuchs (Johan Libéreau), two young law students, and their encounters with various residents of a Lisbon boardinghouse.
MEN IN BLACK (1997) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. What makes this late '90s favorite such an effective twist on the alien encounter genre, Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The Times, is that it portrays the human-alien relationship as comically undramatic. The existence of extraterrestrials is kept secret from the public, but for members of the government agency tasked with tracking them, it's old news. Will Smith plays a New York City police officer who joins the organization after impressing a Men in Black agent (played by Tommy Lee Jones) with his handling of an alien encounter. The partners are quickly drawn into a conflict when a villainous buglike creature illegally arrives on Earth.
OPERA (1987) Stream on Mubi. The streaming service continues its Halloween season celebration of Dario Argento's giallo horror films, a subgenre he helped develop in the '70s, which combines murder mystery with other genre elements like stylized gore, transgressive eroticism and the supernatural. This 1987 movie tells the story of Betty (Cristina Marsillach), a young opera singer who is being stalked by a brutal murderer after she assumes a major role in an avant-garde production of "Macbeth." As the bodies pile up, Betty starts to suspect the killer is connected to the murder of her mother. Blood flows as the plot twists and turns to the very end.
What's on TV
CATHERINE THE GREAT 10 p.m. on HBO. The empress ruled Russia for more than 30 years after ascending to the throne in 1762 following a coup d'état she orchestrated against her husband. But this four part mini-series focuses primarily on the tail end of her reign, when she was fighting to consolidate her achievements and ensure her influence survived into the future. Helen Mirren, who won an Oscar for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II in "The Queen," plays the enlightened despot, known for importing European ideas to Russia and expanding the country's borders. Jason Clarke is Grigory Potemkin, a military leader as well as Catherine's lover, and Gina McKee is Countess Praskovya Bruce, one of the empress's closest confidantes. ictoria Guerra and Jonathan Genet.

Texto completo: To understand how far it has deteriorated, The New York Times ran tests and found dangerous levels of bacteria.
The brick shack on the outskirts of Venezuela's capital is crowded with tubs, jugs and buckets. The water they hold must last the family of eight for a week -- but it's not enough for frequent washing or flushing, so the kitchen is filled with greasy pots and the house smells of stale urine.
And none of the water is treated, making diarrhea and vomit a regular occurrence.
"We practically live in the bathroom," said the mother of the family, Yarelis Pinto. Her pregnant daughter, Yarielys, sat nearby, pale and listless, recovering from her latest bout of diarrhea just one month away from childbirth.
In Venezuela, a crumbling economy and the collapse of even basic state infrastructure means water comes irregularly -- and drinking it is an increasingly risky gamble. Venezuela's current rate of infant mortality from diarrhea, which is closely related to water quality, is six times higher than 15 years ago, according to the World Health Organization.
But the government stopped releasing official public health data years ago.
So The New York Times commissioned researchers from the Universidad Central de Venezuela to recreate the water quality study they had conducted regularly for the water utility in Caracas from 1992 until 1999.
The scientists found that about a million residents were exposed to contaminated supplies. This puts them at risk of contracting waterborne viruses that could sicken them and threatens the lives of children and the most vulnerable.
"This is a potential epidemic," said Jose María De Viana, who headed Caracas's water utility, Hidrocapital, until 1999. "It's very serious. It's unacceptable."
In the latest study, 40 samples were taken from the capital's main water systems and tested for bacteria and for chlorine, which keeps water safe. The study also tested alternative water sources used by city residents during supply outages.
One third of the samples did not meet national norms.
This should have required Hidrocapital to issue a sanitation alert, according to the utility's own internal regulations. But Venezuela's government has not issued any alerts at least since President Nicolas Maduro's Socialist Party took power 20 years ago.
"The biggest health risk that we see there right now is water -- water and sanitation," the head of the International Federation of the Red Cross, Francesco Rocca, told foreign reporters this week, referring to Venezuela.
Venezuela's stagnant economy went into a tailspin in 2014, when a collapse in the nation's oil export revenues exposed the failure of Mr. Maduro's disastrous policies of price and currency controls. The economy has imploded since, with Venezuela losing two thirds of its gross domestic product and at least 10 percent of its population.
Spokesmen for Hidrocapital, Venezuela's water ministry and the ministry of information did not respond to questions about drinking water quality in the capital.
The risks posed by poor water quality are particularly threatening for a population weakened by food and medication shortages. But the problem cuts across the capital's social, political and geographic divide, affecting wealthy gated communities and shantytowns, areas that support the opposition and those loyal to the government.
In Terrazas del Avila, a middle-class neighborhood whose water the study found was tainted with fecal bacteria, residents buy jugs from private companies to cook or drink, said Juan Carlos Castro, a doctor and community leader there.
"This is not drinking water," he said of their tap water. "It's a public health hazard."
But buying water is a luxury in the neighboring shantytowns, where many survive on Venezuela's minimum wage of $ 8 a month.
During the regular blackouts and water outages, Aleyda Sabino's family in the Carapita shantytown walk to a nearby creek to get water. She has a kidney disease and is under doctor's order to drink a lot of water every day. She tries to, although drinking from the creek often results in fever, vomiting and diarrhea.
"I feel I will get sick if I drink the water and sick if I don't," she said. Boiling the water requires cooking gas -- another luxury that is unaffordable to many.
Overall, the new study showed a significant decline in the city's water quality over the last two decades.
Built with oil proceeds by the previous governments, the Caracas public water system was once an engineering feat, pumping 5 million gallons of water per second up thousands feet to the city's mountain valley through complex aqueducts and hundreds of miles of pipelines.
The system was part of a broad investment in public infrastructure. The city's piped cooking gas, its glitzy metro sprinkled with avant-garde art, its elevated motorways and its skyscrapers of public housing were examples of modernity in the neglected and volatile continent.
But while the rest of South America made dramatic improvements in drinking water access in the past two decades, Venezuela's advances were instead hollowed out by underinvestment, mismanagement and six straight years of a spiraling economy under Mr. Maduro.
Outside Caracas, the breakdown of the water infrastructure is even more profound, leaving millions without regular supplies and forcing communities to dig wells and rely on untreated rivers.
The collapse of water services has accelerated in the past two years, according to surveys conducted by universities and nongovernmental organizations. During that time, power cuts, pipeline outages, chemicals shortages and the mass exodus of qualified staff shook the state water utilities to their core.
Now, the Inter-American Development Bank estimates only 30 percent of Venezuelans have regular access to safe drinking water, compared to 60 percent in 2000.
"There hasn't been a deterioration of this magnitude and duration in the region in recent history," said Sergio Campos, the development bank's chief water expert.
The water study commissioned by The Times showed the main water supply system, which provides about 60 percent of the capital's water, was especially compromised. More than half of the samples taken from the main water system had insufficient chlorine; almost two thirds of the samples had levels of bacteria that exceeded regulations.
Venezuelan authorities have not published any public health data since at least 2017. But survey-based evidence collected by local health advocacy groups shows a correlation between the country's declining water supply and the rise of waterborne diseases.
The incidence of hepatitis A, a liver infection, rose to 150 times above normal in Terrazas del Avila, the middle-class neighborhood, following a prolonged water outage in March, said Dr. Castro.
In the nearby slums, procuring, cleansing and storing enough drinkable water is a daily struggle -- and a high-risk game of chance.
In March when a major blackout left many without water, hundreds of people took their water jugs to the sewage-filled Guaire River. In the Petare shantytown in the east, residents ambush water trucks to force them to unload in their neighborhoods.
In the San Isidro shantytown, water flowed for two days in September for the first time in six months. It came out dark with sludge that accumulated in the empty pipes.
The study found excessive bacteria in most of the sampled alternative water sources used by Caracas residents, such as mountainside springs, water sold in shops and water cisterns.
Ms. Pinto, the mother of five who lives in the San Isidro shantytown, bought water she thought was safer until 2017. She can no longer afford to, as she has no income and survives on the food her ex-husband brings for their children.
When Ms. Pinto's tubs run dry, her family trudges to a nearby creek with jugs to fill. More fortunate neighbors pay for access to a homemade system made up of miles of interconnected hoses that carry water from a nearby hill.
"When I drink the water, I feel repulsion," said Ms. Pinto.
Her five children are often laid low by vomiting and diarrhea, and the frequent bouts of illness make it hard for the adults to hold jobs. Only one of the four adults in the house worked, earning $ 8 a month cleaning floors.
But they have no choice, she said. "We have to consume what we have."
The study's researchers say the high bacteria levels in the samples are most likely caused by insufficient chlorine and the unstable supply. These problems have been caused by chronic lack of maintenance, mismanagement and the economic downturn, they say.
The economic crisis has shut down Venezuela's only chlorine plant for months at a time, said a manager at the plant, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. And frequent electrical outages allow bacteria to accumulate in empty pipes, say the utility's managers.
Several of the study's worst results came out better when new samples were collected and tested again several weeks later, implying Caracas's water quality varies greatly according to the chlorine availability and pipeline throughput on a particular day.
Electrical breakdowns and lack of maintenance have gradually stripped the city's complex water system to a minimum. Water pumps, treatment plants, chlorine injection stations and entire reservoirs have been abandoned as the state ran out of money and skilled workers, according to seven former and current Hidrocapital managers who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals.
Dorka López until 2015 managed a water treatment plant that serves about 220,000 people in the capital's satellite city of La Guaira. The plant's five-stage purification process was reduced to just one -- chlorine injection -- after a mudslide damaged the plant in 2013, she said. No attempt was made to repair it.
Gradually, the plant stopped even testing the quality of the water it was supposed to be treating, she said. The staff brought their own drinking water to work.
"We were no longer treating the water, just sending it out," she said.

Texto completo: Without his bodyguard of generals, the president is becoming the overseas arsonist his 2016 critics feared.
For a long time in arguments about the perils posed by the Trump presidency, my watchword has been: Trump is weaker than you think. Too weak to pass legislation. Too weak to get his hacks appointed to Federal Reserve seats. Too weak to use the bully pulpit, or any instrument, to boost his approval ratings above roughly 42 percent. Too weak to prevent leaks or maintain staff loyalty; too weak to plot dirty tricks without their swiftly being publicized; certainly too weak to hold on to power via extralegal means.
But if Trump's weakness makes him less of a threat to the constitutional order (such as it is) than some critics imagine, in foreign policy it's a different matter. There, a weak and flailing chief executive can do as much damage as a ruthless and aggressive one. A domestic weakness that produces gridlock and inertia, scandal and impeachment, is unfortunate but not necessarily disastrous. A weakness on the global stage that tempts other powers toward military aggression risks much more significant disasters.
Before he took office this was one of my major fears for Trump -- that his erratic, feckless qualities would inspire ambitious foreign leaders to test him in ways that made Jimmy Carter's presidency look like easy sailing. Trump "need only be himself," I wrote, "in order to bring an extended period of risk upon the world."
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
As with my other major fears (domestic unrest on a late-1960s scale and a stock market plunge), the worst-case scenario did not initially materialize. Trump's foreign policy was hardly Metternichian, but filtered through a bodyguard of generals his various impulses produced something that almost seemed strategic: near-victory over ISIS, de-escalation in the Koreas, a reasonable focus on containing China. And the world under Trump was in certain respects more tranquil than the world of Barack Obama's second term.
I gave the administration some credit for this. I hoped it would last once the generals departed.
It isn't lasting. Trump's betrayal of the Syrian Kurds over the past week is a moral travesty, but the Kurds have been betrayed by America before. What distinguishes this fiasco is its utter thoughtlessness, its disconnect from any strategic purpose, the sheer obviousness with which Trump allowed himself to be rolled by Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the inability of his advisers to salvage the situation before it led to war.
The constituent elements of the debacle -- the blunder itself, the bluster and excuse-making afterward, our pretend-strongman president's transparent admiration for the foreign tough guy -- were all exactly what Trump's campaign style led one to expect. So were the dead bodies, the refugees, the anger from allies, the glee from rivals. So was the message sent to those allies and rivals, to Riyadh and New Delhi and Jerusalem no less than Moscow and Beijing: that this American president can be easily hoodwinked and flattered and bullied, and the only repercussions will be Mike Pence showing up at your doorstep looking like a disappointed owl.
Even from his most reliable supporters, the defenses of Trump here have been strictly comparative. It's not as bad as the Iraq War/the Libya intervention/the Syrian civil war/the rise of ISIS. The foreign policy establishment is overreacting; far worse debacles happened on its watch.
And there's some truth to this. Trump became president because the smart people in charge of U.S. foreign policy failed in disastrous ways, and even after this past week his own failures haven't nearly matched their body count.
But the comparative defense only holds up until it doesn't. Maybe Erdogan's war can be contained, but maybe there's a regional conflict and a reconstituted ISIS downstream from this debacle -- in which case Trump will have repeated the blunders of his predecessors, but with vastly less excuse.
And even if this particular crisis stabilizes, the decision-making approach that Trump used makes Kaiser Wilhelm look like a model of cool statesmanship, and its application in a crisis involving a real great power could be catastrophic. Nothing about these events supplies any confidence that his advisers can effectively direct him, or that the kind of advice available to him (see Rudy Giuliani, shadow secretary of state) won't keep on getting worse. Nothing about the relative calm of years one through three guarantees that the test isn't lurking in year four.
Or in year five or six or seven, should Trump be re-elected. Which points us to the central issue for Republican-leaning voters and Republican senators alike. Both groups have grown used to Trump, in part because human beings grow used to all things, but in part because the most alarmist predictions, mine included, did not accurately describe his first two years in office.
But those voters and legislators have to ask themselves, at the polls in 2020 or sooner in a Senate trial, what seems more likely to predict Trump's governance going forward: The relatively restrained pattern of the McMaster-Mattis-Kelly period, or the unchecked impulses that just gave us death and betrayal and humiliation for no reason, none at all, save that our president is unfit for his job.

Texto completo: State official says he flagged the optics of son's Ukraine work in 2015
A career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about then-Vice President Joe Biden's son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer, according to three people familiar with the testimony.
George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden's position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition.
Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden's office, he was told the then-vice president didn't have the "bandwidth" to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony.
The testimony by Kent offers a reminder that as Democrats probe President Trump's alleged actions in pressuring Ukraine to dig up compromising information on Biden, the impeachment inquiry also threatens to keep alive questions about the former vice president's handling of his son's foreign work at a precarious moment for his 2020 presidential campaign.
Kent, who also testified about how Trump's associates raised unfounded allegations about the former ambassador to Ukraine, is the first known career diplomat to raise concerns internally in the Obama administration about Hunter Biden's board position. The Washington Post has previously reported that there had been discussions among Biden's advisers about whether his son's Ukraine work would be perceived as a conflict of interest, and that one former adviser had been concerned enough to mention it to Biden, though the conversation was brief.
During his testimony this week, Kent did not name the Biden staffer he said he communicated with, according to people familiar with his remarks.
Although many of Trump's charges regarding Hunter Biden have been unfounded, the elder Biden has faced questions about why he didn't anticipate concerns about potential conflicts of interest as he took a leading role in carrying out U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Polls show Biden with an advantage over Trump in a potential general election matchup, and Biden has sought in recent days to focus attention on the actions of a president many Democrats see as corrupt and unfit for office.
A former senior Biden national security aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, had no recollection of hearing about Kent's concerns, and also never heard a concern raised by the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the time. The first time the aide recalls Hunter Biden's involvement surfacing as an issue was in December 2015, when the vice president traveled to Ukraine to deliver an anti-corruption speech and the New York Times wrote about his son's role. Hunter Biden's board appointment had been publicly announced the previous year and reported by the media at the time.
The aide said that Hunter Biden's position had no substantive impact.
"I don't understand what the optics thing means other than someone thinking it looked bad in a political way," the aide said. "Did it have any effect on U.S. policies, either on what we were doing or what the Ukrainians were doing? It didn't. . . . In the aggregate it didn't have any discernible effect."
The aide said that Joe Biden was dealing with a lot during Beau Biden's bout with cancer, but that it had a minimal impact on his work.
"Day-to-day, the vice president was at work and he was pretty focused," the aide said. "Does that mean it's inconceivable that someone said, 'Hey, look, it's not the time to raise a family issue?' I guess it's conceivable. But I never saw evidence he wasn't capable of doing the VP role and dealing with his family at the same time."
Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement that "on Joe Biden's watch, the U.S. made eradicating corruption a centerpiece of our policies toward Ukraine."
Hunter Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company - headed by a former government minister investigated for possible corruption - in 2014, at the same time his father was leading U.S. efforts to crack down on corruption in that country.
The issue has erupted in recent weeks amid revelations about a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine's president to "look into" the Bidens, particularly whether Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor whose office had been investigating Burisma. The Democrats' impeachment inquiry is seeking to determine whether Trump withheld military aid and diplomatic support to Ukraine in an attempt to get information to use against Biden.
Trump and his allies have made the unsubstantiated claim that Biden pressed for the prosecutor's firing to protect his son. In fact, according to former U.S. officials and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, the investigation of Burisma was dormant at the time. And Biden, adding to the calls from others in the U.S. government and Western institutions, was urging Ukraine to tap a new prosecutor who would be more aggressive in combating corruption.
Biden has said that he never spoke with his son about his dealings with Ukraine and has said that he only learned of his position on the Burisma board when he read about it in news reports.
Hunter Biden told ABC News in an interview this week that he did "nothing wrong at all" but that he showed "poor judgment" in accepting the position on the Burisma board.
Joe Biden told reporters Wednesday that he wouldn't have changed anything about his actions, including discouraging his son from joining the board, and said he had no regrets.
"No. No, I don't," he said. "Because I never discussed with my son anything having to do with what was going on in Ukraine. That's a fact."
Biden has pledged that, if president, no one in his family would have "any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country." During the presidential candidates debate Tuesday night, he twice dodged a question about why he did not have a similar policy as vice president.
But on Wednesday, he said his new policy was developed not because of anything Hunter Biden did but because of the actions of the Trump family.
Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, hold senior White House jobs, while Trump has retained ownership of his real estate business, which is being run by his sons and has been the subject of lawsuits alleging that the company has been a conduit for foreign governments to enrich Trump in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause. On Thursday, the White House announced that Trump had awarded the 2020 Group of Seven summit of world leaders to his golf resort near Miami, using his public office to direct a large contract to his private company.
"In my White House, none of my children or family have offices at the White House," Biden said. "They will not be invited to sit in significant meetings of a Cabinet-level post and they will have no foreign investment, and the reason to do that is not because of anything that went on in our administration. It is because of what Donald Trump has done. He has so debased the standard of what constitutes ethical behavior that the next president has to make it absolutely clear - absolutely clear - this will not happen again."
Biden's campaign has been attempting to move past any discussions about Hunter Biden, and his team considers most questions having already been addressed. Biden aides also pointed toward the debate Tuesday night, where no candidate criticized Biden on the issue, as a sign that it is not resonating on the campaign trail.
"It's been asked and answered," Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, told reporters after the debate. "Democratic voters know that these lies are not getting traction and it's not the conversation they want to hear. And I think that was reflected in the fact that it was not a significant piece of the discussion."

Texto completo: New Jersey continues to probe potential conflicts of interest in the state's corporate tax break programs, and whether or not businesses misrepresented information in order to win millions of dollars from two recently expired programs now being investigated by federal and state authorities.
Audits and reports found that the state agency doling out billions of dollars in tax breaks to companies didn't have the processes in place to adequately vet applications and spot red flags, and raise questions about information companies certified as true in their applications and whether lobbyists registered with the state when required.
The agency granting the lucrative tax breaks, the Economic Development Authority, relies on fees from the applications to help boost the government body's budget, which is self-funded and doesn't rely on state appropriations. The fees get larger if an application is approved, which creates an unhealthy incentive and potential conflict of interest, according to lawyers on a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy.
"Part of that funding stream is the approval of applications that require diligence and require a gatekeeper," said task force special counsel Jim Walden at a hearing Thursday.
In 2017, the EDA brought in almost a third of its revenue from Grow NJ program fees, or $13.2 million. In previous years, the agency collected an average of 15% of its revenue from the program's fees.
If an application is approved, a company must pay 0.5% of the award up to $500,000, and again for when the tax break is actually issued. Companies then pay a service fee up to 2% of the tax credit up to $75,000. A company pays up to $5,000 to apply for a tax break.
Walden noted that the EDA underwriters he interviewed all said the fees did not cause them to approve an application, and they do not receive any bonuses for approvals.
The Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, which won a close to $80 million tax break to build a new practice facility in Camden, is the only company that included the fees it paid in its calculation that determined the size of its tax break.
"What happened is that the public paid for the EDA's fees," Walden said. "That money is money that the public was deprived of."
False statements Refrigeration distribution company Rainforest Distribution, which won a $2.4 million tax break in 2016, appeared to misrepresent information on its application to the Economic Development Authority, according to evidence presented Thursday at a hearing led by the task force.
The Queens-based company certified to the Economic Development Authority that it was considering moving to either Bayonne or Orangeburg, New York. In order to win a New Jersey tax break, a company has to prove it wouldn't move to New Jersey if it didn't have the tax break.
Emails between Rainforest Distribution employees and a consulting firm it hired, CBRE, suggest that Rainforest did not seriously plan on locating in Orangeburg.
Rainforest CEO Alexander Ridings, who was the CFO at the time the company submitted its application, admitted during Thursday's hearing the company had no serious intention of moving to Orangeburg. He said a commercial real estate firm the company hired, CBRE, asked for detailed information and reasons about why the New York site would also fit the company's needs.
Emails between CBRE and Rainforest employees show a CBRE employee named Susan Harte asking for a "lower cost option than NJ" and advised the company not to submit the draft lease Rainforest had from the Bayonne location. The company did not have a draft lease from Orangeburg. Harte asked Rainforest to submit a different document to the EDA "as it shows we are not so far along."
Ridings said he did not understand how this information would be used in Rainforest's application, and that it was the first time he was dealing with a commercial real estate firm and applying for a tax incentive. Special counsel Walden noted that Rainforest would have probably still been eligible for the tax break even if it just listed its previous location in Queens on its application.
"Effective October 16, 2019, Susan Harte, who previously served in our Location Incentives Group, is no longer employed by CBRE," CBRE said in a statement. "CBRE takes great pride in its reputation for upholding the highest ethical standards, which we demand from each of our 90,000 professionals around the globe."
Task force lawyers also read emails between Harte and EDA employees, and asked if the messages should be considered lobbying. Stephanie Olivo, the director of compliance with the state campaign finance agency, said yes. Harte does not appear to have registered with the agency.
"If special interests are not disclosed, there's the possibility the special interests are using illegal means to get their way," Walden said. Registering means "at least there's a breadcrumb trail."
The New York Times found that over five years, a dozen companies listed the same New York address at Blue Hill Plaza as the location they were considering moving to if they didn't win a New Jersey tax break.
The FBI and Philadelphia prosecutors are among a handful of entities investigating the two corporate tax break programs meant to boost job growth and development, Grow NJ and Economic Redevelopment & Growth (ERG), according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
A Senate panel is also considering replacement programs for Grow NJ and ERG, which expired earlier this year. An ethics committee dismissed a complaint filed by advocacy group Working Families earlier this week that alleged the committee was stacked with members with connections to insurance executive and power broker, George Norcross.
Norcross is tied to companies that won $1.1 billion of the $1.6 billion worth of tax breaks awarded in Camden, according to a ProPublica and WNYC investigation. The news outlets also found that lawyers from Parker McCay had an outsized role in the crafting of the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the revamped tax break programs. Parker McCay is led by Norcross' brother, Philip Norcross, and also represents many of the companies that won tax breaks.

Texto completo: Last month, Sharon Moore packed her bags and got a plane heading for Dallas. The St. Johnsbury-based real estate agent was on her way to a rousing event: a four-day workshop, held at a resort, that would bring over 500 voters from across the country to talk about politics.
When Moore, 75, initially received the invitation that she had been selected for a national polling experiment, she almost had to do a double take.
"I remember thinking, 'Oh my gosh, better check this out,'" Moore said. "So my husband and I checked it out and it sounded good."
In the middle of September, 526 registered voters from 48 states were selected to participate in a workshop in the Lone Star State. The event, titled "America in One Room," was organized by Helena, a nonpartisan organization, as well as the NORC at the University of Chicago and the Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford University.
The gathering was featured in the Oct. 13 edition of The New York Times in a special photo section showing the face of each participant.
'Historic gathering' Organizers described the event as a "historic gathering that brought together the most representative sample of the American voting electorate in U.S. history," to "participate in a nonpartisan discussion about the major issues of the 2020 presidential election."
Registered voters were randomly selected based on their membership with AmeriSpeak, a research panel headed by NORC. Some states, such as California, had 74 voters represented, whereas as places like Hawaii, Wyoming and Vermont, only contributed one.
A native Vermonter, Moore grew up in Lunenburg, but she's seen her fair amount of the country during her lifetime. Living everywhere from Missouri to Oregon to North Carolina, and attending school in Kansas, Moore and her husband eventually returned to Vermont, where she's remained for the last 25 years.
"I felt good talking about Vermont. So many other places don't seem to take the environment as seriously as we do. Or the social programs we have."
Conservative people, liberal people, very liberal people Voters spent the majority of the day in groups, debating a wide range of topics, from immigration and health care to the economy and environment.
"We broke into groups of 12," Moore said. "It was a mixture of different people. A woman in a wheelchair. A fellow from Montana. They were conservative people. Liberal people. Very liberal people. We just talked about our views on these subjects."
Going into the event, Moore, a Democrat, kept herself up to date on national issues.
"I'm kind of a political junkie," Moore said. "I watch MSNBC. CNN. Sometimes Fox News. [laughs] I like to hear what's going on."
As discussions proceeded throughout the days, despite differing opinions, everyone remained respectful, she said. While they spent the majority of the time discussing larger, national issues, their conversations were infused with everyone's personal experiences.
'We disagreed on things, but we were polite' "It was all very friendly," Moore said. "We disagreed on things, but we were polite. In my group, nobody got angry. One fellow beside me was very conservative. But he said he just can't vote for Trump, and he's worried Trump will [be reelected] because all the Democrats are very liberal."
When it came to the environment, one topic that came up was the tax on carbon emissions.
"Most people didn't like it, unless it was on corporations," Moore said. "In Vermont, it would be ridiculous. Because we all have to drive. I'm a Realtor, I have to drive. We all have to heat our homes. We all felt like having taxes was not a good fix."
On other topics like taxes, groups were uncertain about how to go about changing the current state of affairs.
"Nobody seemed to have a good idea of how we could lower taxes and keep our good programs going. There's a lot of things we need to have good taxes for," Moore said.
'We can talk to each other' Moore remains careful about how she discloses her political opinions with potential clients, but stays actively involved in her community, from her membership in a local women's club to her volunteering with the Northeast Kingdom's Habitat for Humanity ReStore.
"I vote, and I express my opinion," Moore said. "It's so controversial right now. Some people get very upset. Especially doing real estate I don't say it a lot. My goal is to sell property."
Gauging its success, Moore would like to see a similar event occur in the future.
"I came back feeling really good that we can get together and talk to each other," she said. "Maybe Washington should look at 'America in One Room' and say, 'We ought to be able to do that too.'"

The House’s impeachment inquiry is entirely appropriate

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s withholding of aid for Ukraine and subsequent phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asking questions about possible corruption involving Vice President Joe Biden’s son is yet another example of Trump’s abuse of executive branch power. Like his Russia imbroglio, the incident with Ukraine demonstrates that Trump has no respect for one of the most fundamental principles of American democracy: the rule of law. The House of Representatives impeachment inquiry is in many respects an act of exasperation. It also sends two important messages: The House will no longer tolerate being ignored by Trump and will use its constitutional power of impeachment to protect the integrity of American elections and established political norms.
Checks and balances
American democracy is predicated on sharing power through institutions that check and balance competing claims to that power. Norms such as accepting that Congress has specific powers outside the reach of the president, recognizing an independent judiciary, using civil discourse and the spirit of compromise during political negotiation, and accepting the legitimacy of political battles won by the opposition are crucial to a functioning democracy. If practiced with restraint and care, these norms can enhance a president’s effectiveness to govern. Trump, however, bases his presidency on the assumption that the power of the executive is absolute and should not be questioned. His unwillingness to compromise or recognize the viability of contending political perspectives has created a government of stalemate. Trump’s primary political motivation is to solidify his base. As a result, he has become the president for 40 percent of American voters.
Trump’s transactional decisions are made out of personal self-interest. His modus operandi is to “seal the deal” in any way possible through lying, changing positions on a whim, and intimidation. Ethics has no place in his transactional negotiations, nor does morality. He views all “deals” as a zero-sum exchange; the end result is to win. Ultimately, the consolidation of power is all that matters in his transactional worldview.
Blurring of public and personal realms
Since coming to power, Trump has blurred the traditional separation between public and personal realms of influence. Similar to contemporary autocrats, Trump views himself as the personification of the state. He has created a political culture in which unquestioned loyalty is expected from all levels of government. Trump, like other autocrats, employs periodic purges of bureaucrats and agency experts who oppose him. He has encouraged crony capitalism within the ranks of his Cabinet and the Republican Party, thereby consolidating their political loyalty.
Through the use of institutional corruption Trump has simultaneously enriched himself while his supporters buy influence. For example, the New York Times reported that “90 members of Congress, 250 administration officials and more than 110 foreign officials have been spotted at Trump properties since 2017.” Public Citizen, a nonprofit organization that monitors ethics in government, estimates Trump’s U.S. businesses have acquired more than $15 million in profits, mostly from political groups and federal agencies, since he announced his run for president. Public Citizen added Trump’s properties were “not hotbeds of political activity” before he became president.
With the fusion of state and personal interests, all politics become an extension of Trump. His personal gratification is seen as more important than the national interest. Under Trump, democracy has become a vassal of his demagoguery threatening the commonwealth. Yale history professor Timothy Snyder, the author of “The Road to Unfreedom,” describes Trump perfectly when he writes , “When the difference between public and the private collapses, democracy is placed under unsustainable pressure … only the shameless politician can survive, one who cannot be exposed.”
Actions speak louder than words
In Trump’s Inaugural Address, delivered in January of 2017, he stated, “When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.” But Trump’s actions speak louder than words. His political agenda has found plenty of room for prejudice. Trump has normalized hate speech, awakened long-dormant white supremacy and the concomitant violence associated with white supremacist groups. He has committed human rights violations against immigrant children by separating families along the Mexican border. He has tried to prevent immigrants fleeing violence in Central America from obtaining asylum in the United States. Patriotism according to Trump is predicated on division. The patriot is one who pays loyalty to Trump and buys into his politics of hate. For Trump you are either with him or against him. If you are against him and happen to be black, brown, Muslim or an immigrant, you are an outsider and expected to “go back to where you were born.”
Trump’s reactionary politics has systematically weakened the foundation of cosmopolitan, liberal democracy in America. The United States is no longer seen as a beacon of freedom or a refuge for those fleeing political violence. Decades of collective struggle to expand the right to citizenship has been abandoned since Trump came to office. Trump’s bogus populism based on ethno-nationalism has pushed a more exclusive and restrictive view of citizenship. In essence, he has redefined the semblance of the citizen and it looks very much like his base: white, monied, and conservative. Those who disagree with Trump for all intents and purposes become invisible. They are simply not worthy of Trump’s attention.
Given Trump’s normative indiscretions and potentially criminal actions, it is totally appropriate for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry. The likelihood of an actual impeachment of Trump is slim, given Republican control of the Senate. However, the inquiry will immediately accomplish two outcomes: first, the Democrats will be able to capture the moral high ground in taking steps to protect the Constitution and the ideals of American democracy which Trump has continuously trampled upon; second, the inquiry will provide a process in which Trump’s nefarious activities will be exposed to the high court of public opinion.
Risks for both parties
The outcome of these proceedings pose a risk for both parties. Trump’s general approval ratings have been in the low 40 percent his entire presidency. Morning consult’s August 2019 net approval ratings for Trump signal serious troubles for him in key states critical to his reelection: -14 in Nevada, -4 in Arizona, -18 in Colorado, -9 in Iowa, -14 in Wisconsin, -13 in Michigan, -5 in Ohio, -9 in Pennsylvania, -7 in Virginia and 0 in Florida. These poll numbers suggest a significant number of American voters may be suffering from Trump fatigue.
Past impeachment proceedings have always taken a toll on the American public. The ultimate question is who will be the recipient of the people’s scorn this time?

John Lithgow: Trump is a bad president. He’s an even worse entertainer.

Texto completo: Readers of this page have every reason to be suspicious of the political musings of an actor. I’m suspicious of them myself. But consider this: Our politics and our press are completely dominated by an entertainer president. In recent weeks we’ve even read about our ex-reality-show host president discussing foreign policy over the phone with the ex-TV comedian president of Ukraine.
Entertainment and politics have become bizarrely intertwined. Perhaps it’s time for a working entertainer to weigh in.
I call Donald Trump an “entertainer president” advisedly since he has proved himself to be such an inept public servant. Over the years, he has thrust himself into the public eye with the flamboyant histrionics of a latter-day P.T. Barnum. Part of this is the amoral tradecraft of a New York real estate developer, but a lot of it springs from the appetites of a voracious attention-getter.
Think of Mr. Trump preening at his beauty contests, body-slamming Vince McMahon at W.W.F. events or holding rallies that resemble the arena gigs of an insult comic. These are the antics of a showman, not a statesman.
Mind you, a flair for entertainment is not a bad thing in a leader. We can quote verbatim from performances on the world stage by Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy. Eloquence and wit like theirs have helped rally nations, defeat poverty and win wars. It took Ronald Reagan, an actual actor president, to put the perfect timing and emphasis on the simple sentence, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”
But Mr. Trump is something else again. Where Reagan was the product of the tight quality control of Hollywood’s old studio system, Mr. Trump emerged from the curated chaos of reality TV. He even impersonated his own press agent over the telephone.
As bad a president as Mr. Trump has been, he’s an even worse entertainer. He reads scripted lines like a panic-stricken schoolboy at a middle school assembly. He mangles every attempt at irony, self-mockery or, God forbid, an actual joke. He cravenly fills the hall for every rally with a hopped-up claque drawn from his hard-core base. And he can be grotesquely inappropriate at his public appearances, as when he babbled inanely about crowd size and margins of victory on recent condolence visits to Ohio and Texas after mass shootings in those states.
Pause for a moment and recall No-Drama Barack Obama. Remember when we would whine about how aloof and deliberative he was? Maybe there was some truth to that complaint but, wow, did that man know how to choose his moments.
Think about the time when, during his eulogy for the pastor Clementa Pinckney, slain in his Charleston, S.C., church in 2015, Mr. Obama began to softly sing “Amazing Grace.” Can you imagine a greater contrast or a sterner rebuke to the broad grin and upturned thumb of our current president after the Walmart shooting this past summer in El Paso?
It is dispiriting to watch the wretched excesses of Mr. Trump’s slapstick presidency and the rabid audience he commands. But there may be an upside to his crude performance art. His relentless lies, impulsive acts and gassy pronouncements have emboldened American journalists and quickened their senses.
And just as heartening, the Trump phenomenon has sharpened the wits of a whole new breed of entertainers. These are the daring TV comics who gleefully turn Mr. Trump’s outrages against him every night of the week: Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Seth Meyers and others.
As entertainers, they are everything Mr. Trump is not. They’re smart, informed, disciplined, self-aware and genuinely funny. Not a single item in the day’s news goes unexamined by these warrior satirists, and unlike the late-night comfort food of days past, their comedy is heightened by the bright fire of their anger.
Entertainment, it turns out, ain’t beanbag.
Everyone loves a good villain onscreen and onstage. Shakespeare himself must have especially relished writing lines for Macbeth, Iago and Richard III. But coldhearted monsters in movies and plays are the stuff of fantasy. When we’re sitting in the audience, some part of us is reassured knowing that we are watching fiction.
Reality is a lot less entertaining and a lot more frightening. There has to be a way to rein in real-life villainy in public life. Our government of checks and balances has finally taken on that challenge. With House committees examining Mr. Trump’s recent invitations to foreign governments to meddle in our elections, impeachment is not only possible but probable.
But it will be an uphill struggle. Impeachment would not necessarily close down this long-running freak show. Other forces need to be brought to bear.
Soon, with any luck, journalism and entertainment will act in concert with an energized voting public to bring an end to the Trump nightmare. If not, we’ll have to wait a little longer for quality drama and accommodate ourselves to a continuing diet of B-movie horror.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — For Elizabeth Warren, the hard part begins now.
The Massachusetts senator is unquestionably the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, which made her the focal point of attacks from her rivals in Tuesday’s Democratic debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden had an easier time of it, but this was not good news for him. At various points in the three-hour marathon, he faded away. His rivals no longer see him as the person to beat.
Beneath the jostling for position lay an important policy subtext. Warren was plainly far more comfortable defending her broader economic positions, particularly her proposed wealth tax, than she was in standing up for Medicare for All. The wealth on tax goes to the heart of her candidacy’s purposes. Medicare for All appears to be a position she adopted — somewhat belatedly — to fend off Sen. Bernie Sanders and attacks from her left. Her continued success depends on how she handles this tension.
Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., underscored the ongoing significance of the battle for the party’s progressive wing by endorsing Sanders, who strengthened his hand with a solid performance. Their decisions defined the difficult political terrain Warren faces. Her rise depended on her ability, simultaneously, to pull left-wing Democrats away from Sanders while also gaining new support from more moderate progressives. She made it look effortless. It will be effortless no longer.
The debate also marked a reconfiguration at the other end of the party. While Biden remains near (and, in some polls, still at) the top of the field, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., sense it’s now-or-never for them to replace Biden as the moderate alternative to Warren.
Biden had his moments on Tuesday, and he was especially passionate when the conversation turned to foreign policy and President Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, abandoning the United States’ Kurdish allies. “This is shameful, shameful what this man has done,” Biden declared.
Nonetheless, it was Buttigieg especially, but also Klobuchar, who dominated the discussion on the party’s center-left. Up to now, Buttigieg has prospered as a refreshing new voice in the party, but struggled to break out of single digits. He was earning more acclaim than support. On Tuesday, he played to win.
He was scalding in challenging Warren’s refusal to say whether she would have to raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare for All. “Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,” Buttigieg said. “No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”
Buttigieg shrewdly defined his space: bolder than Biden (“bold” was one of his favorite words), but with more practical, do-able ideas than Warren, and more of an “outsider” than the Congressional veterans on the stage. Klobuchar was also forceful — particularly in discussing the opioid crisis — blending moderation with family anecdotes that brought home her Minnesota roots. Still, both Midwesterners need Biden to weaken substantially and rather quickly, and the former vice president may be doing well enough to keep that from happening.
But will Klobuchar and Buttigieg slow Warren’s rise? Perhaps surprisingly, the moderates and Sanders share an interest in pointing out that Warren has not always been as enthusiastic about Medicare for All as she is now. She was careful in a New York Times interview earlier this year to endorse it, but she stressed the goal of “moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost” and stressed “there are a lot of different ways to get there. ‘Medicare for All’ has a lot of different paths for how we get there.” One can imagine her returning to this more circumspect position in a general election campaign, made easier by her choice to avoid issuing a comprehensive health care proposal of her own.
On the other hand, Warren was unabashed and effective defending her wealth tax — “Taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does” — and she can already fairly claim that she has fundamentally altered the national conversation on taxing large fortunes.
“I have a plan for that” has been Warren’s iconic soundbite. To this point, her strategy has worked brilliantly. Going forward, she will need to confront challenges from both her left and her right. She needs a plan for that, too.

Texto completo: 7 p.m. Oct. 23
Grandel Theatre
$22.13, includes copy of book
When photographer Pete Souza starting "throwing shade" at President Donald Trump, he was fairly subtle. 
The former chief White House photographer posted a picture of red Oval Office drapes, noting he preferred them to Trump's "gaudy" gold ones. On Instagram, Souza countered Trump's boast of inauguration records with a photo of President Barack Obama's bigger crowd.  
But news from the White House has gotten crazier, Souza says. "We're now in impeachment mode.
"I think the first year I was pretty subtle and at times humorous. I'm not as subtle anymore. Now, given the stakes of the country, I'm trying to be more pointed in my commentary."
After about 32 months of a Trump administration, Souza remains rattled by posts from the Potomac: "I'm still surprised that we have a president that lies to us every day and does corrupt things." 
Souza kicks off his book tour in St. Louis for the paperback edition of "Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents," which goes on sale Tuesday. The ticketed event at the Grandel includes a copy of the book. Souza describes his appearance as a visual presentation that extends beyond "Shade." 
The hardcovers of "Shade" and "Obama: An Intimate Portrait" both debuted on the New York Times bestseller list. Souza has a lot of fans. More than 2 million follow his Instagram account. 
"Shade" is a show-and-tell album and has been updated with 60 new pages that "show" Obama's years as president in contrast with Trump's "tell," i.e. tweets and news headlines.
Many of those headlines spur the "fake news" tweets from @realDonaldTrump: 
"The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!" (Jan. 6, 2017)
Or insults:
"When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!" (Aug. 14, 2018)
Souza responds by posting a photo of his former boss having a drink with Mexico's leader. Or a family pooch watching the president, noting, "A real dog waiting for a real President."
They are often amusing or even poignant and remind viewers of Obama's low-key presidential style. But they also are reminders of some of the things Trump said and did early in his own term.
Seldom does Souza get angry comments or emails from Trump fans: "There's only one instance when I referred an email to Secret Service." A few of the critics he's identified as Russian bots.
He's careful to note that he doesn't follow the president's Twitter account, but he does check on it and keeps up with the news. On Instagram, he refers to Trump as "Comrade Minus." (Rather than refer to him by his presidential number, Souza at first called him "46 minus 1," and the reference evolved from there.) 
Most of the time, Souza knows immediately which photo he wants to post to go along with a Trump tweet or quote. He took 1.9 million of them during Obama's eight years in office. 
"Every single photo we were required to save," he says. After Watergate, Congress passed the Presidential Records Act, so all records, including photographs, are preserved. They are now in the National Archives and are in the public domain. (There are limitations. The photos can't be used for advertising, for example.)
Souza admits he didn't immediately understand when people told him he was "throwing shade" on Trump. "I hadn't heard the terminology 'throwing shade' before. But I knew exactly what I was doing."
In the introduction to the book, he writes: "I had seen what the presidency required -- not just in the Obama administration but years before, when I was an official photographer for President Reagan. And both Presidents Reagan and Obama took the job seriously and respected the office of the presidency. That didn't appear to be true for the new guy."
Asked about the difference between working for Reagan and Obama, Souza says he was much younger during the Reagan era and didn't have as much access to the president (he wasn't the chief photographer). He does remember that the atmosphere was more formal than it was under Obama, whom he had also photographed during Obama's first term as a senator from Illinois. Souza spent almost as much time with Obama as the president's own family did.
Souza's work as an official White House photographer is to make photos for the historical record. On Instagram, he says: "They are important to convey information, context, mood and emotion." 
Although his work there was different than when he was a photojournalist for the Chicago Tribune, he says, "It's not like I made pictures any differently. ... Any photojournalist is trying to truthfully portray what is taking place." (Trump's chief White House photographer is Shealah Craighead, and some of her photos are available on Flickr.)
Now, Souza, 64, and his wife have relocated to Madison, Wis., from Arlington, Va., to be closer to his daughter. 
He's not retired but says he's too old to keep up with the demands of a White House job -- "It takes too much out of you."
In the meantime, his book encourages voters to go to the polls. He's predicting that Trump will lose next year -- if he's on the ballot.
"If he's still president on Election Day, I think he'll be defeated in a landslide.
"I think some people think he'll be reelected. I think that's crazy. I think the vast majority of people think he's corrupt." 
In the meantime, Souza keeps posting pictures. While Democrats seek a tape of Trump's controversial call to Ukraine's president, on Sept. 27 Souza posted a photo of Obama's talking to then-President Myung-bak Lee of South Korea. The photographer identifies the various officials in the office and says a photo of Trump's call could be telling: 
"Although Comrade Minus loves to host the reality show for the White House press pool, essentially staging Cabinet Meetings and Oval Office encounters just for the TV cameras, there is little visual evidence of him actually doing real work. "Congress should demand to see photographs of his phone call with Ukraine President Zelenskiy. It could provide information, context and mood: who else is in the room; where in the residence did the call take place; what was he wearing; is he joking or not."

Texto completo: His writings announced the death of Modernism, and the public spaces he designed were full of adventurous shapes and ideas.
Charles Jencks, whose writing on architecture helped define the field after Modernism, and who put his ideas into practice both in memorable landscape architecture and in overseeing the creation of Maggie's Centers, buildings specifically designed for cancer patients, died on Sunday at his home in London. He was 80.
His sister, Penelope Jencks, said the cause was cancer.
Mr. Jencks was an architectural historian who, with a landmark book, put himself at the forefront of the debate over what architecture should do.
"Charles boldly announced the death of Modernism in his 1977 book 'The Language of Post-Modern Architecture,"' Joseph Giovannini, who writes frequently about architecture, said by email. "He also brashly offered its replacement, Post-Modernism, stirring angry style wars that raged in architecture for more than a decade."
Mr. Jencks had little use for Modernism, the style emphasizing geometric forms and rational use of space and eschewing ornamentation, which had dominated the first three-quarters of the 20th century. Instead he advocated "radical eclecticism" -- he believed architecture should reflect the environment, should embrace symbolism and metaphor, and should celebrate distinct styles and merge different influences.
"If he was sometimes facile," Mr. Giovannini, who has written frequently for The New York Times, said, "he was always witty and erudite, and with his teasing polemics, he succeeded as an agent provocateur who helped open the field to other paradigms."
Mr. Jencks wrote numerous books, among them "Le Corbusier and the Continual Revolution in Architecture" (2000), "Iconic Building" (2005) and "The Story of Post-Modernism" (2011), but he was known for more than just words. As a landscape architect, he created intriguing, whimsical gardens, walkways and parks in Scotland, England, Italy, China, South Korea and elsewhere, many of them with science-based themes.
His 40-acre Garden of Cosmic Speculation in Dumfries, Scotland, "uses nature to celebrate nature, both intellectually and through the senses, including the sense of humor," Mr. Jencks's website says. DNA, quarks, black holes and more inspired its features.
His Crawick Multiverse opened nearby in 2015 and turned an old coal-mining site into a cosmos-related piece of land art that includes twin mounds representing the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. Another Jencks creation is Northumberlandia, a quarter-mile-long reclining woman formed out of the landscape near Northumberland, in northeast England.
"He put his causes -- irony, history, complexity, symbolism -- into practice in his own architecture," Mr. Giovannini said. "His landscape designs were brilliant."
Mr. Jencks also devoted considerable effort to Maggie's Centers, an idea that originated with his second wife, Maggie Keswick Jencks, during the seven years she had breast cancer and was furthered by Mr. Jencks after she died in 1995.
She envisioned buildings where cancer patients could go for the kind of welcoming support and life-affirming relaxation not generally offered in hospitals. He helped recruit leading architects to design the buildings and grounds, with Zaha Hadid, Frank Gehry and Kisho Kurokawa among those participating.
The first Maggie's Center opened in 1996 in Edinburgh. There are now more than 20, mostly in Britain but also in Tokyo and Hong Kong.
"Architects, like any group, are competitive and collegial, but with us it seems that each successive center has set the bar a little higher," Mr. Jencks wrote in "The Architecture of Hope: Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres," a 2015 book documenting the continuing project. "Their performance -- and I speak as a (self-interested) critic -- has been extraordinarily high."
Charles Alexander Jencks was born on June 21, 1939, in Baltimore, though he would spend much of his adult life in England. His father, Gardner Platt Jencks, was a pianist and composer, and his mother, Ruth (Pearl) Jencks, was a biologist and artist.
Mr. Jencks grew up in Westport, Conn., and Wellfleet, Mass., and studied English literature at Harvard University, receiving a bachelor's degree there in 1961. In 1965 he earned a master's degree at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, and in 1970 he received a Ph.D. in architectural history at University College London. His doctoral thesis became the book "Modern Movements in Architecture" (1973), which announced him as a significant voice in the field.
Four years later came "The Language of Post-Modern Architecture," which Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic of The Times, called "the book of the year." The volume, she wrote in December 1977, "takes architecture apart and puts it together again with critical wit and a nice bit of scholarly venom."
In that book, Mr. Jencks examined the good and the bad in architecture and faulted Modernist designs for saying little.
"We must go back to a point where architects took responsibility for rhetoric, for how their buildings communicated," he wrote.
"An architect's primary and final role," he added, "is to express the meanings a culture finds significant, as well as elucidate certain ideas and feelings that haven't previously reached expression. The jobs that too often take up his energy might be better done by engineers and sociologists, but no other profession is specifically responsible for articulating meaning and seeing that the environment is sensual, humorous, surprising and coded as a readable text."
Mr. Jencks's first marriage, to Pamela Balding in 1961, ended in divorce in 1973. He married Ms. Keswick in 1978. She was a landscape designer who had written a book about Chinese gardens, and the country house she inherited from her parents became the site of the Garden of Cosmic Speculation.
"When you design a garden," Mr. Jencks wrote in a 2000 picture book about that garden, "it raises basic questions. What is nature, how do we fit into it, and how should we shape it where we can, both physically and visually?"
"Serious garden art," he added, "is a heightening of both aspects of nature, its beauty and terror. Japanese Zen gardens, Persian paradise gardens, the English and French Renaissance gardens were, in some respects, analogies of the cosmos as then understood."
Mr. Jencks married Louisa Lane Fox in 2006. She survives him, as do his sister; two sons from his first marriage, Ivor and Justin; a son and daughter from his second marriage, John and Lily Jencks; a stepdaughter, Martha Lane Fox; a stepson, Henry Lane Fox; eight grandchildren; and five step-grandchildren.
In 2011 Mr. Jencks was interviewed by The Guardian about another gigantic land form, "Cells of Life," that he was working on at Jupiter Artland, a sculpture park near Edinburgh. What, he was asked, drove him to make works that sought to connect the land to the cosmos?
"It's something people have done even before they built Stonehenge," he said, "so why not now?"

'AMERICAN UTOPIA' at the Hudson Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 20). Heaven, David Byrne once sang, is a place where nothing happens. But Broadway is not. And it is hosting the latest theatrical experiment from Byrne ("Here Lies Love," "Joan of Arc: Into the Fire"). Byrne and 11 barefoot collaborators sing and discuss music and justice. Annie-B Parson does the choreography.

'BELLA BELLA' at City Center Stage I (in previews; opens on Oct. 22). Bella Abzug, the radical lawyer and politician, had a signature style -- jaunty hats, vibrant blouses, the occasional strand of pearls. Harvey Fierstein might not dress the same (well, he may don a hat), but he will channel her spirit in his affectionate tribute to Battling Bella, set at the close of a hard-fought senate campaign. Kimberly Senior directs.
212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org
'DR. RIDE'S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE' at Ars Nova at Greenwich House (previews start on Oct. 21; opens on Nov. 5). Blasting into space, doable. Navigating gender and sexuality on Earth, harder. Liza Birkenmeier's play, set in 1983, invites itself over as four friends (Susan Blommaert, Marga Gomez, Erin Markey and Kristen Sieh) enjoy a rooftop party the night before Sally Ride's spaceflight. Katie Brook directs for Ars Nova.

'FIRES IN THE MIRROR' at the Pershing Square Signature Center (previews start on Oct. 22; opens on Nov. 11). Anna Deavere Smith's astounding excavation of civil unrest in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, returns to the stage, starring Michael Benjamin Washington and directed by Saheem Ali. Reviewing the play's premiere in 1992, Frank Rich called it "quite simply, the most compelling and sophisticated view of urban racial and class conflict, up to date to this week, that one could hope to encounter."
212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org
'FOR COLORED GIRLS WHO HAVE CONSIDERED SUICIDE/WHEN THE RAINBOW IS ENUF' at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 22). Ntozake Shange's epoch-defining choreopoem, which premiered at the Public Theater in 1976, reappears this month. Okwui Okpokwasili and Adrienne C. Moore are among the actresses unpacking their lives and hearts. Leah C. Gardiner directs, with choreography by Camille A. Brown.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'IS THIS A ROOM' at the Vineyard Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 22). Is this a play? This Half Straddle drama, which had a celebrated run at the Kitchen in the winter, returns. The text is drawn, verbatim, from the transcription of an interview that F.B.I. agents conducted with Reality Winner (played by Emily Davis), an intelligence specialist who leaked evidence of election tampering by the Russians.
212-353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org
'POWER STRIP' at the Claire Tow Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 21). A play that doesn't protect from surges, this drama by Sylvia Khoury, set in the recent past, centers on Yasmin (Dina Shihabi), a young woman, originally from Syria, in a Greek refugee camp fighting for autonomy and amperes. Tyne Rafaeli directs for LCT3, with Peter Ganim, Darius Homayoun and Ali Lopez-Sohaili.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'SCOTLAND, PA' at the Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 23). Is this a musical you see before you? Yes. The playwright Michael Mitnick and the composer Adam Gwon adapt Billy Morrissette's cult 2001 film, which resets Shakespeare's "Macbeth" in a fast-food franchise. Ryan McCartan plays Mac, Taylor Iman Jones is his ambitious wife, and Lonny Price directs.
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'A WOMAN OF THE WORLD' at 59E59 Theaters (previews start on Oct. 24; opens on Oct. 30). When death kindly stopped for Emily Dickinson, the task of editing of her poems fell to the writer and editor Mabel Loomis Todd. In this new play from Rebecca Gilman, directed by Valentina Fratti for the Acting Company and starring the perpetually radiant Kathleen Chalfant, Loomis Todd, late in life, invites audiences to her Maine home.

Last Chance
'BEAUTIFUL: THE CAROLE KING MUSICAL' at the Stephen Sondheim Theater (closes on Oct. 27). Before it's too late, baby, you can see this 2014 musical, which is ending its Broadway run. The show follows Carole King, now played by Sarah Bockel, from her teen mom days as a breakout Brill Building songwriter to her post-divorce triumph. Ben Brantley called it a "friendly, formulaic bio-musical."
212-239-6200, beautifulonbroadway.com
'VICTOR' at Axis Theater (closes on Oct. 26). Edgar Oliver's new solo show, a chronicle of his friendship and love affair with a homeless man, closes its doors. According to Ben Brantley, Oliver is "a sui generis bard of urban solitude," who conjures an East Village "as cozy as Sherwood Anderson's 'Winesburg, Ohio,' and as otherworldly as a fairy-tale forest from the Brothers Grimm."

Chelsea Clinton says she’s asked constantly about running for office, encourages people to also ask kids not named ‘Clinton or Huntsman’

Texto completo: Chelsea Clinton won’t be following in her parents’ political footsteps just yet.
Clinton, the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, said on Wednesday that she was not running for Congress next year, ending brief but intense speculation that she would seek to extend her family’s political dynasty.
In an interview on “The View,” Chelsea Clinton said she was “not considering” a bid to replace Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, a fellow Democrat who said last week that she would not seek reelection in 2020.
Clinton, the daughter of a president and a U.S. senator, had never explicitly expressed interest in the seat, but she said in an interview last year that she would weigh running for office “if someone were to step down or retire.” After Lowey’s announcement, the idea of Clinton entering the race seemed a viable possibility, because Lowey represents much of Westchester and Rockland counties, north of New York City, where Clinton’s parents live and where the Clintons remain popular.
Clinton herself does not live in the district, but under the U.S. Constitution, a member of Congress must live only in the state they seek to represent, not the specific district.
For days, representatives for Clinton did not answer questions about the former first daughter’s plans, further fueling speculation. Her remarks on Wednesday were her first comments on the topic.
Clinton’s pronouncement clearly disappointed some audience members on the television program. When one of the show’s hosts, Whoopi Goldberg, asked whether Clinton would run, the studio broke out in applause. When Clinton said no, one host exclaimed, “No! Why not?”
Clinton said she understood the interest.
“Someone has asked me some version of this question for literally as long as I can remember,” she said.
“Abby’s nodding,” she added, referring to Abby Huntsman, another co-host, whose father, Jon Huntsman Jr., served as the Republican governor of Utah and the ambassador to Russia under President Donald Trump.
But, she continued, “I think it’s a question that shouldn’t just be asked of someone whose last name is Clinton or Huntsman. It’s a question we should be asking kids: ‘Do you think about running for office one day?’ Young people, women.”
Clinton also noted that she had recently given birth to her third child.
Her announcement likely came as a relief to the other candidates vying to replace Lowey, who was first elected in 1988, and who rose to become the first woman to lead the powerful House Appropriations Committee.
They include Mondaire Jones, a lawyer who had declared a primary challenge to Lowey before she announced her retirement, and Assemblyman David Buchwald, a four-term Democrat who entered the race after Lowey’s announcement. State Sen. David Carlucci has also expressed interest.
On the Republican side, Rob Astorino, a former candidate for governor, is also said to be considering a bid. The district is considered safely Democratic, but Astorino spent eight years as county executive of Westchester.
In the days before Clinton broke her silence on Wednesday, the possibility of another Clinton candidacy had inspired a full gamut of reaction, from excitement to revulsion.
Even on “The View,” the co-hosts responded differently. While one host, Sunny Hostin, seemed crestfallen, another, Meghan McCain — the daughter of the former Republican senator and presidential candidate John McCain — had a milder reaction. “There’s some disappointed people in the audience,” she said, “but it’s OK.”
But in closing the door on a run for office next year, Clinton did not entirely rule out a future one.
“One day you might,” Huntsman said.
“Maybe,” Clinton replied. “Maybe. But not now.”
Editor’s Note: Abby Huntsman is the niece of Paul Huntsman, The Salt Lake Tribune’s owner and publisher.

Texto completo: El jefe interino del gabinete del presidente Donald Trump, Mick Mulvaney, reconoció este jueves en una conferencia de prensa que Estados Unidos detuvo la ayuda a Ucrania después de solicitar a este país que investigara a un servidor del Comité Nacional Demócrata . Mulvaney quitó hierro al asunto y negó que esta solicitud tuviera relación alguna con Joe Biden o su hijo Hunter.
“ Lo hacemos todo el tiempo con nuestra política exterior “, dijo el jefe de gabinete para justificar que el gobierno haya s olicitado a Ucrania algo a cambio (quid pro quo) de la ayuda estadounidense a otros países . Mulvaney se refirió específicamente al pedido de Trump para que su homólogo ucraniano investigara a un servidor del Comité Demócrata Nacional (CDN) .

“¿Me habló (Trump) en el pasado sobre la corrupción relacionada al servidor de CND? Absolutamente. No hay duda de eso. Y por eso fue que frenamos el dinero”, dijo Mulvaney a los periodistas de la Casa Blanca. El jefe del gabinete de la Casa Blanca dijo también que una de las principales preocupaciones de Trump era “ investigar qué fue lo que ocurrió en 2016 “, en referencia a la corrupción en Ucrania.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, effectively confirmed the main premise of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry on Thursday, telling reporters that aid was held back from Ukraine in part to prod the country to investigate Democrats https://t.co/Uep9uueYlf
— The New York Times (@nytimes) October 17, 2019
Mulvaney reconocía con sus palabras que Trump había detenido la ayuda a Ucrania, en parte, para presionar al país a investigar al servidor demócrata . Sin embargo, poco después Mulvaney se retractó de sus palabras y dijo que el corte de la financiación no condicionaba a Ucrania a indagar una supuesta interferencia en las elecciones de 2016 y acusó a la prensa de “malinterpretar” sus palabras para “avanzar en una caza de bruja […] contra el presidente Trump”.
“Déjenme ser claro, no hubo absolutamente ningún quid pro quo entre la ayuda militar ucraniana y cualquier investigación sobre las elecciones de 2016″, aclaró a posteriori. “El presidente nunca me pidió retener nada de dinero hasta que los ucranianos hicieran algo relacionado con el servidor”. Mulvaney insistió en explicar que la única razón por la que detuvieron los fondos de seguridad fue para revisar que otras naciones estaban implicadas en acabar con la corrupción.

Recibe una sentencia de 15 años tras declararse culpable de posesión de cocaína…era leche en polvo

Texto completo: Un hombre sin hogar atravesaba un vecindario industrial en el centro de Oklahoma City el 12 de agosto cuando la policía lo vio. Pasaba de las 10 p.m. y los oficiales observaron que el desaliñado hombre sin camisa y una mochila al hombro no tenía luces traseras en su bicicleta.
Cuando intentaron detenerlo, Cody Gregg aceleró más para luego tirar la bicicleta unas cuadras adelante e intentar huir a pie. Los policías lo alcanzaron e inspeccionaron su mochila. Dentro encontraron un sospechoso polvo blanco en una lata de café, según documentos judiciales consultados por el diario The Oklahoman.
“Dentro del bolso había una gran cantidad de substancia blanca en polvo que basado en mi experiencia y mi entrenamiento creí que se trataba de cocaína”, dijo el oficial que hizo la revisión, según el diario citado. “Más tarde, el polvo blanco dentro del bolso dio resultado positivo para cocaína y era un paquete que pesaba en total 45.91 gramos de cocaína”, añadió.
Gregg fue acusado de posesión de cocaína con intención de distribución y fue enviado a la cárcel del condado de Oklahoma mientras aguardaba su juicio. Él se declaró inocente. Pero la semana pasada, tras dos meses, su arresto fue en agosto, se cansó de esperar y se declaró culpable. Fue sentenciado a 15 años en prisión.
La cárcel del condado de Oklahoma ha estado plagada de problemas durante años, como goteras, moho, sobrepoblación y una tasa de suicidios y muertes mayor a la del promedio nacional, según The Oklahoman.
El jueves pasado, sólo dos días después de recibir su prolongada sentencia, resultados de laboratorio demostraron que el polvo blanco no era cocaína, sino leche en polvo. Gregg le dijo al juez que había conseguido la leche de un dispensario de alimentos, según el diario citado.
Al día siguiente, Gregg solicitó a la corte que le permitieran retirar su declaración de culpabilidad, a la luz de la nueva evidencia. El juez de distrito Timothy R. Henderson concedió su petición y además desechó los cargos en su contra.
Gregg estaba bajo libertad condicional al momento de su arresto. Según documentos de la corte consultados por el diario The Washington Post, había sido arrestado por cargos relacionados con narcóticos al menos unas tres veces desde 2014.
El viernes salió en libertad.
El Washington Post reporta que no es la primera vez que un resultado de laboratorio equivocado termina en la convicción de una persona inocente. Las pruebas químicas que utilizan las policías alrededor de todo el país para determinar si una substancia es ilícita fallan frecuentemente.
En 2016, una investigación del diario The New York Times y la organización de periodistas sin fines de lucro ProPublica, revelaron que hay miles de personas en la cárcel por pruebas que tienen un amplio margen de error.
Una lista de los artículos que han dado un falso positivo a cocaína, recogida por el Washington Post, incluyó cosas como galletas de chocolate, el glaseado de una dona Krispy Cream y tabletas de menta. Algunos estudios citados por este diario indican que un quinto o hasta un tercio de las pruebas están erradas. Sin embargo, las policías las siguen utilizando como una herramienta cotidiana.
La historia de Gregg ilustra otro problema: muchas personas prefieren declararse culpables para no tener que esperar meses o incluso años para tener un juicio. Más de la mitad de las personas acusadas de delitos de drogas con base en una prueba de laboratorio errada se declararon culpables a la primera oportunidad, según el estudio del New York Times y ProPublica.

Texto completo: Mick Ruis is asking for answers. He is seeking a hearing from the California Horse Racing Board to revisit the race that launched Justify toward a Triple Crown and the disregarded drug test that has tainted that achievement.
Tuesday, that request was rejected.
"Please be advised that the Board dismissed the matter as authorized under (California) Business and Professions Code 19577(d)," CHRB counsel John McDonough wrote in reply to a letter from Ruis' attorney, Darrell Vienna. "Therefore, further hearing on the subject is not required or warranted."
These are probably not the last words on that subject.
"The request for a hearing is necessary to exhaust administrative remedies prior to litigation," Vienna said via e-mail Tuesday night. "However, at this point, we are hopeful that the CHRB will provide a full, open and transparent hearing. Should the CHRB fail to provide such a hearing, we do not rule out the pursuit of any and all legal remedies."
"We don't want to make a big scene out of this," Ruis said. "But we want to get to the bottom of it."
The owner/trainer of Bolt d'Oro wants to press the CHRB on its decision against disqualifying Justify from the Santa Anita Derby despite a failed drug test; a race that enabled the lightly raced colt to qualify for the Kentucky Derby and cost Ruis $400,000 in purse money.
Substantial traces of the banned substance scopolamine were found in Justify's urine following his three-length victory over Ruis' Bolt d'Oro at Santa Anita. But the results of that test and the process by which regulators gave Bob Baffert's horse a pass were not shared publicly until the New York Times broke the story last month.
Though the CHRB's position has been that Justify's positive test was the result of an "environmental contaminant" rather than chemical chicanery, Ruis questions whether the board abused its discretion in a case fraught with conflicts of interest and seeming double standards.
At the time the CHRB began its deliberations, Baffert was training a horse for the board's then-chairman, Chuck Winner. Meanwhile, California had yet to adopt standards revised by the Association of Racing Commissioners International downgrading scopolamine from a Class 3b substance – one which could have triggered disqualification – to a less serious level 4c.
News of Justify's drug test and the CHRB's failure to get ahead of the story has proved to be a royal pain to the sport of kings; another argument for national oversight of racing and another blow to a business reeling from a rash of fatalities at Santa Anita.
"Denial of further investigation into the potential corruption in California continues to drag down the industry and compromise the welfare of the horses," Animal Wellness Action executive director Marty Irby said Wednesday in response to the CHRB's stance. "Congress should intervene."
Horses commonly ingest scopolamine when jimson weed infiltrates their feed, and multiple veterinarians have expressed doubt about its benefits. Dr. Mary Scollay, executive director of the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium, suspects the substance may be more "performance-impeding than performance-enhancing."
"It's not clear why anyone would administer that in hopes of getting an advantage," she said.
Still, inasmuch as winning the 2018 Santa Anita Derby was worth $600,000 and second place paid only $200,000, Ruis has a hefty financial incentive to overturn the CHRB's decision. And he's not the only potential plaintiff. Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, who is battling a ban from multiple California tracks, saddled fourth-place finisher Instilled Regard in the 2018 Santa Anita Derby.
Had Justify been promptly disqualified – implausible given the turnaround time for drug testing and CHRB procedures – third-place finisher Core Beliefs would have had enough points to qualify for the Kentucky Derby.
"A rule's a rule," Ruis said. "It was a banned substance. It was an overage. That's it: disqualification. You don't get to appeal, 'Oh it was jimson weed.' You know what? Everybody on the backside can make an excuse for something, right? But not everybody has money to hire an attorney so they can continue to race."
Ruis, who purchased the Woodford Throughbreds farm outside Lexington in the spring, has the means to pursue the matter and is motivated by the belief Justify's drug test was "swept under the rug."
"I'd rather fight than go and argue in a court," he said. "It's ridiculous to hire an attorney. To hire attorneys is the last thing Mick Ruis ever does. I think it's a waste of money. But I had so many people on the backside who said, 'Mick, we've got to stop this. This is ridiculous.' I mean, very, very credible horsemen. . .
"I could care less about the $400,000. That's not it. But I do care for every small trainer and little guy who is running and racing clean on the backside to have a chance. Let the best horse win, not the best whatever-else-they-use win."
Vienna said the request for a hearing is "based upon evidence that members of the CHRB were not apprised of significant and essential facts and were misinformed regarding existing rules and regulations." He declined to elaborate.
"I would hope the CHRB would do the right thing," Ruis said. "But then again, if they don't and we go farther, I would sure love to start subpoenaing records and stuff like that. Then we can really find out what went on."

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio -- The Democratic debate stage is getting bigger, but television ratings are getting smaller.
The primary debate on Tuesday night in Ohio, co-sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, drew about 8.3 million live television viewers on CNN, Nielsen said on Wednesday. The event featured 12 candidates, up from the 10 who debated last month in Houston at an event seen by about 14 million people on ABC News and Univision.
Interest in the 2020 presidential race is clearly strong. The 8.3 million people who watched on Tuesday roughly equaled the number of viewers for a 2008 matchup between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, days before the so-called Super Tuesday primary night.
But the three-hour Ohio event -- which featured a cavalcade of candidates attacking Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- did not perform much better than this year's lowest-rated primary debate, a CNN forum in late July in Detroit with 8.2 million viewers.
Some viewers may be growing tired of watching an oversize Democratic field. A dozen candidates qualified for Tuesday's debate, based on criteria set by Democratic officials, who are keen to avoid any suggestion of skewing their party's presidential contest.
This was also the first debate to be held since the start of the fall TV season, when viewers flock to new episodes of their favorite shows. Over all, the Ohio debate -- which was also competing with Game 4 of the National League Championship Series -- was the third-most-viewed program on television on Tuesday, behind episodes of "N.C.I.S." and "F.B.I." on CBS.
Online viewership is not included in Nielsen numbers, and many people most likely watched via Facebook and other streaming venues. CNN said that at any given minute of Tuesday's debate, an average of 450,000 people were watching on CNN.com or nytimes.com.
Held in a converted gymnasium at Otterbein University in Ohio, the event featured the most candidates ever assembled on a primary debate stage. Producers faced a difficult task in choreographing the stage, but for the most part, the night went smoothly.
The moderating team -- Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper, of CNN, and a television newcomer, Marc Lacey, the national editor of The Times -- kept outbursts and interruptions to a minimum. The journalists also stepped back at times to allow the candidates to engage one another directly. Organizers granted 75 seconds for each candidate to respond to questions, up from 60 seconds for the last round of CNN debates.
Candidates were at their lecterns for the 8 p.m. start time, and the questions began immediately. It was a more restrained approach than CNN's debates in Detroit, which featured a singing of the national anthem in prime time and a Hollywood-style introductory video that some mocked as hyperbolic.
This was also the year's first Democratic debate to start with questions about President Trump and his behavior in the White House. Earlier debates began with a detailed policy discussion about health care.
The next Democratic debate, on Nov. 20 in Georgia, will be broadcast on MSNBC, with The Washington Post as a co-sponsor.

Rivals repeatedly criticize Warren during Democratic debate

Texto completo: BY STEVE PEOPLES, WILL WEISSERT
And DARLENE SUPERVILLE
The Associated Press
Elizabeth Warren's rivals repeatedly jabbed at her during Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, accusing the Massachusetts senator of ducking questions about the costs of Medicare for All universal health insurance and her signature "wealth tax" plan.
Taking hits from all sides reflected Warren's rise to a front-runner in the crowded field of candidates who are looking to deny President Donald Trump a second term. Joe Biden, who has led the Democratic field for months, had to address Trump's unsupported accusations of wrongdoing by him and his son in Ukraine, but by and large avoided confrontation with his rivals.
Mostly out of the fray was Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who spent the past two weeks recuperating at his Vermont home after a heart attack. He made no stumbles but failed to show the same fire as in previous debates. He got applause when he thanked supporters and rivals for their good wishes and declared, "I'm feeling great."
Warren, as in other debates, was pressed about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for her health care plan - and, as previously, she would not say yes or no but argued instead that lower premiums would mean that overall costs would go down for most Americans.
"So, I have made clear what my principles are here," she said.
More moderate Democrats, including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, pounced, calling for an approach that stops short of fully government-funded health care.
"I appreciate Elizabeth's work but, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done," Klobuchar said.
Added Buttigieg: "We heard it tonight. A 'yes' or 'no' question that didn't get a 'yes' or 'no' answer."
The debate touched on foreign policy, too, a subject that has dominated the news in recent weeks as Trump said he was withdrawing most U.S. forces from Syria and then Turkey invaded the northern part of the country to attack Kurdish fighters. The Democratic presidential candidates denounced the president for abandoning Kurdish forces there, who are U.S. allies.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who served in Iraq with the Army, questioned the need for U.S. involvement in "regime change" conflicts in the Middle East. That prompted Buttigieg to respond: "What we are doing or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word."
"I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there," said Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan. "It is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next."
Biden had spent months facing sharp criticism from the rest of the field during debates, but he saw few candidates engage with him on Tuesday. Still, he struggled to fully explain why his newly promised ethics plan to prevent conflicts of interest involving his relatives wasn't applied to his son Hunter when he was hired in 2014 as a director for a Ukrainian energy company.
That relationship has become a focal point of Trump's effort to press for a Ukrainian government probe of the Bidens - an effort that was a major factor leading to the House impeachment inquiry into Trump.
On Sunday, Biden had vowed that "no one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they're a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country."
But CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked, "If it's not OK for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president?"
Biden faltered some before offering, "My son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong."
Still, most of the back-and-forth focused on Warren. Taking aim at her proposal to tax the wealthiest Americans, Klobuchar said, "I want to give a reality check here" and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke suggested it was "punitive."
The senator said that notion shocked her: "I don't have a beef with billionaires."
"Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started," she said.
The debate stage of a dozen candidates made it difficult for any single candidate to stand out. And attacking Biden during previous debates did not result in major gains in the polls for other candidates - meaning criticizing Warren may not mean much this time around.
Hosted by CNN and The New York Times, the field's fourth round of debates was the largest-ever. It took place on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, one of the nation's toughest electoral battlegrounds, but also a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.
The event also came as the impeachment inquiry against Trump has grabbed most of the nation's political attention and left the Democratic race for the White House somewhat overshadowed.
Also debating were New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Obama housing chief Julián Castro. Making his debate debut was billionaire activist Tom Steyer.

Daily on Energy: ‘An abdication of their responsibility’: Climate hawks grouse about debate moderation

CLIMATE HAWKS GROUSE ABOUT DEBATE MODERATION: Climate activists’ fears of a dud Democratic debate proved prescient Tuesday night, and impeachment wasn’t the only reason why.
The CNN and New York Times asked no questions about climate change over three hours, neglecting the topic even as hawks say it intersects with nearly every other issue asked about: foreign policy, the economy, health care.
“It’s time to see the centrality of the climate crisis get reflected in the debates, rather than treated as an afterthought or a side issue,” Nat Keohane, senior vice president of climate at Environmental Defense Action Fund, told Josh. “The idea that the debate moderators don’t have time to discuss one of the biggest challenges the world faces, simply because there are a lot of other things going on, is a cop-out and an abdication of their responsibility.”
Keohane argued moderators missed opportunities to raise news-of-the-day issues related to climate change, such as the California blackouts or the intensity of recent storms like Dorian, and renewed flooding in Houston.
Republican climate hawks, however, said advocates should absorb a lesson from moderators’ choice of topics.
“This is telling us that highly-informed political elites are not fully onboard with the idea that climate change is the most serious threat this country faces in the long term, bar none,” tweeted Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center. “If they felt that way, they’d be asking a lot more questions about it.”
Candidates did not ignore climate change: Some tried to weave climate change into answers unsolicited, most prominently Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer, the climate activist and hedge fund manager participating in his first debate.
“We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change,” Sanders said in a response to a question about impeachment. Sanders also said climate change is a key motivator of his vow for a federal government jobs guarantee, which is a component of the Green New Deal.
Sanders’ campaign said this push was deliberate, as candidates wrestle to succeed Jay Inslee as the “climate candidate.”

Steyer, meanwhile, mentioned climate in the context of criticizing President Trump’s discounting of international alliances, which he said kills the U.S’ leverage over global efforts to reduce emissions.
“We can't solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. It's an international crisis,” Steyer said, before dropping the phrase “frenemies” into his statement.
Complaints after the debate: Other candidates who did not mention climate change complained after the debate about moderators’ ignoring the issue, including Kamala Harris and Julian Castro.
Inslee also signaled he would not stay quiet, as climate activists face the challenge of sustaining the issue’s early prominence in the primary.
"This is the existential crisis of our time," Inslee tweeted. "Not one single question, and that's completely inexcusable."

NO ONE IS HAPPY WITH EPA’S RFS PROPOSAL: The Environmental Protection Agency released its latest iteration of the Renewable Fuels Standard on Wednesday to a whole lot of angst and little praise, a familiar story for the controversial biofuels program.
The supplemental proposal is the EPA’s attempt to thread the needle between ethanol producers and the oil industry on a difficult issue: when to exempt small oil refiners from having to blend biofuels into their supply and how those exemptions affect the overall volume of mandated biofuels. But it may have just further escalated the fight over the program’s future.
Why ethanol producers are mad: The new EPA proposal doesn’t change the numbers, despite promises from Trump that his administration would seek a stronger biofuel mandate to balance out exemptions small refiners have received in the past.
Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor called the EPA’s move an “unconscionable” proposal that turns “a real fix into little more than a Band-Aid.” The ethanol industry and agriculture state senators are already asking Trump to intervene.
Why oil interests and unions are mad: The EPA proposes to “project” the volume of exemptions it would grant under the program in 2020 and suggests the agency would be open to granting partial exemptions for refineries, a step EPA leaders had previously questioned the legality of. Both of these steps would undercut relief oil industry groups say small refiners desperately need.
“[T]here is simply no logic in forcing complying refineries to bear the burden of decisions outside of their control,” Frank Macchiarola, vice president of downstream and industry operations for the American Petroleum Institute.
EPA may have known it would piss people off: The agency’s own press release announcing the supplemental proposal didn’t bear any new praise from either side on the issue. Instead, it cribbed quotes from agriculture leaders praising an Oct. 4 agreement reached by the White House, the EPA, and the Department of Agriculture — a deal most ethanol producers and their supporters say the EPA has now ripped apart.
SPEAKING OF RFS, REFINING GROUP LAUNCHES AD CAMPAIGN AGAINST TRUMP’S PROPOSAL: The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers launched a six-figure advertising campaign Tuesday calling on Trump not to finalize his proposed changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard.
The first 30-second ad ran in the second hour of the Democratic debate in the Washington D.C. market.
Entitled “Refiners vote, protect our jobs,” the ad shows AFPM CEO Chet Thompson addressing refinery employees as well as union and labor representatives from Ohio and Michigan.
“Increasing these mandates is going to hurt the women and men standing here listening,” Thompson says, adding that is “not an America first energy policy.”
LIBERTARIAN GROUP RUNNING ADS AGAINST GREEN NEW DEAL: The energy-related messaging wars continued into the third hour of the debate, when the Competitive Enterprise Institute ran a 30-second spot in the D.C. market questioning the cost of the Green New Deal proposed by congressional Democrats.
CEI, a libertarian think tank with ties to fossil fuel companies, will spend more than a quarter million dollars on the campaign, which will escalate over the next 30 days.
The group is calling the ad, “The Green New Deal: can you afford it?”
RICK PERRY TO TOUT SMALL NUCLEAR REACTORS IN EUROPE: Energy Secretary Rick Perry is traveling to Europe this weekend to tout the Trump administration’s work to encourage the development of small modular nuclear reactors.
Perry will visit Brussels for the first ever U.S.-E.U. High Level Forum on SMRs to boost cooperation on the emerging but still in-development technology, which the energy secretary told reporters on a press call Wednesday is “key to ensure clean, reliable, secure baseload power for years to come.”
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Romania are among European countries that have signed memos with various private companies in the U.S. on developing advanced reactor technologies, said Sam Buchan, DOE’s assistant secretary for international affairs.
The agency is optimistic that other countries, including in Europe, will look to import a technology being developed by Oregon-based NuScale that is on track to be the first company to obtain a license to operate a small reactor design in the U.S. for commercial use, with deployment planned for 2026.
TRUMP MOVES TO ALLOW LOGGING IN MASSIVE ALASKA RAINFOREST: The Interior Department’s National Forest Service issued a proposed rule Tuesday that would allow logging on more than half of the 16.7 million-acre Tongass National Forest in Alaska.
Alaska’s Republican-controlled government had petitioned the Trump administration to allow logging — or tree-cutting — in the huge forest to boost the local economy. The proposal would exempt the rainforest from the 2001 Roadless Rule, a conservation policy set in the Clinton administration which established prohibitions on road construction and timber harvesting on National Forest System lands.
But Democrats and environmentalists say the move would threaten clean water and wildlife habitats in the largest intact temperate rainforest in North America. Taking down trees in the forest would weaken its ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change.
The Forest Service also proposed five other alternatives that keep more protections against logging in the rainforest, but it highlighted its “preferred” option that would remove 9.2 million acres currently exempted by the Roadless Rule to allow development.
US RETALIATED AGAINST IRAN WITH CYBERATTACK AFTER SAUDI OIL STRIKE: American officials say the U.S. attacked Iran in a cyber operation after Tehran allegedly hit two Saudi oil facilities in a September strike.
The officials said Wednesday that the U.S. attack happened in September and looked to hurt Iran's ability to disseminate "propaganda," according to Reuters.
The Pentagon would not comment on the cyberattack, saying that "as a matter of policy" they "do not discuss cyberspace operations, intelligence, or planning."
Iran denied the cyberattack happened.
The Sept. 14 strikes on Saudi oil plants disrupted oil markets, prompting the U.S. to move additional troops and missiles to Saudi Arabia in response.
RENEWABLES GROUP LOOKS TO SHAPE TALK ON NATIONAL CLEAN ELECTRICITY STANDARD: The American Council on Renewable Energy is outlining its vision for a national renewable electricity standard that could require at least 50% of electricity sales be zero-emitting power. Their white paper, released Wednesday, is a first step to add policy detail to a concept already being floated by some on Capitol Hill.
Most important for any renewable electricity standard, ACORE says, is that it requires at least 50% renewables, allows a broad range of renewable technologies to qualify, includes alternative ways to get credit, and doesn’t preempt state-level programs.
One thing to watch: How discussion evolves on dealing with stranded fossil fuel energy assets under any renewables standard.
ACORE has a few suggestions — including restricting utilities from buying power from any carbon-emitting facilities built more than two years after any policy’s enactment. Such a restriction, however, would likely anger fossil fuel developers, particularly as utilities announce new natural gas builds.

Texto completo: Telemedicine is consulting with a medical professional via computer or smartphone. With screens everywhere, it's quite doable. But is it used often? Among people over the age of 50, not so much, according to a University of Michigan poll.
Surveyors found that older patients aren't quite ready to virtually embrace their doctors and health care providers, with only 4% saying they'd had a video-based telehealth visit with a doctor. Their reactions were mixed.
More than half of those polled didn't know if their health care providers offered telemedicine services. More than 80% expressed at least one concern about seeing a doctor virtually rather than in person. And 47% balked at being able to manage the technology.
On the other hand, more than half said they would use telemedicine in certain situations, such as if they got sick while traveling or needed to follow up on previous care.

Body of Knowledge
Women have four times as many foot problems as men, primarily due the nature and comfort of their footwear. In a lifetime, the average person walks about 100,000 miles -- or maybe limps.

Get Me That, Stat!
Male pediatricians still make more than their female counterparts, according to new data published in the journal Pediatrics, earning roughly 76% what their male peers earn, or $51,000 less per year. Another study found that female pediatricians were reportedly more likely to carry the heavier household burden, with primary responsibility for chores such as cooking and cleaning.

Perishable Publications
Many, if not most, published research papers have titles that defy comprehension. They use specialized jargon, complex words and opaque phrases like "nonlinear dynamics." Sometimes they don't and they're still hard to figure out. Here's an actual title of an actual published research study: "A mathematical model of Bieber Fever: The most infectious disease of our time?" Published in 2012 by a team of Canadian biologists and mathematicians, the study looked at the pandemic popularity of the native-born pop singer, then arguably at the height of his acclaim.
The researchers described Bieber Fever as a highly infectious disease with symptoms that included time-wasting, excessive purchasing of useless merchandise and uncontrollable weeping or screaming. The researchers developed a mathematical model to predict the fever's spread and how quickly it would likely burn out.

Fit to Be Tried
There are thousands of exercises, and you've only got one body, but that doesn't mean you can't try them all:
Burpees have a fun name and look kind of fun to do, but the actual doing of them is surprisingly, uh ... invigorating. They're a whole-body workout, promoting cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength.
Start by standing upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms down at your sides. With your hands out in front of you, start to squat down. When your hands reach the ground, pop your legs straight back into a pushup position. Do a pushup. Come back up to the starting pushup position and jump your feet up to your palms by hinging at the waist. Get your feet as close to your hands as you can get, landing them outside your hands if necessary. Stand up straight, bringing your arms above your head, and jump.
This is one rep. Do three sets of reps as a beginner. Add more as you become more invigorated.

Texto completo: An author scheduled to speak at Georgia Southern's Armstrong campus on Thursday canceled her scheduled event after an incident during her Oct. 9 appearance at the university's Statesboro campus that resulted in several people who appeared to be students being videoed burning her book following the lecture.
Outrage from students and alumni under the #southernnotstate hashtag on Twitter followed the incident after video surfaced of students at the Statesboro campus burning the visiting author's book after she discussed white privilege during her lecture and questions and answers.
Latina author and New York Times contributor Jennine Capó Crucet discussed her book, "Make Your Home Among Strangers," to an audience of freshmen students at the Statesboro campus. The book, which is required reading for some Georgia Southern Freshman Year Experience classes, follows a Cuban-American student going to college at a predominantly white institution.
During the Q&A portion of her lecture, one student confronted Crucet about the view on white privilege expressed in the book. In a video posted by user @___yanamarie on Twitter, the student asks Crucet, "So I've noticed you've made a lot of generalizations about the majority of white people being privileged and I just wanted to know what makes you qualified to come to a college campus?"
The student quickly corrects the comment by stating the student understands Crucet has qualifications before Crucet interjects and tells the Statesboro audience it feels like deja vu.
"I'm asking you what makes you think you can come to a college campus like this when we're supposed to be promoting diversity throughout this campus, which is what we're taught?" the student continues in the video.
Some in the auditorium sound off with comments before she completes her question.
"I just would like to know why you came here to tell all of these people that white people are privileged, I don't really understand what the purpose of this was?" the student asks in the video.
Crucet responds by saying white privilege is a real thing and she was invited to come talk at the university. The video ends with Crucet stating she is heartbroken because she had just discussed a moment similar to this one. The almost two-and-a-half minute video had been viewed more than 30,000 times by mid-Friday.
On Twitter, students, alumni and others tweeted their positions after learning some students burned her book:
Twitter user @https_Kieraaa tweeted: "Welcome to my PWI where we brush the actions of privileged children under the rug and ignore the fact that they followed her home.#gsu #southernnotstate #whiteprivilegeatitsfinest."
Twitter user @ball_for_life72 tweeted: "I normally don't speak on these subjects, but I feel like this controversy is something that should definitely be brought to attention! White privilege is a very important topic when teaching Diversity Inclusion! #georgiasouthern #gsu22 #gsu21 #gsu20 #gsu23 #SouthernNotState."
According to Georgia Southern communications and marketing vice president John Lester, the burning of the book was within the students' First Amendment rights but did not align with Georgia Southern's
values nor did it encourage civil discourse and debate of ideas.
"We view these events as a continuing debate of differing ideas, which are tenets of our ongoing efforts to align with our values and initiatives encompassing inclusive excellence," Lester said.
As of Friday, Georgia Southern did not know how many students were involved in the book burning incident on the Statesboro campus, and Crucet declined to talk at the Armstrong campus in Savannah on Thursday because of safety concerns.
In an official statement on her Twitter account, Crucet said campus hosts moved her initial lodging to another hotel, and she later learned in a statement from a faculty member that a crowd had formed outside the original accommodations.
Crucet also said that some students apologized for overall reaction from the initial question pertaining to white privilege. She also said how some Georgia Southern students reached out during and afterward on how her book mirrored their own journeys.
"To think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story - effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space - feels devastating," the statement reads.

Debate attacks demonstrate Elizabeth Warren's new role: the Democrat to beat

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio — She had bobbed and weaved her way through an onslaught of attacks, but near the end of Tuesday's presidential debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren did something unusual: She paused.
She was talking up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau she helped create, saying it was included in financial reform legislation despite the objections of Republicans and even “some of the Democrats," when former vice president Joe Biden cut in over moderator Anderson Cooper.
“I went on the floor and got you votes, I got votes for that bill, I convinced people to vote for it," Biden said, his voice rising and his flattened hand sweeping through the air.
When Cooper asked for Warren's response, she took half a breath. And then another. Seconds went by.
“I am deeply grateful — to President Obama, who fought so hard to get that agency passed into law," Warren said, purposely withholding her thanks from an opponent with whom she has long tangled over consumer issues.
Warren has studiously avoided wading into conflict with her main rivals as her presidential campaign has gathered steam in recent months, but by Tuesday's presidential debate, that was impossible. Her exchange with Biden was the tensest in a long evening that cast Warren in a new role, at least in the eyes of her Democratic opponents: A front-runner, and the one to beat in a primary field newly flush with uncertainty.
One by one, Warren's rivals laid out her potential weaknesses in front of an electorate desperate to defeat President Trump, at times displaying a new willingness to question personal attributes like honesty or demeanor. To Beto O'Rourke, she was “punitive." Biden called her “vague." To Pete Buttigieg, she had a one-track mind — for “infinite partisan combat."
In a preview of how she would seek to shape the race if she remains atop the field, Warren responded dexterously but rarely in personal terms, seeking instead to contrast the sweeping change she has promised with what she suggested is a lack of ambition from her rivals.
“I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started," Warren said, leaning on her campaign slogan instead of a totally fresh response.
In the three previous debates, many of the contenders on the crowded stage were more interested in trying to deflate Biden, but two factors have changed that. President Trump has been relentlessly attacking Biden over his son Hunter's business activities in Ukraine, a line of criticism no Democrat seems eager to reinforce. And Warren has tied or overtaken Biden in several national and early state polls.
So for much of the three-hour debate, lower-polling candidates eagerly auditioned for the role of chief Warren foil, with Biden at times seeming to disappear from the stage. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, making a strong first appearance at a major campaign event since he had a heart attack on Oct. 1, also eluded much of the crossfire, although he faced pointed questions from the moderators about his health.
The offensive on Warren began with Medicare for All, the single-payer government health insurance system she and Sanders have embraced. Moderator Marc Lacey, the national editor of the New York Times, pressed Warren on her refusal to acknowledge that middle-class taxes would go up to pay for it, but she said simply that she would not sign a bill into law that doesn't lower overall costs for those families.
“We heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer," said Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., before touting his own more limited plan, “Medicare for all who want it." He added: “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this."
Warren, apparently as committed as ever to not proffer a soundbite on her willingness to raise certain taxes, dismissed Buttigieg's plan as unaffordable while also labeling it as “Medicare for all who can afford it." But, in a sign of how her refusal to expound on funding for Medicare for All has opened her up to criticism from the left and the right, Sanders took a gentle swipe, too:
“I do think it's appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up," he said.
Then Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has been stubbornly stuck near the bottom of the polls, piled on. “At least Bernie's being honest here," she said, before criticizing Warren's ideas as unrealistic.
“The difference between a plan and a pipe dream," Klobuchar said, “is something you can actually get done."
Jabs like that were always inevitable for a candidate seeking to fundamentally restructure the American economy, and they may come as a relief to moderate voters worried about the party's leftward drift.
But the debate also revealed the perils of attacking a candidate who has built her political brand on populism. At one point, Warren offered a rejoinder to opponents who have not embraced a wealth tax, as she and Sanders have:
“Does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?" she asked.
Soon, O'Rourke suggested that Warren, who has made the idea of taking on hard fights central to her political brand, could be too divisive to win a general election.
“Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up," said O'Rourke, the former Texas representative.
“I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive," Warren said, explaining she simply wanted the wealthy to pay for public goods that helped them — a reprise of a line she used in her 2012 Massachusetts Senate campaign.
Some attacks on Warren did not seem to land. California Senator Kamala Harris, who faded to the background for much of the debate, tried to knock Warren for not signing on to her calls to have Trump banned from Twitter. Warren tried to steer the spotlight instead toward Democrats — like Harris — who court wealthy donors to fund their campaigns, a practice Warren has sworn off.
Not every onstage attack was reserved for Warren. O'Rourke and Buttigieg sparred over the Texan's proposal for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons and Sanders punctured Biden's boast that he had accomplished the most of anyone onstage.
“You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs," Sanders said.
That's when Warren brought up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, showing a new willingness to engage more directly with her chief competitor for the race's top slot.
As she sought to cast the creation of the bureau as a worthy fight that some Democrats had tried to stop, Biden interrupted her.
“You did a hell of a job in your job," he said, prompting the unflappable Warren to show a rare flash of annoyance.
“Thank you," she said, lightly, and continued to speak.

Texto completo: I just read an article in the Baxter Bulletin, probably taken from the New York Times, which began as follows: "Donald Trump has spent his time in office trying to bend the conventions of the American Presidency to his will. Now he appears to be trying to override a core principle of democracy that no one is above the law."
The Democrats, of course, are experts in trying to recognize these principles, because they made a living (literally) by doing these things while they were in office.
Why can not our Politicians, and the Media, acknowledge the good Donald Trump has done for America while he has been President, whether you like his personality or not?
The answer is simple. The aforementioned care more about themselves and their agendas, than they do for America; they ignore their past and lie about the future.
They are not anti-Trumpers; they are pro-selfers. Please, can we not return to a real Republic; to "In God We trust"; and to Loving God and Neighbor?
Why? Because loving God and neighbor has always worked, and the Socialist Agenda has never worked and never will work, because it is pro selfish and anti-God and neighbor.
And, if the Baxter Bulletin prints this letter, it will show that they are fair and we should support them.
J. R. Crawford,
Mountain Home
(Editor's Note: The article mentioned by Mr. Crawford was authored and bylined by Jonathan Lemire, a White House reporter for the Associated Press. Mr. Lemire is not an employee of the New York Times.)
The quick fix For every complicated problem, there is a simple fix
If you have too many poor people, give them money.
If you have too many homeless people, give them a home.
If you have too many sick people, give them health care.
If you have too many dumb kids, just lower the test standards.
If you have too many jobs, just import some illegal aliens.
If you want to save the world, buy an electric car.
If you want to stop homicides, get rid of the guns.
If the people are unhappy, give them some dope to smoke, that will cheer them up.
The uneducated that don't understand these simple solutions for everything are deplorable, ignorant, bigots, racist, homophobic, and the scum of the earth. To put it in a word, they ain't hip (sophisticated).
So if you work for a living, cling to your guns and Bibles and pay for your own way, you are to be looked down upon.
Vote for the public servants that want to help the poor, the sick, the lazy, and most important of all, the illegal aliens.
Without these wonderful people, from God knows where, who will pick your strawberries and vote for the enlightened public servants who know what's best for you?
Do not worry about the money to pay for these wonderful, generous programs, we only tax the rich.
J.P. McQuaide,
Mountain Home

Texto completo: Former New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman insinuated that President Donald Trump is worse than Adolf Hitler while tweeting a New York Times story Monday about a fake video of Trump killing members of the media.
"#Hitler has nothing on #Trump," Whitman wrote, with a link to the story.
The fake video was played at a conference hosted by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort last week, The New York Times reported.
The video is an edited version of a scene from the movie "Kingsman: The Secret Service" and has Trump's face inserted over the face of a character from the film as he enters the "Church of Fake News."
The character then opens fire on the people inside, who have news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed on their bodies.
The White House on Monday said Trump has not seen the video but condemns its contents.
Whitman was New Jersey's 50th governor and served from 1994 to 2001. She has long been a critic of Trump, tweeting earlier this month: "This is NOT my Republican party."
She added that Trump has done enough to warrant an impeachment inquiry, with several of her tweets ending with that or a similar hashtag, and that if the allegations are true he "has to go."

Texto completo: NEW YORK – U.S. counterintelligence agents have been examining Rudy Giuliani's business dealings with two men indicted last week on campaign finance charges since at least early 2019, according to a Manhattan lawyer.
Kenneth McCallion, who has represented several Ukrainian clients including former Ukraine Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in U.S. court cases, said the agents contacted him in February or March. They asked whether Giuliani, who is President Donald Trump's personal attorney, had business dealings with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.
The Ukrainian-born Parnas and Fruman of Belarus are accused of conspiring to circumvent federal campaign financing laws by funneling foreign money to U.S. political candidates and committees in a scheme to buy influence.
The two men, who now live in Florida, played instrumental roles in connecting Giuliani with Ukrainian officials as Giuliani sought information about the financial dealings there of Hunter Biden, the son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden – one of Trump's 2020 presidential campaign challengers.
Parnas and Fruman were arrested last week as they tried to board a flight out of the country. They're in federal custody on $1 million bonds and have not yet entered pleas to the charges. They are scheduled to appear in a New York City federal court Thursday.
McCallion said he "was asked a lot of questions by FBI and other counterintelligence investigators who were looking at Giuliani's comings and goings in Ukraine and business dealings."
"They were interested in the nature of any business dealings with them," McCallion said, referring to Parnas and Fruman. He said he has not been involved in any business or legal matters with Giuliani.
Giuliani said Tuesday he had "no such knowledge" of a federal inquiry involving him.
Asked whether he was aware that agents had questioned the New York attorney about his dealings with Parnas and Fruman, Giuliani said, "No."
A person familiar with the matter said federal authorities have been examining Giuliani's activities as part of the investigation involving Parnas and Fruman.
The person, who is not authorized to comment publicly, did not know whether that inquiry ranged beyond Giuliani's association with the two men.
Late last week, The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors are investigating Giuliani for potential lobbying law violations as it relates to his work in Ukraine. The Times reported that the probe focuses on Giuliani's efforts to "undermine" former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. Yovanovitch, who testified before three House committees Friday as part of the House impeachment inquiry of Trump.
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that investigators have been examining Giuliani's finances, including bank records related to his work in Ukraine, since at least August.
Tuesday afternoon, Giuliani's lawyer informed House Democrats that he wouldn't comply with a subpoena to produce documents related to his dealings on behalf of Trump in Ukraine.
The committees demanded documents from Giuliani dealing with "the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression."
Giuliani has done business in Ukraine since at least 2008. In June 2017, he delivered a speech called "Global Challenge, the Role of the U.S. and the Place of Ukraine," according to a post on the website of the Pinchuk Foundation.
Victor Pinchuk, a billionaire and the son of a former Ukrainian president, moderated the event and invited future Ukrainian leaders "to shape the proper messages that Mr. Giuliani would bring" to the U.S., the foundation said on its website.
Giuliani met with Ukraine government officials, including then-President Petro Poroshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko, the then-prosecutor general, the post said.
Giuliani subsequently met with Lutsenko in January 2019 in New York and a month later in Warsaw, Poland, according to a whistleblower complaint that has triggered a House impeachment inquiry proceeding against Trump.
In a series of reports published in The Hill in March and April, Lutsenko and other Ukrainian officials made claims about purported Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 presidential election and former Vice President Biden's purported efforts to protect Ukraine business interests of his son, Hunter. Neither allegation has been substantiated.
Lutsenko also claimed that Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, gave him a do-not-prosecute list of subjects in Ukraine. Lutsenko has since recanted that allegation, too, and several Ukrainian officials have told USA TODAY he's not credible. He has not responded to requests for comment.
Parnas and Fruman, according to Ukrainian media reports, helped arrange Lutsenko's New York meeting with Giuliani.
The pair's sizable campaign contributions in the U.S. have attracted the scrutiny of federal election authorities. Their company, Global Energy Producers, was credited with giving $325,000 to a pro-Trump political action committee in May 2018.
That same month, Parnas posted photos on Facebook of him and Fruman with President Trump in the White House and with Donald Trump Jr. in California.
Although Global Energy Partners was identified as the source of the contribution to America First Action SuperPAC, financial records show that the money came via a circuitous route through another company linked to Fruman, according to a federal indictment.
Prosecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman gave $5,400 to a U.S. congressman and pledged to raise another $20,000 as they sought his help in removing Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.
In May, Trump abruptly pulled Yovanovitch from her assignment. Giuliani has said he argued for her removal because she was critical of the president.

Texto completo: Protests erupt as Spain convicts leading Catalan separatists
BARCELONA, Spain — Riot police engaged in a running battle with angry protesters outside Barcelona’s airport Monday after Spain’s Supreme Court convicted 12 separatist leaders of illegally promoting the wealthy Catalonia region’s independence and sentenced nine of them to prison.
Officers fired foam bullets and used batons against thousands of protesters who converged on the airport after the verdict was announced in Madrid. Protesters fought back by throwing objects, spraying dark clouds with fire extinguishers, and breaking windows during clashes that lasted into the night.
Regional emergency service SEM said 75 people were treated for injuries at Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport. Spain’s airport operator, AENA, said at least 108 flights were canceled.
Police also clashed with angry crowds late Monday night in downtown Barcelona. They used batons, and sounds similar to the firing projectiles were heard.
Nine of the 12 Catalan politicians and activists were found guilty of sedition and given prison sentences of nine to 13 years. Four of them were additionally convicted of misuse of public funds.
Harold Bloom, author of ‘Anxiety of Influence,’ dies at 89
NEW YORK — Harold Bloom, the eminent critic and Yale professor whose seminal The Anxiety of Influence and melancholy regard for literature’s old masters made him a popular author and standard-bearer of Western civilization amid modern trends, died Monday at age 89.
Bloom’s wife, Jeanne, said that he had been failing health, although he continued to write books and was teaching as recently as last week. Yale said Bloom died at a New Haven, Conn., hospital.
Bloom wrote more than 20 books and prided himself on making scholarly topics accessible to the general reader. Although he frequently bemoaned the decline of literary standards, he was as well placed as a contemporary critic could hope to be. He appeared on best-seller lists with such works as The Western Canon and The Book of J, was a guest on Good Morning America and other programs and was a National Book Award finalist and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. A readers’ poll commissioned by the Modern Library ranked The Western Canon at No. 58 on a list of the 20th century’s best nonfiction English-language books.
His greatest legacy could well outlive his own name: the title of his breakthrough book, The Anxiety of Influence. Bloom argued that creativity was not a grateful bow to the past, but a Freudian wrestle in which artists denied and distorted their literary ancestors while producing work that revealed an unmistakable debt.
He was referring to poetry in his 1973 publication, but “anxiety of influence” has come to mean how artists of any kind respond to their inspirations. Bloom’s theory has been endlessly debated, parodied and challenged, including by Bloom.
White House: Trump condemns violent parody, hasn’t seen it
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump “strongly condemns” a graphic and violent parody video that depicts a likeness of him shooting and stabbing opponents and members of the news media, the White House said Monday. But his press secretary said he hadn’t yet watched the two-minute clip.
The video, which drew widespread condemnation, was played during a conference held by conservative supporters of the president at his Miami golf resort last week.
It depicts a gruesome scene inside a “Church of Fake News” in which a figure whose face has been replaced with an image of Trump goes on a shooting rampage, targeting a long list of political rivals, including Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, former President Barack Obama and numerous news organizations.
The video, the existence of which The New York Times was first to report, was notable for its level of violence. It is part of a growing genre of pro-Trump memes that routinely earn thousands of views on sites like YouTube and Twitter. Many use superimposed faces and feature the president and his chief supporters valiantly conquering challengers or members of the media.
The one featured at the Florida conference appears to have been first posted in July 2018 on the YouTube channel “TheGeekzTeam,” where it has been viewed more than 250,000 times. It uses a violent clip from the 2015 spy thriller Kingsman: The Secret Service. In the original scene, actor Colin Firth is depicted shooting a crowd of possessed churchgoers.
US-China truce leaves big issues for later
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump heralded a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks, and markets rallied in relief over a de-escalation in tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.
But closer inspection suggests there isn’t much substance, at least not yet, to the temporary truce Trump announced Friday at the White House after the U.S. and China wrapped up their 13th round of trade talks.
Yes, Trump agreed to suspend a tariff hike scheduled for Tuesday on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. And the president said the Chinese agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products.
But nothing’s on paper and details are scarce. China’s state-run media hasn’t even mentioned the promise to buy all those soybeans and other agricultural products.
And the negotiators have delayed dealing with the toughest issues for future talks. Meanwhile, the U.S. is still scheduled to target another $160 billion in Chinese goods Dec. 15, a move that would extend Trump’s tariffs to virtually everything China ships to the United States.

Trump ad misleads about Biden, Ukraine and prosecutor

Texto completo: A campaign ad from President Donald Trump claims it has “facts” about the Bidens and Ukraine, but instead mashes ideas together to create a highly misleading 30-second tale.
The ad distorts the known facts about Ukraine prosecutor general Viktor Shokin and Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, where Biden’s son Hunter Biden served on the board.
“Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor.”
Biden did call for Ukraine to fire Shokin, but the ad fails to note that there were widespread calls for his ouster.
Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015, after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked.
“Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden’s company.”
There is evidence that many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance, and for protecting members of Yanukovych’s and Poroshenko’s circles.
When Shokin was fired in the spring of 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption.
Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, previously told PolitiFact that “virtually everyone” he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine “felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired.”
“All decent people were in favor of Shokin’s sacking,” Anders Åslund, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council told PolitiFact. “Biden led a Western/anticorruption consensus.”
Shokin did inherit some of the investigations into Burisma and owner Zlochevsky. Recently, Shokin said in a statement that his refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster.
But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin’s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg in 2019 that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant. Kasko said the matter was “shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,” and Bloomberg reported that documents backed up his account.
The Trump campaign pointed to reporting by the New York Times that Yuriy Lutsenko, a subsequent prosecutor general, had cleared Burisma initially but then reopened the investigation in March.
At the very least, Shokin’s credibility in discussing the case has been undercut by other evidence and the widespread descriptions of his office as uninterested in prosecuting corruption cases.
Democrats’ impeachment inquiry
The ad says that “Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine’s President.”
The ad soft-pedals Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 by describing it merely as a discussion. The ad omits that a summary of the call shows Trump encouraging Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr and “look into” Biden.
Before the call, Trump froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine. The hold on the money was lifted Sept. 11.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would move forward with an impeachment inquiry in September. Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his presidential power by withholding the aid while asking its government to look into Biden, his potential 2020 opponent. They have not yet formulated articles of impeachment.
Our ruling
A Trump ad says “Fact: Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor .... Fact: the prosecutor said he was forced out for leading a corruption probe into Hunter Biden’s company. Fact: Democrats want to impeach President Trump for discussing this investigation with Ukraine’s President.”
This ad claims a compilation of “facts,” but it’s presentation and lack of context is so misleading as to be inaccurate. We rate this statement False.

Texto completo: 1. The Haunting of the Tavern
7 p.m. Oct. 15 and Nov. 12. $60. The Tavern, 922 W. 12th St. tavernaustin.com/haunting-of-the-tavern
Did you know the Tavern is as haunted as it gets? Find out just how much with a hilarious murder mystery dinner that runs select Tuesday nights in October, November and December. Current and former Esther’s Follies cast members, along with other Austin comedians, will transform into a mystery-solving gang a la “Scooby-Doo” to solve what’s really going on at the Tavern. (It might have something to do with a ghost named Emily.) There are five prospective endings to the show, and the audience gets to decide the final whodunit.
2. Herb Alpert & Lani Hall at Paramount Theatre
8 p.m. Oct. 15. $30-$55. 713 Congress Ave. austintheatre.org
“I’m a right-brain guy,” trumpeter Alpert said when I interviewed him in 2015 and asked about balancing his work as a legendary executive with A&M Records (the A is for Alpert) with the music he made on his own and with singer Hall, his wife of 45 years. “I paint, I sculpt, I make music. I practice every day, most every day of my life.” Alpert is now 84 and Hall is 73, but like Austin’s own iconic octogenarian Willie Nelson, the creative spark remains strong. — Peter Blackstock
3. Viva Cinema at the Bullock Museum
7 to 9:30 p.m. Oct. 15. $5-$8. 1800 Congress Ave. thestoryoftexas.com
Viva Cinema, a celebration of the modern cinema of Mexico and beyond, screens and holds a conversation about the film “La Jaula de Oro (The Golden Dream).” In the award-winning film, three teenagers from the slums of Guatemala travel to the United States in search of a better life, but their journey through Mexico results in a harsh reality. Come early for complimentary coffee and treats at 6 p.m.
4. Leigh Bardugo author appearance
7 p.m. Oct. 15. $27.99. Central Presbyterian Church, 200 E. Eighth St. 512-472-5050, bookpeople.com
The New York Times bestselling author of fantasy novels has written a book a little more down to earth. “Ninth House,” which Bardugo will talk about and sign at a BookPeople event, is a tale of power, privilege, dark magic and murder set among the Ivy League elite. Why is Alex Stern given the second chance to attend Yale, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, on a full ride? A ticket to Bardugo’s author appearance includes a copy of the book.

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate being held tonight — Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 — in a suburb near Ohio’s capital will bring back a candidate who has been absent from the stage for a while and introduce one who has never before been seen on the party’s debate lineup.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard failed to qualify for the September debate but will be back on stage tonight after meeting the Democratic National Committee’s qualifications:
* Earning at least 2% support in four DNC-approved polls
* Receiving contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors
* Of those donors, at least 400 each must come from 20 different states
Also making that cut will be first-time presidential debater Tom Steyer of California. The billionaire hedge fund founder is known for his large contributions to environmental causes and political campaigns.
Along with those two will be the 10 candidates you would expect to see on the stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, listed alphabetically:
* Former Vice President Joe Biden
* New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker

* Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke
* Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders
* Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
* Businessman Andrew Yang
Tonight’s debate from 5 to 8 p.m. Pacific time is sponsored by the New York Times and CNN and will be carried on the cable network. The moderators are CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper, and New York Times editor Marc Lacey.

Housing, human dignity and a ‘state of emergency’

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?
Graham Walker is executive director of the Independent Institute, based in Oakland.

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio — Joe Biden became the invisible man during Tuesday's Democratic primary debate, fading into the background as other presidential hopefuls and moderators focused much of their time on new top-polling candidate Elizabeth Warren.
An hour-and-a-half into the debate, Biden had spoken for 8 1/2 minutes, trailing Warren's 12 minutes of speaking time. He spent some of that time addressing the business dealings of his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while he was vice president. Biden dominated combined speaking time in the June, July, and August rounds of debates.
Previous debates centered on the then front-runner's policy positions and rivals went on the attack against him. In the June debate round, California Sen. Kamala Harris dug into Biden for working with segregationist senators in the 1970s to oppose integration busing. In September, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro hit Biden for supporting Obama-era immigration policies.
On Tuesday, Warren was the new target, with many candidates attacking her on failing to directly answer whether her healthcare plan would raise taxes on middle-class Americans.

COOPER: And live from Otterbein University, just north of Columbus, Ohio, this is the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate.
We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and watching around the world, watching us on CNN, CNN International, CNN En Espanol, Cnn.com, thenewyorktimes.com, CNN's Facebook page, and listening on the Westwood One radio network, SiriusXM satellite radio, NPR, and the American Forces Network.
I'm Anderson Cooper moderating tonight's debate, along with CNN's Erin Burnett and New York Times national editor Mark Lacey. We are in Ohio tonight, because it's one of the most critical battleground states. Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896.
BURNETT: The top 12 Democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums. This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate, so to accommodate the large group, there are no opening statements tonight.
LACEY: Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.
COOPER: And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right, let's begin.
Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support. Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there's already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn't it be the voters who determine the president's fate?
WARREN: Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry.
When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn't think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.
Now, that didn't happen. And look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States.
Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but, understand, it's about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.
COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You're all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any chance but to impeach President Trump? Please respond.
SANDERS: No, they don't. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It's not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller Report. I think that the House will find him guilty of -- worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous.
And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a president of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.
COOPER: Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, you said, and I quote, "The American people don't think that they've made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton, and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision." With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?
BIDEN: Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report, if they did that, they would have no choice -- no choice -- but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.
This president -- and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders -- is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.
COOPER: Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be, in her words, fair to the president and give him a chance to exonerate himself. You've already said that based on everything you've seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the president?
HARRIS: Well, it's just being observant, because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it's shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.
During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people. He's been selling out our values. He's been selling out national security. And on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy.
Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.
But the reality of it is that I don't really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there's been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.
COOPER: Senator Booker, you have said that President Trump's, quote, "moral vandalism" disqualifies him from being president. Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond.
BOOKER: So, first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship.
Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn't rip us apart.
Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that's what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.
COOPER: Thank you, Senator Booker.
Senator Klobuchar, you have -- what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people's day-to-day lives, health care, the economy, and could backfire on Democrats?
KLOBUCHAR: We can do two things at once. That's our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.
He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He's not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know, when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he's digging up dirt on an opponent. That's illegal conduct. That's what he was doing. He didn't talk to him about the Russian invasion. He talked to him about that.
So I'm still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I'd like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again.
It doesn't make America great again. It makes Russia great again. And that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers' issues, whether it is farmers' issues, he has put his own private interests...
COOPER: Thank you.
KLOBUCHAR: ... and I will not do that.
COOPER: Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment a distraction?
CASTRO: Not at all. We can walk and chew gun at the same time. And all of us are out there every single day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross a graduation stage, that more families have great health care, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises, because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.
Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller Report point out 10 different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly -- in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power.
We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.
COOPER: Mayer Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There's been, obviously, very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake?
BUTTIGIEG: Well, it's a mistake on the part of Republicans, who enable the president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share.
Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It's also about the presidency itself, because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.
But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it's going to be like, what it's actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.
It starts out feeling like a happy thought; this particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we'll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process.
I'm running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only sitting House member on this stage. How do you respond?
GABBARD: If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we're already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016.
The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward.
If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.
COOPER: Thank you, Congresswoman.
Mr. Steyer, you've been calling for impeachment for two years. Does there need to be bipartisan support?
STEYER: Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.
(APPLAUSE)
But I also want to point out that Anderson's right. Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They're the voice that counts, and that's who I went to, the American people.
COOPER: Mr. Yang, do you think there's already enough evidence out there to impeach the president? Please respond.
YANG: I support impeachment, but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016. We're standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state.
Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns. And we are not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands.
It's not just you. Amazon alone is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls, soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution. And that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office.
The fact is, Donald Trump, when we're talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision, and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.
COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, on impeachment, please respond.
O'ROURKE: You know, I think about everyone who's ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on this stage tonight in Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard, those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our Constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice.
And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president's criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.
COOPER: Thank you, Congressman.
O'ROURKE: If we do not hold him to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our Constitution and our country, but we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line.
COOPER: Thank you.
O'ROURKE: And we cannot do that.
COOPER: Thank you, Congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.
Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it's not OK for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden?
BIDEN: Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.
And what I wanted to make a point about -- and my son's statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.
On the -- look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions -- three occasions -- has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.
Rudy Giuliani, the president, and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He's going after me because he knows, if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.
(UNKNOWN): Anderson -- Anderson...
COOPER: Hold on, sorry, just to follow up. Mr. Vice President, as you said, your son, Hunter, today gave an interview, admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgement by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time. You can answer.
BIDEN: Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict.
My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say. And let's focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.
COOPER: Senator Sanders, your response?
SANDERS: Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way.
But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.
COOPER: Senator Sanders, thank you. Mark?
LACEY: We want to move now to the economy.
(UNKNOWN): May I get in, please?
LACEY: You've proposed some sweeping plans...
(CROSSTALK)
LACEY: ... free public college...
(CROSSTALK)
(UNKNOWN): It is wrong to move on.
LACEY: Thank you. We're going to -- Senator Warren.
(UNKNOWN): It is wrong to move on.
LACEY: Senator Warren, we've proposed -- you've proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans' college debt. And you've said how you're going to pay for those plans. But you have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for all. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?
WARREN: So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is, I have been out all around this country. I've done 140 town halls now, been to 27 states and Puerto Rico. Shoot, I've done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy.
And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I've talked to the young man who has MS.
And here's the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.
Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer, to think about the changes in your family if your mom has diabetes, or what it means for your life going forward if you've been diagnosed with MS. But what you shouldn't have to worry about is how you're going to pay for your health care after that.
LACEY: Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he's going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for all. You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?
WARREN: So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.
LACEY: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, "evasive" about how she's going to pay for Medicare for all. What's your response?
BUTTIGIEG: Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.
No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is, we really can deliver health care for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself.
But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion-dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes-or-no question is Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare. We let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that, too. That is what most Americans want, Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your health care and for your family. And it can be delivered without an increase on the middle-class taxes.
LACEY: Thank you, Mayor. Senator, your response?
WARREN: So, let's be clear. Whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who want it, understand what that really means. It's Medicare for all who can afford it. And that's the problem we've got.
Medicare for all is the gold standard. It is the way we get health care coverage for every single American, including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who's just gotten an MS diagnosis. That's how we make sure that everyone gets health care.
We can pay for this. I've laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.
I've been studying this, you know, for the biggest part of my life...
LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Can the -- can the...
WARREN: ... why people go bankrupt.
LACEY: ... mayor respond?
WARREN: Sure.
BUTTIGIEG: I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice. And the choice of Medicare for all who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care. It's just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not.
And I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big, bold goal -- and once again, we have a president -- we're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now, after everything we've been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?
LACEY: Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Senator Sanders?
WARREN: I'd like to be able to respond...
SANDERS: Well, as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I said, let's be clear. Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone. Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone. We're going to do better than the Canadians do, and that is what they have managed to do.
At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less -- substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, at least that's a straightforward answer, but there's a better way.
LACEY: Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?
WARREN: So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, "Sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS."
LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar...
WARREN: "We're not covering what you need."
KLOBUCHAR: At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.
I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that's have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in our years.
And I'm tired of hearing, whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that's going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold, that will cover more people, and it's the one we should get behind.
LACEY: Senator Warren?
WARREN: You know, I didn't spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question, and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principal reasons for that is the cost of health care.
And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we've got right now is the overall cost of health care. And, look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I've spent my entire life on working on how America's middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I've put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part is that is we have got to stop...
LACEY: Thank you, Senator.
WARREN: ... Americans from going bankrupt over health care costs.
LACEY: Senator Klobuchar, do you want to respond?
KLOBUCHAR: Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done. And we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices.
But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we've had so many times, is that we don't talk about the things that I'm hearing about from regular Americans. That is long-term care. We are seeing -- I once called it a silver tsunami. The aging -- and then someone told me that was too negative, so I call it the silver surge -- the aging of the population.
We need to make easier to get long-term care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio, that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed.
LACEY: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.
KLOBUCHAR: Those are the issues that I hear about when I'm in Toledo.
LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden...
(CROSSTALK)
HARRIS: I'd like to be...
LACEY: Let me -- let me bring you in here, Vice President, for your response. Are Senators Warren and Sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans?
BIDEN: First of all, the plan we're hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I built forward. Build on Obamacare, add a public option. We can go into that. I can talk about that if you'd like.
But here's the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.
And we talk about how we're going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that, in fact, it will reduce costs. But for people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000, because the fact is they'll pay more in new taxes, 7.4 percent plus, or 5 percent, plus a 4 percent income tax. If you're making -- if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.
LACEY: Senator Sanders, do you want to respond to -- we were coming to you.
WARREN: I get a little bit tired -- I must say -- of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.
I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
(APPLAUSE)
And if we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.
LACEY: Thank you, Senator Sanders.
BIDEN: We can stand up to them.
LACEY: Senator Harris, your response?
HARRIS: This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today.
(APPLAUSE)
And it's outrageous. There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.
Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.
(APPLAUSE)
LACEY: Thank you, Senator.
HARRIS: And let's talk about that.
LACEY: Thank you, Senator.
HARRIS: That is a significant health care issue in America today.
LACEY: Thank you, Senator.
BURNETT: I want to turn now to jobs. According to a recent study, about a quarter of American jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years. Ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit.
Senator Sanders, you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation, but tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs. Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?
SANDERS: Damn right we will. And I'll tell you why. If you look at what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We could put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera.
Furthermore -- and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight -- this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change. And the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
We need workers to do childcare. We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems which don't have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors. We need more dentists. We need more carpenters. We need more sheet metal workers. And when we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition fee and cancelling student debt, we're going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs.
BURNETT: Senator Sanders, thank you. Mr. Yang, your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income. Why is giving people $1,000 a month better than Sanders' plan to guaranteeing them a job?
YANG: I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don't like your job? What if you're not good at your job?
The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.
Also, Senator Sanders, the description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who's at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition.
Because the fact is -- and you know this in Ohio -- if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace as a party.
BURNETT: Senator Booker, a federal jobs guarantee or $1,000 a month, are those the best solutions there? Please respond.
BOOKER: Well, first of all, I'm happy to get in finally. And I just want to say, as a great -- as a great New Jersian, Yogi Berra, said, "I am having deja vu all over again."
I'm having deja vu all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016's election. We are literally using Donald Trump's lies. And the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves. And the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we're distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office.
(APPLAUSE)
And I'm having deja vu all over again. And I'm having deja vu all over again because we have another health care debate, and we're not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we're in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close. We are seeing all over this country women's reproductive rights under attack. And God bless Kamala, but you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.
(APPLAUSE)
And men...
BURNETT: Thank you.
BOOKER: It is not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives. It's because women are people. And people deserve to control their own bodies.
BURNETT: Senator, thank you. We are going to get to that issue later on tonight.
Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is, quote, "a good story, except it's not really true." So should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?
WARREN: So the data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who've been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.
I have a plan to fix that, and it's accountable capitalism. It says, you want to have one of the giant corporations in America? Then, by golly, 40 percent of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides, gee, we could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, when there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, no, do you know what that does to our company, do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?
We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate.
(APPLAUSE)
We need to restructure strength in this economy, and that's where it starts.
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.
Secretary Castro, what's your response to Senator Warren's claim that automation is a good story, except it's not really true?
CASTRO: Well, I think -- I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? You know, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I'm even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work.
But I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.
I was in Newton, Iowa, a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa, had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down. TPI manufactures wind turbines. They're putting hundreds of people to work at decent-paying jobs and creating a better future for those families.
On top of that, let me just say this. We need to support working families. We need to invest in things like...
BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
CASTRO: ... universal childcare, so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay 20 percent of their income for it.
YANG: Senator Warren, I just need -- I just need to address this.
BURNETT: Go ahead, Mr. Yang.
YANG: Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation. And they're smart. They see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one; 3.5 million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks.
What is that going to mean for the 3.5 million truckers or the 7 million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.








every single day.
BURNETT: Senator Warren, respond, please.
(CROSSTALK)
(APPLAUSE)
WARREN: So I understand that what we're all looking for is how we strengthen America's middle class. And actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. It's one of the reasons that I've put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now.
That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty. And it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more. It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors, and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security.
BURNETT: Thank you.
WARREN: So after a lifetime of hard work, people are entitled to retire with dignity.
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.
WARREN: I see this as an important question about just -- I want to understand the data on this.
BURNETT: Senator, thank you very much.
WARREN: And I want to make sure we're responding to make this work.
BURNETT: Your time is up.
(CROSSTALK)
BURNETT: I want to give Congresswoman Gabbard a chance to respond.
GABBARD: Thank you. You know, really what this is about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well founded. As people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty. They don't know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives.
And I agree with my friend, Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.
This has to do with bad trade deals that we've seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can't forget that.
BURNETT: Thank you very much.
LACEY: One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry. General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio. Now it's 72nd. Today, thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike. All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers.
Senator Booker, one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico. As president, how would you convince GM to return production to the United States?
BOOKER: Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation -- and I hope that my friend, Andrew Yang, will come out for this -- doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month.
We have to start putting the dignity back in work. And, number one, you start having trade deals, not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn't put workers at the center of every trade deal.
We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed.
But it's more than that. I stood with these workers because we're seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because, right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country.
So the other thing that I'll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectoral bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.
LACEY: Thank you, Senator.
Congressman O'Rourke, same question for you. How would you convince GM to bring production back to the United States from Mexico?
O'ROURKE: I've met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there.
What they want is a shot. And they want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.
If we complement that with investment in world-class pre-K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country, and create more than 5 million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot.
They don't want a handout. They don't want a job guarantee. They just want a shot. And as president, I will give them that shot.
LACEY: Thank you, Congressman.
BURNETT: Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate. The top 1 percent now own more of this nation's wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined. Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator, "Billionaires should not exist." Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence?
WARREN: When you have a half-a-million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 people -- 87 million people uninsured or underinsured, when you've got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college, and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage.
And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality. And we cannot afford a billionaire class, whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.
So if you're asking me do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying -- the wealthiest, top 0.1 percent, start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us? Yes, that's exactly what I believe.
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.
(APPLAUSE)
Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What's your plan for closing the income gap?
STEYER: Well, first of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It's absolutely wrong. It's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.
I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings.
As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get $11 bucks. It's $7.25. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it would be over $20 bucks.
There's something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That's why I'm running for president, because we're not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants -- health care, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage...
BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
STEYER: ... unless we break the power of these corporations.
BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.
(APPLAUSE)
Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren's wealth tax plans do that?
BIDEN: No, look, demonizing wealth -- what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea -- we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax -- I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of 39.5 percent.
I would double it, because guess what? Why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is -- like I said -- the -- a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.
Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are -- there's $1,640,000,000,000 in tax loopholes. You can't justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.
Secondly -- I mean, thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to -- we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not.
And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody's right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed is they're going back and not investing in our employees, they're reinvesting and buying back their stock.
BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
BIDEN: See, I'm doing the same thing.
BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
(LAUGHTER)
Senator Warren, your response.
WARREN: So I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your budget, show me your tax plans, and we'll know what your values are.
And right now in America, the top 0.1 percent have so much wealth -- understand this -- that if we put a 2 cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar, and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities...
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.
WARREN: ... and cancel -- no, let me finish, please, and cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it. My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax. It's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren.
BIDEN: No one is supporting billionaires.
BURNETT: Mayor Buttigieg? Mayor Buttigieg, your response?
BUTTIGIEG: I'm all for a wealth tax. I'm all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers. Let me tell, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live.
Washington politicians, congressmen and senators, saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn't even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad's Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school, I didn't know that wasn't every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy. It's a Chevy Cruze. It used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers.
But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It's because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything. And while he's unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that we're paying attention to the wrong things. We're paying attention...
BURNETT: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.
BUTTIGIEG: ... to who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing...
(CROSSTALK)
BURNETT: Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar...
BUTTIGIEG: This is what it's going to take to get something done.
BURNETT: Will a wealth tax -- will a wealth tax work?
KLOBUCHAR: It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.
(LAUGHTER)
We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer. That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth.
So we have different ways -- I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that help the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that, one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement, and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools.
BURNETT: Thank you. Senator...
KLOBUCHAR: It is not one idea that rules here.
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Warren, please respond.
(APPLAUSE)
WARREN: So understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation.
Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.
KLOBUCHAR: I would like to respond to that.
BURNETT: Senator Klobuchar, respond, please.
KLOBUCHAR: You know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people. I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didn't have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldn't have survived. If my mom didn't have unions as a teacher, she wouldn't have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced.
So just because we have different ideas, and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on, we are in Ohio. We can win Ohio in the presidency, but only if we unite, if we unite around ideals and don't go fighting against each other and instead take the fight to him.
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.
Senator Harris, you want to give working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to help close the income gap.
HARRIS: Right.
BURNETT: Is that a better solution than a wealth tax?
HARRIS: Well, here's how I think about it. When I was growing up, my mother raised my sister and me. We would often come home from school before she came home from work. She'd come home, she'd cook dinner, and at some point we'd go to bed, and she'd sit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work.
And when I think about where we are right now in 2020, I do believe justice is on the ballot. It's on the ballot in terms of impeachment, it's on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice, and so many other issues.
So when I think about this issue, I'm thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table, after everyone's gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee trying to figure out how it's going to make -- how he's going to make it work. And he's probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he's going to have to start driving an Uber. And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he's going to miss his kids' soccer games.
That's the reality for Americans today, which is why, yes, when I get elected and pass this bill, which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, that's going to make a real difference in that man's life. And don't tell him that's not a big deal...
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.
HARRIS: ... when he's trying to get through to the end of the month.
BURNETT: Mr. Yang, your response. Would you impose a wealth tax?
YANG: Senator Warren is 100 percent right that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history. And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected.
If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.
BURNETT: Thank you. Thank you.
Congressman O'Rourke, do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality? Your response.
O'ROURKE: I think it's part of the solution. But I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.
I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She's working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities, and any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations, she wants to know how we are going to help her, how we're going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage.
And Senator Warren said show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you'll show me your values. She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase. Under my administration, if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to know that.
(CROSSTALK)
BURNETT: Thank you, Congressman.
(UNKNOWN): Erin, let me say...
BURNETT: I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.
WARREN: So I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive. Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires. My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America. I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for.
And all I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.
BURNETT: Senator, thank you.
WARREN: That's what this is about.
BURNETT: Senator Castro, your response?
O'ROURKE: There's no argument there. I just want to make sure that we're lifting up those families who are working and need help through an expanded earned income tax credit or child tax credit...
WARREN: But that is...
(CROSSTALK)
O'ROURKE: ... which we will do in my administration.
BURNETT: Go ahead, Senator.
WARREN: That is the point. This is universal childcare for every baby in this country, early educational opportunities for every child, universal pre-K no matter where you live for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old.
O'ROURKE: But in addition to that, will they see a tax increase?
WARREN: Raising the wages -- no, raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. This is about universal college, about investment in our HBCUs, about making sure that we get rid of the student loan debt burden that is crushing...
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator...
(CROSSTALK)
O'ROURKE: ... I just want to know if working families are going to see a tax increase.
(CROSSTALK)
BURNETT: I want to get Secretary Castro in here, please, Congressman. Go ahead, Secretary.
CASTRO: Thanks a lot, Erin. And you see that everybody has their own plans. And let me just say that the way that I view this is born out of my own experience.
I grew up like I bet a lot folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on TV. I grew up with my twin brother, Joaquin, in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother. And we knew what it was like to wonder whether we were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off.
And when I was a kid, to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter, and that's what's happening to a lot of families these days. I was in Las Vegas a few months ago, and I visited people who were homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations.
We can do better than that. I believe that wealth and equality tax, as I've proposed, is part of the answer, but also I've proposed an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate...
BURNETT: Thank you, Secretary.
CASTRO: ... and investing in things like universal childcare and affordable housing.
BURNETT: All right. Senator Booker, please respond.
BOOKER: Well, first of all, I just want to be respond by -- you know, we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president. And how we talk about each other in this debate actually really matters.
I've had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage, and tearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable. I have seen this script before.
(APPLAUSE)
It didn't work in 2016, and it will be a disaster for us in 2020. And so I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren. I have a different plan than many people on this stage. And it involves, again, fair taxes for the richest. We have a lot of work to do there. But we've had 20 years of presidential debates, and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty.
We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world.
My plan will focus on that, and these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not defining ourselves just by what we're against, but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for.
BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Booker.
(APPLAUSE)
COOPER: We've got to take a quick break. We've got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio will be right back after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.
I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American forces from northern Syria, abandoning America's long-time Kurdish allies. As a result, Turkey has now evaded Syria, ISIS detainees have escaped, and the Kurds have announced a new deal with the government in Damascus, a victory for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and Russia, and Iran.
Vice President Biden, we know you would not have withdrawn troops from northern Syria in this way, but that is already in process. So would you send American troops back into northern Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence and protect our Kurdish allies?
BIDEN: I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad's people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they're in, they'll only go to Europe and won't affect us.
It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history -- excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I've never seen a time -- and I've spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I've spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what's happening here.
What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he's going to have a problem -- because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.
COOPER: Just to clarify, Mr. Vice President, would you want American troops back in northern Syria?
BIDEN: I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being -- having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful what this man has done.
(APPLAUSE)
COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard, last week you said that American troops should get out of Syria now. You don't agree with how the president handled the withdrawal. What would you have done differently? How would you have pulled out troops without the bloodshed we're seeing now?
GABBARD: Well, first of all, we've got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we've been waging in Syria.
Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war.
Not only that, but the New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.
As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things -- ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al Qaida in Syria who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.
COOPER: Thank you.
GABBARD: I'd like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in Syria, finally.
WARREN: So, look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.
What this president has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn't understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America. In Syria, he has created a bigger-than-ever humanitarian crisis. He has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life.
I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this.
COOPER: Thank you, Senator.
WARREN: I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed.
COOPER: Thank you.
WARREN: We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region.
COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, Mayor Buttigieg, like many of your fellow candidates on the stage, you've been calling for an end to endless wars. What's your response on Syria?
BUTTIGIEG: Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.
Look, I didn't think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it's also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.
Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed -- ashamed -- of what their country has done. We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms asking, what the hell happened to American leadership?
And when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word. And our allies knew it and our enemies knew it.
COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.
BUTTIGIEG: You take that away, you are taking away what makes America America.
COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.
BUTTIGIEG: It makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place.
(APPLAUSE)
COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?
GABBARD: Yeah, absolutely. So, really, what you're saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like Al Qaida, HTS, al-Nusra and others, because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war? That's really what you're saying?
COOPER: Mayor Pete -- Mayor Buttigieg?
BUTTIGIEG: No, you can embrace -- or you can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump's policy, as you're doing.
GABBARD: Will you end the regime change war, is the question.
BUTTIGIEG: What we are doing...
GABBARD: What is an endless war if it's not a regime change war?
COOPER: Allow him to respond. Please allow him to respond.
BUTTIGIEG: What we are doing -- or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.
When I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.
This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility has been tattered.
COOPER: Thank you.
BUTTIGIEG: I will restore U.S. credibility before it is finally too late.
COOPER: Senator Sanders, is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO?
SANDERS: I'm sorry. Say that again?
COOPER: Is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO?
SANDERS: No, Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.
The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people, in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, "We're with you, we're standing with you." And then suddenly, one day after a phone call with Erdogan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy.
Now, you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States. In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.
(APPLAUSE)
BUTTIGIEG: But this is really important, because what this president has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies, or sometimes allies, too. Remember, the problem right now is not just that -- with our competitors. And, for example a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don't get a peep of support from the president. It's just not the behavior of adversaries like Russia.
But our one-time allies, like Saudi Arabia, which the CIA just concluded was responsible, as we all knew, for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist.
And Turkey, which was an American ally. That's the point. We had leverage. But when we abandon the international stage, when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation, the consequence is the disappearance of U.S. leadership...
COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.
BUTTIGIEG: ... from the world stage.
COOPER: Senator...
BUTTIGIEG: And that makes this entire world a more dangerous place.
COOPER: Senator Klobuchar, should Turkey remain in NATO? Your response?
KLOBUCHAR: We need to work with our allies, to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here. And I think we need to talk about this not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our president blew it and now he's too proud to say it.
And what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say come back, Turkey, and stop this, because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mideast.
Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement and gives them holding the bag and gives the power to China and Russia.
COOPER: Thank you, Senator.
KLOBUCHAR: Think about the nuclear agreement with Russia that he precipitously pulled out of. This is part of a pattern. It's not an isolated incident.
COOPER: Thank you, Senator.
Senator Harris, given that the U.S. abandoned our Kurdish allies, what would you do as president to convince the rest of the world that we can still be trusted?
HARRIS: That's a great question, Anderson, because the commander-in-chief of the United States of America has as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland.
I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security and hot spots around the world.
What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out. And in this case, he sold out the Kurds, who, yes, fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS.
And let's be clear. What Donald Trump has done, because of that phone call with Erdogan, is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a "get out of jail free" card. And you know who the winner is in this? There are four: Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS.
This is a crisis of Donald Trump's making. And it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump's making. And that's why dude got to go. And when I am commander-in-chief, we will stop this madness.
COOPER: Secretary Castro, your response.

DEBATE WILL TEST WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE CAN MEASURE UP TO IMPEACHMENT: Environmental groups and climate activists have low expectations for tonight’s fourth Democratic primary presidential debate in Ohio.
"We had momentum, but impeachment has eclipsed that,” Leah Stokes, an assistant professor of environmental politics at the University of California at Santa Barbara, told Josh. “We are really not the No. 1 issue right now which is unfortunate because we were before."
The overcrowded stage — a dozen candidates, the most in history — will likely be confronted with more immediate questions about impeaching President Trump, and his pullback from Syria, making climate change an afterthought.
“We are fairly sanguine to the reality that this debate is likely to focus on Syria and impeachment,” Brett Hartl of the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund told Josh.
Climate change has received record attention in the previous three debates, but not enough to satisfy activists who note that Democratic primary voters list the issue among their top concerns.
“Outside of the dedicated forums, questions about the climate crisis have taken up far too little debate time so far,” Denis Dison, a spokesperson for the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, told Abby. “And yes, the impeachment inquiry may crowd out policy substance tonight.”
As Dison notes, there have been two town halls dedicated to climate change hosted by television networks, but those forums have not allowed candidates to debate each other, instead serving questions to candidates one-by-one.
The forums did spotlight policy differences on issues such as fracking, nuclear power, carbon pricing, and the Senate filibuster, but the sprawling debates have not featured substantial discussions.
“The DNC rules have failed the public by not thinning out the field,” Hartl said. “If Tulsi Gabbard, Beto O’Rourke, and other marginal candidates are still on the debate stage, then having a good debate on any topic is nearly impossible. Saturday Night Live is doing a better job focusing in on the likely candidates.”
Outside the debates and forums, Democratic candidates are not adequately campaigning on climate change despite the fact that all participants have released comprehensive plans to address the issue, according to the League of Conservation Voters.
LCV released a new report Tuesday reviewing how much candidates are focusing on climate. For example, a review of the stump speeches of the 12 candidates who qualified for the October debate — delivered from June through September at three major events in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina — found almost three quarters (23 out of 31) included some mention of climate change, but only 13 out of 31 speeches discussed specific climate solutions.

LIGHTS ON IN CALIFORNIA MEANS SPOTLIGHT ON PG&E: Power was restored to California counties by end-of-day Saturday, but Pacific Gas and Electric’s troubles are hardly over.
In total, nearly 800,000 homes and businesses were affected by the power shutdowns, which started on Wednesday amid severe wind conditions that PG&E said it was concerned could spark wildfires. The utility found 50 instances weather-related damages to its system in the areas affected by the blackout, Jeff Smith, a spokesman for the utility, told Abby.
But Democratic policymakers, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, aren’t satisfied. They are already calling on the state’s utility regulators to evaluate PG&E’s performance and hold the utility accountable for any missteps — of which Newsom thinks there were plenty.
“It was clear from the start that PG&E implemented this extraordinary measure with astounding neglect and lack of preparation,” Newsom wrote in a letter Monday to California’s chief utility regulator. Newsom said he also will urge PG&E to provide affected customers with a rebate — $100 for homes and $250 for small businesses that lost power.
Meanwhile, California’s fight against fossil fuels rages on: Newsom signed half a dozen bills Saturday, at the close of California’s legislative session, targeting oil and gas production in the state.
One of those bills, AB 342, aims to prevent Trump administration attempts to extract oil and gas on California soil. The legislation bars any California entity from entering into a lease that would allow construction of new oil and gas equipment on federal lands.
LAWSUITS HEAT UP THE CLIMATE CHANGE DEBATE: Litigation against fossil fuel companies is heating up.
Two big developments: This month 26 companies sued by the city of Baltimore asked the U.S. Supreme Court to keep a Maryland state court from hearing the case. The companies want the case transferred to federal court, where similar lawsuits have failed and a single ruling could be issued, rather than sprawling decisions across jurisdictions.
Meanwhile, a separate lawsuit filed by New York state against Exxon — which takes a different legal approach — goes to trial Oct. 23, accusing the company of committing securities fraud by misleading investors about the danger climate change poses for its business.
What’s at stake: David Bookbinder, an attorney with the libertarian Niskanen Center involved in one of the public nuisance suits, told Josh the results of the public nuisance cases could help determine who bears the costs of climate change.
“The local governments are paying more and more money to provide basic government services that are more expensive because of climate change,” said Bookbinder.
Industry fights back: Companies contend that climate change is better handled through public policy and that litigation threatens to undermine cooperation between the industry and policymakers.
“If these municipalities really want to do something about climate change, they should work with manufacturers on local energy innovations, not waste time and resources on this baseless litigation,” said Phil Goldberg, special counsel for the Manufacturers’ Accountability Project, an initiative of the National Association of Manufacturers.

TRUMP PREPARES PROPOSED NEPA REFORMS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS: The Trump administration is moving closer to releasing proposed reforms to how the federal government implements the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, in permitting and environmental reviews for infrastructure projects.
The White House’s Council on Environmental Quality submitted proposed updates to the regulations governing NEPA to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on Friday, signaling a public release is coming soon.
What it means: The change would build off several Trump administration executive orders from 2018 meant to streamline the permitting and environmental review process for federally funded projects, ranging from pipelines, to highways, to transmission.
In June, CEQ also issued draft guidance directing federal agencies to limit consideration of greenhouse gas emissions in environmental reviews.
That guidance would give agencies the discretion to ignore the indirect effects of greenhouse gas emissions of a given project, such as a pipeline, and seeks to clarify that agencies only focus on the “direct” environmental effects of the project itself without weighing the after effects on climate change. Indirect emissions would include natural gas after it has been shipped downstream and used in a power plant, for example.
The changes to the NEPA regulations look more broadly beyond greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
CEQ has not issued a major update to NEPA’s regulations since 1978. While the Trump administration can’t change the underlying statute absent action from Congress, the law is broadly written and courts have historically deferred to CEQ’s interpretation of NEPA’s regulations.
INDUSTRY AND GREENS LEAD BIPARTISAN PUSH FOR PASSAGE OF ADVANCED NUCLEAR BILL: A coalition of businesses, industry groups, environmentalists, and labor unions wrote a letter Tuesday to House and Senate leadership asking them to pass legislation spurring the development of advanced nuclear technologies.
“NELA would help reestablish the United States as a global leader in the next generation of emissions-free nuclear energy,” wrote the groups, which include ClearPath Action, Third Way, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Nature Conservancy, utilities Duke Energy and Xcel Energy, and more.
The Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which was approved in June by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, would expand the use of federal power purchase agreements, build demonstration projects for a range of nuclear technologies, establish new federal research facilities, set new national goals and strategies, and ensure the availability of advanced reactor fuel.
COMPANIES MUST DO MORE ON CLIMATE THAN VOLUNTARY PLEDGES, ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY: Businesses, given their power to shape public policy, should be advocating for science-based climate policies in line with the latest international climate science, 11 major environmental groups wrote Tuesday in an open call to companies.
The groups are urging companies to more clearly align their policy advocacy with the voluntary emissions reductions goals many have set. That should include companies working to align their trade groups’ lobbying with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, the groups wrote.
Signatories on the letter, also published in the New York Times, include: Environmental Defense Fund, World Resources Institute, World Wildlife Fund, Union of Concerned Scientists, and the sustainable investment group Ceres.
Some companies already agree with the environmental groups. The Sustainable Food Policy Alliance — including Danone, Mars, Unilever, and Nestle, ran a full-page ad Tuesday in Roll Call supporting the environmental groups’ call.
EVERYONE LOVES THEIR SUVs: And their impact on global greenhouse gas emissions and oil demand is huge, the International Energy Agency says in a new analysis.
The number of SUVs on the road has grown exponentially in the last decade — from 35 million vehicles in 2010 to now over 200 million — and the bigger, heavier cars were the second-largest driver of global greenhouse gas increases since 2010, according to the IEA.
If that growth continues, the addition in global oil demand could jeopardize the ability of electric cars to make a dent in transportation emissions, two IEA analysts wrote. Expect more on this issue from IEA when the agency releases its World Energy Outlook next month.

Amy Klobuchar fights to stand out in fourth Democratic debate

Texto completo: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has acknowledged a “viral moment” could help spark her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
That’s a tough thing to create when you are one of a dozen candidates on a Westerville, Ohio, stage Tuesday for one of the largest presidential primary debates ever.
Klobuchar definitely got some fresh exposure during the three-hour contest. She logged the third-most speaking time of the candidates, just behind front-runners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, according to the New York Times.
The Times and CNN hosted the fourth Democratic primary debate at Otterbein University.
Klobuchar largely stuck to her moderate approach, arguing nuanced policies were better than the more attention-getting proposals candidates like Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders are known for, such as free college and universal health care.
“The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is a plan is something you can get done. We can get this public option done,” she said in support of a public health care option instead of Medicare-for-all plans that she says will be too costly and will result in 150 million people being kicked off private insurance.
Klobuchar argued that not backing things like a universal income or dramatic new taxes on wealth doesn’t mean she won’t raise taxes on the rich and corporations to provide more services for those who are struggling.
“We just have different approaches,” she said. “Your idea is not the only idea.”
She had a similar take on new gun-control measures, arguing passing universal background checks was more important than fighting over how to ban certain types of guns outright.
“The public is with us on this in a big way,” she said about increasing background checks for gun purchases. “I don’t want to screw this up. Let’s not mess this up with this fight.”
Being a moderate candidate may make it hard for Klobuchar to score a breakout moment. But her positions are far from outside the mainstream of Democrats’ ideals.
At the top of the debate, she joined the majority on the stage putting their support behind the U.S. House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
“We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests,” she said.
Continuing to strike a balance, at the end of the night, Klobuchar picked the late Sen. John McCain when asked about a friend who had a big impact on her life. She quoted a line from his book that McCain pointed to when Klobuchar visited him just before he died.
“There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself,” Klobuchar quoted.
“That’s what we are doing right now,” she said. “What unites us is so much more than what divides us.”
Democratic presidential candidates will debate for a fifth time in November. So far, seven of the candidates on the stage Tuesday have qualified to appear; Klobuchar is not one of them.
In order to make it to the next debate, Klobuchar needs stronger numbers in national polls or in the early primary states.

Texto completo: Doce de los candidatos demócratas que se enfrentan para postularse como rival de Donald Trump en las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 se enfrentan hoy en un debate celebrado en la Universidad de Otterbein, en Ohio.
El debate presidencial de los demócratas este lunes está organizado por la cadena CNN y el diario The New York Times y puede ser el último de cuatro de los candidatos. La cifra de candidatos es récord para un debate de este tipo . En el siguiente debate, el de noviembre, hasta cuatro de ellos podrán perder su oportunidad de enfrentarse en público a sus competidores.
Julián Castro, el único representante latino, es uno de ellos. A él se unen la representante hawaiana Tulsi Gabbard, la senadora de Minnesota Amy Klobuchar y el exrepresentante demócrata Beto O’Rourke. Si estos cuatro candidatos no se esfuerzan al máximo esta noche, probablemente no participen en el próximo debate.
Esta es la primera vez que se celebra un debate después de que se iniciaran las investigaciones que pueden acabar en un juicio político al presidente Donald Trump. De hecho, el tema del impeachment ha sido el primero por el que han preguntado a los candidatos.
Por otro lado, también la primera vez que Joe Biden sube a un escenario de debate sin ser el claro favorito para las primarias demócratas ya que ahora se los disputa con la senadora de Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren. Otra de las primicias de este debate es que el senador vuelve a la campaña después de sufrir un ataque cardíaco.

Texto completo: Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Pensacola, made an appearance at the American Priority Conference at Trump National Doral in Miami last week where a violent video edited to show President Donald Trump carrying out a massacre of members of the news media and his political opponents was shown.
Gaetz, who was a speaker at the conference, told the News Journal he hasn't seen the video.
"I didn't attend any sessions other than the time allotted to me for remarks," Gaetz said in a text message to the News Journal.
Other headliners to speak at the conference included Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump Jr.
The video has drawn condemnation from the depicted victims in the video since the New York Times reported the existence of the video on Sunday.
An organizer for the conference confirmed that the video was shown but denounced its showing as part of a "meme exhibit" with content submitted by third parties, according to The New York Times. "This matter is under review," said the organizer Alex Phillips.
Phillips also said on the conference's website it was "shocking" that the Times did not report on other portions of the conference, "Including our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence while claiming to be upset over a meme that was not sanctioned, shown on stage, or approved."
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday morning that the president has not yet viewed the video, but condemns its contents based on reports. She said he will see it shortly. Trump has not directly responded.
The video is an edited scene from the film "Kingsman: The Secret Service," that replaces actor Colin Firth's face with Trumps as he enters a "Church of Fake News" and begins shooting members of the congregation.
The churchgoers have various news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed onto their bodies
Trump's character shoots, stabs and sets fire to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama, among others.
Gaetz said political criticism should never become violent.
"I have many close friends who work in media," Gaetz said. "My sister worked in media. The mainstream media often deserves criticism and mockery, but nobody should be physically harmed based on their political viewpoint, no matter how biased or corrupt."

Purple &amp; Bold: China, the NBA and the limits of basketball diplomacy

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Monday, Oct. 14 edition of the Purple & Bold Lakers newsletter. To receive breaking Lakers news and the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
The NBA has a program called Basketball Without Borders, a community service initiative that has run camps in 27 different countries over the last two decades. The dream goes something like this: Through the game of basketball, diverse cultures can find some common ground.
But the world as we know it has borders — not just geopolitical lines on a map, but borders of ideology and values. And never have the limits of NBA diplomacy become more apparent than last week.
The Lakers and Nets unwittingly put themselves in the midst of an international incident this week because of a tweet. It’s a weird situation, especially given that the Chinese response has felt particularly outsized, but it’s highlighted what the limitations are for a game to be a unifying force in a world with endlessly complex divisions.
The NBA became so aware of the thorny nature of the politics of the situation that they shut down media availability for the entire trip. The Athletic reported that players, most prominently LeBron James, were wary of the onus for the NBA’s response to China’s actions being put on them, and asked to not be made available for questions. Rather than putting players in position to say something harmful either abroad or at home (like James Harden awkwardly apologizing to China for his general manager’s tweet), the NBA and the player’s association wanted avoid commentary “in real time,” at least until everyone was safely home.
It should be noted here that China is a country that tightly controls and restricts visas: Journalists, for example, require multiple references to just get in. Multiple times, the government kept the NBA in the dark as to whether they would even be allowed to participate in their events. A situation where the Chinese government harassed or detained a player for something they said while visiting abroad could have felt like a very real threat to the traveling contingent. If that’s the case, Adam Silver probably made a wise choice to keep them out of the line of fire.
But now that everyone is safely home, where does it go from here? The NBA would probably prefer this situation quietly goes away, and that they can continue their lucrative contracts in a country where basketball has been increasingly popular. The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese government was toning down rhetoric against the NBA — which make sense because the incident has drawn attention to their authoritarian handling of the Hong Kong protests. It’s bad diplomacy to cut off a league that’s well-liked in the country, disappointing fans locally and making observers abroad question whether they should do business there.
But it seems difficult to imagine this will go away soon. Next year, the NBA will be pressed to continue exhibition games in China: Which teams are going to want to go? Which teams are going to want their players subjected to questions about what it’s like to be the first teams to play since the international incident that briefly flared up tensions between the NBA and China? What do they think of how China handles Hong Kong (because in a year, a lack of knowledge on the situation will be a less convincing case)?
In absence of the voices of players and other NBA personnel who actually went to China, Steve Kerr’s voice stood out among people stateside who spoke on the issue. Well, “spoke” might be a strong word, but Kerr offered that it’s easier for NBA players and coaches to speak on social issues that are close to home. That’s understandable, and it does seem like an unfair burden to expect the NBA to set the example for all US-Chinese relations in all cases.
But it’s also true that the NBA’s reputation as a league that’s outspoken and unafraid to speak the truth on important issues is taking some hits.
As Kerr put it: “Using the game as a force for the greater good. I think those things are important, those values are important. Obviously, there are tremendous financial forces at play here — so how you reconcile all that, I don’t know.”
No one else in the NBA appears to know either.
In the interest of examining the issue, I’m dropping a lot of related reading down in the links.
BUT WHY TONIGHT?
If you’re surprised to see a Lakers-Warriors home game less than 72 hours after the Lakers last played in China, it’s hard to imagine that the Lakers are thrilled about it either.
It’s unclear if players will miss the game due to fatigue. It’s easy to imagine LeBron James, for example, sitting this one out, especially if Anthony Davis is unable to play following his MRI on his sprained thumb. Preseason games, it should be noted, are firmly under control of teams. But it’s also true that any team going to China is hard-pressed to squeeze six preseason games into its schedule.
Frank Vogel said earlier this month that he would be judicious when it came to divvying up time for the long preseason schedule: “I think they made a wise decision a couple years back to reduce it from 8 preseason games to six. Potentially could go even further down to four. I think each coach has an obligation to their team to make sure they’re being smart with their vets. Make sure they’re getting enough reps to learn their new teammates and the system. Get sharp, ready to play, but not overdo it.”

Texto completo: If parents were giving their children virtue names today, as the Puritans used to do, nobody would choose Charity or Grace or Patience. Instead, half of all baby girls born in America would be named Empowerment or Assertiveness.
For women in this cultural moment, assertiveness is perhaps the ultimate in aspirational personal qualities. At the nexus of feminism and self-help lies the promise that if we can only learn to state our needs more forcefully — to “lean in” and stop apologizing and demand a raise and power pose in the bathroom before meetings and generally act like a ladyboss (though not a regular boss of course; that would be unladylike) — everything from the pay gap to mansplaining to the glass ceiling would all but disappear. Women! Be more like men. Men, as you were.
There are several problems with this fist-pumping restyling of feminism, most obviously that it slides all too easily into victim blaming. The caricature of the shrinking violet, too fearful to ask for a raise, is a handy straw-woman for corporations that would rather blame their female employees for a lack of assertiveness than pay them fairly.
There’s also the awkward issue that it turns out to be untrue. Research shows that despite countless attempts to rebrand the wage gap as a “confidence gap,” women ask for raises as often as men do. They just don’t get them.
But even if we leave these narrative glitches aside and accept the argument that female unassertiveness is a major cause of gender inequality and that complex, systemic problems can be fixed with individual self-improvement, we are still left with a deeply sexist premise.
The assumption that assertiveness is a more valuable trait than say, deference is itself the product of a ubiquitous and corrosive gender hierarchy.
As a rule, anything associated with girls or women — from the color pink to domestic labor — is by definition assigned a lower cultural value than things associated with boys or men. Fashion, for instance, is vain and shallow, while baseball is basically a branch of philosophy. Tax dollars are poured into encouraging girls to take up STEM subjects, but no one seems to care much whether boys become nurses. Girls are routinely given pep talks to be “anything a boy can be,” a glorious promotion from their current state, whereas to encourage a boy to behave more like a girl is to inflict an emasculating demotion. Female hobbies, careers, possessions and behaviors are generally dismissed as frivolous, trivial, niche or low status — certainly nothing to which any self-respecting boy or man might ever aspire.
“Women: Improve yourselves!” has always been a baseline instruction of both the world at large and the self-help movement. Take the whole “Women Who …” subgenre, a surprisingly large range of books whose titles start with the words “Women Who …” and end with a character flaw that then blames us for our own failure to be happy or successful. “Women Who Love Too Much,” “Women Who Think Too Much,” “Women Who Worry Too Much,” “Women Who Do Too Much.”
Rarely do we stop to consider that many of life’s problems might be better explained by the alternative titles “Men Who Love Too Little,” “ … Think Too Little,” “ … Worry Too Little” or “ … Do Too Little.” But instead we assume without question that whatever men are doing or thinking is what we all should be aiming for.
Now the assertiveness movement is taking this same depressingly stacked ranking system and selling it back to us as feminism. We in turn barely question whether the male standard really is the more socially desirable or morally sound set of behaviors or consider whether women might actually have had it right all along.
After all, one man’s “assertive” is often another woman’s abrasive, entitled or rude. Surely many of our current most pressing social and political problems — from #MeToo to campus rape, school shootings to President Trump’s Twitter posturing — are caused not by a lack of assertiveness in women but by an overassertiveness among men. In the workplace, probably unsurprisingly to many women who are routinely talked over, patronized or ignored by male colleagues, research shows that rather than women being underconfident, men tend to be overconfident in relation to their actual abilities. Women generally aren’t failing to speak up; the problem is that men are refusing to pipe down.
Take apologizing, the patient zero of the assertiveness movement. Women do too much of it, according to countless op-ed essays, books, apps and shampoo ads. There’s even a Gmail plug-in that is supposed to help us quit this apparently self-destructive habit by policing our emails for signs of excessive contrition, underlining anything of an overly apologetic nature in angry red wiggles.
The various anti-apologizing tracts often quote a 2010 study showing that the reason women say they are sorry more often than men is that we have a “lower threshold for what constitutes offensive behavior.” This is almost exclusively framed as an example of female deficiency. But really, isn’t a person with a “high threshold of what constitutes offensive behavior” just a fancy name for a jerk?
Rarely in the course of this anti-apologizing crusade do we ever stop to consider the social and moral value of apologies and the cost of obliterating them from our interactions. Apologizing is a highly symbolic and socially efficient way to take responsibility for our actions, to right a wrong and clear space for another person’s feelings. It’s a routine means of injecting self-examination and moral reflection into daily life.
Indeed many of our problems with male entitlement and toxic behavior both in the workplace and elsewhere could well be traced back to a fundamental unwillingness among men to apologize, or even perceive that they have anything to apologize for. Certainly many emails I have received from men over the years might have benefited from a Gmail plug-in pointing out the apology-shaped hole. The energy we expend in getting women to stop apologizing might be better spent encouraging men to start.
So perhaps instead of nagging women to scramble to meet the male standard, we should instead be training men and boys to aspire to women’s cultural norms, and selling those norms to men as both default and desirable. To be more deferential. To reflect and listen and apologize where an apology is due (and if unsure, to err on the side of a superfluous sorry than an absent one). To aim for modesty and humility and cooperation rather than blowhard arrogance.
It would be a challenge, for sure. Pity the human resources manager trying to sell a deference training course to male employees. She would need to paint all the PowerPoint slides black and hand out Nerf guns just to get started. As long as the threat of emasculation is a baseline terror for men, encouraging them to act more like women still instinctively feels like a form of humiliation.
Which is exactly why we need to try, because until female norms and standards are seen as every bit as valuable and aspirational as those of men, we will never achieve equality. Promoting qualities such as deference, humility, cooperation and listening skills will benefit not only women but also businesses, politics and even men themselves, freeing them from the constant and exhausting expectation to perform a grandstanding masculinity, even when they feel insecure or unsure.
So H.R. managers and self-help authors, slogan writers and TED Talk talkers: Use your platforms and your cultural capital to ask that men be the ones to do the self-improvement for once. Stand up for deference. Write the book that tells men to sit back and listen and yield to others’ judgment. Code the app that shows them where to put the apologies in their emails. Teach them how to assess their own abilities realistically and modestly. Tell them to “lean out,” reflect and consider the needs of others rather than assertively restating their own. Sell the female standard as the norm.
Perhaps some capitulation poses in the bathroom before a big meeting might help.

Texto completo: “I have seen the future, and it works,” the left-wing journalist Lincoln Steffens famously declared, after observing Bolshevik Russia in its infancy. What was intended as a utopian boast soon read as a dystopian prediction — but then eventually, as Stalinist ambition gave way to Brezhnevian decay, it curdled into a sour sort of joke. By the time the Soviet Union dissolved, even the people inclined to defend the “ideals” of Marxism tended to acknowledge that as a system for managing an advanced economy and running an effective government, the one thing Soviet communism definitely didn’t do was work .
Today, though, there is a palpable fear in the liberal West that Beijing is succeeding where Moscow failed, and that the peculiar blend of Maoist dogmatics, nationalist fervor, one-party meritocracy and surveillance-state capitalism practiced in the People’s Republic of China really is a working alternative to liberal democracy — with cruelty sustained by efficiency, and a resilience that might outstrip our own.
This fear is stoked by a growing realization that the “Chimerica” project, our great integration of markets and supply chains, has had roughly the opposite effect to the one its U.S. architects anticipated. Instead of importing liberal ideas into China and undermining the Politburo’s rule, the Chimerican age has strengthened Beijing’s policy of social control and imported totalitarian influences into the officially free world.
A crucial mechanism for both trends is the internet, once hailed as a great liberator and now revealed as something rather different — a surveillance engine that the NKVD could only dream about, a machine that induces its users to trade privacy for entertainment and distraction, and a panopticon whose global expanse exposes anyone who wants to do business in China to the manufactured consensus of Chinese nationalism, the grievance politics of the Politburo.
China’s influence within U.S. industry is evident well beyond the online realm, of course. But its successful censorship of U.S. businesses generally involves websites, app stores, social media. It’s not a coincidence that the National Basketball Association’s supine behavior toward China in the past week — from what is supposedly the most progressive and politically engagé of the American professional sports leagues — followed from a general manager fleetingly expressing support for the Hong Kong protesters on Twitter. Likewise when China induced Marriott to fire a luckless $14-an-hour worker recently, it was for seeming to endorse Tibetan independence by “favoriting” a tweet. Having figured out how to tame their internet, the Chinese are intent on using commercial power to tame ours.
How afraid should this make us? One possibility is that just as Chimerican optimism was once delusional, so now Chimerican fears are overblown. The Chinese regime has capabilities that outstrip Soviet Russia, but deep weaknesses as well. China’s demographic picture is potentially disastrous, its economic surge may be leveling off, many of its best and brightest are eager to depart, and it has more to lose than America from constant trade brinkmanship, a trans-Pacific Cold War footing. As with fears of Japanese dominance in the 1990s, some Sinophobes may overrate the internal strength of the Chinese model, the permanence of its ascent.
But one can believe that China may be somewhat weaker than it looks and also believe that the fear of the People’s Republic is a healthy thing for Americans to cultivate. For one thing, our policy approach to Chinese power clearly needs adjustment, and yet there are many high-dollar reasons for our elite to protect their Chimerican entanglements — with “elite” here including not only the influence-peddlers of D.C. and Silicon Valley, but also figures like Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, whose professional obligations induced him to draw shameful analogies between America’s sins and Chinese totalitarianism this week.
Given those elite incentives, the only way our China policy will be permanently adjusted is if the outrage that bubbled against the NBA in recent days becomes a permanent factor in U.S. politics, a sentiment that cannot be ignored.
Then, too, a palpable fear of China as a different, darker model for high-tech modernity could be a useful brake our own potential slide in their direction. Not that we are ever likely to reach the fullness of Xi Jinping Thought and Uighur re-education. But there are clear tendencies within our own society — the evaporation of privacy and the rise of online mobs, the power of “inner party” oligarchies and the consolidation of tech giants, certain radical ambitions among progressives and certain authoritarian flirtations on the right — that converge with the Chinese model of oligarchy, surveillance and ideological control.
Given these tendencies and drifts, the bipartisan, pan-ideological outrage over the NBA’s spinelessness is genuinely encouraging. There is a cliché that in fighting an enemy you become much more like them, but the reverse is just as often true. For a divided, balkanized America, it might take the looming-up of a rival power, the rise of a dark but all-too-plausible alternative, to remind us of who we are, and what we do not want to be.

We Need a New Capitalism

Texto completo: Capitalism, I acknowledge, has been good to me.
Over the past 20 years, the company that I co-founded, Salesforce, has generated billions in profits and made me a very wealthy person. I have been fortunate to live a life beyond the wildest imaginations of my great-grandfather, who immigrated to San Francisco from Kiev in the late 1800s.
Yet, as a capitalist, I believe it's time to say out loud what we all know to be true: Capitalism, as we know it, is dead.
Yes, free markets -- and societies that cherish scientific research and innovation -- have pioneered new industries, discovered cures that have saved millions from disease and unleashed prosperity that has lifted billions of people out of poverty. On a personal level, the success that I've achieved has allowed me to embrace philanthropy and invest in improving local public schools and reducing homelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area, advancing children's health care and protecting our oceans.
But capitalism as it has been practiced in recent decades -- with its obsession on maximizing profits for shareholders -- has also led to horrifying inequality. Globally, the 26 richest people in the world now have as much wealth as the poorest 3.8 billion people, and the relentless spewing of carbon emissions is pushing the planet toward catastrophic climate change. In the United States, income inequality has reached its highest level in at least 50 years, with the top 0.1 percent -- people like me -- owning roughly 20 percent of the wealth while many Americans cannot afford to pay for a $ 400 emergency. It's no wonder that support for capitalism has dropped, especially among young people.
To my fellow business leaders and billionaires, I say that we can no longer wash our hands of our responsibility or what people do with our products. Yes, profits are important, but so is society. And if our quest for greater profits leaves our world worse off than before, all we will have taught our children is the power of greed.
It's time for a new capitalism -- a more fair, equal and sustainable capitalism that actually works for everyone and where businesses, including tech companies, don't just take from society but truly give back and have a positive impact.
What might a new capitalism look like?
First, business leaders need to embrace a broader vision of their responsibilities by looking beyond shareholder return and also measuring their stakeholder return. This requires that they focus not only on their shareholders, but also on all of their stakeholders -- their employees, customers, communities and the planet. Fortunately, nearly 200 executives with the Business Roundtable recently committed their companies, including Salesforce, to this approach, saying that the "purpose of a corporation" includes "a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders." As a next step, the government could formalize this commitment, perhaps with the Security and Exchange Commission requiring public companies to publicly disclose their key stakeholders and show how they are impacting those stakeholders.
Unfortunately, not everyone agrees. Some business leaders objected to the landmark declaration. The Council of Institutional Investors argued that "it is government, not companies, that should shoulder the responsibility of defining and addressing societal objectives." When asked whether companies should serve all stakeholders and whether capitalism should be updated, Vice President Mike Pence warned against "leftist policies."
But suggesting that companies must choose between doing well and doing good is a false choice. Successful businesses can and must do both. In fact, with political dysfunction in Washington, D.C., Americans overwhelmingly say C.E.O.s should take the lead on economic and social challenges, and employees, investors and customers increasingly seek out companies that share their values.
When government is unable or unwilling to act, business should not wait. Our experience at Salesforce shows that profit and purpose go hand in hand and that business can be the greatest platform for change.
Legislation to close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act have stalled in Congress for years, and today women still only make about 80 cents, on average, for every dollar earned by men. But congressional inaction does not absolve companies from their responsibility. Since learning that we were paying women less than men for equal work at Salesforce, we have spent $ 10.3 million to ensure equal pay; today we conduct annual audits to ensure that pay remains equal. Just about every company, I suspect, has a pay gap -- and every company can close it now.
For many businesses, giving back to their communities is an afterthought -- something they only do after they've turned a profit. But by integrating philanthropy into our company culture from the beginning -- giving 1 percent of our equity, time and technology -- Salesforce has donated nearly $ 300 million to worthy causes, including local public schools and addressing homelessness. To me, the boys and girls in local schools and homeless families on the streets of our city are our stakeholders, too. Entrepreneurs looking to develop great products and develop their communities can join the 9,000 companies in the Pledge 1% movement and commit to donating 1 percent of their equity, time and product, starting on their first day of business.
Nationally, despite massive breaches of consumer information, lawmakers in Washington seem unable to pass a national privacy law. California and other states are moving ahead with their own laws, forcing consumers and companies to navigate a patchwork of different regulations. Rather than instinctively opposing new regulations, tech leaders should support a strong, comprehensive national privacy law -- perhaps modeled on the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation -- and recognize that protecting privacy and upholding trust is ultimately good for business.
Globally, few nations are meeting their targets to fight climate change, the current United States presidential administration remains determined to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and global emissions continue to rise. As governments fiddle, there are steps that business can take now, while there's still time, to prevent the global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Every company can do something, whether reducing emissions in their operations and across their sector, striving for net-zero emissions like Salesforce, moving toward renewable energies or aligning their operations and supply chains with emissions reduction targets.
Skeptical business leaders who say that having a purpose beyond profit hurts the bottom line should look at the facts. Research shows that companies that embrace a broader mission -- and, importantly, integrate that purpose into their corporate culture -- outperform their peers, grow faster, and deliver higher profits. Salesforce is living proof that new capitalism can thrive and everyone can benefit. We don't have to choose between doing well and doing good. They're not mutually exclusive. In fact, since becoming a public company in 2004, Salesforce has delivered a 3,500 percent return to our shareholders. Values create value.
Of course, C.E.O. activism and corporate philanthropy alone will never be enough to meet the immense scale of today's challenges. It could take $ 23 billion a year to address racial inequalities in our public schools. College graduates are drowning in $ 1.6 trillion of student debt. It will cost billions to retrain American workers for the digital jobs of the future. Trillions of dollars of investments will be needed to avert the worst effects of climate change. All this, when our budget deficit has already surpassed $ 1 trillion.
How, exactly, is our country going to pay for all this?
That is why a new capitalism must also include a tax system that generates the resources we need and includes higher taxes on the wealthiest among us. Local efforts -- like the tax I supported last year on San Francisco's largest companies to address our city's urgent homelessness crisis -- will help. Nationally, increasing taxes on high-income individuals like myself would help generate the trillions of dollars that we desperately need to improve education and health care and fight climate change.
The culture of corporate America needs to change, and it shouldn't take an act of Congress to do it. Every C.E.O. and every company must recognize that their responsibilities do not stop at the edge of the corporate campus. When we finally start focusing on stakeholder value as well as shareholder value, our companies will be more successful, our communities will be more equal, our societies will be more just and our planet will be healthier.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – The popular New York Times weekly column “Modern Love” has featured stories about love and redemption for the past 15 years. Eight of the stories, penned by both first-time writers and established authors, have been turned into a half-hour TV series that debuts Friday, Oct. 18, on Amazon Prime Video.
Daniel Jones, editor of the column, explains the decision was made at the beginning that the stories could not just be two people falling in love but had to cover a wide gambit of looks at romance and relationships.
“We even had titles to the column that would’ve limited it to romantic love. Part of choosing ‘Modern Love’ was to have it be contemporary but broad,” Jones says. “Love is about vulnerability. Human relationships are the most important things in our lives and one thing that people sort of hold on to, but they’re complicated.
“I’m most interested in the sort of offbeat love story. I mean, to me these stories are successful when the person understands themselves better at the end, not when they get the person they’re going after. When they understand something deep about themselves.”
The all-star cast for the anthology series includes Anne Hathaway, Jane Alexander, Sofia Boutella, Gary Carr, Tina Fey, Andy Garcia, Cristin Milioti and John Slattery. The first episode, “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man,” stars Milioti and Laurentiu Possa. It’s based on the column about a woman who gets pregnant unexpectedly and the only person who’s there for her is her building’s doorman. The relationship is full of love and goes beyond normal boundaries.
What Milioti liked best about the column and script was it is not a traditional love story.
“The relationship between her and the doorman is so beautifully nuanced. They both get something from each other that lifts their spirits, that like helps them through their lives. I think, if you ask either character they wouldn’t quite be able to label or name it but they make these huge impacts on each other,” Milioti says. “So much of it is unspoken, too, which I think makes it so beautiful. It’s just sort of an energy between the two of them.
“This like father-daughter-friend type energy. And it’s very uplifting and heartbreaking because you don’t know sometimes how to explain what someone does to you or the impact they have on you, but it is love.”
Milioti read the original column and loved it, but she opted not to seek out the original author. She decided to work with what the information provided through the writing to create the backstory for the character she needed to play the part. Milioti has no idea if her backstory is similar to the real story, but by creating her own version it gave her more freedom to play the role.
Hathaway stars in “Take Me as I Am, Whoever I Am” with Carr. The episode was handled carefully because it follows a woman who is learning how to find love while also learning how to accept that she has bipolar disorder. Jones wanted to make sure the filmed version remained true to the original essay without crossing any lines. Hathaway spoke in great length with the woman in the essay. That gave her a clear understanding of details like the cadence of her voice or what happens when she’s having a manic episode.
The key to this look at love and relationships for Hathaway was while the essay looks at how one person deals with their mental illness, the theme has a much broader reach. She’s certain that when take an honest look at themselves, they will realize everyone is worth being loved.
“I think that’s a journey a lot of people go on whether or not you have bipolar disorder. I imagine having bipolar disorder makes it that much more difficult to imagine that someone wants to take you on. And it’s this huge block in Lexi’s life, and she talks about that. She talks about just needing one person, just one person to accept all of her,” Hathaway says. “That’s really what we all, I think, want. And she gets it.
“She doesn’t get it from the person that, I think, any of us expect her to get it from in the beginning of the episode. But that one person giving her the space, being patient, being compassionate and being a true loving person in her life changes everything for her. It gives her hope and gives her a future.”

What does the measles epidemic really mean?

Texto completo: How did measles, a disease we thought was eradicated in the United States nearly 20 years ago, return to cause more than 1,200 cases so far this year? To simply say the outbreak was caused by a decline in vaccination rates overlooks the cause of that decline.
The late writer Susan Sontag observed that the way a society views illness reflects its cultural health. Thus, the AIDS epidemic exposed the extent of homophobia in America. In that context, what does the measles epidemic really mean?
First, let me state emphatically that there is no evidence that childhood vaccines cause autism or auto-immune diseases. The purported villain thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, has not been used in vaccines for children younger than 6 since 2001.
Moreover, the original 1998 report in the British medical journal Lancet that linked vaccines to autism was debunked and retracted, and the author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his license to practice medicine in Britain for professional misconduct. Nonetheless, his fraudulent report persists on social media, and he remains a busy speaker in the United States.
Despite reports from the Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (among many others) that found no link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism, anti-vaxxers hold fast to their convictions. Why? In the August issue of The Atlantic magazine, Peter Beinart offers three cultural explanations.
First, Americans have dangerously poor historical memories. Most do not remember life with measles, which used to kill around 500 children in the U.S. annually.
Second, this ignorance is amplified by the assumption that the internet can make anyone an expert. Unfortunately, though valuable, the internet can be a minefield of disinformation. As The Israeli diplomat Abba Eban said, “Men and nations behave wisely when they have exhausted all other resources.” When falsehoods are a click away, how do we know what's wise (i.e., logical and evidence-based)? The very concept of truth has been debased by “alternative facts.”
Third, we have lost trust in authority, especially in Washington, D.C., which has repeatedly misled the public. After the deceptions of Vietnam came Watergate, then Iran/Contra, the false premise for invading Iraq, and the current administration’s river of falsehoods and paranoid conspiracy theories.
All these deceits have eroded the cohesiveness of our society. In a column titled “Where Did ‘We the People’ Go?” New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman bemoaned the loss of societal unity, and expressed concern that we’re seeing the end of “truth” — that we simply can’t agree on basic facts anymore.
Vaccines benefit both individuals and society, and the anti-vaccination movement is inimical to a sense of communal responsibility. Herd immunity (community immunity) is ineffective if more than 5% of people are unvaccinated.
Interestingly, there are anti-vaxxers on both sides of the political aisle.
The left distrusts corporations that manufacture vaccines, suspecting them of prioritizing profit over responsibility to the public. The left also sees control of one’s own body as essential to abortion rights.
The political right views government initiatives that control personal behavior as potentially eroding individual liberty. This attitude inevitably creates tension when the government-mandated procedure — vaccination — prevents harm both to oneself and to others.
The issue of harming others also raises the question: “Do parents have a right to withhold vaccines from minor children?” Legally they do, but Eric Lindenberger, an Ohio high school student, famously got vaccinated against his mother’s wishes as soon as he reached the age of 18. He explained that his mother’s misinformation came mostly from Facebook, and she was unmoved by any scientific information he presented to her, responding: “That’s what they want you to believe.” As an advocate of vaccination, Lindenberger has been subjected to intense harassment, including death threats.
Anti-vaxxers also seek alternatives when states eliminate nonmedical exemptions to vaccination for schoolchildren. Thus far, five states have done so — California, New York, West Virginia, Mississippi and Maine, where the law won’t take effect until 2021. In California, parents have pressured physicians to write new medical exemptions, and a few doctors have succumbed to the temptation of inflated fees. The number of kindergartners with permanent medical exemptions quadrupled after California banned personal exemptions; more than 100 schools have medical exemption rates exceeding 10%.
The resurgence of measles is a public health problem that affects everyone, but as a physician, I have a special concern that it reflects a cultural anti-science attitude that threatens evidence-based medicine. The current war on science (manifest also as climate change denial) encourages noncompliance with proven therapies, and substitution of pseudo-science.
Billions of dollars are spent on worthless nostrums such as homeopathic formulations, which — if they appear to the user to be effective at all — only demonstrate the power of the placebo effect. The inability of physicians to dissuade patients from an unreasonable reliance on worthless substances proves again that you can’t reason people out of something they unreasoned their way into.

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey revealed that he has fantasies about deleting his Twitter account following the conclusion of the Trump administration.
“I have a fantasy about on January 21, 2021, deleting my Twitter and moving on to something else,” he told the New York Times on Saturday. “But until then, I can’t.”
The former FBI director, who was dismissed from his position in May 2017, also announced his plans to devote the next 13 months to making sure Trump does not get reelected in 2020.
“I feel stuck, like I can’t do something else. And I couldn’t look myself in the mirror if I went and did something easy,” Comey added.
He also told the Times that his legacy is something he cares about "a little," adding, "It frustrates me in general that millions of people have a false impression of me."
This summer, the Department of Justice opted not to prosecute Comey after the inspector general handed a criminal referral over his mishandling of sensitive information.

Does the Trump impeachment inquiry have Tallahassee roots?

Texto completo: The House's push to impeach President Trump is rooted in allegations leveled by Tallahassee author Peter Schweizer, who runs a think tank co-founded by Steve Bannon and backed by conservative donors and Trump supporters.
"Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends" – which shot to No. 1 when it was released March 2018 – provided the basis for Trump's attacks against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter and his business dealings in the Ukraine.
But it appears to have backfired, providing fuel for House Democrats in their impeachment investigation.
"The irony is that the target was supposed to be the Bidens, not the president," Bloomberg political columnist Joshua Green told NPR's Fresh Air this week.
The impeachment investigation has zeroed in on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelesky, where Trump urged him to "do us a favor" and investigate the Bidens.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son," Trump is quoted as saying.
The CIA whistleblower wrote in his report that Trump was using the power of his office to pressure a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election.
Schweizer, a senior contributor at the conservative Breitbart website once run by former Trump advisor Bannon, said in a recent op-ed piece that he didn't think what Biden's son did was illegal but raises the specter of undue influence. He devoted equal space to questions about Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Schweizer is the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a not-for-profit research organization based in Tallahassee that he co-founded with Bannon in 2012. It has received millions in support from the Koch Family's Donors Trust and from the Mercer Family Foundation, a nonprofit that funds many conservative organizations. Rebekah Mercer is listed as a director of GAI.
GAI's mission statement is to "investigate crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies, and other governmental corruption or malfeasance."
Schweizer, who has lived in Tallahassee since 1994, did not return a call or text message seeking comment for this story, but told the Democrat last year in an article about the book, "We have eight researchers and 16 employees, not all of them in Tallahassee."
Those researchers use forensic tools and specialized databases to research the financial connections of the families of the powerful, he said. It took over a year to get the main facts of the Biden narrative, and still left a lot of questions unanswered, he said.
"Secret Empires" delves into the extremes politicians will go to enrich themselves while in office, according to a New York Times book review. An Amazon synopsis says that children of powerful politicians go into business with people who want to curry favor with their influential parents.
Included are stories about McConnell and Chao and a multi-million dollar gift from her father. The House oversight committee is investigating allegations that she used her office to benefit her family's shipping business.
It also talks about Hunter Biden's business dealings while his father was vice president under Barack Obama. It delves into a $1.5 billion private equity deal involving Hunter Biden and a bank owned by the Chinese government, as well as his business association with Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.
In a recent Bloomberg column, Green makes the case that "Secret Empires" is a "political hit job" that follows the same game plan as "Clinton Cash," which Bannon used to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016.
"Looking ahead to 2020, it wasn't hard to foresee that a moderate, two-term vice president like Joe Biden, popular across the party, was likely to run for president and be a good bet to win," Green said. "Nor was it difficult for GAI to turn up examples of ethically questionable behavior by Biden's family members and publish the information in Secret Empires."
But Secret Empires didn't have the same impact with mainstream media as "Clinton Cash" had, Green said.
Trump was impatient to advance the story he believed would damage Biden, so he tried to get his lawyer Rudy Giuliani to get the new Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens, Green said.
Giuliani told CNN that "a well-regarded investigator" had brought Hunter Biden's story to his attention, Green said.
Schweizer told Green it wasn't him. "I don't know Rudy and I've had no contact with Trump or the White House," he told Green.

Texto completo: The most urgent imperative now is to turn our fear and frustration into votes.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Now we suffer the consequences.
In Northern California, power was cut to more than a million people this week. Near Houston, houses that flooded only two years ago just succumbed again. The South endured record-shattering fall heat waves. In Miami, salt water bubbled through street drains yet again as the rising ocean mounted a fresh assault.
All of it was predicted, in general outline, decades ago. We did not listen. Ideologues and paid shills cajoled us to ignore the warnings. Politicians cashed their checks from the fossil fuel lobbyists and slithered away.
Today, we act surprised as the climate emergency descends upon us in all its ferocity.
The scientists knew long ago, and told us, that the sea would invade the coasts. They knew a hotter atmosphere would send heavier rains to inundate our cities and farms. They knew the landscape of California, which always becomes desiccated in the late summer and early fall, would dry out more in a hotter climate.
But even the scientists did not quite foresee the way that bone-dry vegetation would turn into a firebomb waiting for a spark. California is the state that has done the most to battle the climate crisis, but that has not saved it from recent fires so ferocious they burned people alive.
In high winds, ill-maintained power lines strung across aging poles are often the source of the spark. The largest utility in the state, Pacific Gas & Electric, has already been propelled into bankruptcy by fire liabilities it calculates at $ 30 billion. Now PG&E, far behind in basic tasks meant to make its system safer, is pre-emptively shutting down power lines on windy days to try to prevent more death and destruction.
If there is any fix for the fire situation, it will not be cheap or easy. True, the people who were running the power company deserve some blame -- but not all of it. We now know that power rates in California, high as they may have seemed, were a false economy. The public was not paying enough to harden the electric grid against rising climate risks.
Nationwide, you can say the same about the fossil fuels we burned so heedlessly these last decades. They seemed cheap and convenient at the time. Only now are we learning the true cost.
As tempting as it is to blame the politicians and the fossil fuel executives for the fix we find ourselves in, that is too easy. At any time in these last three decades, we could have woken up. We could have heeded the warnings of scientists like James E. Hansen of NASA, who told Congress in 1988 that the planet was warming sharply and would continue to do so if we persisted in burning fossil fuels. We could have voted James Inhofe, the climate-denying senator from Oklahoma, out of office. Had we been aroused and angry, we could have wielded our democratic power to bring the fossil fuel companies to heel.
I remember sitting with Dr. Hansen in his NASA office the week he retired, in 2013, wondering along with him when the public revolt over the climate crisis would finally begin.
Now we have our answer. Under the unlikely leadership of a brave 16-year-old schoolgirl from Sweden, Greta Thunberg, we are marching in the streets now by the millions. We are making demands. We are angry, and should be, but let's spare a moment to be angry at ourselves for waiting so long.
People keep asking: Is it too late?
Yes, in some sense it is. What the events in California and Miami and Houston tell us is that we are living through the risks of an altered climate now, not a hundred years from now. Expect the situation to keep getting worse for the rest of your life. The ocean will keep rising for centuries, probably much faster than today. We will lose our great coastal cities.
But here is the thing people must understand: The crisis is still manageable, barely. If we do not move far more aggressively, it could spiral entirely out of control. At a global scale, we have yet to turn the corner and start cutting emissions. If we let them keep rising, today's wildfires and floods will seem like child's play soon enough. In a world of ever-rising temperatures, mass starvation is but one of the risks.
The most urgent imperative now is to turn our fear and frustration into votes.
The climate troglodytes must be thrown out of office, starting with Donald J. Trump. We need laws with teeth to propel the clean energy transition: hard targets, bans, taxes, mandates. We cannot stand back for another presidential election in which the Republican Party lies about this issue while the Democratic Party hides from it.
Granted, "Curtail future damage!" is not an inspiring battle cry. "To the Bastille!" it is not. Yet millions of young people have begun to understand the stakes, their fears given voice by that young lady from Sweden, with her moral intelligence and her capacity to wield the truth like a rapier.
Look again at that picture of her, a lone student picketing Sweden's Parliament with a homemade sign, and let yourself marvel at the birth of a global movement. Older people forced the youth into this situation by our dereliction, and now we must not let them carry the battle alone.
We can sit back, citizens, and watch the fires and the floods and the heat waves with a rising sense of doom. Or we can be as brave as a schoolgirl and decide that now is the time to stand up and fight.

Behind Trump's obsession with a border wall

Texto completo: Write a book about immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border, and you're bound to get a few questions. This past summer, at an event in Austin, I had just read from my novel, which deals with human trafficking, when a hand went up from a woman in the first row. She wanted to know what I thought about President Trump's relentless push to build a border wall - something he had been talking about nonstop since launching his campaign and even more so, it seemed, after he repeatedly failed to secure its funding. So I told her what had been on my mind all summer: If there is no wall, there is no second term.
The woman in the first row and everyone else in the room looked stunned, as if the thought had never occurred to them that a second term might be contingent on the president's delivering on his promise of the wall. And perhaps it hadn't, but now, after reading "Border Wars," the new book by Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear, a stark account of the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to disembowel the nation's immigration policy - one created over time to foster this land of immigrants - and his utter desperation to build the wall at any cost, it seems clear to me that this same thought has crossed our president's mind.
In the same way that Trump's obsession with the wall is about more than his wanting to build a barrier to protect us from the "invasion" of immigrants at our southern border, "Border Wars" is about more than his administration's strategizing and ill-fated efforts to make this happen. The book also reveals the rampant dysfunction within the administration, much of it happening because no one can rein in the president, and his aide Stephen Miller's xenophobic push to move the country toward zero immigration, meaning none at all, documented or undocumented, refugees or asylum seekers. None.
If you have kept up with the news, many details you'll find in "Border Wars" may sound familiar, but what's new here is how each initiative concerning the construction of the wall or attempting to stem the flow of immigrants, followed by a degree of shortsightedness, followed by disastrous results (see: family separation), followed by a high level of damage control, is part of a larger pattern. Hirschfeld Davis and Shear argue that it isn't just a ban on travelers from certain Muslim nations, or a decision to not renew the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, or a sudden "national emergency" on the border that most people living on the border weren't aware of. It's that these all add up to an assault on immigration, a comprehensive plan not to strengthen our policies but to dismantle them from within the White House.
Trump's problems started when he based his 2016 presidential campaign on an undeniably tangible structure that most experts agreed wouldn't be effective at solving the problem of immigrants slipping into the country. Presidential candidates generally make less-tangible promises. Think health care, or scaling down a war, or increasing spending on education - all subjects of promises that can be measured to some degree but also leave room for interpretation. A wall is a wall. It's either sealing off all 1,200 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, as Trump continues to promise, or it's not. And right now, it's not anywhere close to that.
Hirschfeld Davis and Shear, both New York Times correspondents, interviewed about 150 people to get this behind-the-scenes account of what happened when the media and the rest of us were out of the room. And it isn't pretty.
Trump's obsession with the wall has extended even to his preference for certain building materials. In an exchange with Kirstjen Nielsen, his homeland security secretary at the time, he requested that the barriers be a series of flagpoles set next to one another, their tops sharp so no one would dare climb over, and the pointy parts painted black so they'd become scorching in the hot sun. While we'd like to envision our commander in chief as someone who takes a hands-on approach, I don't expect many of us expected a president who, according to the book, would insist on "flat black!"
Nielsen's other job, aside from helping the president realize his vision of a wall, was to contain Trump's impulse to shut down the border the more frustrated he got over not securing adequate funding for the barrier, and to monitor the increasing number of immigrant families arriving - a result of his continued assertions that he would be building the wall and immigrants' fear that he would eventually seal the border.
If all this sounds like a circus, consider that Trump even toyed with the idea of building a moat and filling it with alligators and poisonous snakes that would further deter immigrants from attempting to cross the border. At one point, the president suggested that Border Patrol agents fire back if immigrants threw rocks at them. When he was told this wasn't possible under the Customs and Border Protection use-of-force policy, Trump asked if the agents could at least shoot the immigrants in the legs.
The point was to make their passage into the United States as dangerous and uncomfortable as possible, whether that meant being impaled, burned, electrocuted, bitten by snakes or eaten alive by alligators.
Toward the end of the book, Jared Kushner, the president's aide and son-in-law, is described as joining a meeting in the West Wing to see if he might offer some perspective. This was in January 2019, a little more than two weeks into the partial government shutdown Trump initiated when he could not get Congress to give him money for his wall. Kushner asks the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, now also the acting homeland security secretary, how effective a wall across the entire border would be. McAleenan tells him it would cut illegal immigration by maybe 20 to 25 percent, whereas closing the loopholes that dictate how CBP deals with families, children and asylum claims - details of immigration policy the president paid little attention to - would decrease the flow by 75 to 80 percent. "Okay," Kushner replied quietly. "So we've wasted the last two years."
As might be expected in a book by New York Times reporters, "Border Wars" avoids polemics in favor of a fact-based account of what precipitated some of this administration's more brazen assaults on immigration. The Muslim ban. The president talking about shithole countries, about Haitians with AIDS, Africans living in huts, none of which he apologized for. The president mobilizing the National Guard to defend our border against a caravan of immigrants traveling from Central America. The family separations at the border. The DACA "dreamers" debacle. The precipitous drop in admitted refugees. Two government shutdowns as a result of Trump's not getting the funding he demanded. The move to declare a "national emergency" at the border and divert military funds to build at least part of the wall. Hirschfeld Davis and Shear had only to state the facts and allow readers to draw their own conclusions. Trump has already taken care of impaling himself.

Texto completo: Other than a partial reference to President Trump's trade policies, ABC News posed no questions about employment in the last Democratic presidential primary debate. Nor did the candidates go there.

When the Democrats meet to debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday, I urge CNN, the New York Times, and the Democratic contenders not to repeat that mistake. Ohio voters deserve a robust probing of economic issues, and if Democrats want to compete here in Ohio, they need to deliver.

The skills gap is a problem. People were losing their jobs to automation a decade ago. They needed government to help facilitate a transition yesterday.

The irony is that President Barack Obama's Department of Labor was addressing this with its focus on work force retraining programs. That made it a target for the Trump Administration when it had the admirable goal of making the government more functional.

The best example I can think of is work force training - and the number I have always [had] stuck in my head - is we have 43 different work force training programs spread across at least 13 different agencies, Mick Mulvaney said during a news briefing when he ran the Office of Management and Budget in 2017, rightly pointing out that no one person was responsible for their overall improvement.

I spent several hours on the phone each with University of Michigan's Betsey Stevenson, who had been the chief economist at the Department of Labor in Mr. Obama's first term, and Eric Seleznow, who had been deputy assistant secretary at the department's Employment and Training Administration. Ms. Stevenson provided multiple data points showing that those programs made a difference in the unemployment rate. Mr. Seleznow conceded that a program or two could be dropped or consolidated but most were needed to address vastly different industries, geographies, and constituencies.

I realized then that I could no longer be a reporter and identified as a Democrat. Technology has made the United States in the 21st Century so complex and varied, that arguing over big versus small government seems antiquated.

Since then, I advised both John Hickenlooper and Howard Schultz on their now-defunct presidential efforts. Both were prepared to lead on work force issues.

Mr. Hickenlooper, who piled up awards for strides Colorado made on work force development as governor, hesitated to name it publicly as the cornerstone of his White House mission. It seemed intangible and too long-term to grasp. Basically, it wouldn't work on TV.

You can't get that done in a single piece of legislation, he told me. It's a total transformation of the economy that would take the full eight years.

Mr. Schultz traveled the nation as chairman and CEO of Starbucks trying to understand how his employees, in every socioeconomic class and region, could get the most out of their employment and then go further. He constantly innovated and wanted to do it on a bigger scale.

Now Andrew Yang is the candidate with the strongest marker in the race against which all others need to be measured. He told the New York Times he thinks work force training programs don't work because they don't evolve fast enough. His answer: hand every American $12,000 a year to live better.

Unrigging the system, like Elizabeth Warren wants to do, and giving away the farm, like Bernie Sanders wants to do, aren't ideal platforms from which to pivot to job creating. Joe Biden just wants to beat Donald Trump.

Ms. Warren does have a plan. She calls for a massive job-creation agency she would brand as the Department of Economic Development that would consolidate some agencies and oversee worker training programs.

Amy Klobuchar wants to extend broadband Internet to rural areas: without it, no job creation in remote areas.

The federal government has a role to play in helping Americans migrate to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Republicans generally believe that role should be a minor one and the market will solve all problems. President Trump believes the government should return our work force to the 1950s. Democrats have a chance to paint a vision for what the work force should look like and the degree to which the government can help us get there. They need to debate what that is.

The author, an Ohio native, was a political reporter for CNN and other outlets, and worked for former Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper and former independent presidential candidate Howard Schultz.

Anthony Davis sprains thumb, Lakers look tired in loss to Nets in China

Texto completo: The start of the sequence was something fans had been craving for months: As Anthony Davis corralled a defensive rebound, he sent an outlet pass sailing past the halfcourt line to a streaking LeBron James.
James ran under the rim for the lay-up … and missed it. He got his own rebound … and missed again right under the hoop.
Multiple blown lay-ups on one play is unusual to see from the 34-year-old star, but then again, it’s been an unusual trip.
Fatigue was the predominant trait of the Lakers in Saturday’s 91-77 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, the second of two exhibition games played under fraught geopolitical circumstances in China. The weight of international travel, atypical drama and playing their second game in three nights seemed to slow the Lakers down in Shenzhen: They scored just 36 points in the first half, looking listless against a Nets team that didn’t even suit up its best player, Kyrie Irving.
The most relevant portion of the night ended with some discouraging news: Davis, who made his first start at center in the team’s third preseason game, sprained his right thumb on a block. The Lakers ended up pulling him after one quarter, setting him up on the bench with a fresh wrap, and the new franchise centerpiece finished with just 6 points on 2-for-7 shooting.
The Lakers announced after the game that Davis would undergo diagnostic testing upon his return to Los Angeles, joining Kyle Kuzma, Quinn Cook and Jared Dudley as players who have been laid up with ailments recently.
No one else picked up the slack. James also played just one quarter, finishing with four assists and six points on 2-for-7 shooting including his misses near the basket. While team sideline reporter Mike Trudell shared that James spent much of the second half interacting with Chinese fans – thawing some of the chill that had set in earlier in the week between the NBA and the host country – he did little on the court to sate them.
The role players that have sparked some intrigue early did little to help blunt the impact of the star power outage. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Avery Bradley combined for 25 points, but required 25 shot attempts. Rajon Rondo, who started for the second consecutive game, had no assists and four turnovers in 16 minutes. JaVale McGee stood out in the first two exhibitions – on Saturday, he had a much more down-to-earth performance (9 points, 3 rebounds, 2 blocks). As a team, the Lakers shot just 33 percent, including 5 for 32 from 3-point range.
The small lineup with Davis at center struggled to create offense, but the Nets also struggled to score as well. After one quarter, a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by Alex Caruso had kept the Brooklyn lead to just 20-19 in a rock fight. While Davis has famously wished to play less center, he was a brutally efficient rim protector, getting a pair of blocks despite his injury.
Caris LeVert (22 points) helped pull Brooklyn back in pole position, putting on a well-rounded display after missing most of Thursday’s 114-111 Nets win that provided much more suspense. Taurean Prince added 14 points.
The Lakers were to fly back immediately Saturday, scheduled to reach Los Angeles late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. While the NBA decided Friday to not make media available for the rest of the trip, it seemed safe to assume the Lakers and the league welcomed the end of a whirlwind week that started with a flurry of outrage over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting in support of Hong Kong protests against the government.
The NBA has been under fire from both sides, as Chinese businesses pulled sponsorships and state-run television decided to blacklist the games. Back in the United States, the president was among the notable critics of the league for bowing to foreign interests. Shenzhen is just north of Hong Kong, giving rise to some concern that the Lakers’ second exhibition could have more tension than the first, but The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had asked the media and public to tone down the fiery rhetoric earlier in the week, soothing some of the angst.
The Lakers will play their first preseason game at Staples Center against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. It’s unclear if any players will sit out on a short turnaround after a flight halfway across the globe.

Heirs of omission: Who’s in, and not in, a will

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

There are no easy homeless fixes, which may be a good thing

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – One of the wonderful – and frustrating – things about living in our relatively free society is the authorities have only limited ability to tackle big problems. Because our system respects individual rights, the government can’t just boss us around. Its power is distributed among various levels and branches. And everyone has access to the courts, which tie up proposals for years.
This system is less of a well-oiled machine and more like one of cartoonist Rube Goldberg’s infamous contraptions, where insanely complicated gadgets complete the most basic tasks. His invention for cutting hair, for instance, involves pushing a button that sends a whippet after a rabbit on a treadmill, thus activating a lawnmower that skims a person’s hair.
This inefficient madness is frustrating when we want government to “do something,” but it’s a godsend when your property or freedoms are in the crosshairs. After the entire history of human existence, it’s safe to conclude that messy, pluralistic democracies do a better job protecting the rights of individuals and even fixing problems than countries run by strongmen. That doesn’t stop people from yearning for something easy.
Today’s column centers on a growing homeless population. “In Alameda County, the number of homeless residents jumped 43 percent over the past two years,” according to a New York Times report. “In Orange County, that number was 42 percent. … San Francisco notched a 17 percent increase since 2017.” It surged 16 percent in Los Angeles since last year. The homeless are more visible, as encampments and panhandlers seem to be everywhere.
Various governments are taking different approaches, almost all of them asinine. One new affordable-housing project in Emeryville recently opened with a price tag of $736,000 per unit, noted Marc Joffe, of the Reason Foundation, in a column in the East Bay Times. At that price, perhaps the state will house every poor and homeless person by the 25th century.
0President Trump has demanded that California officials “clean it up,” but hasn’t offered specifics. Trump’s points – blaming local governments for their failure and lamenting “horrible disgusting conditions” – are accurate. But the federal government doesn’t have a conclusive solution, either, and all the executive orders in the world won’t fix that.
Meanwhile, federal courts have limited the ability of localities to deal with homeless who turn public parks into putrid campsites. In the Martin v. City of Boise case last year, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal ruled that city officials may not remove vagrants from most public areas unless they offer them shelter. This “easy” solution will only make the problem worse because shelter can’t be built overnight.
People don’t even agree on the nature of the problem. Many liberals argue that the answer to homelessness is to give every homeless person a home, which ignores the enormous financial implications of such a promise. It also ignores reality. Many homeless have addiction problems or are mentally ill, so it’s not just a matter of housing.
Conservatives often take a simple approach, also. They want police to round up homeless people. It’s one thing to arrest homeless when they shoot up in public or refuse to leave a park, but wholesale roundups are costly and raise numerous liberties issues. Some people want to place mentally ill homeless people in mental institutions. That would mean a massive rebuilding of state facilities, which largely have been shuttered. It means other court battles. Fortunately, our society will never forcibly commit people without such legal tussles.
Joffe’s column, however, takes the prize for simple fixes. The solution “would involve placing large volumes of manufactured homes in low-cost areas” that would be sited in “economically distressed cities and towns or on undeveloped parcels in unincorporated areas,” he wrote. Translation: Wealthy communities would dump their homeless problem on the doorstep of poorer cities and rural residents. Instead of dealing with a problem they helped create, San Francisco and Santa Monica could simply bus their problem to Adelanto or Stockton.
Joffe raises (but doesn’t answer) the question of “whether the homeless should be obliged to take housing options they may not like,” but for this idea to work it would have to be required. Beach-area vagrants won’t willingly get on that bus to the Mojave. The courts would have to determine if cities can force the homeless to hop aboard – and how long and under what terms they can be forced to stay in the official encampments. What if all inland communities say no?
There are plenty of reasonable, albeit modest, approaches to the homeless crisis. For instance, cities can reduce building regulations and allow homeless facilities to be built on vacant land that’s now off limits to development. None of these ideas are quick, easy or satisfying, but that’s OK. Would you really want to live in a society where the government can round up thousands of people and ship them to the desert?

Texto completo: Did Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts lie when she said she was fired from her first teaching job at Riverdale Elementary School in New Jersey for being pregnant?
If so, was it during an interview 12 years ago when she was a Harvard law professor and skipped over the details of her departure, making it seem as if it were her own choice? Or is she fibbing now when on the campaign trail she tells the story of how her principal said he hired someone else for Warren's job after she became "visibly pregnant"?
I don't know, but it's not a stretch to believe her story of pregnancy discrimination.
Half a century removed, it may be hard to imagine, but back in the early 1970s, employers openly and regularly hustled women out the door when loose clothing could no longer conceal their expanding bellies. As two former schoolteachers in the Riverdale district told CBS News, there was a rule at the time that women would stop working when they were five months pregnant. The practice wasn't outlawed until 1978, when Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.
Even so, pregnancy discrimination is still a problem in the workplace, though it may be less overt and actionable, and thus harder to pin down. The Center for American Progress reported last year that pregnancy discrimination remained a problem in all industries. Last year, The New York Times did a great report on the various ways that employers punished women for being pregnant.
The Washington Free Beacon published documents earlier this week showing that Warren was granted a contract by the school board for a second year of teaching. The article references that 2007 interview and its disparity with the story she now tells.
Certainly, her subsequent response could have been better. Although she didn't comment for the article, she later said the extension was granted before her pregnancy was showing and that the offer was later rescinded. OK. But what about her earlier comments, which imply she left voluntarily to raise a family? Was that a deliberate effort to avoid the details?
If that's what happened - and I suspect it was - I don't think admitting it hurts her. It's very human to gloss over the painful details, especially when the cold, hard truth doesn't make us look great. In this case, getting fired for being pregnant would cast Warren in the role of victim, a show of weakness many a career-minded women would want to avoid.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Rosalía had already won two Latin Grammys by the time Marcela Valdes, a New York Times contributing writer, learned about the Spanish flamenco pop star. "El Mal Querer," Rosalía's second album, struck a chord with Ms. Valdes, a self-proclaimed "passionate amateur" of flamenco, who profiled the 26-year-old singer for The New York Times Magazine's annual culture issue.
"She [Rosalía] has this intellectual interest in flamenco music," said Sasha Weiss, the culture editor at The Times Magazine. "Marcela was also in this great position to illuminate that."
"El Mal Querer," released in 2018, is a genre-bending album that combines flamenco, electronic and urbano sounds. Its concept was inspired by the 13th-century lyric-poem "Romance of Flamenca" and was rooted in Rosalía's thesis at la Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya (ESMUC). The album earned Rosalía seven Latin Grammy nominations and collaborations with the established stars James Blake, J Balvin and Ozuna.
The rapid success of Rosalía signifies a booming current of Spanish-language pop taking over the American mainstream, Ms. Weiss said. Singers like J Balvin and Bad Bunny are injecting a new sound into pop that is fused with reggaeton, trap and dance hall. But Rosalía is perhaps the most polarizing figure of this Spanish-language embrace. Spanish Romani Gypsies have criticized her use of slang and iconography from Andalusia, where flamenco originates, and some have questioned whether a Spanish performer should be eligible in Latin music award categories.
The assignment posed important questions for Ms. Valdes, who has profiled figures like Alfonso Cuarón, Mario Vargas Llosa and Jorge Ramos for the magazine. She said she wanted to understand what it takes for a flamenco-trained singer to become a pop artist. Her mission was to identify the turning point for Rosalía's journey from cante and palmas to pop music. "This was sort of like seeing an opera singer decide to start singing R&B music, and I was very interested in when she decided to do that," Ms. Valdes said.
In her quest, Ms. Valdes interviewed Rosalía twice -- first in Madrid and then in Los Angeles. She watched her perform at the Mad Cool Festival in July and at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, and visited her hometown, Sant Esteve Sesrovires, near Barcelona. Ms. Valdes also paid a visit to ESMUC, where Rosalía cut her teeth as a flamenco artist and producer, and interviewed Rosalía's many collaborators.
Ms. Valdes described the singer to be even more charming in person than onstage. "She doesn't do a lot of interviews and I could see why, because she's really trying to be there in a very authentic way," Ms. Valdes said. "Part of what attracts me to flamenco is this emphasis on authenticity, and I feel like that was something that she brought to our interviews."
Ms. Valdes also said she was happy to have witnessed Rosalía perform in her home country. "You could see the reaction to her, not just as an exotic pop phenomenon but as someone who was giving expression to this tremendous variety that is Spanish culture," she said.
It is because of that multicultural expression that the rise of Rosalía, a Catalan woman, has been problematic for some in the Gypsy community in Spain. Ms. Valdes said she understands where the sensitivities come from, pointing to Francisco Franco's harassment of the Gypsies during his nearly 40-year dictatorship. But she said professional flamenco circles have not spoken out against the singer.
The intensity of flamenco is also what inspired the photographer Christopher Anderson to shoot Rosalía around a large fire in a studio in Barcelona. Mr. Anderson, a regular contributor to The New York Times Magazine, said he asked Rosalía to sing flamenco on set, citing Richard Avedon's 1959 photo of Ella Fitzgerald as a reference. "Some singers go in the studio and what they present is something very polished and very final," Mr. Anderson said. "To just do it raw might not be something that they are willing to do."
Ms. Valdes and Mr. Anderson agreed that Rosalía's success was rooted in the singer's intellectual mastery of her craft and a lifelong ambition to not only be famous, but to change the paradigm of flamenco. "There's almost nothing as exciting in the world as seeing really great art made by a really great artist," Ms. Valdes said.

By Jillian Mock
Last month, young people around the world skipped school to join global climate strikes. Children of all ages marched, chanted and carried signs with slogans like, "You'll die of old age, I'll die of climate change."
Dark messages like that highlighted the worry many young people feel about climate change.
Climate change and related natural disasters can take a toll on mental health, according to a 2017 report by the American Psychological Association. That can include depression and anxiety.
Children may be one of the hardest-hit groups. According to a poll by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than seven in 10 teenagers and young adults in the United States say climate change will cause harm to their generation. That includes young people who identify as Democratics and Republicans.
In order to lighten that anxiety, experts say, parents should talk to their children.
To address these fears, find a calm moment to ask your child what they've seen or heard about climate change and how that makes them feel, said Dr. Lise Van Susteren, a psychiatrist in Washington and a founder of the Climate Psychiatry Alliance. She said parents should gently correct irrational fears but not downplay anxieties just to make children feel better. That could just make the child feel she can't trust adults to be honest with them on this topic.
"Talk about the problem, then pivot to the solution," Dr. Van Susteren said.
Once you've discussed your child's climate fears, talk about people and organizations that are already working on large-scale climate solutions, said Maria Ojala, a psychologist at Orebro University in Sweden who studies young people and climate change.
If possible, talk about solutions in a personal context. Highlight steps you've already taken as a family or as individuals to reduce your carbon footprints and brainstorm new ideas together. Taking action can be an empowering antidote to fear, Dr. Van Susteren said. Encourage your child to take action with her peers as well, like joining a group at school or volunteering with a local organization. Collective action has mental health benefits, according to Dr. Ojala. "We are social beings and it's very good for our well-being to work together with others and be part of a group," she said.
You probably won't get rid of your child's fears altogether, and that's O.K., Dr. Ojala said. The goal is to help your child cope with her fears in a constructive way to avoid hopelessness.
Finally, think about your own personal choices and lead by example, Dr. Van Susteren said. Your children are probably watching.

The story behind the salt prints in our ghost forests story
By Claire O'Neill
Hello! I'm the art director for the NYT climate team, so you probably won't have seen my name here before. It's mostly a behind-the-scenes job. But, we thought you'd be interested in the back story on the piece about ghost forests we published this week -- not only because the topic is important, but also because the presentation was unusual.
The gist of the story, reported by Moises Velasquez-Manoff and photographed by Gabriella Demczuk, is that rising seas are creating huge stands of dead trees, sometimes surprisingly far from the sea. It's happening in lots of places, but we focused on the Eastern Seaboard.
We've used drones, wide lenses and other digital flourishes to cover forests in the past -- like in our story last year on cedar trees dying in Lebanon. This time we thought we'd do something different and get close to the roots of these things dying en masse.
Gabriella and Moises trekked out to the sites in the thick of a July heat wave, trudging through thick mud and marsh to find these ghost forests. "Sweating under a black sheet," she said, "I photographed the trees using a 4x5 large format camera to capture the subtle hues and exquisite details that only film can produce."
And, because she was photographing with film, we brainstormed ways to experiment with printmaking. She had the idea to collect salt water from each location and use it as a wash to sensitize photo paper to make salt prints. It's a very early photo technique from the 19th-century that gives a sort of sepia tone to the final product.
In Gabriella's words: "I welcomed discoloration, fog and irregularities that came with using different concentrations of salt levels in the water to create a visual metaphor for how salt is slowly killing these coastal forests, stripping the bark and bleaching its colors."
Maybe you loved it, maybe you hated it. But we hope that it's something you haven't seen before, and something that sticks with you. As always, let us know what you think of the story.

Texto completo: After acquiring a series of businesses, including the "21" Club, he turned the obscure licensing organization Sesac into a force in the music industry.
Stephen C. Swid, an investor and businessman whose varied career included deals for furniture and carpeting companies, an independent film distributor and the "21" Club, but who became best known for transforming Sesac, once an obscure licensing organization, into an influential force in the music industry, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78.
His family said the cause was complications of frontotemporal degeneration.
After starting his career as a Wall Street analyst and money manager in the 1960s, Mr. Swid teamed with a partner, Marshall Cogan, to take over a series of businesses that put them on the map as aggressive young investors.
First, in 1974, was General Felt Industries, a major producer of carpet padding -- an unglamorous but lucrative business that served as their springboard. Three years later, the two men took over Knoll International, the designer furniture firm (now known as Knoll Inc.), and in 1985 they paid $ 21 million for the "21" Club, a watering hole for the city's power-broker elite. Along the way, they also made unsuccessful runs at the Boston Red Sox and Sotheby's.
By 1986, Mr. Swid had split with Mr. Cogan and was looking for new deals when he learned that CBS Inc. was selling its music publishing division, CBS Songs, which controlled the copyrights to about 250,000 songs, including classics like "Over the Rainbow" and "New York, New York."
Joining with two music executives, Charles Koppelman and Martin Bandier, Mr. Swid led the purchase of CBS Songs for $ 125 million. The three formed a new company, SBK Entertainment World, and in early 1989, a little more than two years after the CBS deal closed, sold it to the conglomerate Thorn-EMI for $ 337 million.
It was the highest price that had ever been paid for a music publisher, and the sale raised eyebrows both in the music world and on Wall Street. But to Mr. Swid, it was simply a matter of finding the right price for an undervalued asset.
"It's obvious now, in retrospect, that the $ 125 million price was lower than the true value of the company at that time," he told The New York Times when the Thorn-EMI deal was announced.
In 1992, Mr. Swid led an ambitious deal to acquire Sesac for $ 15 million, and ended up turning it into a billion-dollar business that has had lasting effects on the music industry.
Sesac, founded in 1930 as the Society of European Stage Authors and Composers, had long been a marginal player in performing rights, the business of collecting licensing payments from radio and other outlets and funneling that money back to songwriters and publishers as royalties. By 1992, the industry giants Ascap and BMI were estimated to control 99 percent of the market between them.
But as part of a plan conceived by Freddie Gershon, a music executive, and joined by Mr. Swid and another partner, Ira Smith, a revamped Sesac would find ways to pay songwriters more than they were getting from Ascap and BMI.
"We were little Davids against these Goliaths," Mr. Gershon said in an interview. In addition to the three partners, the investment bank Allen & Company contributed money to the deal.
To make Sesac more competitive, the new partners pursued genres like Spanish-language pop -- they offered contracts in Spanish, a novel step at the time -- and embraced new technologies to identify more accurately when their songs were being played on the radio.
But Sesac's biggest coup came in 1995 when the company lured Bob Dylan and Neil Diamond from Ascap by offering them large advance payments. The size of those payments has not been disclosed, but was estimated at the time by Billboard, the music trade publication, to be about $ 5 million combined.
The presence of those two writers, whose songs are essential to radio programmers, instantly made Sesac a power in the industry, helping to attract more writers and giving the company leverage to demand higher license fees.
"We're going to become a major player," Mr. Swid told Billboard, "and Ascap and BMI will do everything they can to stop us."
Sesac's move did lead to increased competition among the performing rights societies to sign and retain top songwriters, a process that continues today.
Sesac now has more than 400,000 songs in its catalog, by songwriters and composers including Kurt Cobain, Adele, Randy Newman, Paul Shaffer, Ric Ocasek of the Cars and the members of R.E.M.
Stephen Claar Swid was born on Oct. 26, 1940, in the Bronx, to Dave and Selma (Claar) Swid. His father was a trucking executive who also helped build the New England Thruway. He graduated from Ohio State University in 1962, with many of his summers spent working as a parking attendant at the Astor Hotel in Times Square, his son, Scott, said.
Mr. Swid is also survived by his wife, Nan, a founder of Swid Powell Designs, which focuses on housewares; two daughters, Robin Swid and Jill Rosen; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Carole Eisner.
In addition to his investments in Sesac and SBK, Mr. Swid held ownership stakes in Spin magazine and Cinecom Entertainment Group, an independent film producer and distributor, whose catalog included the 1990 version of "The Handmaid's Tale."
An art collector, he served as the chairman of the Municipal Arts Society and was on the board of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation for more than 30 years.
But the company he remained closest to, and where he had his greatest success, was Sesac, which he ran as chairman and chief executive from 1992 until his retirement in 2013. Sesac, which is privately held, has always remained closely guarded about its finances. But according to Moody's Investors Service, which has rated its debt offerings, its annual revenue grew from just $ 9 million in 1994 to $ 167 million by 2013, or about 8 percent of the American performing rights market.
In 2017, Sesac, which Mr. Swid and his partners had bought for just $ 15 million 25 years earlier, was sold to the Blackstone Group, the investment giant, for $ 1.2 billion.

Texto completo: Will Eddie Murphy and his natty cohort in "Dolemite Is My Name" bring back the double-knit polyester leisure suit?
Don't bet on it. But what the movie may spawn, in some quarters at least, is yet another round of 1970s-inflected-Afro urban chic.
There is plenty of hustle in Murphy's latest film, which arrived in theaters last week and will be on Netflix starting Oct. 25. In this upbeat biography of Rudy Ray Moore, the record store clerk turned entertainer, and his stage persona Dolemite, the actor slips nimbly into character. His dapper suits, carnival-stripe bell-bottoms and platform shoes, the winged lapel of his dinner jacket invariably punched with a bright carnation, function as a liberating second skin.
His regalia is matched by the riotous costumes his companions flaunt, their high-crown Homburgs, fur-collared coats and slickly patterned polyester shirts, plumage ripe for the plucking by a novelty-parched style establishment.
Fashion's pilfering of Black urban style hardly comes as news to Ruth Carter, the "Dolemite" costume designer, who won an Academy Award earlier this year for her work on "Black Panther."
"In fashion, urbar cultures tend to lead the way," Carter said. "When we pick up something over the :op and even gaudy, wear it and bring it down to a more realistic level, it tends to catch on."
That it does. Over the years some of those Afro-urban influences have filtered onto establishment runways, among them that of Marc Jacobs, who provoked social media furor when he sent white models onto his catwalk crowned in Afros And dreaclocks.
More recently, and more notoriously, Alessandro Michele, the Gucci creative director, stirred a tempest when he plucked inspiration from the 70s workshop of Dapper Dan (Daniel R. Day), the much mythologized Harlem tailor, but failed to credit his source. Michele and Day eventually collaborated on a fashion line.
From Carter's perspective, fashion's impulse to borrow seems natural, if not downright inevitable. "The 70s in urban America had its own individual look and style," she said. "People wanted a piece of it.'
Still, in its way, the movie represents a take-back, the reclaiming of a sartorial heritage that has leached bit by bit into the cultural mainstream.
"There were lot of kooky things you could do in the 70s and now to make yourself kind of a clown," Carter said. "But this is a film where you look a little deeper into all of the details about this time, and your job is to make people look good."
The film's splashy style, its untrammeled exuberance, was embodied in the day by Moore, a small-time comedian bent on coolly defying the odds to become a trash-talking recording artist and, ultimately, the star of his own roughly cobbled films.
Dolemite, his sedulously designed alter ego, can be thought of as an early influencer his raunchy, rhyming patter a progenitor of '80s rap, his rakish wardrobe conceived to captivate an avid following.
His look had its origins in the smoky, boozy nightclubs where he performed, his costumes both a sendup and an homage to the 70s-era blaxploitation genre. The fur-collared maxicoats, the pinstripe suits, the boutonnieres worn by the class-conscious heroes and villains of "Superfly" and "Shaft" were aspirational, Carter said. Their wardrobes, which bore the stamp of Savile Row, were modified and showily accessorized for impact.
"The pimp takes that suit and blows it out," she said. "His only rule is that there are no rules."
The pimp owes a less obvious debt to the 19th-century dandy, all style and swagger in his high top hat, tight waistcoat and ruffle-front shirt - that last a Dolemite signature.
Murphy's flamboyant character may have also taken a page from Robert Beck, better known as Iceberg Slim, the outlaw hero of "Pimp: The Story of My Life," a 1967 fictionalized autobiography and a repository of pimp philosophy and style.
Always on the prowl for sporty vines (suits) and fancy trimmings, "I would press 5-dollar bills into the palms of shine boys," Beck writes. "My shoes would be handmade, would cost three times as much as the banker's shoes."
After all, as he reasons in another passage, "few can resist the charms of exclusivity in its myriad forms."
Just as colorful an influence: Moore's travels on the chitlin circuit, performing and selling his self-produced albums out of the trunk of his car. "What I loved best about people in that time was that they created a subculture," said Carter, who is 59. They were unapologetic in taking a stance, in creating the Black community of the South.
"They went to juke joints and back-alley clubs, sat with their legs crossed wearing sequined bright yellow hats, bright pink suits, white shoes - we called them marshmallows - and white fur hats. They enjoyed their community that was a little rude and crude."
No less rude than Dolemite himself, whose resplendence in the film was in studied contrast with his companions' relatively subdued civilian wardrobes. For those, Carter turned to Sears catalogs and magazines including Jet and Ebony.
For more extravagant departures, she plumbed Eleganza, a defunct catalog replete in its day with shirts bearing floppy nine-inch "dog ear" collars, madly striped flares, leather or denim patchwork coats and two-tone double-knit jumpsuits fashioned, as the catalog copy proclaimed, from "luxurious 100 percent Orion acrylic!"
She ran up some costumes from scratch, among them a line-for-line replica of the powder blue suit Moore wore in his 1976 action comedy, "The Human Tornado."
Stimulating though it may have been, Dolemite's larger-than-life persona, built largely on his wardrobe, may have left some fans queasy, Carter acknowledged.
"At one time people were afraid to like it," she said But now, among mainstream filmgoers, it's as apt to prompt envy. "Those costumes give people the freedom to play," she said. "Who wouldn't want some of that?"

Texto completo: A spokesman for Shepard Smith denied that his departure from Fox News was related to a recent meeting between Attorney General William Barr and network mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Smith announced his last day anchoring Shepard Smith Reporting on Friday at the end of his show. Many were quick to speculate that the frequent Trump critic was outed from the show after Murdoch and Barr met at the former's home on Wednesday, but it's unclear what was discussed during their rendezvous, according to the New York Times.
Chris Giglio, a spokesman for Smith, told the paper's Michael M. Grynbaum, "This was Shep's decision and his alone," in response to the rumors.
Tweet
MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes was one of many who speculated that the two events could be related.
"So Barr goes and meets w Murdoch and then...," he tweeted. "I mean who knows. I have no inside info. Mostly I thought the AG having a meeting at Rupert’s house, amidst very public internal battles over coverage of Trump, looked...odd."
Tweet
Hayes was far from the only person to speculate about the possible connection.

Fox News also denied the speculation, with a spokesperson telling the Washington Examiner that any rumors of the sort are "absolutely not true."

Texto completo: More than 5 million children under the age of 11 in the U.S. have a parent with a substance abuse disorder. Why should they not see their lives addressed on screen?
Sesame Street, which has introduced characters struggling with hunger and living with autism in the past few years, has a new lesson to teach children. So it gave Karli, the show’s accidentally pro-life character, a fuller backstory.
Karli was introduced earlier this year as a character in the foster care system. Now, it turns out, she's in the system because her mother has an opioid addiction. While some parents may be concerned about the show addressing something so serious as the opioid crisis, Sesame Street does it with forthrightness and simplicity.
“Karli’s mommy has a disease called ‘addiction,’” one character explains. “Addiction makes people feel like they need a grown-up drink called alcohol or another kind of drug to feel okay.”
In another scene, Karli explains that she used to think she was responsible for her mom's addiction. "I used to feel like a lot of things were my fault, especially my mom's problem," she says. "But she told me no, it was a grown-up problem. It wasn't because of anything I did."
iFrame ObjectSesame Street has never dealt with addiction before. But it decided that it was time to do so because the crisis doesn't just affect parents.
“So often, it’s only an adult issue and grown-ups are being treated,” Sherrie Westin, president of social impact and philanthropy for Sesame Workshop, told the New York Times. “Given that we know how much this impacts a young child, in terms of their own development and the trauma that can literally inhibit a healthy development, more and more I think this allows us to raise awareness to the importance of addressing the impact on a child and not just the adult, who is struggling with addiction.”
Yet some parents disagree. In "A is for Addiction: ‘Sesame Street’s new storyline is a wrong turn," one columnist and mother writing at the Boston Herald argues against the new narrative. "Awareness is good, but pummeling toddlers with storylines explaining addiction only adds to the increasing anxiety of the youngest generation," Jessica Heslam wrote.
The beauty of the Sesame Street storyline, though, is that the characters are not anxious. Karli is sheltered in some ways because she has a mother who tells her she loves her, and she's found a good foster home. She's able to share the reality of her situation without pain and fear. The most important message is not about despair, but that when bad things happen, kids must understand that those things aren't their fault.
Children’s shows ought to address serious issues that children face. Mr. Rogers dealt with taboo topics from racism to divorce to death. Throughout Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, he never shied away from tough topics, even explaining "assassination" to children after the killing of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.
"What children probably need to hear most from us adults is that they can talk with us about anything and that we will do all we can to keep them safe in any scary time," he explained years later. "I’m always glad to be your neighbor.”
Good children's shows can remind viewers that yes, there are problems around us, but children don't need to be frightened. It's possible that bad things can be happening, but for children who are just learning to cope with the world, it's still a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

7 things to know about the arrests of the 2 Giuliani associates

Texto completo: Two businessmen who are associates of President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani have been arrested on campaign finance violations. Is there a connection to the Trump-Ukraine scandal that has entangled the controversial, divisive president in impeachment proceedings by the House?
Here, compiled from Globe wire reports, is what we know so far about the story:
Who are the two men? Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are Florida-based executives of an energy company. Parnas, 47, a former stockbroker, was born in Ukraine and is a naturalized US citizen. Fruman was born in Belarus and is also a naturalized US citizen.
Parnas has told The Washington Post that Giuliani, Trump's outspoken, combative lawyer, is a "very good friend" but their relationship is not longstanding. Parnas said he got to know Giuliani while fund-raising for Trump's 2016 campaign. "The relationship bonded and built over time. We're just very close," he said.
In May, Giuliani tweeted that Parnas and Fruman were his "clients." He recently said they had sought his advice on a business venture.
What did they do for Giuliani in Ukraine? Parnas and Fruman have acted as emissaries in Ukraine for Giuliani. They helped him in his efforts to dig up information about, and encourage investigations into, Trump's political rivals, including Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Parnas worked with Fruman to connect Giuliani to Ukrainian prosecutors who provided information to Giuliani, The New York Times has reported.
The Associated Press reported last week that Parnas and Fruman helped arrange a January meeting in New York between Ukraine's former top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, and Giuliani, as well as other meetings with top government officials.
Lutsenko once cast doubt on Hunter Biden's actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani's attention last year. Now Lutsenko says Biden “did not violate anything."
John Dowd, the attorney now representing Parnas and Fruman, said in a letter to House investigators last week, “Messrs. Parnas and Fruman assisted Mr. Giuliani in connection with his representation of President Trump."
What were they arrested for? Parnas and Fruman face charges relating to federal campaign finance violations. Federal prosecutors allege, among other things, that Parnas and Fruman engaged in a scheme to secretly “funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and State office [to] buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidates' governments."
The donations were made "to advance their own personal financial interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials, including at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working," the indictment charges.
Records indicate that, in one instance, Parnas and Fruman used wire transfers from a corporate entity they controlled to make a $325,000 donation in 2018 to the America First Action committee, the main pro-Trump super PAC.
They allegedly hid the fact that “they were the true source of the contribution," Fruman having received the money from a “private lending transaction between Fruman and third parties," prosecutors said. Prosecutors did not say who the third parties were.
The indictment also accuses Parnas, Fruman, and two other men of participating in a separate scheme to acquire retail marijuana licenses by donating to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada, and other states.
Were Parnas and Fruman already on the House impeachment inquiry's radar? The two men, who were arrested Wednesday evening at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington, D.C., with one-way tickets out of the country in their pockets, had roles in Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine to gin up an investigation of the Bidens. Trump's attempt in a July phone call to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine into investigating the Bidens is at the core of the Trump-Ukraine scandal.
So the two men are believed to be important witnesses in the House's impeachment inquiry. Parnas was slated to be deposed on Thursday and Fruman on Friday. Neither had been expected to show up, The New York Times reported.
Just hours after the two men were indicted, House Democrats subpoenaed Parnas and Fruman to appear for a deposition and hand over documents.
The whistle-blower complaint by an unnamed intelligence official that reported Trump's effort to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens refers to "associates" of Giuliani in Ukraine who were attempting to contact Zelensky's team, but it's not clear whether that refers to Parnas and Fruman.
How does the former US ambassador to the Ukraine come in to the story? Prosecutors also alleged that Parnas urged a US congressman to seek the ouster of the US ambassador to Ukraine, at the request of Ukrainian government officials. That happened about the same time that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician, the AP reported.
The congressman wasn't identified by name in court papers, but the donations to "Congressman 1" in the indictment match campaign finance reports for former Republican US representative Pete Sessions. In May 2018, Parnas posted a photo of himself and an associate with Sessions in his Capitol Hill office, with the caption "Hard at work !!"
John Dowd, an attorney for the men, hung up on an AP reporter calling about the case. Giuliani, who is not mentioned in the indictment, said he couldn't comment on the case and that he didn't represent the two men in campaign finance matters.
Sessions acknowledged in a statement that he had met Parnas and Fruman several times but said, “at no time did I take any official action after these meetings," Bloomberg News reported.
Questions have swirled about the May recall of Marie Yovanovitch, who was serving as ambassador to Ukraine. Trump ordered her removal after months of complaints from allies outside the administration, including from Giuliani, that she was undermining him and hampering efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
President Trump also referred to her as "bad news" in the July phone call with Zelensky that sparked the whistle-blower complaint and the scandal.
Is there any connection to Trump? By virtue of the $325,000 donations and a flurry of others, Parnas and Fruman, who were relatively unknown, gained access to the highest levels of the Republican Party, The Associated Press reports.
The Washington Post reports that previous social media posts and interviews with Parnas and Fruman indicate they interacted with Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr., and had attended events at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida and at the White House.
In a now-deleted Facebook post that was unearthed by BuzzFeed News and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Parnas displayed photos of himself and Trump at an event that apparently took place at the White House on May 1, 2018.
In an interview with a Russian-language publication later that month, Fruman said he and Parnas had attended a small group meeting with Trump in Washington the previous week and talked about the coming midterm elections.
On May 21, 2018, Parnas posted a photo online of himself and Fruman with Trump Jr. and Tommy Hicks, a Republican fund-raiser and close friend of the president's son, at what he said was a breakfast in California.
Parnas has told The Post that he decided to get involved politically because he was a passionate supporter of Trump's candidacy after growing up in New York and selling Trump condos in the city when Trump's late father, Fred Trump, was still running the Trump Organization.
What does Trump say? The indictments are the first criminal charges to be brought connected to the Ukraine controversy. They do not allege any wrongdoing by the president or his defender Giuliani, but they are likely to add fuel to the House's impeachment probe.
Trump said Thursday he didn't know either man. “Maybe they were clients of Rudy," he added.
One of Trump's outside attorneys, Jay Sekulow, said neither the president nor his campaign were aware of alleged improper contributions by the two men.
"As the indictment establishes, neither the president, nor the campaign, nor the PACs were aware of the financial issues involved," Sekulow said.

Texto completo: The mother of James Foley, the war correspondent from New Hampshire beheaded by ISIS in 2014 after being kidnapped about two years earlier in Syria, said Thursday that she's “grateful" two of her son's alleged captors have been moved from a Syrian prison to Iraqi custody following Turkey's incursion into northern Syria.
However, Diane Foley said in a telephone interview, she's concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Syria that prompted the removal of the suspects, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Amon Kotey.
Two Iraqi intelligence officials told the Associated Press Thursday that the United States will hand over to Iraqi authorities nearly 50 Islamic State members who were transferred from Syria in recent days, after Turkey began a military offensive into northern Syria against US-backed Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The Kurds are holding more than 10,000 ISIS members, but concerns have been raised about possible escapes as the Kurds turn their attention to the advancing Turks.
“We have been awaiting extradition of [Elsheikh and Kotey]" to face charges in the American civilian courts, Diane Foley said. “We think they've been moved to Iraq, which is a good step since we can watch to make sure they're in secure custody."
Foley continued, “The hard part to watch is the other 10,000 ISIS fighters and 70,000 ISIS family members who are now not being guarded" because the Kurds “have to defend themselves." She said it's “very concerning" that so many ISIS fighters “have the opportunity to escape and infiltrate our country."
Foley also lamented the plight of the Kurds now confronted by Turkish military aggression. “Our allies, the Kurds, who have fought beside us and with our allies to contain ISIS, how awful now to allow them to be assaulted," she said.
As for Elsheikh and Kotey, Foley said, “I really hope that they are not held indefinitely [without trial] because that is just not fair to anybody. . . . Obviously, they treated our American citizens deplorably, but we need to bring them to trial to see if they're the actual perpetrators of the horrific crimes they're accused of."
Elsheikh and Kotey were part of a four-member British cell that the Islamic State put in charge of Western hostages, who nicknamed them the “Beatles" because of their accents. In 2014 and 2015, the militants held more than 20 Western hostages in Syria and tortured many of them. The group beheaded seven American, British, and Japanese journalists and aid workers and a group of Syrian soldiers, broadcasting the atrocities in videos released to the world.
Another member of the cell, Mohammed Emwazi, or “Jihadi John," is believed to have killed James Foley. Emwazi was later killed in a drone strike.
Diane Foley said Thursday that she hoped to see Elsheikh and Kotey tried in US civilian courts so her family can deliver victim-impact statements, and so the public can obtain crucial information about ISIS leadership and about citizens of the United States and other countries who have been “lost in this conflict."
She also reflected on the state of Syria, which has been mired in a bloody civil war that began in 2011 and that her son doggedly covered until his abduction and eventual execution.
“It's just so tragic," Foley said. “Such a loss of life, for what? For what? What has been gained? . . . It's very sad to me, this whole thing."

Trump claim off about photo of Bidens

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is doubling down on a photo he says shows Joe Biden and his son posing with a Ukrainian gas executive as evidence Biden knows more than he has let on.
“The Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable,” he tweeted. “Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.”
The photo, which was first aired by Fox News on Sept. 30, shows Joe and Hunter Biden playing golf in the Hamptons in 2014. According to Trump, one of the men is the “company boss” of Burisma, the energy company where Hunter served as a board member while his father was vice president. Trump tweeted a doctored Nickelback music video Oct. 2 that includes the image juxtaposed with an interview in which Joe Biden says he had never talked to his son about his business dealings abroad.
That video was quickly removed from both Twitter and YouTube due to a potential copyright infringement for the Nickelback music. But now Trump is re-upping the claim amid an ongoing impeachment inquiry against him for his own dealings with Ukraine.
We reached out to the White House for more information about the source of Trump’s claim, but they did not comment on the record.
Trump’s tweet is misleading on two fronts.
• The photo shows the Bidens with another American board member of Burisma.
• Biden hasn’t said whether or not he’s spoken with Burisma officials.
Who’s really in the photo
Trump claimed that the photo of the Bidens shows them posing “with the company boss” of Burisma. Our research shows otherwise.
In a previous story, we found that the man on the far left of the frame is Devon Archer. In 2008, Hunter Biden joined with Archer — a former senior adviser for the presidential campaign of John Kerry in 2004 — in a string of investment and consulting firms.
The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2014 that the two had joined Burisma as board members. That role is different from “boss” or “executive,” as Trump has claimed in separate tweets about the photo of Archer. Board members are not typically involved in day-to-day operations of a company.
While Joe Biden was vice president, firms run by his son and Archer “pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,” the New York Times reported in May.
The fourth man in the photo that Trump tweeted is Ralph Pascucci, founder of Netrex Capital Markets LLC, a New York investment banking firm.
He is also a principal of Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y., where the Bidens spent a week in August 2014.
We reached out to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign for more details, but they did not comment on the record.
Taras Burdeinyi is the current CEO of Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky is the founder and owner. In 2014, Alan Apter was the chairman of the board of directors and reportedly brought on Biden and Archer.
What Biden said
In his tweet, Trump claimed that Joe Biden said he “never spoke to the Ukrainian company” where his son served as a paid board member. But that mischaracterizes what the Democratic presidential candidate actually said.
In his Nickelback video, Trump showed a clip of Biden saying he had “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” contrasting that with the photograph of the golf group. That’s different than claiming he had never spoken to Burisma.
Biden knew his son worked for the Ukrainian energy company. Beyond that, there’s little we know.
Our ruling
Trump claimed Joe Biden “said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company” where his son, Hunter, served as a board member. He also claimed a photo of the Bidens shows them posing with “the company boss” of Burisma.
Trump’s statement is not accurate. We rate it False.

Georgetown University must decide whether it is a university or a hostage to censors

Texto completo: Georgetown University must defend the right of invited speakers to speak.
On Monday, acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan was prevented from delivering remarks at a formal Georgetown University event. While faculty repeatedly attempted to calm protesters in the crowd, their words went unheard. Every time McAleenan attempted to speak, he was drowned out. One member of the faculty explained that McAleenan had agreed to take questions, including from protesters. They ignored him. They weren't interested in dialogue or learning, or even arguing.
Frustrated, McAleenan eventually decided to leave.
Does Georgetown accept this? Does it hope that it doesn't happen next time? Or does it take action to create consequences for those who would destroy its community and its learning environment from within?
Because that environment will be history soon if Georgetown allows this to stand. As one of the nation's finest universities, respected for its legacy of high-quality education, it must hold true to its fundamental commitment to expose students to diverse and influential viewpoints. If a small section of protesters gets to determine what is and what is not acceptable speech, then Georgetown is no longer a university at all. It is a hostage to censors.
Censorship is, unfortunately, contagious. Once these little authoritarians realize they can exercise real power by shutting others up, they become bolder. And if faculty fear that protesters will respond to a particular speaker, they may even self-censor to avoid that outcome.
Georgetown should start suspending people who behave in such a fashion, giving their entire school a bad name. It won't be hard to identify them. Some of the protesters have been doing the media circuit, making clear their lack of both contrition and introspection.
Sabiya Ahmed, a third-year law student told the New York Times that there is "nothing to debate." Speaking to the BBC, Ahmed explained why silencing a speaker is preferable to debate. "If we think that there needs to be a discussion around [Trump administration immigration policy], that there's room for discussion around whether those policies are justified, I think there's something really wrong with us. So when we saw him leave," Ahmed smiled "I was just, we started clapping."
Also speaking to the BBC, first-year law student Daniel Berchenko said that "silencing the oppressor" is a duty. Challenged as to whether he is personally oppressed by the state, Berchenko ridiculously replied, "Something that is very important to me is that you don't need to be affected by something to understand that it's wrong."
These law students fail to understand the most basic tenet of any legal education — namely, that to successfully apply facts to law, one must first hear from the most informed individuals on issues of relevance. McAleenan clearly met that criterion on Monday.

Texto completo: The People’s Republic of China is the largest, most powerful and arguably most brutal totalitarian state in the world. It denies basic human rights to all of its nearly 1.4 billion citizens. There is no freedom of speech, thought, assembly, religion, movement or any semblance of political liberty in China.
Under Xi Jinping, “president for life,” the Communist Party of China has built the most technologically sophisticated repression machine the world has ever seen. In Xinjiang, in western China, the government is using technology to mount a cultural genocide against the Muslim Uighur minority that is even more total than the one it carried out in Tibet. Human rights experts say that more than 1 million people are being held in detention camps in Xinjiang, 2 million more are in forced “re-education,” and everyone else is invasively surveilled via ubiquitous cameras, artificial intelligence and other high-tech means.
None of this is a secret. Under Xi, China has grown markedly more Orwellian; not only is it stamping its heel more firmly on its own citizens, but it is also exporting its digital shackles to authoritarians the world over. Yet unlike the way we once talked about pariah nations — say East Germany or North Korea or apartheid South Africa — U.S. and European lawmakers, Western media and the world’s largest corporations rarely treat China as what it plainly is: a growing and existential threat to human freedom across the world.
Why do we give China a pass? In a word: capitalism. Because for 40 years, the West’s relationship with China has been governed by a strategic error the dimensions of which are only now coming into horrific view.
A parade of American presidents on the left and the right argued that by cultivating China as a market — hastening its economic growth and technological sophistication while bringing our own companies 1 billion new workers and customers — we would inevitably loosen the regime’s hold on its people.
Even Donald Trump, who made bashing China a theme of his campaign, sees the country mainly through the lens of markets. He’ll eagerly prosecute a pointless trade war against China, but when it comes to the millions in Hong Kong who are protesting China’s creeping despotism over their territory, Trump prefers to stay mum.
Well, funny thing: It turns out the West’s entire political theory about China has been spectacularly wrong. China has engineered ferocious economic growth in the past half century, lifting hundreds of millions of its citizens out of miserable poverty. But China’s growth did not come at any cost to the regime’s political chokehold.
A darker truth is now dawning on the world: China’s economic miracle hasn’t just failed to liberate Chinese people. It is also now routinely corrupting the rest of us outside of China.
This was the theme of the NBA’s hasty and embarrassing apology this week after Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets’ general manager, tweeted — and quickly deleted — a message in support of Hong Kong’s protesters. After an outcry from U.S. lawmakers, Adam Silver, the NBA’s commissioner, later seemed to backtrack on his genuflection.
But I wasn’t comforted. The NBA is far from the first American institution to accede to China’s limits on liberty. Hollywood, large tech companies and a variety of consumer brands — from Delta to Zara — have been more than willing to play ball. The submission is spreading: This week the American video game company Blizzard suspended a player for calling for the liberation of Hong Kong in a livestream. And according to Deadspin, ESPN — a network owned by Disney, which has worked closely with the Chinese government on some big deals in China — warned anchors against discussing Chinese politics in talking about the Rockets controversy.
This sort of corporate capitulation is hardly surprising. For Western companies, China is simply too big and too rich a market to ignore, let alone to pressure or to police. If the first and most important cost of doing business in China is the surgical extraction of a CEO’s spine, many businesses are only too happy to provide the stretcher and the scalpel.
But it will only get worse from here, and we are fools to play this game. There is a school of thought that says America should not think of China as an enemy. With its far larger population, China’s economy will inevitably come to eclipse ours, but that is hardly a mortal threat. In climate change, the world faces a huge collective-action problem that will require global cooperation. According to this view, treating China like an adversary will only frustrate our own long-term goals.
But this perspective leaves out the threat that greater economic and technological integration with China poses to everyone outside of China. It ignores the ever-steeper capitulation that China requires of its partners. And it overlooks the most important new factor in the Chinese regime’s longevity: the seductive efficiency that technology offers to effect a breathtaking new level of control over its population.
There was a time when Westerners believed that the internet would be the Communist regime’s ruin. In a speech in 2000 urging Congress to normalize trade relations with China, President Bill Clinton famously quipped: “There’s no question China has been trying to crack down on the internet. Good luck! That’s sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.” The crowd of foreign policy experts erupted in knowing laughter.
China proved them wrong. It didn’t just find a way to nail Jell-O; it became a Jell-O master carpenter. Through online surveillance, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and the propagandistic gold mine of social media, China has mobilized a set of tools that allow it to invisibly, routinely repress its citizens and shape political opinion by manipulating their feelings and grievances on just about any controversy.
This set of skills horrifies me. China may not be exporting its political ideology, but through lavish spending and trade, it is expanding its influence across the planet. There is a risk that China’s success becomes a kind of template for the world. In the coming decades, instead of democracy — which you may have noticed is not having such a hot run on either side of the Atlantic — Chinese-style tech-abetted surveillance authoritarianism could become a template for how much of the world works.
I should say there were a couple of small reasons for optimism regarding the spread of Chinese tyranny. The bipartisan outrage over the NBA’s initial apology to China did suggest U.S. lawmakers aren’t willing to give China a completely free pass. The Trump administration also did something clever, placing eight Chinese surveillance technology companies and several police departments on a blacklist forbidding them from trading with American companies.
But if we are to have any hope of countering China’s dictatorial apparatus, we’ll need a smarter and more sustained effort from our leaders. I’m not holding my breath.

Texto completo: Everyone has that experience where they finally see the light on some topic.
One recalls a landmark birthday when, older and wiser wine drinkers schooled a certain jug-Merlot drinker that had favorite glasses with painted sides, and thick rounded rims.
This conspiracy brought modern wine glass technology to his attention, even if he would not give up the jug. The result was about a half dozen sets of four proper wine glasses of various sizes and styles.
The result was almost immediate, with new stemware, the jug wine perceptively moved up in class. Wine variety enlightenment would follow; even though, it took 10 more years.
Wine glasses require proper size, proper design and proper materials. George Ravenscroft, an English glass merchant, developed leaded crystal in 1674. His product was durable, and it allowed one to see the wine in the glass much more clearly than in a pewter mug, or the relatively opaque glass of that day.
The original glasses were relatively small in capacity, about 70 m/l gross, or equal to 12-15 slosh-inducing pours from a modern 750 m/l bottle. They have evolved into relatively large bowls of 350-450m/l.
Nobody should fill a modern wine glass to the brim; in fact, a capacity of about 25% is optimum. The design of the glass indicates the level for a proper pour.
Glasses have rounded bottoms that widen to a point and then taper to the mouth, which sometimes may widen slightly again at the top, as in the case of a specially designed Burgundy glass. The wide point of the glass is the level that constitutes a proper pour.
This allows maximum surface area for the wine to distribute its volatility and aromas, as the taper more effectively directs those to the nose and olfactory bulbs.
There are dozens of wine glasses. Red wine glasses are usually larger in capacity than white ones. The five standards are from largest to smallest — Bordeaux, Cabernet, Burgundy, Pinot Noir, and Standard Red.
White wine glasses are generally Chardonnay and Standard White. Traditionally, sparkling wines are served in vintage, tulip, and flute shapes. Dessert wine glasses, usually smaller, have various shapes.
A relatively well-appointed home wine service could potentially contain three or four types of red wine glasses, two types of white wine glasses, and at least one glass designed for the sparklers. With a dinner for four-to six persons, that is a lot of crystal.
There has been a quantum shift in wine glass opinion over the last few years. The first fissure, one may have noticed, is in the sparkling wine category. The flute is out, one might occasionally use a tulip or a vintage, but the worldwide trend is for use of a typical Chardonnay or Pinot Noir glass.
Additionally one may have noted several columns in the New York Times, advocating one glass for all wines. Many sommeliers have trended to recommending one red glass and one white as being adequate, if not overkill. Storage wise this makes sense, especially for space-starved oenophiles.
What glasses meet those specifications? At this writer's home, the preference for red wines is a Pinot Noir glass, and for whites a Standard white. However if they all broke tomorrow, the replacement would be only Pinot Noir glasses in a commensurate quantity.
One hopes that those flutes that say, "Party Like it is 1999" are lost in the hoped-for catastrophe. Moreover, all should banish those stem-less glasses, that cause body temperature to warm the wine, as one drinks.
What would be the specifications for materials and design for new glasses? One can locate thin glasses with thin rims, relatively easily. Those thick, rounded rim glasses are for cheap wine in dark bars.
Proper glasses produced in one piece with no seams on the stem, are preferable. Riedel glasses fill the bill: about $10-15 per stem- and dishwasher safe, too! Others as low as $4-5 per stem are available at any of your favorite general merchandise big boxes.
Make sure they ring when you thump them. Generally, one wants a relatively large bowl that allows swirling to release the aromas that help enjoyment and taste.
That brings one to the final focus on glassware. The purpose of proper wine glasses is to produce a positive experience. That experience includes identifying a wine that one likes, at a reasonable price, and serving it at a proper temperature, in a proper vessel, with a proper victual accompaniment.
Cheers!

Texto completo: The interruption of famed violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter's performance with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra by an audience member in the front row who was recording her garnered international attention – and has sparked a conversation about when or if such a recording should be allowed.
Mutter, in her first interview since the Sept. 28 incident, told The New York Times she prefers cell phones be locked away during performances. She also shed new light on what happened.
Mutter told the New York Times the woman began recording her on a phone as she played the first movement of Beethoven's Violin Concerto, which distracted her. When she shot the woman stern looks, the woman did put her phone down, Mutter told the paper.
"The first movement is over, and I'm trying to concentrate and stay calm," Mutter recalled in the New York Times article. "Then she takes out a second phone, and a power bank. I continued the second movement, but it's already boiling in me. I'm totally out of the flow."
She added, "I feel violated in my rights, of my artistic property. As an artist you take such care when doing a recording – that you have your own sound engineer, that the mics are hung in the right spots. The sound is a part of you, you want your voice replicated in a way that really represents what you have worked on for an entire life."
She felt the audience "approval of her stance" and described the reaction as erupting "in long, powerful applause."
The New York Times article discussed the rules of etiquette and the idea that young people expected to record concerts and experiences, classical or not.
CSO rules say that during performances phones are allowed, but must be on silent. Non-flash photography is encouraged during moments of applause, but audio and video recording is not allowed.
"Please be mindful that the use of smartphones and other devices during concerts can be distracting to others," the rules also say.
Mutter told The New York Times, "The beauty of such an event, a pop concert as well as a classical concert ... is really being there, taking it in, having your own personal, really private memory of it."
Mutter, through her agent, declined to talk further about the incident.
CSO President Jonathan Martin told The Enquirer he never got a good answer about why the woman was recording the performance.
"Everyone expected her to put her phone back in her purse, but instead she stood up and started talking to the soloist," Martin said. "I was forced to go and defuse the situation or lose the performance and soloist – and perhaps the whole weekend."
Former Enquirer reporter Janelle Gelfand, who now writes for the Cincinnati Business Courier, was reviewing the performance when the woman interrupted the Beethoven Violin Concerto. "The orchestra ground to a halt," Gelfand said.
Gelfand described the confrontation as lasting several minutes, with Mutter telling the woman, "Either I will leave, or you will put away your phone and recording device."
Martin, who has also been praised for his handling of the situation, escorted the woman out.
"It's a balancing act," Martin said. "We want audience members to feel comfortable. But there is a social contract. You're there with 2,000 other people. Performers expect to come to the stage without interruption."

Warren Will Avoid Big Fund-Raisers if Nominated, With Some Caveats

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren is seeking to find a balance -- disavowing fund-raisers with wealthy contributors while promising not to actually disarm in a potential matchup with President Trump.
As Senator Elizabeth Warren has surged toward the top of the Democratic presidential field, she has found herself torn between two competing imperatives: maintaining her perceived purity from the influence of wealthy contributors and not ceding any financial advantage to President Trump, who is busy breaking fund-raising records.
One of the centerpieces of Ms. Warren's anti-corruption message has been her pledge to forgo traditional big-money fund-raisers, which advisers believe has helped fuel her rise. From the start, Ms. Warren had said the ban only applied to the primary. "I do not believe in unilateral disarmament," she said when she announced it in February on MSNBC.
But in a reversal, she told CBS News in an interview posted late Tuesday evening that she would extend the pledge through the general election if she were to win the Democratic nomination.
"Look, for me this is pretty straightforward," Ms. Warren said. "Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it's about a grass-roots, let's build this from the ground up."
Pressed on whether that was her position "no matter how much money Donald Trump is raising," Ms. Warren replied: "Yeah, I'm not going to do the big-dollar fund-raisers. I'm just not going to do it. The whole notion behind this campaign is that we can build this together."
Her aides confirmed the decision on Wednesday but layered on some caveats: While she would forgo fund-raisers for her campaign, she would headline open press events for the Democratic National Committee, which has traditionally served as a virtual extension of the nominee. Her spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said Ms. Warren was committed to helping Democrats "up and down the ballot."
Powered by small donors, Ms. Warren has become one of the strongest Democratic fund-raisers of the 2020 field, raising $ 24.6 million in the last three months from more than 940,000 donations, second only to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who raised $ 25.3 million.
Ms. Warren's new position on general election fund-raisers appears to be an effort to thread the needle between those on the progressive left urging her to permanently swear off soliciting big checks and Democratic officials and activists concerned that such a stand would endanger the party as Mr. Trump and the Republicans bank record sums of cash.
Veterans of Democratic politics said the idea that fund-raising operations for the party nominee and the party itself would be completely independent was strained.
"Once you are the Democratic nominee, you are the party," said Rufus Gifford, a former finance director for President Barack Obama, who has donated to multiple 2020 candidates but not to Ms. Warren. "You own the party. Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party."
The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $ 355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $ 2,800.
Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to "make sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources" they need. She also said Ms. Warren was "not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign," including "no special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers."
Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week.
The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot. Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the Republican National Committee raised $ 125 million in the last three months.
Henry R. Munoz III, who stepped down as finance chair of the D.N.C. earlier this year and has co-hosted a fund-raiser for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Ms. Warren's proposed arrangement left him confused.
"I don't even know how that would work," Mr. Munoz said. Democrats, he added, "have to do everything in their power to work together to create an infrastructure to do battle with the almost unlimited resources that this administration and that party will use to destroy what we believe in."
Beyond the party itself, an array of Democratic super PACs are gearing up for 2020.
Guy Cecil, the chairman of the biggest such group in the presidential race, Priorities USA, wrote on Twitter that regardless of Ms. Warren's decision, it was "full speed ahead."
"We're already up & running ads holding Trump accountable in key states & will be through November next year," Mr. Cecil wrote.
Ms. Warren has steadily risen in the polls throughout the year and has recently topped Mr. Biden in some surveys both nationally and in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Previously, she had been clear that her ban on fund-raisers applied only to the primary. MSNBC's Chris Hayes asked her that directly when she announced it ("Yes," Ms. Warren replied). And in an interview with The New York Times over the summer, Ms. Warren said, "It's primaries. This is Democrat against Democrat. I don't believe in unilateral disarmament."
Some of her rivals had sought to portray her stance as inconsistent. "Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grass-roots donations -- both in the primary and in the general," Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said pointedly when announcing his campaign's quarterly financial haul.
There has also been grumbling about the $ 10 million in leftover Senate funds she seeded her presidential campaign with, some of which was raised from major contributors.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are the only two Democrats to skip traditional fund-raising events in the primary, where candidates can collect checks of up to $ 2,800. Her announcement this week could appeal to more fervent supporters of Mr. Sanders, whose base Ms. Warren has been seeking to win over.
Tension over how candidates raise their money is an age-old political issue.
In the 2016 race, Mr. Trump railed against the influence of big donors in the Republican primary. But once he became the nominee, he quickly embraced the donor world. At the time, he said he did not see a contradiction.
"No," Mr. Trump said then, "because I'm raising money for the party."

At 60, Framingham product David Blatt has a new off-the-court challenge: MS

Texto completo: “An ambassador," said David Blatt.
That's what he'd do, might become, if he can't do this anymore, this game that has dominated his life and taken him to high places.
“I've always had the dream to be an ambassador, a diplomat in Israel. In some way I'd want to help the country."
Blatt, a dual US/Israeli citizen, is 60. His life has been about basketball, from the scruffy outdoor courts of Framingham, to Framingham South High, to Princeton, to the highly competitive overseas leagues.
And then when he had his fill of playing, Blatt grabbed clipboard and whistle and journeyed off to become one of the most successful European coaches ever. “He was known as the Phil Jackson of Europe," said Gary Bernson, Blatt's best friend and former high school teammate at South.
Blatt couldn't pull himself out of the gym. Any gym.
Now, he has been forced to.
Two months after announcing he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, Blatt resigned earlier this week as coach of Greece-based Olympiacos Piraeus in the EuroLeague. Olympiacos had opened the season on Oct. 4. In a statement, he said “it's in the best interests of both sides to part ways [with the team]. My time in Greece with Olympiacos has been meaningful and significant in many ways."
In a release, the club said, “we've had the honor to work with one of the greatest figures in world basketball."
On Monday, in an e-mail, Blatt elaborated.
“I don't want to use my illness as an excuse, but in my discussions with management, I had to be honest about certain limitations I had," he said. “But more so, there were many problems in the team. We had only played one game. It did not start well. Together we sat and decided it was better for everyone that we part ways. No hard feelings.
“I'm looking forward to my next steps and challenges, as I have always wanted to do more. After 12 years as a professional player and 27 as a coach, time to enter a new phase of life. I relish it. Sometimes the window closes and the door opens."
Blatt, the father of four children, is approaching the disease the same way he went after every game he ever played or coached: eye to eye. He's on a new cycle of treatment. “No guarantees, it just came out," he said of the new treatment over the phone from Greece.
The constant of MS is fatigue, legs weakening, and faltering balance. The 6-foot-3 Blatt has always been a high-energy guy. It's the way he played and the way he coached.
“He was a pretty legit player as a freshman," recalled Phil “Smokey" Moresi, Blatt's high school coach at Framingham South.
“There was an aura about him, a cockiness. As a sophomore, he was a starter. The other four starters were seniors. He won them over by getting the ball to them." Blatt ran the show, up tempo.
Blatt's recent medical troubles began following back surgery in June 2018. He dutifully did his post-op physical therapy. Time went by. “But I didn't feel any improvement," he said. “I thought 'what's going on here?' " It was suggested he see a neurologist. He did. Tests proved out he had MS.
“There's been good days and less than good, but I'm happiest when I'm coaching." Now that's been taken away.
Blatt understands what he's up against, but please, no sympathy overtures. After the diagnosis he wrote an open letter to his team that emphasized “I am still the same person. Self-pity doesn't do anything but foster and encourage a downward side." He says he went back to his coaching methodology: “Find out the problem, why did it happen, how do we fix it?"
He had been working out with the team trainer, emphasizing aquatic exercise several times a week. “I'm not as quick and nimble as I used to be," he said. “I've got to be careful."
Bernson, who has visited Blatt in Israel, recalled a younger Blatt. “David was like Superman, always in shape. To see him like this is heartbreaking."
Added Moresi, “But he never complains. Every time I talk to him it's 'how you doing, coach?' He never says anything to worry me."
Blatt has been candid with his family on his condition and what to expect. “We've all educated ourselves about this. They're realistic," he said. “It's not life-threatening, in short distance." Still, the body breakdown is progressively debilitating, particularly ominous for someone like Blatt, who has always lived life in motion.
“He had told me he thought he could make it through this season," said Bernson. One game wasn't the plan. The team's statement called the decision to part ways with Blatt “consensual termination."
Moresi, who also coached at Ashland High and in college, had a profound effect on the career Blatt chose. “He taught me basketball and life lessons." Blatt was a star on Moresi's teams that ripped off a 58-game Bay State Conference winning streak.
“It was a great time in our lives," said Blatt.
Former Celtics standout Tom “Satch" Sanders was coaching Harvard when Blatt graduated from Framingham South. “He wanted David, but he'd already given [Princeton coach] Pete Carril his word," said Moresi.
Blatt played for the US national team that was twice crowned champion of the Maccabiah Games. In six seasons as Maccabi Tel Aviv coach, his record was 179-21. Blatt coached the Russian national team to a bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. While coaching Russia to a EuroBasket championship, Blatt was described in a New York Times story as “an American Jewish Israeli who coaches Russia."
Blatt's success abroad didn't get ignored back home. In the spring of 2014, he met with Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, expecting to sign a deal as an assistant. But at the last moment, the Cleveland Cavaliers breezed in with an offer as head coach. Blatt took it.
The Cavs advanced to the NBA finals in Blatt's first year, but lost to the Warriors, coached by Kerr. It was the first time two first-year coaches had made it to the NBA finals. Blatt received a congratulatory call from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
On Jan. 22, 2016, the Cavaliers fired Blatt. The team was 30-11 at the time, the best record in the conference. Assistant coach Tyronn Lue took over and the LeBron James-led Cavaliers went on to win the NBA title. The team sent Blatt a championship ring. He was 83-40 as the Cavs' coach.
Blatt follows the NBA only casually. “Some of it is still a little painful," he said, “but I've got bigger challenges now." One of the joys is watching his son, 22-year-old Tamir, make a name for himself playing pro ball in Israel.
So that's David Blatt at 60. Work, hopefully, unfinished. Life to live. Life is work.

Texto completo: 'Horror Stories'
By Liz Phair, Random House, 272 pages, $28

Pity to those who approach a Liz Phair project with their own expectations. Ever since her stunning, out-of-nowhere 1993 debut album, "Exile in Guyville," fans have been clamoring for her to recapture that lightning, to produce another work so revelatory, empowering and inspiring.
"Guyville" was a portrait of the female artist in the male-dominated Wicker Park rock scene, a young woman from Winnetka who hung out with up-and-coming bands such as the swaggering Urge Overkill and didn't mention that she too wrote songs. These songs were vulnerable and muscular, tuneful and constructed from odd chords that she'd discovered while fingering her fret board. She claimed ownership over her sexuality through lyrics as explicit as the album's nipple-bearing cover, yet even in her incendiary song "(Expletive) and Run," she wasn't too proud to admit, "I want a boyfriend."
Since then Phair's muse has taken her on a journey that some followers have found confounding. She startled her fan base with the slick pop of her 2003 eponymous album, which a New York Times reviewer called "an embarrassing form of career suicide," though it yielded her highest-charting single in "Why Can't I?" Later came her loopy rapping about the music industry on the very loose 2010 album "Funstyle," which got her dropped from her label and compelled her to write a note to fans in which she explained that "(l)ove them or hate them," the album's songs were "all me .... This is my journey. I'll keep sending you postcards."
Phair, now 52, hasn't sent any musical postcards since then, but now she has written a lively, insightful letter in the form of a new memoir, "Horror Stories." You may assume this is the book in which Phair will walk us through her surprising rise to stardom, tell us the back story of each of those beloved songs, share juicy tales of hanging out with sometime-muse Nash Kato of Urge Overkill and others on the early '90s Chicago scene, and convey how she faced performing in public for the first time ever after her debut album's release.
But no. Remember that warning about having expectations with Phair?
"Horror Stories" is Phair's portrait of the artist as an older woman who has accumulated much perspective and wisdom yet remains frustrated that even after one marriage and other ill-fated relationships, she still wants a boyfriend. There is a #MeToo-themed chapter that springs from her experience of being produced by singer/songwriter Ryan Adams (though she doesn't mention him name), who early this year was accused of sexual misconduct by several female musicians. "Did he hit on me? Yes. Did I take him up on it? No. Is that why he lost interest in our record? Maybe, partially," Phair writes.
That experience, which she does not portray as traumatic on its own, triggers distressing memories for Phair, who saw "Exile in Guyville" as her way to reclaim power after the "disturbing and unwanted attention" that she endured as a young woman. Once she became a star, she still was expected to please predatory record-label executives, radio programmers and others industry scumbags. Yet aside from this vivid chronicle of male misbehavior, the "Horror" of most of Phair's "Stories" isn't the type to generate headlines.
The book's subtitle could be "Tales of Empathy," as Phair wrestles with memories that linger and haunt: the passed-out young woman on the bathroom floor whom she and others failed to help; the quiet, pretty high-school girl destined for disfiguring surgery; the hunky, perhaps overly friendly Trader Joe's staffer whose sunny demeanor masks his own darkness; and relationship betrayals in which she is both victim and perpetrator.
Instead of laying out these stories in chronological order, she drops in and out of settings as if remembering them in the moment, and she expects, not unreasonably, that we can keep them all straight. So the soon-to-be-boyfriend of the "New York City Blackout" chapter is the boyfriend of the later chapter in which she must deliver some high-profile performances despite having lost her voice. (She identifies one key concert as "Q101's Christmas show," with her manager telling her she can't afford to blow off Chicago's "adult contemporary" station -- except that Q101 played alternative rock then; maybe she meant 101.9-FM The MIX?)
Likewise, we see Phair trying to recover from the brutal end of another relationship before she rewinds to show us what this boyfriend, Rory, actually did to her. Most strikingly, she writes about the end of her marriage, the couple's drifting apart but also her own infidelity. As is typical of Phair, she doesn't gloss over details or spare herself in the telling; she conveys the adrenaline rush that comes on strong and the shame and regret that follow more forcefully. In this and other instances, Phair sees signs of the devil and other spiritual forces at work.
A sense of inner conflict permeates the book. She's a privileged rock star from Chicago's North Shore who is afforded celebrity treatment as well as a woman and artist constantly swimming upstream. The coin flips between good fortune and struggles.
Her grappling with these issues gets messy at times. One chapter recounts a terrifying break-in at her Oberlin College house, after which she feels reluctant to describe the perpetrators because they are black:
Even though I'm white and middle class, I don't sit in the lecture halls thinking history is my story. I don't feel like my future is in any way guaranteed. I expect to work twice as hard to be acknowledged in the art world simply because I'm female. How does that make me the oppressor? Why shouldn't I say who I think the (expletives) were who broke into my house? They broke the law, but now I'm feeling guilty?
That chapter feels like an overreach, an attempt to make a grand race-relations statement amid a simple tale of revenge vandalism. She also comes to an odd conclusion with her Trader Joe's checkout-guy story, basically that the pain of that situation serves as a lesson that we should all stay in our own lanes. And I must add, as a fellow child of a doctor at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, I'm not so sure about her claim that her swimming while pregnant gave her son asthma.
That said, "Horror Stories" reminds us of something gratifying: Liz Phair can write. She does so with engaging candor and a terrific eye for detail, whether evoking an ill-conceived trek through a New York blizzard, a childhood climb up a spider-infested tree or therapeutic adventures on a surfboard. Check out this vivid description of having makeup applied before a photo shoot:
A petite woman with red hair and perfect features is lining my lips. I have my mouth open in an obliging O shape, and she has her pencil in her hand, squinting at my vermillion border like forensic scientist trying to trace the outline of a missing piece of evidence. We met fifteen minutes ago, and we are literally breathing into each other's mouths.
Then there's this unspoken response to a "coiffed matron" at a wedding who, unable to process the contrast between Phair's "prim and proper" appearance and her penchant for profanity, asks, "What's wrong with you?"
I don't know what's wrong with me! But something is definitely wrong with me, because I can't stand to keep my thoughts and feelings bottled up like you ruthless doyennes of propriety. ... I'm only twenty-six years old, and I've known three friends who killed themselves, a dozen girls with eating disorders, seven guys who went to rehab, and more people than I can count who've been sexually assaulted and never talk about it. I want to hear the truth. I want to feel solid ground beneath my feet.
She still is speaking her truth, with a generosity of spirit and willingness to dig into the thorniest aspects of what it means to be human right now. Twenty-six years after "Exile in Guyville," it turns out, Liz Phair is rewarding our expectations after all.
Phair will appear in conversation with music critic Jessica Hopper at 5:30 p.m., Oct. 15, at Pritzker Pavilion, 201 E. Randolph St. For details, visit Chicago Ideas.

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his pressuring Ukraine to conduct an investigation into a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is moving rapidly, and developments are coming to light at all hours. Here's a summary of what you might have missed, and what's expected to happen next.
Here's what happened over the weekend:
— Amid reports from the New York Times and others that a second whistle-blower, with direct knowledge of the Ukraine phone call, has been interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general, lawyers for the first whistle-blower confirmed on Twitter Sunday that they were representing “multiple" individuals.
— Here's how Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, reacted to the news:
— On Friday afternoon, House Democrats subpoenaed White House officials, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for documents related to the inquiry. Trump signaled that he would not comply without a full House vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry.
— House Democrats also announced they've requested documents from Vice President Mike Pence about his role in the scandal.
— On Saturday, Axios reported that Trump claimed to Republican House members that he made the call to Ukraine at the urging of Energy Secretary Rick Perry. A spokesperson for Perry said the secretary encouraged Trump to speak to Volodymyr Zelensky about “matters related to their energy security and economic development," not about the Bidens.
What's happening next:
— The ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, is expected to give a deposition on Tuesday.
— Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from the post early, will be speaking Friday.
— Giuliani and Pence face a deadline of Oct. 15 to turn over the requested documents, and the White House has an Oct. 18 deadline.

Texto completo: Not all theme park rides are created equally as some Disney World visitors found out this weekend when they became stranded for hours on the brand new Skyliner gondola ride and had to be rescued by firefighters.
The unfortunate incident illustrated an unsettling theme park truth: Some rides are worse than others to get stuck on.
It’s a lot easier to evacuate from the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean or the Mad Tea Party if the attraction malfunctions than a gondola ride dangling from a cable several stories in the sky.
Skyliner passengers were stuck for up to three hours and had to be rescued by firefighters using ladder trucks when the new aerial cable car ride malfunctioned Saturday night.
A few unfortunate theme park visitors have found out first hand that it’s much harder to evacuate an attraction when they are way up in the air on a swing tower ride or an elevated monorail. Or even worse, upside down on a looping coaster or thrill ride.
Let’s take a closer look at some recent incidents that illustrate the worst types of rides to get stranded on at a theme park.
Joker’s Jinx at Six Flags America — Two dozen riders were trapped for more than three hours in April 2017 when the launch coaster stalled on the track at the Maryland amusement park. Firefighters used a hydraulic crane to rescue the riders who were stuck 80 feet in the air at a 30-degree angle, according to Washington’s NBC4 News.
Sky Cabin at Knott’s Berry Farm — The gyro tower stopped revolving and became stuck 125 feet in the air for eight hours in December 2016 at the Buena Park theme park, according to the Orange County Register. Riders were rescued by firefighters and lowered by harness.
Monorail at Walt Disney World — Passengers were stranded for hours when the Monorail Gold line stopped on the track at the Florida theme park resort in October 2015, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Fire crews evacuated the trains by cherry picker.
Windseeker at Knott’s Berry Farm — The 300-foot-tall tower swing ride stranded riders in mid-air for nearly four hours in September 2012 at the Buena Park theme park, according to the Orange County Register. Similar incidents occurred with the Mondial tower rides during the 2012 and 2013 seasons at Cedar Point, Kings Island and Carowinds. The Knott’s ride was relocated to Missouri’s Worlds of Fun in 2014 and renamed SteelHawk.
Invertigo at California’s Great America — Passengers were stranded 80 feet in the air for more than four hours in August 2009 at the Santa Clara amusement park when the roller coaster became stuck on the lift hill. Firefighters rescued 24 riders and evacuated them down a staircase, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Invertigo was relocated to Pennsylvania’s Dorney Park in 2012 and renamed Stinger. Dorney has since retired the coaster.
King Kahuna at Kennywood — Riders were stranded upside down when a Huss Top Spin ride malfunctioned in July 2008 at the Pennsylvania theme park, according to the Associated Press. The thrill ride featured seats on a rotating platform that spun 360 degrees forward and backward between two pendulum arms. The Kennywood ride was removed after the 2009 season.
Batman and Robin: The Chiller at Six Flags Great Adventure — A lightning strike knocked out power to the New Jersey amusement park in August 2004 and stranded riders upside down 75 feet in the air on the electrically powered launch coaster, according to the New York Times. Park employees eventually eased the train down to a position where riders could evacuate. The dueling shuttle coaster was removed after the 2007 season.

Texto completo: Tuesday’s forecast for Shanghai is not terribly different from Los Angeles weather: sunny, low-70s, little chance of rain.
But even as the Lakers boarded a flight Monday morning bound for China, they knew they were about to fly into a storm.
Sunday’s news cycle was bombarded by reaction to a Friday tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” The NBA is generally a league that is permissive about expressing personal views on social issues; the estimated hundreds of millions of NBA fans in China are apparently not. Subsequent fallout included Chinese businesses vowing to cut ties with the Rockets, former Houston star Yao Ming saying the Chinese Basketball Association would no longer work with them, and awkwardly worded statements from Rockets ownership and the NBA at large.
In the middle of the madness, the Lakers are flying to Shanghai and Shenzhen, two of the largest cities in the world for a pair of exhibition games with the Brooklyn Nets and a host of league events. What was initially planned as an innocent bit of diplomacy for a league that is extremely popular overseas could now have significantly higher stakes for both the Lakers and the NBA.
Outside of North America, it’s reasonable to say that China is by far the most important market for the NBA. The country of 1.4 billion people is basketball-crazed. According to numbers shared by the league: The CBA estimates that 300 million people play basketball at some level in the country. The NBA has had a dedicated office in China since 2008. Tencent, the league’s top media partner in China, estimates that nearly half a billion people watched NBA programming on their platforms – a figure that has tripled from the viewership just five years ago. It’s common to see Chinese-language reporters roaming locker rooms before and after games, and ESPN has a partnership with Tencent to get one-on-one postgame interviews with players as they walk off the court.
Many players understand the power of the Chinese market, and it’s common for players to tour Chinese cities for their shoe companies. LeBron James, for example, goes abroad virtually every summer.
“I’ve been able to go over there and I’ve always been welcomed with open arms,” he said last week. “They love the game of basketball. It started with Yao and Yi (Jianlian) and those guys over there. We want to make the game as popular as we can and show our appreciation by going overseas in China like we’re doing next week.”
While Chinese fans have a raucous following for both superstars and a handful of major franchises – of which the Lakers are definitely one – they showcase love for players at all levels. Lance Stephenson, who played for the Lakers last year before deciding to play in China this season, recently shared a video on Instagram of the doorman at his hotel mimicking his famous “air guitar” gesture.
Joe Young, who spent Summer League playing for the Lakers, played for Nanjing’s CBA team last season. When he first flew in, he remembers being greeted by hundreds – perhaps even a thousand – fans all bearing roses for him, a foreign player who went on to average 36 points per game for a franchise that hung around the bottom of the league standings. Toward the end of the season, Young didn’t like leaving his apartment for fear that he would be accosted in public by adoring fans.
“It’s just another level over there,” he said. “Those fans are crazy.”
But in light of the Morey incident, it seems that devotion has an uglier side to it: a hair-trigger for rebuking political discourse that puts China in an unfavorable light.
Morey’s tweet touched on a nerve that has been sensitive for months. Hong Kong is in the midst of protests of mainland China’s attempts to assert more control over the island that was a longtime British territory. A bill that would have allowed for extradition to mainland China sparked more than a million people to take to the streets in June to show their displeasure. Since, protesters and the Chinese government have had countless skirmishes, in which the New York Times estimated that some 2,000 canisters of tear canisters had been fired. Complicating the issue, many mainlanders feel that the legacy of Hong Kong is irrevocably tied to the country’s adversarial history with colonialism – Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai tried to relate the context in a Facebook post on Sunday night.
Morey’s tweet was deleted shortly after it was issued, but it was out in the open for the world to notice. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly noted that Morey’s tweet didn’t represent the Rockets, insisting that the team is an apolitical organization. Morey himself issued a statement saying he did not mean to offend Chinese fans. The NBA followed up with a statement that both related that the league supports individuals “educating themselves and sharing their views,” but also called the incident “regrettable.” James Harden, the Rockets’ franchise star, apologized and added “We love China.”
Outside of the league, the clamor was even louder as several political leaders criticized the NBA for kowtowing to Chinese interests – Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri even wrote an open letter to the NBA asking them to cancel the Lakers’ exhibitions there.
On other hot-button issues, the NBA has stood unconditionally behind its players’ ability to express political views. On his own, James has spoken in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, for gun legislation and against NCAA amateurism. Other politically outspoken NBA figures include coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, who have been particularly critical of the White House. Political expression has now entered the fabric of the NBA, so it’s all the more evident when the league tiptoes around a statement such as Morey’s that threatens its standing in a lucrative market.
The conflict of economic interests and political motivations is a needle the league has managed to thread for more than a decade of its increased investment in the Chinese market. This moment is arguably the first serious threat to the harmony that the NBA and China have managed to maintain. The Lakers, who sport two enormously popular stars in James and Anthony Davis, have a chance to heal some of the damage done.
Still, the larger question is likely to linger: Was it reasonable in the first place for the NBA to expect to have it both ways? That might not be so easily resolved.

IRAQ VETERAN RECEIVING PARDON ; 'THAT FELONY IS NOT WHO I AM'

Texto completo: Eric Pizer is a father, a college graduate with an associate degree in criminal justice and a decorated Iraq War veteran who has always wanted to be a police officer.
But for the past almost 15 years, Pizer, 38, has also been a felon.
When Pizer was 23, two days after he got back from being deployed in Iraq, he tried to de-escalate a drunken argument between his friend and a jealous husband after a night of drinking in the town in Boscobel in southwestern Wisconsin. Pizer said he and his friends didn't know one of the women with whom they were hanging out was married.
After Pizer heard the husband say, "I'm going to ... kill you," Pizer threw one punch and broke the man's nose, resulting in the substantial battery charge. He had no prior criminal record and hasn't committed any crimes since.
Pizer said it was a "knee-jerk reaction" and that he "didn't think about it, it just happened." He still regrets the moment and is deeply remorseful for the pain he caused.
Since then, Pizer has gotten forgiveness from the man he punched, but the felony has tainted others' view of his character, caused tension in his relationships, prevented him from starting a career and disallowed him from being able to carry a firearm, which he would need to fulfill his dream of becoming a law enforcement officer.
"I've always been who I am," said Pizer, of Edgerton. "And that felony is not who I am."
Over the past nine years, Pizer worked with two lawyers, who are helping him pro bono, to try to reopen his case and plead the felony down to a misdemeanor or get a pardon, with little success.
But then Democratic Gov. Tony Evers was elected, replacing two-term Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who refused to issue pardons.
"I still remember the day that Evers was elected," said David Relles, one of Pizer's attorneys. "I called Eric because the case had just been dormant, and I said, 'Well, maybe you got a shot now.'"
On Monday, Pizer will be among a group of four people who will be receiving pardons for the first time in nine years in Wisconsin. Evers plans to sign their pardons Monday afternoon, invoking a constitutional power held only by the governor.
The three others who are set to receive pardons include Kevin Sorenson, Mwangi Vasser and Steven Nichols. Sorenson and Vasser were both convicted for selling drugs in their late teens. Nichols was convicted of a felony burglary when he was 21.
Sorenson, now 36, wants the pardon so he can serve in more positions in the military, including volunteering for deployment. Vasser, 40, hopes to become a military chaplain. Nichols, 62, wants to be able to hunt and travel to Canada for the Calgary Stampede, an annual rodeo, exhibition and festival.
"A pardon can profoundly impact a person's life by offering them an official grant of forgiveness," Evers said in a statement. "(These four) have paid their debt to society, made amends, and contributed to their communities. I believe they deserve a second chance."

No pardons under Walker
Walker was firm on his position of refusing to grant pardons during his tenure, despite repeated appeals from Pizer, his lawyers and letters from dozens of citizens - including veterans and Republicans - who asked Walker to give Pizer a pardon. Pizer's case even got coverage from the New York Times, which called his conviction a "one-punch felony."
"I would say people recognized that he deserved a second chance," Relles said.
UW-Madison professor Barry Burden, an expert on American politics, said Walker's stance on pardons was "exceptional" for Wisconsin, as both Republican and Democrat governors before him exercised their constitutional pardoning power.
Before Walker, former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson issued 238 pardons, former Republican Gov. Scott McCallum issued 24 and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle issued more than 300, according to Evers' office.
Walker has said little about his rationale for his position. In late 2013, a Walker spokesman told the Wisconsin State Journal he had made the decision early in his administration and the position had not changed. Walker also told a TV reporter there were thousands of convicted felons "who probably have a compelling case to be made that we don't know about." A spokesman said Sunday he had nothing more to add.
Evers re-started the pardons board in June, and his office had received 210 pardon applications as of Friday. Only five were heard before the board, one of which was rejected. On Oct. 14, 10 more requests will be heard by the board, and those hearings will continue every six to eight weeks, Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said.
Burden said the nine years of no pardons in the state likely created a "backlog" of people who will be eligible. He said there will be "people who were ignored by one governor and then given a pardon by the next."
After being ignored by Walker for eight years, Pizer's pardon will restore his right to own a gun and pursue a career in law enforcement.
"I honestly don't really have those right words for how amazing this is for me finally," Pizer said. "Not just for me, but for everyone else who has helped me along the way to get this for me. This is one huge, gigantic relief."

'Extremely naive'
Relles said there are several things that make Pizer an ideal candidate for a pardon.
For one, Relles said Pizer's charge could have been reduced to a misdemeanor instead of a felony.
Pizer said he was "extremely naive" in terms of how the legal system worked when he was 23. On recommendation from his lawyer at the time, he accepted a plea deal for the felony charge because under the deal he would only have to do probation instead of jail time.
But Pizer said he didn't fully understand the impact that having a felony on his record would cause.
With a felony on his record, Pizer hasn't been able to start a career, despite going to night classes to get associate degrees in criminal justice and health science. He's made "just enough to get by" in his jobs as a piano mover, a construction worker, a landscaper, a FedEx Driver and now working for a concrete company.
Having a felony also contributed to tensions in Pizer's marriage, which ended after four years.
A hard transition
If the 2004 incident had happened today, Relles said, it would have been a "classic case" for veterans court, which allows qualifying veterans to get charges dismissed or reduced after successful completion of a treatment program for addiction, mental health or other disorders.
Pizer served four years in the Marines, earning two commendations and the rank of corporal. He did two tours of duty, one in Kuwait and one in Iraq. The second deployment was voluntary, because he didn't want to abandon four new marines who were under his command.
In Iraq, every week rocket-propelled grenades would be shot at the base where Pizer was stationed. One had even exploded against a brick wall right outside his tent, blasting him out of his bunk.
Pizer said the stress of being only two days removed from a war zone contributed to his gut reaction of punching the husband, Steven Frazier, in the nose.
He said it was "hard to flip the switch" from being "always aware, always alert" while he was on duty to being a normal civilian. Today, soldiers are required to stay on base for around a month before returning home to "defuse" and "calm down," Pizer said.

A 'second chance'
The punch left Frazier with headaches and breathing problems, but after a conversation in 2014 facilitated through a restorative justice program, the two men were able to talk through their differences on that night 15 years ago.
"At the end of the conversation, we stood up, we shook hands, he said he forgave me," Pizer said. "That just felt amazing. ... He forgave me, and I think that is all that is really important."
Pizer said if Frazier was able to forgive him, the state should be able to too.
"If I am granted a pardon, you won't regret it," Pizer said during his pardon hearing around five weeks ago. "For the rest of my life, I will be a law-abiding member of society, I will be better able to support my family, and I will contribute only positively to the greater Wisconsin community.
"That is my pledge to you today. I will make you all proud to have given me this second chance."

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today.
This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever.
In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter.
It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it.
The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, "What to Cook."
She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience.
We chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.
How her new book will be different from 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat' But as far as the book, one of things I've seen is that people feel kind of stuck about deciding what to make.
Even really good home cooks create a menu for a dinner or a party page for page, word for word out of a magazine spread of recipes. Or because they saw such-and-such-thing on TV or Instagram. I started to think about how there's so much I can share with those people about how to make their lives easier by understanding what decisions to make about what they should be cooking.
I did my best with "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" to teach people how to translate how professional cooks think about how to cook. What I've realized is I haven't really that similar translation about how professional cooks decide what to cook.
I think people have a really romantic notion that chefs show up at work and are like 'today I feel like making this grand and wonderful creation' or something. And maybe some people do that. But the constraints of a real kitchen are what chiefly make a professional cook decide what to make. If I can teach that to home cooks I think it would make people's day-to-day cooking a lot easier.
So that's what I'm going to do with the book that I have not started writing yet. (laughs)
Chef Samin Nosrat is the author of the award-winning book, "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking," which is now a show on Netflix.

To the Editor:
Re "That Extra $ 250 Million to Protect the Elections? Just a Drop in the Bucket" (news article, Sept. 26):
There are in fact no new security provisions in the legislation Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, finally backed -- just $ 250 million of pork to the voting equipment vendors (who are among Mr. McConnell's donors), virtually certain to be spent on the latest iteration of "rig me" voting equipment, a.k.a. bar code ballot marking devices, no more secure than the equipment it would be replacing.
Indeed it is fortunate that the appropriation is so small and inadequate. Less damage will done. But to characterize Mr. McConnell as somehow caving to pressure and doing the right thing here is as inaccurate as it is naïve.

To the Editor:
Re "Now McConnell Backs Funding to Protect Vote" (news article, Sept. 20):
Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has just allowed a bill to give states $ 250 million to improve election security. It probably won't do much good.
Russian operatives won't try to alter or discard ballots in thousands of American locations. They will focus on attacking web-based election material, like computerized electoral rolls.
No matter how states secure web-based material, state defenses are no match against sophisticated Russian malware. An effective defense takes time, skilled teams of people and advanced computers not available to most states.
Taking small numbers of Democratic votes off the rolls in computerized electoral rolls can turn a swing state's electors from Democrat to Republican.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal agencies have the tools to fight the Russian cyberattacks, but they didn't get the money.
Where is the integrated program needed to protect the 2020 election?

To the Editor:
Re "Aloof? For Cats, It's Just an Act" (Science Times, Oct. 1):
I don't need a newspaper -- even the newspaper of record -- to tell me that cats are emotionally attached to their owners.
My cat, Mushroom, will come to me from another room when he hears me calling him by name.
After my husband died, Mushroom circled Justin's pillow for more than a week.
The best thing about a cat is not having to take him for a walk at the end of a leash. Cat owners know what the worst thing is.

The defenses of democracy are giving way

Texto completo: It is no longer surprising to see President Trump wielding the government as an instrument purely for his personal benefit or vengeance.
What is both alarming and new is how government, increasingly, is giving way and giving in.
Three years into Trump's term, we are witnessing the accelerating erosion of a bedrock American principle: that the awesome power of government will be wielded fairly, based on facts and evidence, and without regard to political fear or favor.
A normal government that cared about corruption in Ukraine, as officials in this administration sometimes pretend they do, would seek improvements in its judicial system. But Trump has no such concern, as you can tell from his July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president. He never mentions corruption, but presses only for two specific investigations he hopes will benefit his domestic political fortunes.
A government committed to rescuing Americans from unfair detention abroad - as Trump likes to boast he is - would be committed to rescuing all Americans from unfair detention abroad.
But this administration picks and chooses, based on Trump's whims and grudges. For a Christian cleric held in Turkey, Trump goes all out. For a New York Times reporter endangered in Egypt, the administration does not bestir itself, as Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger recently recounted.
Some officials have indulged these impulses almost from the start. That Times reporter barely escaped arrest two years ago. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's dishonest maneuverings to get a question about citizenship added to the 2020 Census took place in the spring of 2017. Last year, officials devised their policy to separate children from parents at the border, and then repeatedly lied about it.
But as time goes on, the government more and more is endorsing and amplifying policies that serve Trump's political interest. Just recently:
l As soon as Trump decided to make political hay out of California's homeless population, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler accused the (Democratic) state of allowing human feces to pollute its waterways and demanded action. Around the country, 3,508 community water systems are out of compliance with standards; only California attracted the EPA's attention.
l When the House Ways and Means Committee requested Trump's tax returns, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig flatly refused - though the law says the returns "shall" be turned over if requested.
l When another House committee wanted former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to testify about Trump's efforts to fire special investigator Robert S. Mueller III, White House counsel Pat Cipollone - who is supposed to represent the law, not the president's personal well-being - happily asserted executive privilege on behalf of this tale of obstruction, though Lewandowski never actually worked in the White House.
l Indulging another Trump obsession, the State Department has intensified an investigation of Obama-era officials who sent emails to Hillary Clinton - including by retroactively classifying some of their messages, as The Post reported a few days ago.
l When the intelligence community's inspector general ruled that the whistleblower complaint about Trump and Ukraine should be sent to Congress, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel conveniently offered a contrary opinion. No, the OLC said, "the appropriate action is to refer the matter to the Department of Justice."
l Which was doubly convenient, in fact, because Justice, with great efficiency, determined that - although soliciting assistance from a foreign power on behalf of a political campaign is against the law - Trump had nothing to worry about, on the pretext that prosecutors were unable to assign a dollar value to the help he had solicited. Case closed. Case never even opened, in fact.
What's going on? Senior officials who had the fortitude to defend the rule of law have gradually been replaced by those who put ambition over principle. A few who still try to do the right thing are kept in vulnerable "acting" positions and hemmed in by toadies and hacks in subordinate positions.
Meanwhile, honest civil servants leave or become demoralized. They watch first-class research agencies be deliberately disrupted and degraded. They see Trump firing (Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch) and threatening (the still anonymous whistleblower) honest professionals. Resistance to abuse of power naturally dwindles.
Yes, take this as a warning of what a second term would mean. Norms get eroded, a nonpartisan bureaucracy can be corrupted.
But remember also that the whistleblower and intelligence inspector general refused to bend. Thousands of public servants like them are continuing to fulfill their missions as best they can. We need to keep faith with them as they work, often under pressures we can't imagine, to keep government fair and honest.

Epstein company seeks to keep leases

Texto completo: A company that was owned by the late Jeffery Epstein is asking a judge to reverse New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard's cancellation of grazing contracts on state trust land adjacent to Epstein's Zorro Ranch in southern Santa Fe County.
A petition filed Thursday in state District Court on behalf of Cypress Inc. says the action violated state law and requests a court order to prevent termination of the land leases.
Authorities have said Epstein, the wealthy financier accused of trafficking and sexually abusing more than a dozen women when they were teens, took his own life in a New York jail cell Aug. 10. He had been arrested on criminal charges about a month earlier.
Cypress Inc., the company he owned, held two grazing leases totaling about 1,200 acres of land adjacent to his massive property north of Stanley.
On Sept. 4, Garcia Richard held a news conference announcing the grazing contracts were canceled effective Oct. 4 and tore up copies of the lease agreements. Cypress Inc.'s petition notes she said her office was "looking for a reason to cancel these leases."
Garcia Richard listed three reasons for the termination. First, she said, her staff was allowed to visit the ranch after Epstein's arrest in July and conduct a field report, but after his death, she was unable to access the property. The 40 cows grazing on the state land were a cover for privacy, she said, and land appraisement forms were signed by Ghislain Maxwell, Epstein's associate, instead of a neutral party, as required.
Cypress Inc. disputes the assertions, saying it had given access to the ranch 43 days before termination of grazing leases and offered access after it was notified of the cancellation. But the state ignored the company's offer, says the petition, which also claims current leases were not signed by Maxwell but by a another person with personal knowledge of the property.
The state land commissioner is required to provide the company 30 days to address any alleged violations, the company says, and must hold hearings contesting the agency's decision.
The petition says cancellation of the grazing contracts decreases the property's value and harms ranchers subletting the leases and anyone seeking assets of the estate.
Property tax assessments say the ranch is valued at an estimated $17.2 million.
At the time of Epstein's death, the criminal counts against him did not include any allegations stemming from incidents at Zorro Ranch or elsewhere in New Mexico.
But two women have said in civil lawsuits they were raped at Zorro Ranch -- and the New York Times reported in July that Epstein had told scientists and others he wanted to use the property as a "baby ranch," where he would impregnate women and spread his DNA.
The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office told The New Mexican in July there were no investigations into alleged sex crimes at Zorro Ranch, and the state Department of Public Safety, in a response to a records request earlier this year, said it had no documents pertaining to Epstein.
Still, shortly after Epstein's arrest in New York in early July, New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas said he was launching an investigation into whether the financier committed any crimes in the state.
Epstein, who had misrepresented his wealth to be in the billions of dollars, owned properties in New York, Florida, France and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Two days before he died, he signed over his $577 million estate into a trust.
Many of his accusers were angry that Epstein had evaded the justice system while his victims endured shame and trauma. At least three women have filed lawsuits against his estate, tying up the money until any settlement.
During a federal court hearing two weeks after his death, one accuser, Chauntae Davies, said Epstein raped her on his private island in 2001 after he asked her for a massage.
"I have suffered and he has won," she said.
Federal prosecutors have said the criminal investigation will continue, scrutinizing the network of rich, powerful people surrounding Epstein.
Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General William Barr is overseeing an inquiry into Epstein's death at the New York Metropolitan Correction Center.

Texto completo: Medios de comunicación en Kansas City confirmaron que las víctimas mortales del tiroteo en un bar de Kansas City eran de ascendencia hispana.
Alfredo Calderón, Everaldo Meza y Francisco García Anaya fueron identificados entre los muertos por familiares y amigos de acuerdo con la estación KSHB. Se desconoce el nombre de la otra víctima. El tiroteo dejó cinco heridos.
El suceso, que también dejó cinco heridos, se produjo poco antes de la 1:30 a.m. De acuerdo con el New York Times, un hombre fue retirado del bar Tequila KC después de que arrojara un vaso de plástico a un cantinero que no quiso servirle por su mala conducta. El sujeto además peleó con otro cliente.
El sospechoso volvió minutos después acompañado de otro hombre y abrió fuego dentro del bar. Según la información, el sujeto ya había causado problemas un semana antes. El bar no contaba con su guardia de seguridad armado en esta ocasión.
La Policía descartó un crimen de odio por los testimonios recogidos con los sobrevivientes. También reveló imágenes de los sospechosos tomadas de cámaras de vigilancia.
Las edades de los muertos oscilan entre los 20 y los 50 años. El canciller de México Marcelo Ebrard dijo que dos de las víctimas son ciudadanos de ese país.
Les comunico que hay dos mexicanos fallecidos en Kansas, extendemos el más sentido pésame del Gobierno de México a sus familiares y amigos”, dijo Ebrard en un mensaje en Twitter.
“Tendrán nuestro apoyo sus familias”, añadió, al indicar que se esperan datos sobre “quiénes y por qué perpetraron este crimen”.
El bar es un establecimiento privado que solo admite a quienes son miembros. En su web, se describe como “un bar de barrio con bebidas frías y gente fantástica” y su menú incluye tacos, burritos, nachos y pizzas.

Texto completo: The dead sometimes speak louder than the living.
That's especially true when it comes to investing, markets and the economy, topics that generate many opinions from living people, few of which are useful.
I find it's better to ask the deceased what they think. With that in mind, I’ve profiled seven departed legends whose views should always remain at the top of your mind when you want advice about investing. The more you study these people, the better you'll fare.
Neff: Bragging means selling
John Neff, the last of the legendary mutual fund managers, died June 4. His 31 years running the Windsor Fund, part of Vanguard, averaged 13. 7% annually to 1995, more than doubling a comparable S&P 500 investment. How did he do it? Neff avoided fads and focused on fundamental firms and value, seeking to buy stocks cheaply compared with their intrinsic worth. That is a timely reminder since value investing is now long out of fashion. It will return someday.
Neff said things like, “When you feel like bragging about a stock, it’s probably time to sell. ”
Key dates for your finances: FAFSA and other money deadlines
Don't sabotage your retirement: 3 expenses to avoid.
Graham: Father of value
Neff, like Warren Buffett, derived from the Ben Graham school of value investing. Buffett is often depicted as 85% Ben Graham (the other 15% being Phil Fisher, see below). Graham is often called, “the father of value investing. ” If you have time for just one investing book, make sure it's Graham’s classic, "The Intelligent Investor. " Graham’s key takeaway? Heeding value provides a margin of safety and higher returns, although those returns are irregular over time. That's because most investors oversell and underappreciate what isn’t faddish and hasn’t worked recently.
T. Rowe Price & Phil Fisher: Growth gurus
The reverse thinking came from the two “fathers” of growth stock investing, Thomas Rowe Price Jr. and Philip Fisher (disclosure: my father). These two are considered the first major voices claiming that a firm’s future growth prospects matter much more than the current perceived “value. ” Both deployed rigorous, varied disciplines for verifying small firms that would grow fast longer term. Price is best known for founding mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price Group. Fisher’s legendary book, "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits," was the first investing book to ever grace The New York Times best-seller list. Price and Fisher, if active now, would both be riding high in this growth-oriented bull market.
Bogle: Passive champion
Vanguard’s Jack Bogle taught the world that most people will do better if they focus on neither growth nor value but instead become passive investors through an S&P 500 Index Fund. Beating the market requires that you know something useful others don’t. Do you?
If not, Bogle provided a ready path: Combine growth and value passively and match the market without trying to beat it or accidentally lag it. He knew most investors lag the market by in-and-outing the wrong things at all the wrong times. Since most money managers have lagged markets for years, Bogle would also ride high right now.
Loeb: Be a skeptic
Gerald Loeb was an early “contrarian investing” voice, believing that if too many investors thought something would happen, it was already priced into the market and wouldn’t happen. He was an active trader, book author, columnist and sometimes called “the most quoted man on Wall Street. ” Some of Loeb is usually in my writings.
He also established the gold standard of awards for excellence in financial journalism, the Gerald Loeb Award. Loeb’s key takeaway? Always invest, but be skeptically skittish because nothing endures.
Ponzi: Sounds too good to be true
Charles Ponzi’s legend lives on, quite infamously: the Ponzi scheme is his namesake. Studying his schemes teaches to avoid being a victim of them. When a deal sounds too good to be true, it isn’t true. Risk is real and everywhere. So are fraudsters.

Texto completo: Amber Guyger got off easy.
Amber Guyger got what she deserved.
It's easy to be in either camp -- or, for the truly ambivalent, be in both camps at once.
One thing is certain: Botham Jean is dead. Guyger killed him by accident, she says, but at best there appears to be considerable carelessness involved.
Which only brings up the very troubling question: Would she have made that mistake if Jean had not been black and she were not white?
Jean, 26, an accountant and native of St. Lucia, was relaxing after work in his Dallas apartment when Guyger, 30, a Dallas police officer, walked in and shot him.
Guyger, who lived in the same building but on a different floor, told authorities she mistakenly had entered Jean's apartment, thinking it was her own. When she saw Jean, she said, she thought he was an intruder and shot him in the chest.
The story quickly went viral on national news and the web, partly because of the tantalizing racial angle.
With that, cue the news networks, the pundits, the politicians and the community activists chanting, "No Justice, No peace!" Put Jean's name alongside Laquan McDonald of Chicago; Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina; Freddie Gray in Baltimore; Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; and other black men who have died in questionable encounters with police.
But this case also was tougher than those others. There was no controversy connected to Botham's name before his death. He hadn't been stopped by police on the street or driving his car. He was quietly eating ice cream in his own home.
Yet, successful prosecutions of police officers are rare, civil libertarians and police brutality specialists say. Guyger's tearful remorse also made her an exceptionally sympathetic figure, perhaps too sympathetic, many reasoned, for the jury to find her guilty of murder instead of, say, knocking the charge down to manslaughter.
Jurors also were allowed to consider her Castle Doctrine defense, which allows homeowners in some states, including Texas, to stand their ground and shoot intruders -- even though in this case the "castle" turned out to be somebody else's home.
She didn't get off that easy, although it could have been worse. Guyger was sentenced to 10 years, eligible for parole after five.
The average sentence for an on-duty officer convicted of murder is about 12 years, Philip Stinson, a legal expert on police shootings, told The Dallas Morning News. Stinson, a professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, said that although Guyger was off duty at the time of Jean's shooting, her sentence was similar to those handed down for officers convicted of murders committed while on duty.
But the drama of Guyger's sentencing was almost upstaged by a surprising display of compassion for her by Brandt Jean, Botham's 18-year-old brother.
"I think giving your life to Christ would be the best thing that Botham would want for you," he said, addressing his victim impact statement toward her. "I love you as a person, and I don't wish anything bad on you."
He told Guyger that he didn't even want her to go to prison. Then he asked for permission to give her a hug. Guyger responded by rushing across the courtroom to join him in a big long hug.
Then the judge, Tammy Kemp who also is African American, also gave her a hug and a Bible.
The poignant scene coming across national television and computer screens reminded me of the survivors and victims' families of the mass shooting by a white supremacist at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine and wounding three others in 2015.
Such expressions of forgiveness after the Charleston shooting and in Dallas received a mixed response from black community leaders and citizens. "What white people are really asking for when they demand forgiveness from a traumatized community is absolution," wrote Roxane Gay in The New York Times about why she could not forgive Dylann Roof, the Charleston killer.
"They want absolution from the racism that infects us all even though forgiveness cannot reconcile America's racist sins. They want absolution from their silence in the face of all manner of racism, great and small," she wrote. "I, for one, am done forgiving."
She's not alone. I do not easily forgive killers such as Guyger or Roof, either, unless they show that they understand the errors of their ways and are willing and ready to change themselves for the better. Guyger, at least, appears ready, but first she must serve her sentence. Forgiveness can help us all to find peace. But there must also be justice.

Texto completo: I recommend a petnup.
"I have some good news," my divorce lawyer told me during our second consultation in her downtown Durham, N.C., office. Before divulging it, she asked a question: "Are you willing to pay $ 16,000 for Zoe?"
In our first meeting I'd explained to the lawyer, Milan Pham, that I didn't really care about our "stuff." "North Carolina state law is clear," she told me. "Community property -- property acquired during the marriage -- is to be divided equally." Anything Jim and I had owned separately before the marriage was still his and his.
But Zoe was not "stuff."
She wasn't a daughter, either. Zoe was a Jack Russell terrier, then 14 years old, who had entered my life with Jim. "Pets are treated exactly like televisions, furniture and cars," Ms. Pham explained, meaning that Zoe belonged to Jim like any of the other assets he had brought into the marriage. (We'd been married for four years, together for 13 in total.) No matter that we'd shared the cost of her upkeep during the course of our marriage -- regular vet visits, organic food and treats (including her daily broccoli fix), the groomer, dog walkers, even a canine psychiatrist -- legally, Zoe was Jim's.
I'd asked for joint custody.
Dividing our community property had been relatively straightforward. I got the leather bench from Design Within Reach; Jim took the Cuisinart coffee maker, burr grinder included. He took the barbecue; I got the TV. I didn't get the Tiffany cobalt vase I'd hoped for (a gift from our matchmaker), which I mostly wanted because it anchored my blue glass collection). Jim seemed happy enough to let me have the rest of our wedding presents, as well as every gift I'd ever given him, including a photo book titled, "I, Jack Russell." But not Zoe.
The impasse was rich in irony, since Zoe and Max (the goofy cocker spaniel I had brought into our relationship) had been the greatest challenge to us as a couple. We were a blended family that was not mixing well. Early in our relationship Zoe badly bit Max, tearing his flesh and requiring an emergency trip to the vet. I told Jim: "A dog that bites once will bite again. We have to get rid of her." Understandably, that didn't sit well with him. I had some skin in this game, too, since she drew blood from me as well. (Once, I was pretty sure I'd lost a nipple. Luckily, I was wrong.) When we started couples therapy, our dogs were Topic A. And it wasn't long before we took both dogs to a canine "shrink" with a doctorate who -- unsuccessfully -- tried to repair both two-legged and four-legged relationships.
It seemed no amount of love could help Zoe overcome her nature. But over the years, especially after Max died, I grew to accept her, character flaws and all. We worked it out in ways that Jim and I could not. I came to appreciate how she would wake up happy every day, ready to greet the world with her prancing walk. I came to see how cataracts near-blinded her and incontinence shamed her. How could I not love her? How could I just write her off like the blue vase?
I had asked Jim for joint custody for two reasons. I'd grown deeply attached to Zoe. But I also hoped that the sharing of responsibilities would help us find a way to stay in each other's lives. Perhaps Zoe, who had brought us so much marital discord, would provide an enduring tie.
Jim's answer was "no." He made clear to me that he understood the law, emailing, "My lawyer did advise me that Zoe is considered personal property and as such it is my decision to make about her future." Then, to make sure I understood, he added, "You can't always have what you want."
What about what Zoe wanted? The law does not care. In dividing marital property, judges don't consider where your TV wants to live, and they've been similarly unsentimental about what might be in the best interests of "companion animals."
Until recently, that is. Three states -- Illinois, Alaska and, effective this year, California -- have amended their family code to treat pets differently from other types of marital assets.
"There is nothing in statute directing judges to treat a pet differently from any other type of property we own," a California assemblyman, Bill Quirk, noted in 2018 while advocating the change in law. "However, as a proud parent of a rescued dog, I know that owners view their pets as more than just property. They are part of our family, and their care needs to be a consideration during divorce proceedings." Thanks to Mr. Quirk, since January, California judges have been permitted to consider the well-being of the animal, as well as who provided its care, in working out custody agreements.
Which is how I came to be sitting in my lawyer's office that day, entertaining the idea of paying $ 16,000 for joint custody. Ms. Pham said "North Carolina may not be far behind" regarding the pets-as-property dispute. In the meantime, though, her legal team had examined other state laws and come up with a dollar amount to try to induce Jim to share custody. "It will certainly get Jim's attention," she said. "Indeed, it would," I thought.
To me Zoe was priceless, but even so, $ 16,000 seemed excessive for an 11-pound geriatric terror ( $ 1,455 a pound!). Heartbroken, I signed the separation agreement that listed Zoe between "electric salt and pepper shaker" and "red bowl" on the inventory of Jim's property. Then she was gone, living with Jim in a new town 65 miles away.
A few weeks later came another email from Jim: "I am not suggesting I want to do this, but would you be interested in Zoe full time?" Without missing a beat, I replied, "yes," which led him to disclose that his new townhouse wasn't dog-friendly. Although our legal agreement was signed and recorded, I took full custody of Zoe. I understood the implications of my "win" when Jim wrote again, declaring that he wouldn't pay for any of Zoe's care "because I won't ever see her again." Or me, as it's turned out so far.
I consider myself lucky to spend my days with Zoe now. After years of caring for my parents, who both died within months of my and Jim's legal separation, I needed that little "terrier-ist" more than ever. Smiling more than snarling, and now two weeks shy of 17, she plays a daily game of "kill the squirrel," where she chases those show-off rodents in the front yard with every expectation of capture. So far, the squirrels are winning. Zoe and I are victorious in our own way -- we got what was best for us, no $ 16,000 payment required.
Not long ago I spoke with Cristina Stella, a lawyer with the Animal Legal Defense Fund. In my divorce I'd belatedly learned the importance of having a prenup, which Jim and I had skipped. "I don't know if you've ever heard the term 'petnup'," Ms. Stella said, "but it's the best way to avoid custody disputes when the relationship dissolves." Options include sole custody, joint custody and even pet support (like child support).
Divorce is not for the faint of heart, whether human or canine. I now know how to protect my rights and any four-legged "stuff," should I marry again. How to protect my heart -- well, that's another matter.

Free Speech Is Killing Us

Texto completo: There has never been a bright line between word and deed. Yet for years, the founders of Facebook and Twitter and 4chan and Reddit -- along with the consumers obsessed with these products, and the investors who stood to profit from them -- tried to pretend that the noxious speech prevalent on those platforms wouldn't metastasize into physical violence. In the early years of this decade, back when people associated social media with Barack Obama or the Arab Spring, Twitter executives referred to their company as "the free-speech wing of the free-speech party." Sticks and stones and assault rifles could hurt us, but the internet was surely only a force for progress.
No one believes that anymore. Not after the social-media-fueled campaigns of Narendra Modi and Rodrigo Duterte and Donald Trump; not after the murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Va.; not after the massacres in a synagogue in Pittsburgh, two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, and a Walmart in a majority-Hispanic part of El Paso. The Christchurch gunman, like so many of his ilk, had spent years on social media trying to advance the cause of white power. But these posts, he eventually decided, were not enough; now it was "time to make a real life effort post." He murdered 52 people.
Having spent the past few years embedding as a reporter with the trolls and bigots and propagandists who are experts at converting fanatical memes into national policy, I no longer have any doubt that the brutality that germinates on the internet can leap into the world of flesh and blood.
The question is where this leaves us. Noxious speech is causing tangible harm. Yet this fact implies a question so uncomfortable that many of us go to great lengths to avoid asking it. Namely, what should we -- the government, private companies or individual citizens -- be doing about it?
Nothing. Or at least that's the answer one often hears from liberals and conservatives alike. Some speech might be bad, this line of thinking goes, but censorship is always worse. The First Amendment is first for a reason.
After one of the 8chan-inspired massacres -- I can't even remember which one, if I'm being honest -- I struck up a conversation with a stranger at a coffee shop. We talked about how bewildering it was to be alive at a time when viral ideas can slide so precipitously into terror. Then I wondered what steps should be taken. Immediately, our conversation ran aground. "No steps," he said. "What exactly do you have in mind? Thought police?" He told me that he was a leftist, but he considered his opinion about free speech to be a matter of settled bipartisan consensus.
I imagined the same conversation, remixed slightly. What if, instead of talking about memes, we'd been talking about guns? What if I'd invoked the ubiquity of combat weapons in civilian life and the absence of background checks, and he'd responded with a shrug? Nothing to be done. Ever heard of the Second Amendment?
Using "free speech" as a cop-out is just as intellectually dishonest and just as morally bankrupt. For one thing, the First Amendment doesn't apply to private companies. Even the most creative reader of the Constitution will not find a provision guaranteeing Richard Spencer a Twitter account. But even if you see social media platforms as something more akin to a public utility, not all speech is protected under the First Amendment anyway. Libel, incitement of violence and child pornography are all forms of speech. Yet we censor all of them, and no one calls it the death knell of the Enlightenment.
Free speech is a bedrock value in this country. But it isn't the only one. Like all values, it must be held in tension with others, such as equality, safety and robust democratic participation. Speech should be protected, all things being equal. But what about speech that's designed to drive a woman out of her workplace or to bully a teenager into suicide or to drive a democracy toward totalitarianism? Navigating these trade-offs is thorny, as trade-offs among core principles always are. But that doesn't mean we can avoid navigating them at all.
In 1993 and 1994, talk-radio hosts in Rwanda calling for bloodshed helped create the atmosphere that led to genocide. The Clinton administration could have jammed the radio signals and taken those broadcasts off the air, but Pentagon lawyers decided against it, citing free speech. It's true that the propagandists' speech would have been curtailed. It's also possible that a genocide would have been averted.
I am not calling for repealing the First Amendment, or even for banning speech I find offensive on private platforms. What I'm arguing against is paralysis. We can protect unpopular speech from government interference while also admitting that unchecked speech can expose us to real risks. And we can take steps to mitigate those risks.
The Constitution prevents the government from using sticks, but it says nothing about carrots.
Congress could fund, for example, a national campaign to promote news literacy, or it could invest heavily in library programming. It could build a robust public media in the mold of the BBC. It could rethink Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act -- the rule that essentially allows Facebook and YouTube to get away with (glorification of) murder. If Congress wanted to get really ambitious, it could fund a rival to compete with Facebook or Google, the way the Postal Service competes with FedEx and U.P.S.
Or the private sector could pitch in on its own. Tomorrow, by fiat, Mark Zuckerberg could make Facebook slightly less profitable and enormously less immoral: He could hire thousands more content moderators and pay them fairly. Or he could replace Sheryl Sandberg with Susan Benesch, a human rights lawyer and an expert on how speech can lead to violence. Social media companies have shown how quickly they can act when under pressure. After every high-profile eruption of violence -- Charlottesville, Christchurch and the like -- tech companies have scrambled to ban inflammatory accounts, take down graphic videos, even rewrite their terms of service. Some of the most egregious actors, such as Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, have been permanently barred from all major platforms.
"We need to protect the rights of speakers," John A. Powell, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me, "but what about protecting everyone else?" Mr. Powell was the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and he represented the Ku Klux Klan in federal court. "Racists should have rights," he explained. "I also know, being black and having black relatives, what it means to have a cross burned on your lawn. It makes no sense for the law to be concerned about one and ignore the other."
Mr. Powell, in other words, is a free-speech advocate but not a free-speech absolutist. Shortly before his tenure as legal director, he said, "when women complained about sexual harassment in the workplace, the A.C.L.U.'s response would be, 'Sorry, nothing we can do. Harassment is speech.' That looks ridiculous to us now, as it should." He thinks that some aspects of our current First Amendment jurisprudence -- blanket protections of hate speech, for example -- will also seem ridiculous in retrospect. "It's simpler to think only about the First Amendment and to ignore, say, the 14th Amendment, which guarantees full citizenship and equal protection to all Americans, including those who are harmed by hate speech," he said. "It's simpler, but it's also wrong."
I should confess: I used to agree with the guy I met in the coffee shop, the one who saw the First Amendment as an all-or-nothing dictate. This allowed me to reach conclusions with swift, simple authority. It also allowed me to ignore a lot, to pretend that anything that was invisible to me either wasn't happening or didn't matter.
In one of our conversations, Mr. Powell compared harmful speech to carbon pollution: People are allowed to drive cars. But the government can regulate greenhouse emissions, the private sector can transition to renewable energy sources, civic groups can promote public transportation and cities can build sea walls to prepare for rising ocean levels. We could choose to reduce all of that to a simple dictate: Everyone should be allowed to drive a car, and that's that. But doing so wouldn't stop the waters from rising around us.

Texto completo: Today is Saturday,
Oct. 5, the 278th day of 2019. There are 87 days left in the year.
On this date
In 1947, President Harry S. Truman delivered the first televised White House address as he spoke on the world food crisis.
In 1953, Earl Warren was sworn in as the 14th chief justice of the United States, succeeding Fred M. Vinson.
In 1983, Solidarity founder Lech Walesa was named winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
In 1984, the space shuttle Challenger blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center on an 8-day mission; the crew included Kathryn D. Sullivan, who became the first American woman to walk in space.
In 1989, a jury in Charlotte, N.C., convicted former televangelist Jim Bakker of using his television show to defraud followers.
In 1999, two packed commuter trains collided near London's Paddington Station, killing 31 people.
In 2001, tabloid photo editor Robert Stevens died from inhaled anthrax, the first of a series of anthrax cases in Florida, New York, New Jersey and Washington.
In 2005, defying the White House, senators voted 90-9 to approve an amendment sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that would prohibit the use of "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" against anyone in U.S. government custody. (A reluctant President George W. Bush later signed off on the amendment.)
In 2011, Apple founder Steve Jobs, 56, died in Palo Alto, California.
In 2017, Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein announced that he was taking a leave of absence from his company after a New York Times article detailed decades of alleged sexual harassment against women including actress Ashley Judd.
Ten years ago: President Barack Obama filled the Rose Garden with doctors supportive of his health care overhaul, saying "nobody has more credibility with the American people on this issue than you do." Americans Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak won the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine. A suicide bomber blew himself up in the lobby of the U.N. food agency in Islamabad, killing five staffers.
Five years ago: A suicide bomber blew himself up in Grozny, killing five policemen and wounding 12 others as the Chechen capital celebrated the birthday of its pro-Russian leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. Geoffrey Holder, a Tony Award-winning director, actor, painter, dancer and choreographer, died in New York at age 84.
One year ago: Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia announced that they would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, all but assuring that Kavanaugh would be confirmed. A jury in Chicago convicted white police officer Jason Van Dyke of second-degree murder in the 2014 shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald. The government reported that the unemployment rate fell in September to 3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969, reflecting a healthy economy driven by strong consumer and business spending. In an elaborate prank orchestrated by the street artist Banksy, one of the artist's paintings self-destructed in front of auction-goers in London, moments after it had been sold for $1.4 million.

FAITH MATTERS: A culture of life

Texto completo: Not too long ago, a front-page story in the New York Times carried the caption: “The world we live in now is one in which no place is safe, no lives really matter, when it comes to violence” (Sept. 2, 2019). This statement was prompted by the fact that this year, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, there had been twenty-six mass shootings in the United States. And to this we must add the rash of suicides, especially among the young. As I write this, another headline reads, “Three Suicides on One [Navy] Ship Point to a Growing Problem” (NYT, Sept. 25, 2019).
Watching the news and reading the headlines, we may feel helpless at the frightening and heartbreaking loss of human life.
We have not been without prophets. In 1995, Pope Saint John Paul wrote his encyclical letter Evangelium Vitae on the dramatic struggle between what he called the “culture of life” and the “culture of death.” He urged the world to uphold the sacred value and inviolability of human life rather than giving way to a culture of manipulation and choice in life matters, as evidenced in abortion, euthanasia, biological engineering, ecological destruction and unnecessary recourse to the death penalty. Violating the right to life, the Pope said, would only result in the destruction of values that are fundamental not only for the preservation of the lives of individuals and families, but of society, as well.
If the value of human life and society’s obligation to uphold and preserve it are relativized, then we should not be surprised at what we are experiencing today. I believe that the challenge in our present national tragedy is to rebuild a culture of respect for life from conception until natural death. In the Catholic Church, every October is designated “Respect Life Month.”
How do we accomplish this? Resisting a “culture of death” begins with our own change of heart. When we encounter God and experience His love, we become more aware of our own God-given dignity and value as creatures made in the divine “image and likeness.” We become more respectful of our neighbor’s life and dignity, as well. And when someone is facing great trials, we will want, in the words of Pope Francis, to “accompany” them with understanding, compassion, prayer and love.
Writing in the New York Times in 1995, Paul Baumann had this to say about Pope St. John Paul’s Gospel of Life: “(H)is moral certitude spooks the baptized and unbaptized alike, for it seems to deny the moral ambiguity that is inherent in a pluralistic society, the conflicting ideas of right and wrong that come from so many voices.”
With the passing of years since 1995 it must be asked: are we being “spooked” today by moral certitude, or rather by the disrespect for life that results from a lack of moral certitude about life’s sacred value and inviolability?

Democratic donor and accused killer Ed Buck finally arrested: John Phillips

Texto completo: The state of California is home to some of the most infamous serial killers in U.S. history — from the Manson Family, to the Freeway Killers, all the way to the Grim Sleeper.
Well, another accused killer is now awaiting trial in California. This time it’s prolific Democratic donor and West Hollywood resident Ed Buck.
Buck was finally arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies and charged with operating a drug house, as well as providing methamphetamine to a 37 year-old man who suffered an overdose at Buck’s apartment.
This incident was the third known time a man suffered a meth overdose at Buck’s home. The previous two alleged victims, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, did not survive.
Days later, the feds announced that they too would be prosecuting Buck — this time on one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.
At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said investigators found 10 more victims, nine of whom said Buck, “administered drugs to them or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.”
The case is now generating national and international headlines; and I’m noticing that three false storylines seem to be emerging, and they need to be corrected.
First, The New York Times tried to minimize Buck’s power and influence by referring to him as “a small-time Democratic donor and political activist.”
That’s like calling Harvey Weinstein a “love-sick teenager.”
According to federal records, Buck has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and groups, and was classified by the California Secretary of State’s office as being a “major donor.”
Before he was nicknamed ‘Dr. Kevorkian’ by his West Hollywood neighbors, Buck could have easily gone by Ed ‘Big Bucks’ with all of the campaign cash he was throwing around.
Second, it has been reported in multiple publications that the politicians and political action committees who took contributions from Buck acted quickly to distance themselves from him.
Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Why does everyone want to write a book?

Texto completo: Writers’ workshops are popping up everywhere.
Some, like Inlandia Institute’s workshops around the Inland Empire, are free, sponsored by Inlandia’s donors and philanthropic organizations. Others are hosted by celebrity authors or internet bloggers, such as Elizabeth Gilbert, Joyce Maynard and Dani Shapiro. A recent New York Times Style section reported on the proliferation of celebrity-run workshops that cost hundreds — even thousands — of dollars and take place in venues as disparate as New York City and San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.
Why are these workshops — free or expensive — finding so many takers? It’s quite possible that rubbing elbows with celebrities motivates some who pay up for Maynard’s or Shapiro’s sessions. But it’s certainly not why about 120 people have come to my free or low-cost Inlandia workshops over the past three years.
For them, I believe the motivation comes from a need to tell stories.
In my memoir-writing workshops, I sense an urgency to be heard, read and remembered by their children and grandchildren. Since most of my participants are at least as old as I am (mid-60s), I understand the urgency: There’s no time like the present. In fact, we may have no time other than the present.
But even my fiction-writing participants feel compelled to tell stories. Their ages spread across generations — currently, my workshop at the Palm Springs Public Library comprises 14 writers, ages 25 to 91. I believe my 91 year old will live well past 100, given his health and energy, and my 25 year old is certainly not contemplating an imminent demise. That’s not the source of their urgency.
Some people suggest people hope to make money writing now that real jobs (not gigs) are harder to find. If that were the case, they would be quickly disabused of that fantasy. The average full-time novelist makes somewhere around $6,000 a year — not a living wage.
Authors, essayists and academics have written books about humans as “storytelling animals.” They argue that we teach by telling stories, we make excuses for ourselves by telling stories and we grab the limelight by telling stories. We learn by hearing stories, and we empathize by listening to stories. Stories are the means by which we entertain ourselves, share our humanity, make friends and construct arguments.
So, why this sudden rush to write them down?
I believe the urgency to write isn’t about money or time, it’s about a pent-up supply of stories to tell. My husband and I once lived in a tree-lined neighborhood in Denver, in a house with a fine front porch that comfortably accommodated us and our two dogs plus a couple of neighbors or passersby. Nearly every night when the weather was amenable, we sat out there with a beer or a glass of wine, and talked with friends and complete strangers. I doubt that we were aware of it at the time, but as I look back, I realize this was our story-telling hour. We told stories about our days and about our lives, and we listened to stories. It was an essential part of our day, and when the weather turned bad, our cabin-fever was at least in part a result of the isolation that the snow, ice and cold caused and the hiatus in our story-telling hour.
We no longer have such a front porch, and neither do most Americans. And those who do may sit out on the step for days without anyone wandering by or coming out of the house across the street. Most of us are inside watching “Game of Thrones,” playing video games or Googling. While all of those activities are about story, as well, most of us are passive, not active participants in the telling. We’re not asked to tell a story — we’re just asked to listen. Our extended families are spread across the country — if not the globe — as well. We see them rarely, and most of our communications are via Facebook or Instagram, neither of which lend themselves to in-depth story telling.
In some towns, including Palm Springs where I live, community organizations have initiated storytelling events where people are coached and encouraged to stand up and tell stories to a receptive audience of their peers. But clearly, these programs can’t soak up all of the desire to tell stories, and hence, writers’ workshops proliferate.
Perhaps some of the current popularity of writing workshops has to do with self-publishing — now made easy by the likes of Kindle Direct Publishing, Ingram Spark and Lulu. Anyone can write a story and make a book these days; we don’t have to wait for a big publishing house in New York or London to grant us permission. And Joe Moran, author of the recently published book “First You Write a Sentence,” suggests that computers and printers produce pretty pages, which encourages everyone — regardless of the quality of the sentences — to think they’re a bona fide “writer.”
But, I believe this rush to write stories has more to do with our technology-inspired isolation than technology-inspired hubris. We want to tell each other stories, and we want our stories to be heard.

Texto completo: The state of California is home to some of the most infamous serial killers in U.S. history — from the Manson Family, to the Freeway Killers, all the way to the Grim Sleeper.
Well, another accused killer is now awaiting trial in California. This time it’s prolific Democratic donor and West Hollywood resident Ed Buck.
Buck was finally arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies and charged with operating a drug house, as well as providing methamphetamine to a 37 year-old man who suffered an overdose at Buck’s apartment.
This incident was the third known time a man suffered a meth overdose at Buck’s home. The previous two alleged victims, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, did not survive.
Days later, the feds announced that they too would be prosecuting Buck — this time on one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.
At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said investigators found 10 more victims, nine of whom said Buck, “administered drugs to them or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.”
The case is now generating national and international headlines; and I’m noticing that three false storylines seem to be emerging, and they need to be corrected.
First, The New York Times tried to minimize Buck’s power and influence by referring to him as “a small-time Democratic donor and political activist.”
That’s like calling Harvey Weinstein a “love-sick teenager.”
According to federal records, Buck has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and groups, and was classified by the California Secretary of State’s office as being a “major donor.”
Before he was nicknamed ‘Dr. Kevorkian’ by his West Hollywood neighbors, Buck could have easily gone by Ed ‘Big Bucks’ with all of the campaign cash he was throwing around.
Second, it has been reported in multiple publications that the politicians and political action committees who took contributions from Buck acted quickly to distance themselves from him.
Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Marc Thiessen: Media trying to absolve Bidens of wrongdoing

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Let’s be clear: President Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not “beautiful” or “perfect.” Far from it. Trump should not have asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden or to cooperate with his private attorney Rudolph Giuliani’s investigation of the former vice president’s son. Since Trump made no promises or threats in the call, it is a stretch to claim his conduct rises to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” But it was highly inappropriate.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
However, it does not follow that Trump’s malfeasance absolves Joe Biden and his son of their malfeasance. Two things can be true at the same time: that Trump did something wrong, and that Joe and Hunter Biden did something wrong as well. This seems to be lost on many in the media, who are bending over backward to absolve the Bidens of wrongdoing.
For example, many in the media state as fact that Biden’s actions in encouraging the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin had nothing to do with his investigation of the natural gas company, Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden as a board member. His firing was justified, they say, because the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund and other U.S. allies were demanding he be fired as well. Furthermore, as CNN’s Jake Tapper insisted this weekend, “according to the Ukrainians that investigation [into Burisma] was dormant at the time.”
First, the phrase “dormant” means, by definition, that an investigation into Burisma existed and was not closed. Second, we don’t know for certain that the Burisma investigation was, in fact, “dormant.” Shokin has sworn in an affidavit it was not. His successor says it was. Who is lying? Nobody knows for sure. Journalists don’t get to choose which version they prefer and report it as fact.
But here is what is incontestably true: Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. His son took a position with a Ukrainian natural gas company, despite having no experience in Ukraine or natural gas, the very same month the elder Biden visited Kiev and urged Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. As Yoshiko Herrera, an expert in Russia and Eurasia policy at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, put it, “conflict-of-interest rules should have applied.”
The latest spin is that there is nothing to see here because, as Reuters reports, the investigation of Burisma “focused solely on activity that took place before Hunter Biden, son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, was hired to sit on its board.” Did it occur to anyone that maybe that is precisely why Burisma hired the American vice president’s son? According to The New York Times, Biden’s hiring “allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans.” As Robert Weissman, president of the progressive watchdog Public Citizen, has said, “It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter’s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter’s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him.” The revelation that Hunter Biden accepted a job with a Ukrainian company that was under investigation while his father was taking the lead in fighting corruption in Ukraine is damning, not exculpatory.
Biden knew about his son’s involvement with Burisma, because the New Yorker has reported that in December 2015 Obama energy czar Amos Hochstein “raised the matter with Biden.” We also know, via The New York Times, that “some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine could complicate his father’s diplomacy there.” No doubt, there is a paper trail at the State Department to that effect.
The Code of Federal Regulations (§2635.502) clearly states that when a federal official takes action he knows will affect “a relative with whom the employee has a close personal relationship” and “the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter.” In other words, Joe Biden should not have taken the lead on Ukraine policy while Hunter Biden was working for Burisma. And even if Shokin deserved to be fired, Biden had no business being the one to deliver the ultimatum.
Hunter Biden’s business dealings, in Ukraine and elsewhere, are crying out for investigation. That does not mean it was appropriate for Trump to raise them with the Ukrainian president. But the fact that Trump did so does not give the media carte blanche to make excuses for the Biden family.

GOP moves event after fear of protests

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
GRANTHAM — The Sullivan County Republican Committee on Thursday moved a fundraiser featuring a speaker with controversial views on Islam to Claremont after Grantham police and the owners of the initial venue worried that possible protests could create a public safety concern.
The Eastman Community Association on Wednesday evening sent an email to members telling them that it had canceled the Friday night GOP fundraiser with Robert Spencer, an author and director of the Jihad Watch blog that had been planned for an event space next to its restaurant at the Center at Eastman.
“We respect Mr. Spencer’s right to share his views and the rights of those who were planning to come to protest his remarks,” the Eastman email said. “However, in the interest of public safety we have no choice but to cancel Friday’s event.”
Board members had spoken earlier in the day with Grantham Police Chief John Parsons, and both Eastman officials and Parsons said they were concerned that there was not enough time to make public safety plans for the GOP event, a likely sold-out performance at the restaurant by singer Jason Cann, and possible protests. Although Eastman is a private community, its center is open to public events and members of the public would be allowed to protest outside.
Parsons said that the center is at the end of a road that has “limited access,” and that he only learned of the event on Wednesday morning, making preparing and staffing for any type of emergency response, including a fire, impractical.
“It was a lot to try to bring together in a very, very short period of time,” Parsons said.
And Bill Matson, the president of the Eastman board of directors, also said the cancelation by the board was not over Spencer’s message.
“We don’t know who might show up. That’s part of the problem,” Matson said. “What we did know for sure is with 48 hours before the event was to take place, we didn’t have time to do the contingency planning to ensure that anybody who shows up could exercise their First Amendment rights safely,” Matson said.
But Sullivan County GOP Chairman Keith Hanson, a conservative radio talk-show host who himself lives in Grantham, said Eastman officials had capitulated “to the whims of an offended, vocal minority” who don’t like Spencer’s message.
“We are proud to be the political party that embraces the concept of ‘freedom of speech,’ and all of the God-given rights entitled to us all as recognized by the Constitution of the United States,” Hanson said in a statement, calling the invitation to Spencer an “opportunity for many to hear a fact-based opinion they may not understand, share, or accept.”
In a phone interview, he said Spencer was a “subject matter expert” who has worked with federal agencies, including the FBI and the military.
“The bottom line is fundamentalist Islam, sharia law, advocates for subjecting women and treating them at best as second-class citizens, and at worst equivalent to commodities and chattel, condones state-sponsored torture and execution of members of the LGBT community, and advocates and condones pedophilia and child marriage, wherein 8- and 9-year-old girls are forcibly married to 50-year-old men, routinely,” Hanson said.
Spencer earlier in the day had objected to a Valley News political column which had noted that the Southern Poverty Law Center labels him as “one of the most prolific anti-Muslim figures in the United States” and said in an email, “All my work is dedicated to defending the freedom of speech and the equality of rights of all people before the law. Do you really think that constitutes ‘vilifying and maligning Muslims’?”
But Asma Elhuni, the lead organizer of the United Valley Interfaith Project, pointed out that the right-wing Norwegian extremist Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb attack and shooting spree, appeared to be influenced by Spencer. Breivik quoted Spencer 64 times in his manifesto, according to the New York Times.
“I don’t know any Muslim who doesn’t know Robert Spencer,” said Elhuni.
“This man is extremely dangerous,” she added later.
She said Spencer’s work is particularly troubling because he paints Muslims with one brush, labeling the entire religion and not just extremists as dangerous. His characterization of sharia, or Islamic law, is particularly ignorant and uses a single hard-line interpretation to scare people, Elhuni said.
“There’s no one sharia for the Muslim world,” she said. “My sharia teaches me that I should make sure my neighbors don’t go hungry. My sharia teaches me to take care of the poor and orphaned.”
The Sullivan County Republican fundraiser Friday evening has been moved to the Elks Lodge on Summer Street.
Hanson said he was in touch with Claremont police about security.

Hondurans Are Hardly Shocked by Claim of $1 Million Bribe From El Chapo

Texto completo: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras -- The allegation in the Manhattan courtroom was stunning. United States prosecutors said that one of the world's most notorious drug traffickers had given $ 1 million to the brother of the president of Honduras, money meant for the president himself.
But on Thursday, Hondurans tempered their outrage with resignation at the news emerging from the cocaine-trafficking trial of Juan Antonio Hernández, the younger brother of President Juan Orlando Hernández.
On the first day of the trial on Wednesday, prosecutors said that the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo had delivered $ 1 million to the president's brother with the intention that the money would be funneled on to the country's leader.
The news that American prosecutors say their president is complicit in drug trafficking only confirmed what many Hondurans already believed about their political leaders.
Indeed, many say they gave up long ago, despairing that Honduras will never address the chronic corruption, violence and criminality that has a chokehold on their country.
As a result of this pessimism, thousands leave their country every month -- many headed to the United States -- after losing hope for a good future for themselves and their families.
So the drug-trafficking trial of Juan Antonio Hernández, known as Tony, has only strengthened the belief of many that their government is venal and does not have their interests in mind.
"I think that a lot of information is coming out that almost the whole country knew already," said Gracia María Avendaño Paz, 45, a lawyer. "We live in a narcostate."
In a tweet after the allegation was made, the president denied receiving any money and called the allegations "false, absurd and ridiculous."
But to many Hondurans, hearing and absorbing the news for the first time on Thursday, the allegations rang true, even though prosecutors have yet to present evidence.
"How didn't he know what his brother was doing?" said Francisco Antonio Velásquez, 33, a hotel employee in Tegucigalpa, the capital, of the president. "This tars him, it does. In my opinion, he has touched the narcos' dirty money." The president, too, should be prosecuted, Mr. Velásquez said.
The trial started just days after President Trump reached a deal with the Honduran president that will make it more difficult for asylum seekers to reach the United States. This has given many Hondurans the impression that the United States is more concerned with stopping migration than with drug trafficking.
President Hernández has been the country's dominant political figure over much of the past decade: first, as president of Congress, and since 2014, as the country's leader.
He has denied any involvement in drug trafficking, arguing that the allegations are the invention of convicted drug traffickers angered by his tough anti-crime policies. In Congress he pushed for a law that allowed Honduras to extradite accused drug traffickers to the United States and, as president, he began to send them north to stand trial.
On Thursday, the president told reporters at a news conference that more "novelistic stories" about him were likely to emerge at his brother's New York trial as part of an effort by drug traffickers to attack him.
Raúl Pineda, a former legislator from President Hernández's National Party, said that the allegations against the president put him in a "highly uncomfortable" situation, but he is still very much in control of the country.
"National public opinion is quite unfavorable," Mr. Pineda said. "But it won't have an effect because of his control over the attorney general, the judiciary, the armed forces and most of the media."
"The fear of reprisal leads to a kind of silent acceptance," he added.
The one hope that many Hondurans have, Mr. Pineda said, is that pressure from outside the country will force some kind of change -- perhaps evidence from the trial will prompt a serious investigation inside Honduras of the president's actions. "His control is strong but it is not absolute," Mr. Pineda said.
Long before the arrest last November of his brother, who is accused of trafficking cocaine through Honduras for at least 12 years, President Hernández saw popular opinion in Honduras turning against him.
A surge of unaccompanied children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala who fled to the United States in 2014 snapped attention to conditions in the region, where gang violence produced the highest murder rates in the world.
The following year, demonstrators poured into the streets to protest Honduras's rampant corruption, forcing President Hernández to accept a panel of international prosecutors to investigate graft. That group, working with the prosecutor's office, has begun to reveal how politicians pocket public funds, confirming Hondurans' long-held suspicions about why money destined to build schools, clinics and roads never reaches them.
More than 60 percent of Hondurans lived in poverty in 2018 according to the World Bank. In rural areas, one in five people live on less than $ 1.90 a day.
Remittances from Hondurans working abroad account for about 20 percent of the country's economy.
In 2017, President Hernández won re-election after a disputed vote count. A United Nations investigation determined that 23 people died in the ensuing protests, at least 16 of them at the hands of security forces.
"There is not one single area where you can say the country is doing well," said Dr. Suyapa Figueroa, the president of the Honduran medical association, who said she has watched health services decline over the past 10 years.
Budgets for health and education have dropped as a proportion of overall spending, said Ismael Zepeda, an economist with Fosdeh, a Tegucigalpa research institution.
In 2010, the health budget accounted for some 12 or 13 percent of the whole government budget, he said. Next year, it will be 6 percent.
The trial is a far-off concern, though, in the rural villages where people live hand-to-mouth, and it is the government's neglect that stings most.
In the municipality of Cedros, about 50 miles outside the capital, the signs of abandonment by the state are everywhere -- in the dry fields, the pitted dirt roads and the rudimentary schools.
A local resident, Wilmer Valdez said he has twice tried to reach the United States, and twice he was sent back. But with a new baby to support, he may try again.
"You look for a future because here there is only enough to get by from day to day -- nothing more," Mr. Valdez said.

Texto completo: "Amazon is building the infrastructure to monitor us all," a privacy advocate says.
We're in the middle of a digital privacy reckoning. Even the tech companies are taking notice. Facebook is reportedly pivoting its social network inward to private groups. Google is tightening privacy restrictions on its Chrome browser and its voice assistants. Apple has started putting privacy front and center in its advertising campaigns. And then there's Amazon, which is, uh, trying to strap the surveillance state to your dog.
Seriously.
Last week in Seattle, the e-commerce giant invited reporters as it rolled out a mind-boggling array of new products. One Zero's Will Oremus aptly described the event as Amazon's quest to become "The Everywhere Store." As far as I can tell, the theme appeared to be: items you might remember from your analog life (ovens, doorbells, rings, lamps, eyeglasses, dog collars) only now with more microphones, sensors and tracking capabilities!
Some of this isn't new. Ever since the runaway success of Amazon's Echo speaker, the company has been trying to stuff its poor voice assistant, Alexa, into as many mundane corners of our life as possible. Last week's event marked the furthest realization of this ambition to date.
But Amazon's vision of the future feels increasingly at odds with the ability to be anonymous in public. One concern, according to the tech activist Liz O'Sullivan is Amazon's new product called Sidewalk, which is a wireless mesh Wi-Fi network that will help link connected devices at long range. On Twitter, O'Sullivan suggested that products like Sidewalk (which is in a testing phase) need only a small fraction of the country to opt in to "to create a network with exhaustive coverage of our neighborhoods and streets." Her takeaway: "Amazon is building the infrastructure to monitor us all."
I reached out to O'Sullivan shortly after her tweets to get a better idea of how this might work. Her fear is that Amazon, through Sidewalk as well as other products, like its Ring doorbell cameras, is quietly creating Wi-Fi beacons everywhere. Each time our products come in contact with these devices, they transmit little bits of data. Mostly, this data isn't highly personal (occasionally, it's randomized), but it's still enough to potentially identify and then track users. Again, this already happens with Wi-Fi routers and mobile phones. The big difference here is that Amazon is looking to own a substantial chunk of the network and the devices. That means having access to a lot of data.
O'Sullivan suggests that the ubiquity of devices means you could be surveilled by Amazon even if you don't own its products. "If you have enough Ring doorbell cameras on your block, it doesn't matter if you bought one or not; you're being monitored and, down the road, perhaps your device is pinging them," she said.
O'Sullivan isn't a Luddite. And she believes that connected cities could alter citizens' lives for the better. Using big data, for example, to provide better ambulance routes could save hundreds of lives. The key, she believes, is regulation. "We need to know they're not going to take this data and sell it to law enforcement or other organizations to do better behavioral targeting," she said. "Our vision of a smart city of the future has nothing do with advertising."
In her Twitter thread, O'Sullivan expressed frustration that the sometimes breathless coverage around Amazon's new devices hardly addresses their potential for surveillance. I asked her if she finds it hard to be a critic of new technology, especially when others find it exciting -- something I've struggled with as a journalist.
"It makes me sad because it's a powerful moment for humanity and tech, and I want to be on the side of, 'hey, this is cool!"' she said. "But the consequences are too great and abuse of data is too prevalent. They've taken consumer drive and turned it into a tool to monitor and influence us."
Before we hung up, I asked her about Amazon's new dog tracking device and jokingly asked whether surveilling our canine friends was a bridge too far. Her answer was sobering.
"I found that product pretty revealing," she said. "Human beings don't need those collars because we're already on a digital tether."
From the Archives: 'Consumer Groups Criticize Amazon's New Privacy Policy'
This week's pick looks at Amazon's privacy policies from the good old days -- the year 2000. Sometimes it's helpful to look at a company's early days -- before it became a behemoth -- to understand its privacy values. From the piece:
Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc., which sells a wide range of products, including books, toys and hardware, posted a revised privacy policy on its website Thursday telling customers the information they give is considered a company asset that can be sold.
The piece quotes the company's old privacy policy and includes a very telling line:
"As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets," the new policy reads. "In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets."
Always helpful to remember that you, the customer, are always a "transferred business asset."

Tip of the Week: Apple's New Privacy Tools
Apple's latest operating system, iOS 13 (which you should download because it's important to update your phone!), has some spiffy new additions that can help protect your privacy. What I like about these features is that they aren't reinventing the wheel but instead taking third-party privacy protections and making them easy for anyone to install.
Once again, my colleagues in the newsroom have a great primer on these iOS 13 tools. Brian X. Chen wrote this guide last week. Here's one snippet on how to use the iOS 13 to create burner email addresses. I highly suggest you read the whole thing.
When you use it to register for a website or app, iOS 13 will present you with an option to hide your email address that is linked to your Apple ID. If you choose to use it, Apple will create what is essentially a burner email address so that you can sign up for the app or website while hiding your real email address from the third party.
Whenever the website or app then tries to contact you, it will email the burner address and not your real email address. Apple will forward the note to you so you are aware of it. Then if a business starts sending spam to the burner email address, you can easily delete your account and the business won't have your real email address.
What I'm Reading:

Texto completo: ORLANDO, Fla. -- President Trump on Thursday delivered a campaign-style speech to an audience of elderly voters, pitching a new executive order that aims to improve private Medicare plans as the responsible alternative to the "Medicare for all" policies supported by some of his Democratic political opponents.
"Standing in solidarity with our nation's seniors, I declare once again that America will never be a socialist country," Mr. Trump told a crowd at the Villages in Florida, the country's largest retirement community, where the population is overwhelmingly white and conservative and where many residents are veterans.
"Democrat health care proposals would put everyone into a single socialist government program" and end private insurance for all Americans, Mr. Trump told the supportive crowd.
While the Medicare for All Act proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont would indeed cover all Americans under a single national health insurance program, most of the other Democratic presidential candidates want to give people the option of buying into Medicare, or a similar "public option," but do not require it.
[ Medicare for All? For More? Here's How Medicare Works. ]
That did not stop Mr. Trump from pitching himself in a critical swing state as the bulwark against a raid on health care benefits that members of his audience rely on. "As long as I'm president, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits," Mr. Trump said, adding that "I will never allow these politicians to steal your health care and give it away to illegal immigrants."
Nearly all the Democratic candidates have said they support granting government health coverage to undocumented immigrants. At a debate in June, the idea received a unanimous show of hands in support.
But while Mr. Trump's speech suggested that the Democratic proposals for expanding coverage put retirees' access to health care in grave danger, the plans would not actually diminish their benefits. The Sanders plan, for example, would eliminate Medicare but provide more benefits for all Americans, including the elderly, than the program currently offers. It would have lower out-of-pocket costs compared with Medicare, though it would increase taxes.
Mr. Trump's speech, delivered from behind a lectern with a presidential seal, was billed as an official White House event and his travel was not paid for by his campaign. But it was almost indistinguishable in much of its content from the remarks Mr. Trump delivers at his "Make America Great Again" rallies.
Mr. Trump called the Democratic presidential field a bunch of "maniacs" and noted that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom he referred to by the pejorative nickname Pocahontas, "came up from the ashes." He noted that he would have to knock her out of the running again "because I don't see sleepy Joe Biden making it."
Mr. Trump said his victory in the 2020 election was critical to preventing the country from being hijacked by the "radical left," which he said was "consumed by rage and radicalism and insatiable lust." And he said that House Democrats had begun impeachment proceedings because "they know they can't beat us fairly."
Mr. Trump's advisers earlier in the day previewed the new executive order as part of Mr. Trump's commitment to protecting Medicare. Seniors "like what they have, so the president is going to protect it," Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said in a conference call with reporters. Mr. Azar also used the call to frame Democrats' health care plan as too focused on reducing the ranks of the uninsured.
The executive order seeks to beef up Medicare Advantage, the plans offered by private insurers that contract with Medicare and currently cover about a third of the program's 60 million beneficiaries, according to senior administration officials. The order also calls for lowering Medicare Advantage's premiums, allowing providers to spend more time with patients and reducing Medicare fraud.
The executive order, originally called "Protecting Medicare From Socialist Destruction," was renamed "Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation's Seniors" before Mr. Trump's speech. But administration officials said the renaming was a distinction without a difference.
Joe Grogan, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the goal was still to contrast the administration's commitment to protecting seniors with "the vision for Medicare as a one-size-fits-all, single-payer system" supported by many Democratic candidates.
"Medicare for all is Medicare for none," added Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who has been a vocal critic not just of the Democratic proposals but also of the Affordable Care Act. "Proposals like Medicare for all, as well as the public option, they are morally wrong because they would demote American seniors to second-class status."
Democrats competing for their party's presidential nomination strongly disagree: All advocate expanding health care coverage, though their strategies to do so vary.
Mr. Trump's appearance in a Republican-leaning region of Florida reflects the judgment of advisers who see health care, in recent years a Democratic issue, as a better focus for the president than the impeachment proceedings underway on Capitol Hill. And they see it as a way of tying all the Democratic candidates to the most progressive wing of the party and branding them as socialists.
Since his attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act ended in failure, Mr. Trump has repeatedly promised to unveil a new health care plan. Instead he has issued a series of executive orders and proposed rules to counter Democratic health care proposals for expanding coverage.
In July, for instance, the administration said it was taking steps to make it easier to import some drugs from Canada and to force hospitals to disclose the discounted prices they negotiate with insurers.
Administration officials on Thursday morning underscored what has become a frequent talking point for Mr. Trump: that the price of prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in decades.
But that claim is misleading. While the Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs declined in 2018, many experts say that is too narrow a measurement and that prices for many drugs, especially brand-name ones, have continued to rise.
Mr. Trump appeared at ease in front of a supportive audience.
"I should be retiring with you," Mr. Trump said. "I should be in this audience, clapping. But I didn't trust anybody to be standing here, because I know what you have."

Texto completo: The sum was $ 7 million less than Mr. Biden's fund-raising haul in the previous quarter.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has raised $ 15.2 million in the past three months, his campaign said Thursday, a drop-off of $ 7 million from the previous quarter and a sum that falls short of two leading Democratic rivals.
Mr. Biden, who began the Democratic presidential primary leading in the polls, has seen his advantage slip, falling behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in several recent polls both nationally and in some early-voting primary states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. His total for the third quarter of the year was another sign of unsteadiness.
Several of his opponents released their third-quarter totals earlier this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a strong small-dollar fund-raising base, pulled in $ 25.3 million, his campaign said Tuesday, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., reported $ 19.1 million raised during the last three months. Senator Kamala Harris of California raised $ 11.6 million.
Ms. Warren has not yet announced her third-quarter total. The deadline for presidential candidates to file their reports is Oct. 15.
Last quarter, Mr. Biden pulled in $ 22 million, one of the biggest hauls in the field for that time period, though he still fell behind Mr. Buttigieg for that quarter.
Mr. Biden announced his total at a fund-raiser Thursday afternoon in Palo Alto, Calif., and the campaign announced it in a news release shortly afterward. His campaign declined to comment when asked about Mr. Biden's cash on hand.
At the fund-raiser, Mr. Biden appeared to take a veiled shot at the views of some of his more liberal opponents as he cautioned against a "socialist" response to President Trump, according to a news media pool report from the event. Mr. Sanders is a democratic socialist.
"You've got to share in the benefits," Mr. Biden said at the fund-raiser, where tickets were offered for $ 1,500 and $ 2,800. "That's been broken. You don't need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this -- you've just got to make capitalism work like it's supposed to work. We've got to save capitalism from this guy."
Ms. Warren identifies as a capitalist, though she has called for more far-reaching progressive policies -- Medicare for all, for example -- than Mr. Biden supports.
Even before the $ 15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer.
Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate.
"Look, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it's important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president," he said. "But I've learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values."
The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to "look into" Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son's business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump's actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden's candidacy.
While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight -- even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden's advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump's focus on the Bidens.
That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president's conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden's team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued.
During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers.
At a fund-raiser in Los Angeles last Thursday, Mr. Biden told attendees that his campaign was close to landing nearly 670,000 donations from about 350,000 people, with an average donation of $ 46, according to a media pool report of the event. At the time, it wasn't clear if those remarks were referring to the third-quarter haul or to a cumulative total.
The campaign said Thursday that 98 percent of all donations came from grass-roots donors of $ 200 or less, and said that 56 percent of donors this quarter were new to the campaign.

On average, American households do about 300 loads of laundry every year. Heating the water and running the machines can consume enormous amounts of energy, and that means plenty of greenhouse gas emissions.
While efficiency has improved significantly in the past couple decades, one study estimated the nation's residential laundry carbon dioxide emissions at 179 million metric tons per year. That's equal to the total annual energy use of more than 21 million homes.
There are steps you can take to reduce those emissions.
"Laundry temperature is a big deal," said Elizabeth Morgan, director of Innoweaver, a British consulting firm. That's because about 90 percent of the energy a washing machine uses goes toward heating water.
There are some situations where you probably should use hot water: cleaning bed linens after being sick, for instance, or washing sweaty gym gear. An occasional hot wash can also help with general hygiene, Ms. Morgan said. Aside from that, though, stick to cold water.
It's worth noting that the cold setting may still heat the water in your machine to as much as 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 27 Celsius. Check to see if your washer has a "tap cold" option and, if so, use it.
Another thing to keep in mind: The temperature recommendations on clothing labels represent "the highest spectrum clothes can handle," said Melissa Hockstad, president and chief executive of the American Cleaning Institute. So you don't necessarily need to go that hot.
The benefits of cold washing are numerous. One calculation from the cleaning institute, using Energy Star data, estimated that a household could cut its emissions by 864 pounds of carbon per year by washing four out of five loads in cold water.
Cold water also means fabrics won't break down as much. That could reduce the amount of microplastics getting into the environment. (A single wash can release up to 700,000 tiny synthetic fibers into freshwater systems.) Not to mention, your clothes will likely look better and last longer.
Drying, though, is the major contributor to emissions. "It takes a lot of energy," said Kyle R. Gluesenkamp, a researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He said dryers often use five to 10 times more power than a washing machine.
Current technology is part of the problem. Most dryers in the United States suck in air, heat it and use it to evaporate water from the clothes, then vent it outside. Dr. Gluesenkamp compared that with boiling off water on the stove. It takes a lot of time and energy.
There are more energy efficient alternatives. Heat-pump dryers, for example, recycle hot air so the machine's heating unit doesn't have to work as hard. These dryers don't always need vents and tend to be common in Europe, where you can't always punch a hole in the wall of your 19th century building.
Whatever kind of machine you use for drying, Dr. Gluesenkamp said, the best thing you can do to reduce energy consumption is take full advantage of the high-speed spin cycle on your washing machine. That means less water needs to be evaporated off.
The Energy Department also recommends only doing full loads, and using dryer balls to help separate your clothes.
But the most efficient drying method requires almost no energy; just enough to haul your basket to a rack or clothesline. Air drying avoids the machine altogether and could save millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year.
Old laundry routines, like any old habits, can be hard to break, but a few simple changes could reduce emissions sharply and save you money. "Be consistent and do it every time," Ms. Hockstad said. "That's really how we're all going to do our part."

This week, researchers got into a fierce public debate over whether eating red meat is really as bad for you as we'd thought. It was sparked by a new series of papers arguing that we just don't have airtight evidence about the health risks of beef or pork.
Here on the climate team, we tend to focus on the environmental consequences of food. And this seemed like a good occasion to revisit what we really know. How sturdy is the scientific evidence on the climate impacts of meat eating?
Let's start with what experts can say with a fair amount of confidence: Meat usually has a much larger greenhouse gas impact than plant-based foods. And beef has the biggest impact of all, with a climate footprint that's about five times as large as chicken or pork, on average.
How can researchers be so sure? Partly, there are good common sense reasons to think so: Raising cows, chickens or pigs for food tends to take up a lot more land than growing crops. That's because you need room not just for the animals but also for crops to feed them. On top of that, cow stomachs contain bacteria that help them digest grass but that also produce methane, a potent planet-warming gas that's emitted through burps. So you'd expect cows to have the biggest impact.
The catch, however, is that production systems can vary hugely. If a farmer clears a patch of rain forest to raise cattle, that's much worse for global warming than a farmer raising cattle on existing pasture. So when scientists try to measure the emissions from different foods, the precise numbers can vary widely depending on where they're looking.
But there have now been hundreds of studies and when researchers tally them up, a clear pattern emerges. "Study after study shows that even when you have all this variation, the greenhouse impacts of beef are, on average, still many times greater than chicken, and another order of magnitude greater than, say, beans," said Diego Rose, a professor at Tulane University who has studied both the nutritional and environmental aspects of diets. "Those results are pretty solid."
That still leaves some unanswered questions. For example, researchers are still hotly debating whether grass-fed beef is any better for the climate than conventional feedlot beef. The answer can vary from location to location, and hinges on tricky questions about whether cattle grazing can help local soils take more carbon out of the air.
And, in another recent study, a team of scientists warned that we still don't know nearly enough to understand the consequences of lots and lots of people worldwide all shifting their diets at once. While there's been plenty of research on the climate impacts of beef and chicken, the scientists noted, a lot less is known about the environmental effects of many of the foods that might replace them.
Bottom line? We know food is a major contributor to climate change, accounting for about one-quarter of humanity's greenhouse gases. And we know that meat tends to have an outsize impact. But that still leaves all sorts of important nuances that are going to be crucial for scientists to figure out if we hope to get global warming under control.

Texto completo: The same biased reporters who pushed two-and-a-half years of Russian conspiracy theories aren’t done with their vendetta against President Trump. They will stop at nothing until he is removed from office.
These aren’t journalists, they’re political operatives.
Now, they’re even trying to criminalize the president’s attempt to get to the bottom of the Russian collusion hoax.
The New York Times ran a front-page story on Monday breathlessly reporting “another instance of the president using American diplomacy for potential personal gain” — which turned out to be nothing but cooperation between the Department of Justice and the Australian government related to a long-standing DOJ investigation.
The hypocrisy is laughable. The story is a shining example of how journalists contort stories in order to hew to the Democrats’ party line.
As everyone actually following the story knows, the origins of the collusion stories in 2016 are downright suspicious. They read like a movie script, complete with spy games, shady characters, and government intelligence operatives from around the world.
Alexander Downer, an Australian politician, played a major role in getting the Trump-Russia collusion narrative going. Trump didn’t make up these suspicions, they came from the sworn testimony of people at the center of the Russia investigation.
The question is not whether Downer was involved, but why.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller made a point to ignore Downer’s involvement with anti-Trump “dossier” author and British spy Christopher Steele, even though Mueller's mandate was to report on foreign interference in our elections. That’s why Attorney General William Barr initiated an investigation to get to the bottom of what happened, fulfilling a promise he made to Congress during his confirmation hearing.
Every responsible and informed person should support the DOJ investigation. Some things just don’t add up in the official narrative of Russian interference, and the public deserves to know the truth. Yet journalists write off every question and allegation involving the origin of the baseless collusion allegations as “counternarrative marbled with conspiracy,” designed by Trump to advance his own interests.
You’d have to have spent the past three years living under a rock to believe there are no legitimate questions to be asked about the events leading up to the Mueller probe.
While the biased reporters at the New York Times may think they’ve dropped a bombshell with their latest reporting, they haven’t actually written anything new. Trump himself very publicly tasked Barr with investigating the role of the Australian, Italian, British, and Ukrainian governments in the origins of the collusion allegations months ago. That investigation would obviously involve, if not require, cooperating with those governments.
The media largely ignored or dismissed Barr’s investigative assignment from Trump because it didn’t fit their narrative. That doesn’t mean it was some nefarious secret, though.
Now that Democrats have concocted the Ukraine “scandal,” their media allies are retooling the story of Barr’s investigation and presenting it as evidence of a corrupt bargain between the president and a foreign leader. The Australia story’s clear purpose is to substantiate the baseless accusations that Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky involved a quid pro quo deal.
The media enthusiasm for the non-existent quid pro quo is matched only by their determination to ignore the likelihood that there was a very real one involving the Democratic front-runner. Joe Biden’s son Hunter was taking money from a Ukrainian energy company while his vice president dad was influencing Obama administration policy on Ukraine.
Biden vehemently denies having any knowledge of his son’s business dealings, but there are photos of the two Bidens golfing with company executives just months after Hunter was named to the board.
We're supposed to believe Hunter Biden got on the board on his own merits, and not because his dad was vice president? The media hardly spent any time investigating that. Instead, they're going down another rabbit hole just to smear Trump.
Democrats have one goal: to take down Trump. Unfortunately, they can rely on compliant media reporters and editors to put an anti-Trump spin on any story that seems like it might help do it.

Farhad Manjoo: Why lefties should watch Fox News

Texto completo: I try to limit my intake of 24-hour cable TV news, because as a medium, on balance, I think it’s bad for America. Though Facebook has suffered more scrutiny and reputational damage for its role in 2016, it was cable, not social networks, that went gaga pumping up Trump during the campaign. Today, it’s the toxic feedback swirl of Twitter and cable — and a president and a press corps that spend all hours feeding on one another’s digital droppings in a dystopian circle of life — that has rendered our political culture so vulnerable to reflexive, narrow-minded conspiracies, tribalism and groupthink.
Lately, however, I’ve found myself gorging like a bear in salmon season on the worst, most brain-corroding corner of cable, the network I’ve called a “forked-tongue colossus” for its two-decades-long project of dismantling our collective hold on the truth. I refer, of course, to Fox News.
In the past week, it’s been riveting, and I can’t get enough. Forget “Succession” — as we descend into the hell pit of impeachment and a presidential election, there is no more engaging and consequential family drama on television right now than the one happening every day on Fox News.
I won’t lie to you: Watching Fox isn’t easy. Much of it is still a fetid sewer of venom that bears little resemblance to the real world, and I would hope that you have more enjoyable ways to spend your time, like elective dental surgery.
But when news breaks on television — as it will in an unending cascade of hearings, stump speeches, debates and grandstanding news conferences from now until at least January 2021 — Fox should be your go-to place to watch, especially if you are on the left.
There is a simple reason: While other organizations report the news, Fox News is the news. There is now a growing rift on Fox: Its news side is asking increasingly tough questions of Trump, while its opinion side pushes his raving conspiracies. The drama speaks to real tension on the right, and Fox will inform political reality. It is no exaggeration to say that what happens on Fox now — the way it decides to play impeachment and the twists and turns of the 2020 race — could well determine the fate of the republic.
Fox’s anchors, reporters, its far-flung network of guests and its many shaggy narratives — what Deadspin’s David Roth has called the “Fox News Cinematic Universe” — are now deeply embedded in the operations of the United States government.
Even before the Trump era, Fox exerted striking influence on the Republican Party. But with Trump, Fox has reached the zenith of its powers. Its anchors regularly advise the president about politics and policy. Its story lines inform his hourly moods and his strategic decisions, including his staffing. And its commitment to indulging the president’s conspiracy-fueled ravings has helped pull political culture ever farther from reality.
In other words, Fox is now not just a reflection of what happens in the world; instead, how a piece of news plays on Fox determines what happens in the world.
Tucker Carlson didn’t think it was a good idea to bomb Iran, so we didn’t bomb Iran.
He didn’t like John Bolton, so shut the door on your way out, John!
Lou Dobbs thought Kirstjen Nielsen was weak. Bye bye, Kirstjen!
The connection between Trump and Fox runs so deep that you might wonder where one ends and the other begins. Is Trump rotting Fox’s brain, or is Fox rotting Trump’s?
But when it comes to politics, it doesn’t matter; whichever way the rot runs, watching Fox now is like getting a peek into Trump’s war room and, in a larger sense, into the future of the right in America, however ugly that picture may be.
Now there is an extra layer of intrigue. Suddenly Fox News feels like a nation up for grabs, and there is growing, palpable drama on its sets.
The network’s daytime anchors — people like Shep Smith and Chris Wallace, who fall on the news reporting side of Fox’s opinion-reporting divide — have always grumbled about the network’s nighttime pundits, talkers like Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. Now the two sides are at open war, sniping at each other daily over the seriousness of impeachment and the very legitimacy of any inquiry of the president.
On impeachment, Fox News’ news side has been excellent. There were many moments in the last week where I felt shocked and gratified by the seriousness with which Fox was taking impeachment.
On Friday, Wallace called the White House’s “spinning” on the Ukraine call “astonishing and deeply misleading.” On Sunday’s “Fox & Friends,” reporter Ed Henry asked conservative radio host Mark Levin a series of substantive questions about the propriety of the Ukraine call. Levin roared his response, earning Twitter praise from the president, but Henry’s sharp questioning stood out to me: There he was upsetting Trump’s narrative on Trump’s favorite show. That’s progress, right?
And later on Sunday, in one of the most devastating performances by an administration official this week, Trump aide Stephen Miller fell apart like a used tissue under Chris Wallace’s withering questions.
In those moments of truth on Fox, I couldn’t help feeling a rush of optimism for America. I’ve often wondered whether after the Trump era it will ever be possible to pull back from the conspiracy right. In the ravings of Trump’s Ukrainian call, we saw undeniable proof that Infowars has invaded the president’s brain.
Are we seeing some sign that the conspiracies have a limit — that as nutty as things have gotten, Rupert Murdoch isn’t willing to turn his air over to an even darker cast of characters and story lines, what NBC News’ Ben Collins calls the “4Chan Cinematic Universe”?
But then I watch Fox’s opinion side and my optimism vanishes. For much of the past week, on Fox’s prime-time lineup, the president’s narrative has held total sway. On Carlson, on Hannity, on Ingraham, on “The Five,” the big story has been much the same: The president did nothing wrong, impeachment is a witch hunt and a coup, they’re coming to take your guns, to corrupt your children and to ruin all that’s great about the country.
There were times, watching Carlson and Hannity, that I felt truly terrified for the nation. Fox’s most popular hosts are still framing Trump’s political battles in apocalyptic terms; if they keep that up, what hope is there for any of us?
But this, too, is important news about America: The president, quoting a Fox News guest, says that his impeachment could bring about civil war in America. Watching Fox’s prime-time lineup, I totally believe it.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Already under investigation for asking Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, an unrepentant President Donald Trump said Thursday that China should also investigate his political foe – an all-but-engraved invitation to another foreign country to inject itself into U. S. politics.
"By the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine," Trump told reporters.
Democrats and other critics denounced Trump for invoking China, saying he wants yet another country to interfere in the next U. S. presidential election just as Russia did in 2016.
"The defining characteristic of Donald Trump's presidency is the ongoing abuse of power," said Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. "The White House itself has admitted that Donald Trump tried to bully a foreign country into lying about the domestic opponent he's afraid to look in the eye next November. "
Speaking with reporters en route to Florida for a Medicare speech, Trump also acknowledged that he did indeed want Kiev to investigate Biden and his son, though he denied using foreign aid as leverage.
Asked if he had requested President Xi Jinping of China to help investigate the Biden family, Trump said, "I haven't but it is certainly something we could start thinking about. "
Some critics noted that Trump's call for China to investigate Biden came less than a week before American and Chinese negotiators meet to try and revive a proposed bilateral trade agreement. The Trump administration has been engaged in a longstanding trade war with Beijing.
"It is the president saying to a foreign government that it will win his favor by investigating the Bidens," said David Rothkopf, a foreign policy analyst and critic of Trump. "And he is saying it in the middle of a massively important trade negotiation so the stakes could not be higher for China. "
In firing back at Trump, Biden's campaign compared the president's remarks to his open-ended call in 2016 for Russia to "find" Democrat Hillary Clinton's emails.
Trump "is flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations," Bedingfield said.
Biden, the vice president under Obama, has said that Trump is targeting him because he fears defeat in the next election.
"He is repeatedly smearing me and my family," Biden said Wednesday. "His party fans out to carry the smear. Millions of dollars in dishonest attack ads are blanketing the airwaves – paid for by the special interests so well served by his presidency. "
Current Vice President Mike Pence, who has kept a low profile in recent days, expressed support for Trump's actions. “The American people have the right to know whether or not the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position,” Pence told reporters during a stop in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Pence later tweeted out a wire story about his comments.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Cal. , who authorized the impeachment inquiry last week, referenced Trump's comments in responding to a request by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , to suspend the investigation.
In rejecting that suggestion, Pelosi replied to McCarthy that "I received your letter this morning shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections. "
At the heart of Congress' probe into the president's actions is his claim that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into a company tied to his son, Hunter Biden. But sources ranging from former Obama administration officials to an anti-corruption advocate in Ukraine say the official, Viktor Shokin, was ousted for the opposite reason Trump and his allies claim.
One of Trump's contentions is that Hunter Biden landed business opportunities in Ukraine and China because of his connection to Joe Biden, and that the senior Biden used his position to protect his son.
There is no evidence of any improper activity by either Biden.

Before leaving the White House, Trump wrote at least 20 tweets and re-tweets, many of them attacking the ongoing impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine.
Trump also turned to immigration, dismissing a series of reports that he has floated ideas of harming migrants to dissuade them from attempting to enter the U. S. Specifically, Trump denied a New York Times report that the president had previously asked about shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down.
"Fake News, just like the snakes and gators in the moat," Trump said, referring to another report that he had inquired about using alligators to discourage migrants. "The Media is deranged, they have lost their minds!"
A USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll released Thursday found that Americans by a 45%-38% plurality support a House vote to impeach Trump.

Texto completo: Donald Trump, campaigning in Iowa in 2015, said that "I've had a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war." For the past three years, we have witnessed Mr. Trump's wars on governance, science, national security policy and public service. For the past several days, we have witnessed a new war - a war on whistleblowers that will make it particularly difficult for others to come forward in the future.
The president has said the White House is seeking the identity of the whistleblower who brought to light Mr. Trump's phone call pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former vice president and political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. He's also called into question the whistleblower's credibility and loyalty to the country.
It's likely the White House already knows who the person is, however. The New York Times last week outed the whistleblower as an intelligence analyst from the Central Intelligence Agency. In my 24 years at the CIA, it was unusual to find more than one intelligence analyst assigned to the White House at any one time.
The whistleblower himself, unfortunately, was rather naive in taking his complaint initially to the CIA's Office of the General Counsel, which quickly informed the White House. CIA lawyers are known for protecting the interests of CIA directors and not the interests of whistleblowers.
Whistleblowers are essential to our democracy. Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, whistleblowers have recorded the improper granting of security clearances to members of his administration, the Department of Energy's plan to secretly transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the removal of scientists from research on climate change, and the abuse of families and children in detention at immigration centers.
The congressional oversight committees, particularly the intelligence oversight committees, must be more aggressive in protecting the rights of whistleblowers. The Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has certainly been so; his Republican Senate counterpart, Richard Burr, has been virtually silent along with most others in the GOP, making it difficult for the whistleblower to get a fair hearing, let alone protect his anonymity.
The laws to protect whistleblowers, particularly whistleblowers from the intelligence community, are inadequate. Most government whistleblowers may go directly to the appropriate congressional oversight committee after delivering their complaint to the Office of the Inspector General. Whistleblowers from the intelligence community, however, must coordinate their remarks to the intelligence committees with senior officials from the Office of National Intelligence or the Central Intelligence Agency. Private contractors, who play an increasingly important role in the intelligence community, have virtually no protection.
Attorney General William Barr's role in the war on whistleblowers, moreover, will be particularly harmful to the national security interests of the United States. He is seeking the help of foreign intelligence officials in an effort to discredit the legitimate work of the intelligence community regarding the presidential campaign of 2016. This could make it more difficult for U.S. clandestine officials to collect essential intelligence from these same foreign intelligence officials who are essential in gathering information on terrorism and nuclear proliferation.
Mr. Barr's efforts, as well as the investigation of the intelligence community by U.S. Attorney John Durham, are designed to intimidate the intelligence community. In a previous investigation, Mr. Durham gave a free pass to CIA officials involved in the destruction of the torture and abuse tapes, including the current CIA director Gina Haspel and the former director of the National Clandestine Service Jose A. Rodriguez Jr.
The mainstream media appear to be rallying in support of the whistleblower, but that is not always the case. When I testified as a whistleblower against the confirmation of Robert M. Gates as director of CIA, I provided background information to a reporter for The New York Times in order to counter the misinformation from the White House designed to compromise my credibility. When it became apparent that Mr. Gates would eventually be confirmed, the reporter stopped reporting my information. She explained that whistleblowers are good sources only in the short run, while journalists had to rely on high-level government officers for long-term access and should not gratuitously offend them.
As long as Donald Trump appears to favor "repealing and replacing" the First Amendment's defense of free speech and free press, it will be up to whistleblowers in the intelligence and policy communities to ensure that any misuse of power does not go unreported.
Whistleblowers are essential to government oversight, investigative journalism and the public's awareness of the wrongful actions of federal officials. Only whistleblowers can challenge the secrecy that limits the debate on foreign policy and national security that deprives citizens of information needed to participate in genuine life-and-death issues.

Texto completo: MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin of Russia said Wednesday that he would not mind if the White House made public his talks with President Trump at a summit meeting last year, because there was nothing incriminating in their conversations.
Just five days earlier, Putin's spokesman had said the Kremlin would not want records of the two presidents' talks released. But Putin, a former KGB spy, said his previous job had taught him that any conversation he had could be published.
“Therefore, when they tried to spin another scandal over our meeting with President Trump in Helsinki, we told the administration directly: If someone wants to find out something, publish; we are not against it," the Russian president said in Moscow.

Journalists need to stand up to obfuscation

Texto completo: Scott Pelley of CBS pushed back hard when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried to spin him on Sunday's "60 Minutes."
So did Chris Wallace of Fox News when Trump aide Stephen Miller refused to accept reality on the same subject: President Trump pressing Ukraine's president to provide dirt on his political opponent.
So did Jake Tapper of CNN with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee, and Chuck Todd of NBC with Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).
The Tapper interview "centered on Jordan misrepresenting the allegations focused on Joe and Hunter Biden - allegations that have been broadly debunked," my Post colleague Philip Bump wrote in a piece that gives a telling blow-by-blow of several Sunday interviews.
In every case, the interviewers were admirably well-prepared and assertive. Wallace even went so far as to call Miller's responses "an exercise in obfuscation."
Good to see.
And not nearly enough.
As the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry ramps up, so, too, does the Trump disinformation campaign - spreading its fact-adverse surrogates throughout the media world in an all-out effort to sway public opinion.
Make no mistake, public opinion - more than any other factor - will determine what happens.
William A. Galston of the Brookings Institution looked back recently on the two most recent presidential impeachments.
"The first, which ended in 1974, led to the resignation of its target - President Richard Nixon. The second, which began in 1998 against President Bill Clinton, led to the resignation of the man who had orchestrated the effort - House Speaker Newt Gingrich."
Among the determining factors: public opinion.
"The public must be convinced that the charges are true - and that they are weighty enough to justify overturning the results of a presidential election," if an impeachment is not to backfire, Galston wrote.
With the stakes so high, the media has to step up more than ever before to help news consumers - American citizens - figure out where they stand.
That's going to be increasingly challenging over the next weeks and months.
That public opinion be based on facts - not weaponized falsehoods - is about the most crucial work the media can do.
How can journalists rise to the challenge?
First, by being quick on their feet and utterly prepared, and, as noted, we're seeing more of that.
Interviewers have wised up.
By contrast, Pelley was not nearly as ready when he interviewed Mike Cernovich, the pro-Trump blogger and author, in 2017 on "60 Minutes." A lot of viewers came away from that interview feeling that the respected newsman was caught off-guard - and that Cernovich owned the exchange as he turned the tables about how the 2016 election played out.
Charlie Warzel, an astute observer of right-wing disinformation, described what happened and why it would keep on happening.
"The New Right media isn't just an opposition force to the mainstream media - it's a parallel institution armed with its own set of facts that insists on its own reality," he wrote in BuzzFeed News.
So, too, Trump's surrogates, some of whom are members of the media themselves.
One only has to tune in for an evening to Fox News prime-time shows to see this in full swing.
"Totally untethered from reality," is the accurate description by Oliver Darcy, a reporter who focuses on right-wing media for CNN.
"If The Gateway Pundit and Infowars formed a cable news channel, it'd look something like the 2019 version of Fox prime time programming," he tweeted.
The second way that news organizations can meet the challenge of this moment is to stop booking those surrogates who are the worst of the inveterate liars. I'd put Trump shills Corey Lewandowski and Kellyanne Conway in this ever-growing category.
Conway famously touted her allegiance to "alternate facts" early in the Trump presidency - and has stayed right with the program.
And Lewandowski recently admitted lying to the media in recent congressional testimony: "I have no obligation to be honest with the media because they're just as dishonest as anyone else."
Third - and this goes well beyond TV interviews - the mainstream media must end its addiction to both-sides journalism, which gives falsehood the same opportunities as truth.
In this case, that involves equating what Trump did with the accusations of undue influence in Ukraine by former vice president Joe Biden.
Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times took this on in a column headlined "Trump's Claims About Biden Aren't 'Unsupported.' They're Lies."
"Journalists, perhaps seeking to appear balanced, have sometimes described Trump's claims about Biden as 'unsubstantiated' or 'unsupported,' " she wrote. That's misleading, she continued after ticking through the known facts.
These claims aren't just unproven - they're falsehoods that shouldn't be soft-pedaled in the name of fairness.
I'm not suggesting that reporters, interviewers and news operations advocate for a particular outcome in the looming impeachment.
That's not the job of the press in America's democracy.
But they must carry out their mission: to get to the truth so citizens can make wise decisions and not be bamboozled by lies and distractions.

Texto completo: CNN host Jake Tapper issued a "parental advisory" before reading tweets from President Trump during his show on Wednesday afternoon.
"A parental advisory for you: In this block, I'm going to be quoting from things that the president of the United States has tweeted. So if you have kids in the room, you might want to mute the television because he used some profanity today," Tapper began.
As he referenced, the president used the word "bullshit" on social media this morning.
CNN's Tapper issues 'parental adivsory' to read Trump tweets
"The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone’s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306," Trump tweeted. "Get a better candidate this time, you’ll need it!"
Tweet
New York Times reporter Michael Grynbaum reported earlier in the day that the network gave the green light for the newsroom to use the word "bullshit" in graphics, banners, and headlines.
"We should show and say it because the President sent it out just that way," read the memo sent to staff.

IF TRUMP IS THE VILLAIN, HOW COME BIDEN IS A LOSER?

Texto completo: In a nutshell, President Donald Trump was afraid of former Vice President Joe Biden, whom he trails by double digits in polls, so he set out to destroy his Democratic adversary by threatening to withhold U.S. aid from Ukraine unless its leader delivered campaign dirt he could use against Biden.
Trump's gambit was so audacious, illegal and un-American that a reluctant House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to launch an impeachment inquiry against Trump.
So why does it feel like Biden is already a loser in this?
Consider the trepidation expressed by a Democratic county chairman in Iowa to the New York Times last week: "I could see people who are already on the fence about (Biden), maybe because of his long career in politics, his age, his ability to win, kind of going, 'Oh great, we're already starting this and we haven't even gotten to the nomination.' " The Ukraine story raises an underlying question about how professional journalists can cover a leader as essentially amoral as Trump.
Once again, he has exploited the national media's pursuit of evenhandedness and fair play by connecting Biden to a fictional Ukraine scandal just as they did with Hillary Clinton on email servers or her alleged role in the attack on the U.S. embassy at Benghazi, Libya, by a group of Islamic militants.
It's a Trump specialty: Fabricate a scandal and then pound so long and so hard on it that it resonates, especially among "low-information" voters, the people who pay little attention to politics.
The professional media, inadvertently, provide the megaphone.
As a news consumer, you must have read or heard multiple in-depth "backgrounders" about Biden, his son Hunter, and Ukraine: When Biden was vice president in 2014, he was President Obama's point person on Ukraine, pushing that country to eliminate bureaucratic corruption.
His son Hunter, a lawyer and businessman, took a paid board position with a Ukrainian national gas company. A Wall Street Journal story from the time benignly reported that "some anti-corruption advocates feared (that role) would undermine the elder Mr. Biden's work."
But that's it. No one except Trump, with no proof, has alleged any wrongdoing, and Joe Biden says he never spoke to his son about overseas business dealings.
Yet Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, suggest Joe Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor to stop an investigation into the company on which Hunter Biden was a board member.
The Wall Street Journal reported: "In Ukraine, government officials and anti-corruption advocates say that is a misrepresentation. Neither Mr. Biden nor his son have been accused of any wrongdoing."
But that last part the part about there being no proof of wrongdoing by the Democratic presidential candidate that hardly seems to matter, does it?
The sheer frequency of the retelling gives it enormous weight.
It reminds me of an old truism about investigative reporting. Sometimes it is not so much what a story says, but how prominently it is "played" and how much newsprint it consumes.
That's what's happening with the Biden "scandal" it is getting so much attention that to some it must seem like a real thing.
Trump's lapdogs at Fox News and on conservative talk radio amplify his talking points, but those outlets don't really matter. They only reach an established cult of incurious true believers.
What matters is when the professional media again fall into the false equivalence trap.
As a journalist, I empathize.
We are taught to be "objective" and evenhanded, which dictates covering "both sides" of a story, even, apparently, when a second side does not exist.
My advice, were it solicited, would be this: Once the facts are laid out, give only the most cursory mention of the Biden-Ukraine angle in ongoing coverage and emphasize that there has been no finding of any Biden wrongdoing. Mention that at the beginning, not the end.
Others in the media are also fuming about this.
James Fallows, national correspondent at The Atlantic, charges the media are embracing false equivalence like they did in 2016.
He wrote: "The problem with Trump is that he is not like anyone else who has ever held the presidency. He lies with abandon; he uses public office for private gain on a scale never before witnessed; and he seems to have no respect for, or even interest in, the institutions of self-government to which all of his predecessors have at least paid lip service."
But here is the key: "I don't know whether there is any real 'abuse of power' story about Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, and Ukraine. But even if there were (again, I'm imagining this just for argument), it would be fundamentally like other abuse-of-power questions the press has tried to uncover over the years. You could fairly liken it to questions about whether Ivanka Trump's clothing brands are receiving favorable trademark treatment from Chinese officials, or whether the Air Force has gone out of its way to have planes land and refuel at a Scottish airport near Donald Trump's golf resort there.
"What you can't liken it to, or shouldn't," Fallows wrote, "is what Donald Trump appears to have done in asking the government of Ukraine to interfere in the next election. But there is a slot in the reporter's and editor's brain that is more comfortable if criticism and exposés are 'balanced.' " Look, Biden is in many respects an imperfect candidate and should have his record appropriately and proportionately scrutinized.
But, because Trump apparently considers Biden a singular threat to his re-election, the president concocted, then successfully elevated, a Biden-Ukraine scandal.
The national media seem complicit as unintentional enablers, which is not how any of this is supposed to work.
In pursuit of balance, the journalistic outcome is anything but. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund ; Paul Fanlund is editor and publisher of The Capital Times

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump rechazó de que quería armar su muro fronterizo con México con características como picos, una corriente eléctrica y un foso son cocodrilos, además de sugerir disparar a los inmigrantes en los pies para evitar que cruzaran a los Estados Unidos.
“Ahora la prensa está tratando de vender el hecho de que quería un foso relleno de caimanes y serpientes, con una cerca electrificada y puntas afiladas en la parte superior, en nuestra frontera sur” , escribió Trump. “Puedo ser duro con la seguridad fronteriza, pero no tan duro. La prensa se ha vuelto loca. ¡Noticias falsas!”
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019
Así reaccionó el mandatario sobre un extracto de un libro de los reporteros de The New York Times, Michael Shear y Julie Hirschfeld Davis , declarando detalles en los informes que incluye disparar en los pies a los inmigrantes .
Los reporteros informaron que Trump “a menudo” sugirió rodear su muro fronterizo con una trinchera como un foso e incluso les pidió a los ayudantes que buscaran estimaciones de costos para el plan presentado supuestamente men marzo en el Despacho Oval.
Entre sus otras ideas estaba su amenaza, que emitió públicamente, de cerrar la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos por completo, sus sugerencias privadas de que los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza comenzaran a disparar a los inmigrantes y su idea de que los listones de acero electrificado que componen el muro fronterizo.
“¡Me estás haciendo parecer un idiota!” , habría expresado molesto el mandatario en la tensa reunión de marzo con la entonces secretario de Seguridad Nacional Kirstjen Nielsen y el secretario de Estado Mike Pompeo .

Would you fly to American Dream?

Texto completo: American Dream Meadowlands is hoping to take shoppers to new heights.
The entertainment and retail center, which will open in phases beginning Oct. 25, could become one of the region's first retail centers to offer customers a new way to shop.
By helicopter.
"It paints a bigger picture for you — the whole concept," said Chuck Lanyard, president of retail brokerage firm The Goldstein Group in Paramus. "In today's world, we're such jet-setters where things like that can happen."
The concept is simple: Offer wealthy shoppers a painless, if pricey, way to get to American Dream that doesn't involve sitting in traffic on the congested roadways that crisscross Bergen and Hudson counties. So why hasn't anyone done it yet?
An on-site helipad is a huge investment for "a very elite few who can afford to fly in and out in helicopters just to shop," said Lanyard, who has more than four decades of experience brokering real estate deals for retail tenants in the area. But, he added, American Dream is hoping to lure the kind of shopper willing to spend that kind of money.
Don Ghermezian, president of American Dream, told WWD in May that the center purchased three helicopters, two Rolls-Royces and two Bentleys to bring in customers from Manhattan and the Hamptons. He also said American Dream will have a Rolls-Royce golf cart to whisk VIP guests throughout the property.
When NorthJersey.com asked how a helicopter service might work at the complex, an American Dream spokesperson declined to comment.
"I don't have information to share regarding your transportation questions, but we are planning to make additional transportation announcements prior to opening," the spokesperson said in an email.
Hudson's Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, did not respond to questions about a possible helipad on its store at American Dream, which The New York Post reported.
Although American Dream has not released details about how it plans to fly shoppers to the 3 million-square-foot property in East Rutherford or where a helipad would be located on the property, aviation experts say they are not surprised by the proposal.
"There's always interest in the development of heliports at locations that can service the public, and this is just another way in which helicopters can do that," said Chris Martino, vice president of operations for Helicopter Association International.
Adding a heliport to a project is not that difficult, Martino said. Officials would coordinate with the appropriate local officials to get it approved.
"There are hoops that they need to jump through to make sure that they're complying with all the local regulations," Martino said.
Although having an on-site helicopter service would be a first for a North Jersey mall, shopping centers on both coasts have toyed with similar concepts.
The owners of Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Orange County, New York, have proposed constructing an on-site helipad as part of the mall's upcoming expansion, which also includes building two hotels and a parking deck.
The helipad is "something new" for the mall's Premium Outlets platform, said John Villapiano, vice president of development for Simon Property Group, which operates the New York mall. The concept was inspired by a noticeable demand from shoppers interested in skipping the 52-mile traffic-plagued trip to the mall from Manhattan.
"There are several helicopter operators in and around the city who are eager to engage with Woodbury Common and establish a route for customers willing to pay for the convenience of taking a helicopter," Villapiano said.
Mall officials plan to work with the appropriate local boards to figure out how to include a helipad in the center's expansion, he said. The concept is in an early exploratory phase.
In the past, the outlet mall has coordinated transportation to its site for shoppers flying into nearby airports. The mall has also partnered with helicopter operators to offer round-trip flights from Manhattan during the holiday shopping rush.
"Obviously, it's an expensive way to travel — so not everyone would be coming [by helicopter], and I don't anticipate this to be a regular event," Villapiano said. "It's something that could just provide another amenity for customers who otherwise would maybe not come to Orange County."
In the past, Woodbury has partnered with Blade — a company that lets users book an on-demand flight using an app, similar to the way Uber works for cars.
On its website, Blade offers flights to at least two malls in California — Westfield Century City in Los Angeles, and Westfield UTC in San Diego — through a program called The Westfield Experience. Shoppers can skip the traffic by taking a helicopter and then a "door-to-store" black car to either mall for a day of shopping and dining. The service even comes with a $100 dining credit per flyer.
Those two malls are owned by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which also runs Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus.
A spokesperson said the Paramus mall has not launched any programs with helicopters.
The concept of flying shoppers to malls dates back at least two decades. In 1996, the Mall at Short Hills in Millburn experimented with the idea of flying shoppers to its property.
That year, The New York Times reported that the luxury mall was preparing to launch limousine, ferry and helicopter services that would bring Manhattan shoppers to New Jersey.
The helicopter, which could seat four shoppers, departed from four locations in Manhattan and flew shoppers to Morristown Airport, 10 miles from the mall. Then a limousine took shoppers from the airport to the mall entrance of their choice. The service cost $1,500.
A spokesperson this week said the mall no longer has this service.
Although flying to shop by helicopter may be rare, large corporations with heavy pockets have been tapping carriers for similar services for years.
"There's lots of corporations that have corporate aviation departments with helicopters they use for transporting folks to and from their work sites and to airports," Martino said.
But even that kind of helicopter service is changing in the New York metro area, where American Dream is hoping to lure potential flyers.
At Hudson Yards, the new, mixed-use neighborhood along the Hudson River in midtown Manhattan that is home to offices as well as more than 100 shops and restaurants, Blade recently partnered with Related Companies to offer office tenants weekday flight service from the West 30th Street Heliport to John F. Kennedy International Airport for $195, The Real Deal reported in March. A few months later, Uber launched a similar program called Uber Copter. The program, available now as a soft launch for Uber's Diamond and Platinum members, flies riders from Manhattan to JFK.

Grassley pushes back on Trump

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a long-time defender of whistleblowers and a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, pushed back Tuesday against the president's call to identify the person who filed a complaint about his July phone call with the Ukrainian president.
"This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers' requests for confidentiality," Grassley said in a news release.
The president wrote on Twitter on Sunday that he deserves to meet the person who filed a whistleblower complaint about him, saying that they had represented his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a "totally inaccurate and fraudulent way."
The whistleblower filed the complaint on Aug. 12 about Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, in which the president encouraged the foreign leader to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, as well as Biden's son, who was on an energy company's board in Ukraine.
Trump has sought to delegitimize the report, saying it should not have been filed because much of it is based on second-hand information rather than the whistleblower's direct knowledge of events.
But Grassley pointed out in the release Tuesday that protections for whistleblowers do not hinge on how the person acquired the information they've reported.
"When it comes to whether someone qualifies as a whistleblower, the distinctions being drawn between first- and second-hand knowledge aren't legal ones," Grassley said. "... Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim's credibility."
In addition to defending the whistleblower's request for anonymity from the president, he also pushed back against reports on the person's identity from news organizations.
Last week, the New York Times published details on the whistleblower's identity. The paper faced backlash for publishing the information, which critics said could have outed the person's identity.
"We should always work to respect whistleblowers' requests for confidentiality," Grassley said. "Any further media reports on the whistleblower's identity don't serve the public interest — even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks."
Although Grassley called for protecting the person who filed the whistleblower report, he has not joined with Democrats who are calling for the president's impeachment. The Iowa Republican criticized Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who announced the House would launch an impeachment inquiry against the president last week.
"Unfortunately, instead of waiting to learn the facts by reviewing that transcript or hearing from the whistleblower, Democrats have moved straight to starting the impeachment process," Grassley said in a September news release. "Democrats have been searching for any reason to impeach President Trump since his inauguration because they couldn't accept the results of the 2016 election."

Historic farmhouse needs help The Delhi Historical Society has begun a capital campaign to keep open its historic farmhouse and museum on Anderson Ferry Road.
Built in the last quarter of the 19th century, the farmhouse was home to Mary Witterstaetter and her six children from the 1890s to the 1970s. Developers donated the farmhouse to the Delhi Historical Society in 1991.
After much refurbishment, hard work, and support from the community, the Farmhouse opened as the Delhi Historical Society's museum and headquarters in 1992.
The floorboards on the farmhouse signature wrap-around porch are in need of replacement. About half of the porch floor boards are original to the house. The boiler in the basement dates to the 1960s. Per the manufacturer, the life-span of their boilers is 10-20 years. These projects are estimated to cost $25,000.00.
The farmhouse and Delhi Historical Society are resources to neighboring communities and beyond. Just this year, the world famous Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens brought horticultural volunteers to the farmhouse to learn about the great floricultural history of Delhi, also known as the Floral Paradise of Ohio.
In addition to the museum on the first floor, the second floor holds a research center where genealogists and historians can investigate the rich history of our communities. Most recently, the New York Times best-seller, "The Ghosts of Eden Park," by author Karen Abbott, was researched in part at Delhi Historical Society.
The mission of the Delhi Historical Society is to discover, preserve, and share the history of Delhi and surrounding areas. While the Society's main focus is on Delhi Township, it also preserves and shares the history of Green Township, Sayler Park, and Price Hill.
The Delhi Historical Society is inviting individuals and businesses to help keep the farmhouse running, so our neighbors and families have a place to learn about their heritage.

Highway 50 Fright Field haunted event returns Highway 50 Fright Field is returning for a seventh season. Part haunted trail, part haunted woods, all on a real haunted 1830s farm near an actual Indian archaeological site.
Every October, all those that walk on this land are in grave danger. They tried to break the centuries-old curse, but it only became worse. Fear the wrath of the ancient Indian Wendigo spirit. The field turns into an adventure, hot with blood and horror, which is the first attraction, the Haunted Trail & Woods.
The trail features everything from possessed zombies to many horrific entities throughout time that you "love to fear."
The second attraction is their Operation Termination Zombie Paintball. Imagine walking into a bunker and taking the adventure into your own hands by shooting 100 rounds into zombies from all walks of life and death. May you be successful with your mission against the undead.
The last attraction is their new Corn Cob Cannon. Shoot real cobs of corn into the field with a cannon. Hit a zombie target and win a prize.
Obtain individual tickets to one attraction, or purchase discounted "Combo" or "Triple Threat" tickets to two or even all three attractions. Hopefully, you will survive...
The owners/operators truly enjoy bringing horror to the next level. The haunted trail lasts approximately 20 minutes, and it is the most unique outdoor haunted attraction in the Tristate area. The 1830s farm is listed on the National Register of Historical Places.
Highway 50 Fright Field will be open every Friday and Saturday in October (weather-permitting) from 8 p.m. to midnight. They are located just west of Cincinnati on Highway 50, near E-Town, Ohio, and the Indiana/Ohio state line. By interstate, they are only 3 miles from either the Kilby Road (OH) or the Lawrenceburg, Indiana, I-275 exits. Just look for the huge clown on the side of the barn.
Parking is free, and while there, you can visit the Buckeye Trading Post (www.buckeyetradingpost.com) on the same property. Purchase edible bugs, "shrunken heads," freeze-dried lizards, high-quality Halloween masks, and more. Drinks and snacks are also available in the Buckeye Trading Post or at the Highway 50 Fright Field Café concession booth.

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today.
This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever.
In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter.
What to expect at Samin Nosrat's Mesa show It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it.
The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, "What to Cook."
She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience.
We chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.
How her new book will be different from 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat' But as far as the book, one of things I've seen is that people feel kind of stuck about deciding what to make.
Even really good home cooks create a menu for a dinner or a party page for page, word for word out of a magazine spread of recipes. Or because they saw such-and-such-thing on TV or Instagram. I started to think about how there's so much I can share with those people about how to make their lives easier by understanding what decisions to make about what they should be cooking.
I did my best with "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" to teach people how to translate how professional cooks think about how to cook. What I've realized is I haven't really that similar translation about how professional cooks decide what to cook.
I think people have a really romantic notion that chefs show up at work and are like 'today I feel like making this grand and wonderful creation' or something. And maybe some people do that. But the constraints of a real kitchen are what chiefly make a professional cook decide what to make. If I can teach that to home cooks I think it would make people's day-to-day cooking a lot easier.
So that's what I'm going to do with the book that I have not started writing yet. (laughs)
Chef Samin Nosrat is the author of the award-winning book, "Salt Fat Acid Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking," which is now a show on Netflix.

State Senate to investigate NJ Transit

Texto completo: Whispers of NJ Transit fare hikes are, in part, the reason the state Senate is launching an investigation into the struggling agency, the future investigating committee's chair said Tuesday.
"We charge more for a commuter system than any other area around here and now we're talking about charging more and it isn't working right — that's not a formula for success," said Senate President Stephen Sweeney, who said the investigation would likely begin after the elections in late November or early December. "The time of talking about things is long past and it's really time to figure it out, come up with solutions and move forward."
Sweeney will be joined on the committee by three Democratic colleagues in the senate — Sandra Cunningham, Patrick Diegnan and Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg — and several Republicans who will be named at a later date to join the group.
The committee will hold public hearings, round-table discussions, conduct site visits and, if needed, Sweeney said, a subpoena for information or testimony.
"We're just going to keep a focus on this, a very high-profile focus on this until we have a solution," Sweeney said. "It's time to stop talking about how good we are ... because the commuters I've been talking to don't feel that way."
NJ Transit spokeswoman Nancy Snyder said in an email the agency looks forward to working with the Legislature, and highlighted recent changes at the agency including accelerating work on a federally-mandated braking system, hiring engineers and drivers, and advancing stalled capital projects.
"While there is still much to be done, NJ Transit has made notable progress investing in recruiting, infrastructure and new vehicles, while enhancing safety for riders," Snyder said. "We look forward to discussing these issues with the Legislature in the months ahead as we continue improving the quality of public transportation throughout the state.
Riders had mixed reactions to the news.
"This is great news. Let's just hope this NJ Senate committee has teeth," Bobby Amirshahi, a rider on the Morris & Essex line, said in a Facebook comment.
Fellow rider, David Danto, threw in his suggestion to get results.
"Pass a state law that has the NJ Transit executives and management earn a basic salary, with incentives tied to train reliability and on-time performance," Danto said. "With skin in the game there would finally be improvements."
Murphy's law Fixing the embattled agency has been a central talking point of Gov. Phil Murphy since he was elected in 2017.
The governor issued an audit of the agency, which released its report about a year ago, signed a reform bill in December requiring changes at NJ Transit, and has held several press conferences this year touting the agency's improvements.
"Make no mistake: this administration is doing the long, difficult work of putting NJ Transit on the path to recovery, and Governor Murphy will not stop until New Jersey commuters have the world-class transportation agency they deserve," Murphy spokesman Dan Bryan said in a statement.
"We welcome the Legislature's scrutiny and look forward to the discussion of their budgets that were negotiated with Governor Christie and sent to his desk, which reduced state funding to the agency by as much as 90 percent."
Years of underfunded budgets that required the agency to raid its capital monies and unreliable funding from different sources has been at the heart of NJ Transit's problems, an issue highlighted frequently by politicians, agency officials and advocates for commuters.
This year the state Legislature approved a $50 million net increase for NJ Transit during budget negotiations in May, up from the $25 million originally proposed by Murphy.
Sweeney said a "dedicated source of funding is crucial," but admitted nothing concrete is in the works to make that happen yet.
Weinberg said earlier this month that this issue should be addressed once the agency's new board members are appointed to their positions. Murphy gave his list of board nominations to the Senate in March, but they have yet to be confirmed.
The announcement of the investigation comes four days after The New York Times published an article calling NJ Transit "the worst commuter train in America."
NJ Transit trains are four times as likely to be cancelled as Long Island Railroad and Metro North trains, and NJ Transit's accident and breakdown rate is worse than other major railroads, according to The New York Times analysis.
A father and teenage son were injured in a car accident with a NJ Transit train on Main St in River Edge, N.J. Thursday Sept. 19, 2019 according to River Edge Police Lt. Mike Walker. They were extricated from the car by River Edge Fire Department with the assistance of Oradell and New Milford departments.

Sturgill Simpson releases blazing new rock record

Texto completo: Listeners hungry for Sturgill Simpson's familiar croon better keep feasting on the old stuff – because the Kentucky songwriter's new album trades country comfort for all-out helping of rock 'n' roll grime.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, Simpson teamed with leading names in anime to team the 40-minute stack of new tunes with a Netflix film of the same name.
How's the album sound? And what can you expect from the Netflix film? Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide To Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he'd fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile earlier this month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formidable years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genre.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album. There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin;" The slick, funky flair of "A Good Look;" southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town;" and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success: "They come back stage and on my bus, pretending to be my friend/ Shaking hands behind grandstands, wearing the same 'ole grin."
The songs come from "a weird spot," Simpson told Lowe earlier this year – including his distaste for the industry behind the art.
"It is a dirty toxic industry," he said. "And I wanted to express a lot of that."
'Sound & Fury,' the film A 41-minute "Sound & Fury" anime epic, now streaming on Netflix, puts colorful (and unapologetically violent) context to the album.
Simpson, a Navy veteran once stationed in Japan, enlisted acclaimed creative Jumpei Mizusaki to direct, with "Afro Samauri" creator Takashi Okazaki serving as character designer.
The film draws blood-soaked lines between good and evil, a tension illuminated by dystopian chemicals and city-sprawling guerrilla warfare.
It took about $1.2 million to produce, the Times reported and follows "hegemonic structures, politics, corruption, greed – you know, things that usually lead to really (expletive) music," Simpson said.

Texto completo: The great leader envisioned a world where every citizen has dignity and prosperity.
NEW DELHI -- Upon reaching India in 1959, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. remarked, "To other countries I may go as a tourist, but to India I come as a pilgrim." He added, "Perhaps, above all, India is the land where the techniques of nonviolent social change were developed that my people have used in Montgomery, Alabama, and elsewhere throughout the American South. We have found them to be effective and sustaining -- they work!"
The guiding light whose inspiration got Dr. King to India was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the Mahatma, the Great Soul. On Wednesday, we observe his 150th birth anniversary. Gandhi Ji, or Bapu, continues to give courage to millions globally.
Gandhian methods of resistance ignited a spirit of hope among several African nations. Dr. King remarked: "When I was visiting in Ghana, West Africa, Prime Minister Nkrumah told me that he had read the works of Gandhi and felt that nonviolent resistance could be extended there. We recall that South Africa has had bus boycotts also."
Nelson Mandela referred to Gandhi as "the Sacred Warrior" and wrote, "His strategy of noncooperation, his assertion that we can be dominated only if we cooperate with our dominators, and his nonviolent resistance inspired anticolonial and antiracist movements internationally in our century."
For Mr. Mandela, Gandhi was Indian and South African. Gandhi would have approved. He had the unique ability to become a bridge between some of the greatest contradictions in human society.
In 1925, Gandhi wrote in "Young India": "It is impossible for one to be internationalist without being a nationalist. Internationalism is possible only when nationalism becomes a fact, i.e., when peoples belonging to different countries have organized themselves and are able to act as one man." He envisioned Indian nationalism as one that was never narrow or exclusive but one that worked for the service of humanity.
Mahatma Gandhi also epitomized trust among all sections of society. In 1917, Ahmedabad in Gujarat witnessed a huge textile strike. When the conflict between the mill workers and owners escalated to a point of no return, it was Gandhi who mediated an equitable settlement.
Gandhi formed the Majoor Mahajan Sangh, an association for workers' rights. At first sight, it may seem just another name of an organization but it reveals how small steps created a large impact. During those days, "Mahajan" was used as a title of respect for elites. Gandhi inverted the social structure by attaching the name "Mahajan" to "Majoor," or laborers. With that linguistic choice, Gandhi enhanced the pride of workers.
And Gandhi combined ordinary objects with mass politics. Who else could have used a charkha, a spinning wheel, and khadi, Indian homespun cloth, as symbols of economic self-reliance and empowerment for a nation?
Who else could have created a mass agitation through a pinch of salt! During colonial rule, Salt Laws, which placed a new tax on Indian salt, had become a burden. Through the Dandi March in 1930, Gandhi challenged the Salt Laws. His picking up a small lump of natural salt from the Arabian Sea shore led to the historic civil disobedience movement.
There have been many mass movements in the world, many strands of the freedom struggle even in India, but what sets apart the Gandhian struggle and those inspired by him is the wide-scale public participation. He never held administrative or elected office. He was never tempted by power.
For him, independence was not absence of external rule. He saw a deep link between political independence and personal empowerment. He envisioned a world where every citizen has dignity and prosperity. When the world spoke about rights, Gandhi emphasized duties. He wrote in "Young India": "The true source of rights is duty. If we all discharge our duties, rights will not be far to seek." He wrote in the journal Harijan, "Rights accrue automatically to him who duly performs his duties."
Gandhi gave us the doctrine of trusteeship, which emphasized the socio-economic welfare of the poor. Inspired by that, we should think about a spirit of ownership. We, as inheritors of the earth, are responsible for its well-being, including that of the flora and fauna with whom we share our planet.
In Gandhi, we have the best teacher to guide us. From uniting those who believe in humanity to furthering sustainable development and ensuring economic self-reliance, Gandhi offers solutions to every problem.
We in India are doing our bit. India is among the fastest when it comes to eliminating poverty. Our sanitation efforts have drawn global attention. India is also taking the lead in harnessing renewable resources through efforts like the International Solar Alliance, which has brought together several nations to leverage solar energy for a sustainable future. We want to do even more, with the world and for the world.
As a tribute to Gandhi, I propose what I call the Einstein Challenge. We know Albert Einstein's famous words on Gandhi: "Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth."
How do we ensure the ideals of Gandhi are remembered by future generations? I invite thinkers, entrepreneurs and tech leaders to be at the forefront of spreading Gandhi's ideas through innovation.
Let us work shoulder to shoulder to make our world prosperous and free from hate, violence and suffering. That is when we will fulfill Mahatma Gandhi's dream, summed up in his favorite hymn, "Vaishnava Jana To," which says that a true human is one who feels the pain of others, removes misery and is never arrogant.
The world bows to you, beloved Bapu!

Texto completo: Hong Kong police have fired the first shot since the beginning of a series of pro-democracy protests that have lasted all summer in defiance of China's communist regime.
Lawmakers Claudia Mo, James To, and Au Nok-hin said the protester was shot in the Tsuen Wan district of northern Hong Kong, according to the New York Times.
Police superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan said the officer "felt his life was under serious threat."
"The round hit an 18-year-old, and the area near his left shoulder was injured, and he was conscious when taken to Princess Margaret Hospital," she said. "The police force really did not want to see anyone being injured, so we feel very sad about this. We warn rioters to stop breaking the law immediately, as we will strictly enforce the law."
The shooting comes as protesters gathered to counter march a Beijing-controlled celebration of 70 years of Chinese Communist Party power. President Trump took to Twitter Tuesday morning to congratulate President Xi Jinping for the country's anniversary.
"Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China!" he said.
Tweet
Hong Kong police have escalated tensions recently, adopting China's description of protests as potential terrorism.
"The extent of violence, danger and destruction have reached very serious conditions," Hong Kong's secretary for security John Lee said earlier this month. "Radical people have escalated their violent and illegal acts, showing elements of terror."
Hong Kong police have arrested pro-democracy leaders as a part of "unlawful" assemblies in an attempt to squelch dissent.
Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued a statement condemning the shooting by police and denouncing the Chinese communist regime for the violence in Hong Kong.
"Today Chinese tyrants celebrated 70 years of communist oppression with their typically brutal symbolism: by sending a police officer to shoot a pro-democracy protester at point-blank range," he said Tuesday. "The freedom-seekers in Hong Kong mourn this anniversary, and the American people stand with them against those who deny their God-given dignity."

Paul Krugman: Elizabeth Warren vs. the petty plutocrats

Texto completo: Remember when pundits used to argue that Elizabeth Warren wasn’t likable enough to be president? It was always a lazy take, with a strong element of sexism. And it looks ridiculous now, watching Warren on the campaign trail. Never mind whether she’s someone you’d like to have a beer with, she’s definitely someone thousands of people want to take selfies with.
But there are some people who really, really dislike Warren: the ultrawealthy, especially on Wall Street. They dislike her so much that some longtime Democratic donors are reportedly considering throwing their backing behind Donald Trump, corruption, collusion and all, if Warren is the Democratic presidential nominee.
And Warren’s success is a serious possibility, because Warren’s steady rise has made her a real contender, maybe even the front-runner: While she still trails Joe Biden a bit in the polls, betting markets currently give her a roughly 50% chance of securing the nomination.
But why does Warren inspire a level of hatred and fear among the very wealthy that I don’t think we’ve seen directed at a presidential candidate since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt?
On the surface, the answer may seem obvious. She is proposing policies, notably a tax on fortunes exceeding $50 million, that would make the extremely wealthy a bit less so. But delve into the question a bit more deeply, and Warren hatred becomes considerably more puzzling.
For the only people who would be directly affected by her tax proposals are those who more or less literally have more money than they know what to do with. Having a million or two less wouldn’t crimp their lifestyles; most of them would barely notice the change.
At the same time, even the very wealthy should be very afraid of the prospect of a Trump reelection. Any doubts you might have had about his authoritarian instincts should have been put to rest by his reaction to the possibility of impeachment: implicit death threats against whistleblowers, warnings of civil war and claims that members of Congress investigating him are guilty of treason.
And anyone imagining that great wealth would make them safe from an autocrat’s wrath should look at the list of Russian oligarchs who crossed Vladimir Putin — and are now ruined or dead.
So what would make the very wealthy — even some Jewish billionaires, who should have a very good idea of the likely consequences of right-wing dominance — support Trump over someone like Warren?
There is, I’d argue, an important clue in the “Obama rage” that swept Wall Street circa 2010. Objectively, the Obama administration was very good to the financial industry, even though that industry had just led us into the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Major financial players were bailed out on lenient terms, and while bankers were subjected to a long-overdue increase in regulation, the new regulations have proved fairly easy for reputable firms to deal with.
Yet financial tycoons were furious with President Barack Obama because they felt disrespected. In truth, Obama’s rhetoric was very mild; all he ever did was suggest that some bankers had behaved badly, which no reasonable person could deny. But with great wealth comes great pettiness; Obama’s gentle rebukes provoked fury — and a huge swing in financial industry political contributions toward Republicans.
The point is that many of the superrich aren’t satisfied with living like kings, which they will continue to do no matter who wins next year’s election. They also expect to be treated like kings, lionized as job creators and heroes of prosperity, and consider any criticism an unforgivable act of lèse-majesté.
And for such people, the prospect of a Warren presidency is a nightmarish threat — not to their wallets, but to their egos. They can try to brush off someone like Bernie Sanders as a rabble-rouser. But when Warren criticizes malefactors of great wealth and proposes reining in their excesses, her evident policy sophistication — has any previous candidate managed to turn wonkiness into a form of charisma? — makes her critique much harder to dismiss.
If Warren is the nominee, then, a significant number of tycoons will indeed go for Trump; better to put democracy at risk than to countenance a challenge to their imperial self-esteem. But will it matter?
Maybe not. These days American presidential elections are so awash in money that both sides can count on having enough resources to saturate the airwaves.
Indeed, over-the-top attacks from the wealthy can sometimes be a political plus. That was certainly the case for FDR, who reveled in his plutocratic opposition: “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”
So far Warren seems to be following the same playbook, tweeting out articles about Wall Street’s hostility as if they were endorsements, which in a sense they are. It’s good to have the right enemies.
I do worry, however, how Wall Streeters will take it if they go all out to defeat Warren and she wins anyway. Washington can bail out their balance sheets, but who can bail out their damaged psyches?

Texto completo: Valley Stream's Alexcia Smith, who has worked as a private chef for such music stars as Alicia Keys and Bow Wow, pits her talents against the titular star of Food Network's "Beat Bobby Flay" Thursday at 10 p.m.
Writer-comedian Tina Fey was a guest judge for that episode's competition, in which two chefs cook against each other in a first round with the winner taking on chef-restaurateur Flay in round two. "She's so cool, really awesome, down to earth," says Smith, 34, who was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and raised in Hempstead. "She was in my corner from the minute the show started. When she was critiquing my dish, even though I didn't think it was my best, she said, 'No, it's better than you think.' It gave me that extra sense of confidence I didn't have."
Smith, who had learned cooking from her father while growing up, found her culinary niche during high school in Hempstead. After completing her required courses by junior year, she found herself done with her remaining classes by 9:30 a.m. "My guidance counselor said, 'We can't have you walking around the hallways,' so he introduced me to the idea of culinary programs, since my chosen electives were always home-ec classes."
While retaining her plans to go to medical school and become a plastic surgeon, she began studying culinary arts at BOCES, New York State's vocation-oriented Board of Cooperative Educational Services. Despite the hopes of her parents, mom Delores and dad Lloyd, med school went by the wayside.
"It was so amazing," she says of discovering her niche. "My instructor said, 'You really have a knack for this.' " He helped find her a job at Garden City's since-closed Viking Culinary Arts Center, a showroom for the kitchen-appliance maker. In its in-store kitchen, "I was able to work with a variety of different chefs who did demonstrations, like Tom Colicchio and Dorie Greenspan." She went on to earn a 2006 Bachelor's degree from The Culinary Institute of America.
Her parents eventually came around, and Smith - who has a twin sister and a younger brother - went on to work for Restaurant Associates, managing food service for The New York Times and later Condé Nast. She left in 2013 to become a private chef - presently for a Manhattan-based celebrity she cannot name - and pursue such other ventures as her organic-granola brand in.grain.ed, sold through Hamptons farm stands.
A friend from the Hamptons, where Smith spends part of her year, recommended her for the show. "My neighbor Ellen, a sweet-as-pie older woman," Smith says. "One night my family came to the Hamptons and I made shrimp pasta, nothing fancy. And I invited Ellen over to meet my family and eat with us."
Ellen, it turned out, was a close friend of a "Beat Bobby Flay" producer, who called Smith to be on the show.
"I thought it was a prank," Smith says. "I didn't call him back, so he sends me a text message. That's when I thought, 'Maybe this is real!' "

Texto completo: The beginning of the fall race meeting brought hopes that a series of changes would stop the carnage. On the second day, another death.
ARCADIA, Calif. -- The most critical racing meeting in the 85-year history of Santa Anita racetrack opened on Friday amid a swirl of new safety measures, personnel changes and nerves.
Thirty horses died at the racetrack in a six-month stretch that ended in late June, so the Stronach Group -- the track's owner -- rolled out a series of reforms designed to better protect the thoroughbreds from catastrophic injury and put government authorities, animal-rights activists and the public as a whole at ease.
On Saturday, however, a 3-year-old colt named Emtech collapsed in the stretch with both his front legs broken and had to be euthanized, which, if history is any indication, will most likely renew doubts about the industry's will to reform and lead to calls for the sport to be closed altogether.
It was the 32nd horse fatality (one died earlier in the month while training) at the famed California racetrack since December, and it came just days after Gov. Gavin Newsom called the deaths a "disgrace." He warned that horse racing was dangerously close to being out of business in his state.
And yet Santa Anita's problems are hardly isolated. The horse deaths here have put a bull's-eye on the sport and focused unwanted attention on other racing circuits that are having, or have had, deadly race meets.
Nearly 10 horses a week on average died at American racetracks in 2018, according to the Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database. That figure is anywhere from two and a half to five times greater than the fatality rate in Europe and Asia, where rules against performance-enhancing drugs are enforced more stringently.
At Belmont Park in New York, home of the Belmont Stakes, there have been seven fatalities because of injuries over the past 18 race days -- four in afternoon racing and three in morning training hours. On Friday, the Keeneland fall meet, an elite and highly anticipated race meeting in Lexington, Ky., will open amid heightened anxiety after a troubling rash of horse fatalities in its spring meet.
Keeneland had four race-related deaths -- three on dirt and one on turf -- over the course of its 16 racing days, for a rate of 3.12 fatalities per 1,000 starts, or almost twice the national average.
California has adopted some of the most aggressive drug and safety reforms in the nation, but the death of Emtech on Saturday is likely to give fuel to skeptics who wonder if the track has gone far enough to create a safer environment and whether the members of the California Horse Racing Board are up to the task of policing the sport. Earlier this month, The New York Times revealed that the 2018 Triple Crown champion, Justify, had failed a drug test before the Kentucky Derby, but that those regulators secretly decided not to pursue any punishment.
Kathy Guillermo, a senior vice president at the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, called on the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to release the findings of a continuing investigation into the horse deaths in California. Guillermo and PETA have been working closely with the Stronach Group and regulators on rule changes.
"Tragically, we have no answers, no mandate for the use of CT scan technology to detect the pre-existing injuries that cause broken ankles, no switch to safer synthetic tracks -- which PETA has requested -- and no end in sight to the deaths," she said in a statement. "The horses may not get a funeral, but racing is certainly digging its own grave.
Emtech had a history of physical problems.
In October 2018, the colt was claimed -- or purchased for the price of $ 75,000 -- by another owner after his debut race at Santa Anita. Standard procedure calls for state veterinarians to inspect any horse whose ownership changes. After that inspection, Emtech was found to be unsound, and the sale was voided.
The colt was then placed on a list for observation by state veterinarians. He remained there until June, when he passed the required workout for removal from the list, according to California regulators.
He was on the panel's special post-entry and pre-raceday examination list for a race in July at Los Alamitos Race Course in Cypress, Calif., and one in August at Del Mar near San Diego.
"After passing 5 examinations and racing successfully for those races, he was not flagged by the panel for special attention in his subsequent races other than his required pre-race examinations," Rick Arthur, the equine medical director for California, said in a statement.
Dr. Dionne Benson, chief veterinarian for the Stronach Group, said the company would "open an immediate review into what factors could have contributed to Emtech's injury."
In New York, the state's gaming commission said that "nothing has gone wrong" in its safety and medication protocols.
In 2012, after 21 horses died at tracks run by the New York Racing Association over a similar time span as Santa Anita's, a government-appointed task force issued a critical report on how industry officials prioritized filling races over ensuring that horses were fit. Stricter medication rules and safety protocols were put in place.
Despite its best efforts, the gaming commission says it cannot eliminate catastrophic injuries in the sport.
"The commission's risk management program includes real-time risk assessment, the development and testing of protective factors to reduce risk, and follow-up monitoring to ensure progressive reduction of racing injuries, but it will not eliminate equine injuries," the commission said in a statement.
