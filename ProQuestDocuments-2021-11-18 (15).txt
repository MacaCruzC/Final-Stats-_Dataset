Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Women who were once FBI recruits sued the bureau Wednesday, accusing it of running a "good-old-boy network" at its training academy that discriminates against women, in some cases because of race and disabilities in addition to gender, and sets them up to fail.
Male instructors at the academy in Quantico, Virginia, exposed the women beginning in 2015 to a hostile work environment, sexual harassment and inappropriate jokes, according to the lawsuit.
One woman said that an instructor referred to an African-American female trainee as "spaghetti head," a reference to her braids. The woman also said training agents made repeated sexual advances.
In particular, the lawsuit takes aim at the tactical training that plays out Hogan's Alley, the academy's mock town where hired actors play terrorists and criminals. Trainees practice making dangerous arrests where they use weapons. Many of the female agent recruits were kicked out of the academy during this phase more quickly and more often than men.
"The real purpose of the suit is to change the culture of the FBI," said David J. Shaffer, the lawyer for the women.
The suit also named the former FBI director James B. Comey, who is accused by one woman of dismissing her complaints, and Mark Morgan, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who oversaw the academy as a former top FBI official and was involved in the dismissal of female trainees. Comey declined to comment. Morgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sixteen women sued, seven of whom continue to work for the FBI. Some women did not use their full names, fearing retaliation. As part of the lawsuit, they asked for a review of the training evaluation process; $300,000 each for emotional stress; end more female training instructors.
The FBI declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said in a statement that it was "committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected." Internal figures provided by the FBI show the bureau's efforts to recruit more women are gaining traction. The FBI said the number of women applying to be agents had increased to 36% this year from 22% in 2017,' surpassing the bureau's goal of 33% for the current fiscal year.
Attorney General William P. Barr said last month that he had directed the Justice Department to investigate accusations of discrimination, including claims that the FBI academy forced out male potential agents for not being "masculine enough."
The lawsuit comes as the FBI, historically a male-dominated law enforcement agency, is trying to increase its ranks of female agents. Women made up only a fifth of the bureau's 13,500 agents as of October, and few women work in the agency's top echelons.
In the lawsuit, a majority of the women took issue with many aspects of the FBI's agent training program. It typically lasts 20 weeks and involves firearms, academics, defensive tactics and navigating high-risk situations.
According to the lawsuit, instructors overseeing the tactical training, most of whom are men, penalized and dismissed female trainees at a "rate significantly and disproportionately higher than their male counterparts." The men, the lawsuit said, are allowed to retake tactical exams while women are denied the same opportunity.
When the women tried to defend their decision-making or their actions, instructors admonished them for lacking integrity or emotional maturity, they said in the lawsuit.
They also accused instructors of employing a double standard for men. "When male trainees do the same, they are praised for having a 'command presence,'" the lawsuit said.
One of the women, Clare Coetzer, washed out of training in June 2018 after passing all the previous required courses. During training, she was written up four times and given a warning that the FBI calls a "suitability notice," which put her in jeopardy of being kicked out of the program.
But, Coetzer said, a male instructor rescinded two such notices that male colleagues received. She said she performed well on future tests but was still bounced from training.
Another woman, Erika Wesley, worked for the FBI for six years, completing an assignment in Baghdad before leaving the agency in 2010 before her first child was born. She attended training in 2018 to become an analyst. Wesley said she was subjected to "inappropriate sexually charged commentary" by .male instructors, with some saying that women needed to take birth control to control their moods.
When Lauren Rose, who works in the FBI's Miami field office, complained in an email in 2015 to Comey, the director at the time, about discriminatory practices, he rebuffed her. Comey suggested she use her "pain" to reflect on strengths and weaknesses, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit says Morgan was involved in Rose's dismissal from the academy in 2015 and that he took issue with her "attitude" at the time. Rose said in the lawsuit she had "exemplary history of performance reviews" before her training and after as an FBI employee.
Female trainees were sometimes offered other FBI positions after being kicked out of training but were "forced to take positions several grades lower than their previous grade or experience justified," according to the lawsuit.
Some of the same women filed a complaint last year with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accusing the FBI of engaging in similar practices. Shaffer said his clients decided to sue after the FBI ignored the complaint.
"I asked the FBI twice to sit down before this lawsuit, and the FBI would not respond to me," Shaffer said. "It's very unusual."
In two previous class-action lawsuits, Shaffer said, the FBI had been responsive.
The women are receiving support from the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which fights workplace sexual harassment and discrimination.

Texto completo: Oh yeah, the Finals.
The NBA season is supposed to lead dramatically to this point but was widely believed to be over before it started with the Warriors coming off three titles in four seasons … having lost the one in 2016 after leading the Cavaliers 3-1… with no LeBron James-led contender arising in the East to worry about.
Instead, it’s the Toronto Raptors with their star/upcoming free agent, Kawhi Leonard, and trash-talking rapper/co-owner, Drake, representing the East and, in an upset, taking a 1-0 lead.
Unfortunately, Leonard played hurt last series as his uncle/adviser, Dennis Robertson, told Yahoo’s Chris Haynes (“You could clearly see he was in pain.”)
Nor did Kawhi look too bouncy in Game 1, scoring 23 points and shooting 5 for 14 from the field.
So, lead or no lead, good luck, Raptors!
The matchup looked so one-sided, Warriors players were being asked before it started if Steph Curry would finally be the Finals MVP … based, of course, on the assumption that injured Kevin Durant won’t be a major factor and that wouldn’t matter to the team.
Meanwhile, the New York Times’ Marc Stein introduced his plan for the anticipated walkover: multiple postseason tournaments like European soccer teams.
Compounding the absurdity, Commissioner Adam Silver told Stein that a second “cup” was “in the conceptual phase.”
As if the league needs a new attraction with a boffo comedy going as Magic Johnson continued to bash the Lakers while pledging undying love to them?
It was another crazy week with ESPN.com’s Baxter Holmes producing a 6,500-word opus on Johnson’s misbegotten era … while ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith melted down on the air, decrying his own company’s story.
Smith is Magic’s guy at The Wide World of Sports. As Stephen A. actually noted, he was embarrassed to have Johnson coming in the same day Holmes’ piece ran, in which Magic was alleged to be an abusive boss who had several Lakers staffers resigning and/or taking anti-anxiety medication.
Ranted Stephen A. in Johnson’s defense:
“Oh my god! Let’s get the ax! Let’s take Magic Johnson to the guillotine!”
Of course, with Johnson determined to keep going on the air to defend himself, these coincidences in timing are becoming common … like the week before when Magic went on to call GM Rob Pelinka a back-stabber, the same day the Lakers introduced Coach Frank Vogel in their first press conference since Johnson’s resignation 41 days before.
In the part we didn’t know before, Holmes reported James’ agent, Rich Paul, waged a season-long campaign against Coach Luke Walton.
This was confirmed by Silver, himself. In an early-season chance meeting, the commissioner said Paul told him something to the effect of, “Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.”
Assuming that Paul’s opinions followed James’, and Johnson’s followed LeBron’s, this explains why Magic went off on Walton at the seven-game mark, turning Luke into a lame duck.
LeBron knows he’s held to the highest standards and has done this before, trying and failing to get Erik Spoelstra fired in Miami, succeeding in getting David Blatt fired in Cleveland.
In this, James was joined by Johnson, feeling exposed after his controversial decisions to forego shooters and sign eccentrics such as JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley.
Not that Magic was supposed to take orders from James. With LeBron locked up for three seasons, it was the other way around.
It was Johnson’s job to make James understand they might have to sacrifice this season to finish rebuilding after saving a maximum salary slot and bringing in so many veterans on one-year deals.
What Magic wasn’t supposed to do was go off on Walton before Thanksgiving on LeBron’s behalf, undercutting what little stability they had.
Of course, conveying that message meant realizing it, himself. By all accounts, Magic didn’t, talking of building for the future while challenging Golden State at the same time.
A Lakers staffer told Holmes he didn’t know if Johnson had a plan. Actually, Magic did … or LeBron did … and it was a dilly: Trade for Anthony Davis, off-loading enough salary to save their max slot for another star free agent to put alongside James.
Unfortunately for Magic, it proved impossible with New Orleans blaming the Lakers for their heavy-handed, obviously LeBron-driven, wooing of A.D.
Worst of all for Johnson, he wasn’t working at the Lakers job full-time and couldn’t live it down when it got into the press.
“And last but not least, lazy?” Magic told Stephen A. last week, re-framing the charge into one he could lampoon.
“I have built a $600 million business. You can not be lazy going from basketball and winning five championships. … I wasn’t lazy as a player and I’m not lazy as a CEO and a business owner. That’s never going to happen.”
Of course, no one said he was lazy. The charge was that he wasn’t often in the Lakers’ office, which he hasn’t addressed.
Holmes, noting Johnson’s many business interests, suggests he was in their office “once a week or every two weeks.”
Infrequent as that was, it could have been OK if Johnson had a smooth working relationship with an experienced No. 2 man who assigned all the detail work.
Imagine if Jeanie Buss had kept GM Mitch Kupchak, who had all the qualifications, instead of lumping Mitch in with her brother, Jim, when she fired him.
The No. 2 man became Pelinka, an agent, hired at the suggestion of his client, Kobe Bryant, neither of whom had front office experience.
As for Johnson’s inconceivable charge of being stabbed in the back … still unspecified aside from citing “little things that bothered me” … he had more than two seasons with Pelinka. If loyalty was an issue, Magic should have been able to tell long before.
Unfortunately for the Lakers and Jeanie, who kept Pelinka, Rob is now lumped in with Johnson in the press, as if he was Magic’s partner in crime … setting up Pelinka as the scapegoat for the next thing that goes wrong.
Actually, Pelinka looks more like another of the staffers Magic ran roughshod over.
Pelinka, reported Holmes, survived with the avid support of Jeanie’s best friend and new Lakers power player, Linda Rambis.
Now to see how long any of them, Rob and/or Linda, last.
If there’s a silver lining for Lakers fans, it’s that the heat in the press is exposing an organization run on nepotism and cronyism, which Jeanie might finally be obliged to recognize and professionalize.
Of course, that suggests more misadventures await in the meantime so buckle up.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In 1968, a young sportswriter named Brent Musburger wrote a column for a long-forgotten newspaper called The Chicago American. He wrote about the Olympic protests of John Carlos and Tommie Smith, who raised their black-gloved fists on the podium after winning medals in the 200-meter sprint at the Summer Games in Mexico City.
The headline on Musburger's story, according to The Nation, was "Bizarre Protest by Smith, Carlos Tarnishes Medals. "
The notable line from Musburger, who was 29 at the time: "Smith and Carlos looked like a couple of black-skinned storm troopers. "
Fifty-one years later, during a panel discussion Thursday about athletes and activism hosted by The Atlantic, Carlos was asked by moderator Jemele Hill whether he ever received an apology from Musburger for that column. Musburger, of course, went on to become a renowned sports commentator for ABC and ESPN, among others.
"Well you know, Brent Musburger doesn't even exist in my mind. So I don't even know," Carlos said to applause. "He didn't mean anything to me 51 years ago. He doesn't mean anything to me today. Because he's been proven to be wrong. "
Musburger, who is now 80, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. However, in a 1999 interview, he told The New York Times that his column was "a bit harsh" while continuing to question the effect of the protest.
"Did it improve anything?'' Musburger told the Times two decades ago. "Smith and Carlos aside, I object to using the Olympic awards stand to make a political statement. "
Musburger, who currently works for sports gambling network VSiN and serves as the radio play-by-play voice of the Oakland Raiders, referred to Carlos and Smith's protests in his 1968 column as "a juvenile gesture by a couple of athletes who should have known better. " He also wrote that Smith would be remembered as a "militant black. "
Carlos did not return to the topic of Musburger after his initial exchange with Hill, but he did speak at length about his iconic protest during Thursday's event, which also featured appearances by U. S. hockey star Hilary Knight, former U. S. women's soccer goalkeeper Briana Scurry and former NFL player Martellus Bennett, among others.
EX-NFL PLAYER SPEAKS OUT: Martellus Bennett: White quarterback would change conversation on NFL player protests
The 73-year-old also spoke about the repercussions of his action — and how he responded to people who argued that he should "stick to sports" or "shut up and play," which has again become a familiar complaint against outspoken athletes.
"I don't pay attention to people that don't make sense," Carlos said. "They didn't make any sense to Jack Johnson, or to Jackie Robinson, because they told them the same thing. . . . All of them received the same note that they put under my door: 'Just shut up and play the game. '
"I'm not concerned about those individuals who tell me to just go out there and play sports. Because before I was an athlete, I was a human being. When I die, I will be that human being. "

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A Republican redistricting expert advocated for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census to give an electoral edge to whites and Republicans, opponents of the move alleged in a court filing Thursday.
The filing in Manhattan federal court said a trove of newly discovered documents revealed that Thomas Hofeller, a longtime Republican gerrymandering guru, played a key role in pushing the Trump administration to include a citizenship question on the census for the first time since 1950.
Lawyers for opponents of adding the question said the files, found on Hofeller's computer drives after he died last year, also showed that he contributed vital language to a Justice Department letter used to justify the question on the grounds that it was needed to protect minority voting rights.
In reality, the lawyers argued, the documents show the census change is part of a wider Republican effort to restrict the political power of Democrats and Latino communities.
"The new evidence reveals that Dr. Thomas Hofeller, the longtime Republican redistricting specialist, played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' and that defendants obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations, the filing said.
The change, announced in spring 2018, seems poised for approval by the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments in April and is likely to rule by July. It's not yet clear if the Hofeller documents might affect the pending case, though the American Civil Liberties Union apprised the high court of the latest developments Thursday in a letter signed by Dale Ho, director of the group's voting rights project and a lawyer who argued against adding the question before the top court.
States, cities and rights groups had sued in New York and elsewhere, arguing that the question would suppress the count of immigrants and strengthen congressional representation and funding for areas where mostly Republicans reside. States with large numbers of immigrants tend to vote Democratic.
Lawyers for President Donald Trump's administration say the commerce secretary has wide discretion to design the census questionnaire.
On Thursday, lawyers for groups including the ACLU said that the files show that a Justice Department official and a transition official for President Donald Trump testified falsely by hiding Hofeller's role in asking for the question. They asked U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman to issue sanctions or consider finding individuals in contempt.
Ho, of the ACLU, said documents found after Hofeller's death last year revealed the administration's "goal was to dilute the voting power of minority communities. That's literally the diametric opposite of what the administration has been saying all along.
Furman gave the Justice Department until Monday to respond. An official with the department declined to comment on the record.
Furman set a hearing in the case for June 5.
The Hofeller documents cited by lawyers were discovered when his estranged daughter found four external computer hard drives and 18 thumb drives in her father's Raleigh, North Carolina, home after his death last summer.
The New York Times reported that she contacted Common Cause, which had recently sued in state court to challenge North Carolina's legislative districts, which had been drawn by Hofeller.
Furman, the federal judge, ruled in January that the question could not be included on the census, saying fewer people would respond to the census and that the process used to add it was faulty. Federal judges in California and Maryland reached similar conclusions in separate lawsuits.
Besides the citizenship question, the Supreme Court also is expected to decide within weeks, in cases from North Carolina and Maryland, whether to set limits for the first time on drawing districts for partisan advantage.

Texto completo: Lin-Manuel Miranda came from seeing "Spamilton: An American Parody" and tweeted, "I laughed my brains out."
That endorsement from the "Hamilton" creator and a rave in The New York Times made "Spamilton" a hot ticket during its off-Broadway run and a hit for Gerard Alessandrini, the creator of "Forbidden Broadway." "Spamilton" includes dozens of references to "Hamilton" and its stars, plus as many musical theater and pop culture touchstones as Alessandrini could manage in a breakneck 90 minutes.
Miranda, who created and starred in "Hamilton," is a main character in the show and "my fantasy of what he might be thinking," is how Alessandrini puts it. "I know him a little bit, but not that well."
During a performance early in "Spamilton's" original run, Alessandrini's gaze was fixed on audience members Miranda, director Thomas Kail and orchestrator Alex Lacamoire - Tony winners all for "Hamilton" and "In the Heights." Their reaction included "rolling over laughing." Another good sign: Miranda gave the cast tickets to "Hamilton."
Alessandrini was speaking by phone a week after checking out Pittsburgh CLO's "Spamilton,"which runs through Aug. 25 at the Greer Cabaret, Downtown. He refers to Pittsburgh as a "sit-down company" rather than a local production. Other "sit-downs" are in L.A. and Chicago, while most cities are getting a shorter-stay tour. He praised CLO executive director Van Kaplan, "who certainly knows what he's doing," and noted that original choreographer Gerry McIntyre directs and choreographs the CLO show.
T.J. Newton plays Miranda and Alexander Hamilton alongside Justin Lonesome (George Washington, Ben Franklin, others); CLO newcomer Erin Ramirez (leading ladies); LaTrea Rembert (Daveed Diggs, others); Tru Verret-Fleming (Aaron Burr, Leslie Odom Jr.) and Nick Stamatakis (keyboards and King George).
Alessandrini has transformed "Hamilton's" 20,000 words over 2½ hours into a 90-minute comedy with no intermission. His "Spamilton" rewards the knowledge of the hordes of Hamilfans who are drawn to the title, but he also draws on his "Forbidden Broadway" formula and doesn't skimp on the influences and inspirations that led to Broadway's biggest hit, from "Camelot" to "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," from Liza Minnelli to Beyonce.
"Forbidden Broadway" debuted off-Broadway in 1982 and ran for 2,332 performances. CLO performed the show in 2006 - the same year it was awarded the Tony Award for Excellence in Theatre. Nearly two dozen editions of the parody revue have been performed, but "Spamilton" is the first to challenge Alessandrini with the rhythms and rhymes of rap.
"Even though the length of 'Spamilton' is the same as a 'Forbidden Broadway,' the script is maybe three times as long," he says. "In most musicals, it takes a minute to three minutes to read through a page. When you're doing 'Spamilton' - or 'Hamilton,' for that matter - it takes about 30 seconds to read through a page. That's the fun of rap; it's an avalanche of words."
"What's harder," Alessandrini added, "is taking an Irving Berlin song that doesn't have much room for expression, because it's so concise. But in rap, there's a lot of room to say a lot of funny things. "Within the references from Broadway to rap classics, Alessandrini pays his usual homage to Stephen Sondheim, who came to see "Spamilton" and offered his congratulations.
"When he called for tickets, the first thing I heard was, 'So, I hear I'm Yoda,'" Alessandrini says. "He understands that it's healthy to take people down. But I also think it's a pretty good tribute to make him Ben Franklin."
Alessandrini's intention is to spoof, not to skewer, and for the most part he has mastered the art of how to leave them laughing.

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
BEING IN THE bartending world, Pamela Wiznitzer said, is a lot like going to Chabad. Bear with her for a second.
In her professional world, the one where she's been among the top 10 finalists for "American Bartender of the Year" three times and was the "2014 Bartender of the Year," as decided upon by the Village Voice, she finds that she can go anywhere in the world and find a community of likeminded folks. She knows that all she has to do to find a friend and maybe a free drink in any city in the world is ask another mixologist in her circle if they know anyone there.
So, too, has been her experience with Chabad. When she was last in Honolulu, she walked into the local Chabad house and felt at home immediately.
"The parallels are uncanny," she said.
Wiznitzer is in Philadelphia for the Big Apple Circus, a onering circus that put some extra juice into its food and beverage program this year. Wiznitzer, who knew of Big Apple through some friends who used to work for the company, will lead the cocktail program for the VIP tent, serving drinks like "Swing Time" (Flor de Caña rum, lime, hibiscus, pearl luster and bubbly wine) and Howl at the Moon (Tullamore Dew Whiskey, lemon, cinnamon, chai, honey and bitters). The circus will be in town through June 16 at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks.
Wiznitzer was born in New York but grew up in Cleveland, where her father was a doctor and her mother was a part-time teacher. She remembers her days in the tight-knit Cleveland Jewish community fondly, where Jews of all stripes lived together happily.
"There's a place for everyone," she said. "It's judgment free." Most importantly, "it was just a place where you could be Jewish and you weren't afraid to be Jewish."
However, she did find herself looking for a little bit more; after attending Jewish day school until seventh grade, she felt that she needed to expand her horizons beyond the Jewish community.
"I was living a very homogeneous life," she said, "and it made me very uncomfortable." She started to going to public school in Shaker Heights, a notably diverse area, and remains thankful for the decision.
It was a similar rationale that brought her to Barnard and the Jewish Theological Seminary, schools she chose partially for their Jewish population, but also because, simply enough, the Princeton Review ranked them as especially diverse schools. It was at these schools where she was first introduced to mixology.
Sort of. Her first encounter with the world of serious bartending happened as it does for many students: making drinks for her friends before heading out for the night.
"All of us played bartender in our dorm room at some point, right?" she said.
Her junior year, some of her friends at the Columbia Bartending Academy enticed her to sign up with the promise of developing good skills, but also with the idea that they could take home some of the leftover alcohol at the end of the evening to be used for their own purposes.
"It was kind of like a joke to do it," she said.
It elevated to more than that soon - she was mixing drinks and getting occasional bartending gigs to make extra cash. Then a recession came and suddenly there was nothing jokey about it all. She became a bartender full time, working at a sports bar in Murray Hill during day shifts. Wiznitzer found quickly that not only did she enjoy the work, she was actually "really good at it," as she said. She rose quickly, especially after her parents asked her when she would get a "real job"; what better way to get a "real job" than to turn the one she had into something "real?"
She began attending the Steinhardt School at NYU, where she pursued a master's in food studies. At the same time, she began to apply to prestigious cocktail bars. A friend set her up with an interview at The Dead Rabbit in the financial district.
The Dead Rabbit became known widely, in no small part, thanks to the drinks being created by Wiznitzer. In her 2½ years there, she found herself getting noticed; she appeared on television, and was featured in articles everywhere from The New York Times to Bar Business Magazine.

How did she handle that?
"I've been prepared my whole life for anything that comes my way," she said. "You just kind of do it."
She took oif from The Dead Rabbit in summer 2014, and went on a fact-finding mission across the country, to "teach myself how America drinks," she said. She eventually returned to her old stomping grounds, but decided she wanted to take her work up a notch, and became the creative director at an Upper East Side bar called Seamstress, a place typically devoid of cocktail culture, she said.
For a time, it was an absolute joy, taking on a level of responsibility she hadn't previously had; in the end, Seamstress closed, but she's grateful for the experience, and finds that her independence as a beverage consultant for large companies allows her some added flexibility.
But it all comes back to what got her into the business in the first place: making drinks as creatively as she can.
"It's a great outlet to just let your wildest dreams manifest themselves in a creation in a glass," she said. *

Texto completo: Early LGBT rights activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera will be commemorated with a monument in New York's Greenwich Village, near the epicenter of the historic Stonewall riots.
The monument was publicly announced Thursday in honor of the 50th anniversary of Stonewall and just in time for Pride month.
“We hope this monument is a lasting tribute to two women who devoted themselves to life-saving change for people throughout their community," said Gillian Branstetter of the National Center for Transgender Equality to USA TODAY in an e-mail.
"Transgender history is American history, and lasting recognition of the work done by those who came before us is a crucial step towards honoring the past and reaching the future Marsha and Sylvia worked to build. ”
Johnson and Rivera were key figures in the Stonewall riots of 1969, in which gay patrons fought against a police raid. At the time, New York refused to grant licenses to bars that served gay people. It resulted in police entering Stonewall Inn with a warrant on June 28, 1969, where they arrested 13 people.
“The majority of people at Stonewall were either drag queens or gay men of color,” Titus Montalvo, a hairdresser and makeup artist who was 16 at the time, told USA TODAY.
Johnson and Rivera went on to co-found STAR – Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries – an organization that served young, homeless trans youth. The term "transgender" was not used commonly in their lifetime. Johnson later became involved with the AIDS charity ACT UP in the 1980s.
The monument, which is estimated to cost $750,000 according to the New York Times, will honor the two trans pioneers posthumously. Johnson died at 46 in 1992, in what was ruled twenty years later as a possible homicide, while Rivera died in 2002 at 50 from liver cancer complications.

Skipping Breakfast Could Aid Weight Battle

Texto completo: Skipping breakfast before exercise might reduce how much we eat during the remainder of the day, according to a small but intriguing new study of fit young men.
The study finds that the choice to eat or omit a meal before an early workout could affect our relationship to food for the rest of the day, in complicated and sometimes unexpected ways.
Weight management is, of course, one of the great public - and private - health concerns of our time. But the role of exercise in helping people to maintain, lose or, in some instances, add pounds is problematic. Exercise burns calories, but in many past studies, people who begin a new exercise program do not lose as much weight as would be expected, because they often compensate for the energy used during exercise by eating more later or moving less.
These compensations, usually subtle and unintended, indicate that our brains are receiving internal communiques detailing how much energy we used during that last workout and, in response, sending biological signals that increase hunger or reduce our urge to move. Our helpful brains do not wish us to sustain an energy deficit and starve.
Previous studies show that many aspects of eating and exercise can affect how much people compensate for the calories burned during exercise, including the type and length of the exercise and the fitness and weight of the exercisers.
Skipping or consuming breakfast also can matter. When we eat a meal, our bodies rely on the carbohydrates in those foods as a primary source of energy. Some of those carbohydrates are stored in our bodies, but those internal stores of carbohydrates are small compared to the stores of fat. Some researchers believe that our brains might pay particular attention to any reductions in our carbohydrate levels and rush to replace them.
This is where breakfast comes in. If we skip eating in the morning, we have no calories from a meal available for fuel during exercise and instead will rely on - and reduce - our internal carbohydrate stores, along with some of our fat.
Some researchers have speculated that we might then wind up overcompensating later, eating more calories than we burned during the workout and undermining our efforts to maintain or lose weight.
But that possibility had not been investigated. So, for the new study, which was published in April in The Journal of Nutrition, scientists from the University of Bath in England and other institutions decided to look more closely at how breakfast and exercise interact.
They first recruited 12 healthy, active young men and asked them to report to the university’s exercise lab on three separate mornings. On one morning, the men ate a hearty, 430-calorie bowl of oatmeal and rested for several hours.
Another morning, they swallowed the same porridge before riding a bike moderately for an hour.
On a third visit, they skipped the porridge but rode the bike, not eating at all until lunch.
Each time, the men stayed at the lab through lunch, eating as much or little at that meal as they wished. The scientists also handed the men food baskets to take home, asking them to eat only from the basket and return uneaten portions, so the researchers could track their daily calories. They also used respiratory masks and mathematical formulas to estimate their 24-hour energy expenditure.
Then the scientists compared numbers, with some results they had not predicted.
Least surprising, the men wound up with an energy surplus when they had breakfasted and then sat, taking in about 490 more calories that day than they burned.
When they downed porridge and then worked out, though, they maintained their energy balance with fine precision, burning and consuming almost exactly the same number of calories that day.
It was when they had skipped breakfast before exercise that their eating became most interesting. Having presumably depleted most of their bodies’ stored carbohydrates during the cycling that day, the men seemed ravenous at lunch, consuming substantially more calories than during either of their other lab visits.
But afterward their eating tailed off and, at the end of the day, they maintained an energy deficit of nearly 400 calories, meaning they had replenished few of the calories they had burned while riding.
These findings have implications for people hoping to use exercise for weight control, said Javier Gonzalez, a senior lecturer at the University of Bath, who oversaw the new study. They suggest that working out on an empty stomach in the morning might not prompt us to overeat later and might, instead, lead to calorie deficits.
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
Should that situation continue beyond a single workout and single day, we would probably lose weight, he said.
Still, this study was small, short-term and involved only fit, young men eating oatmeal for breakfast. Whether the results would be comparable for those of us who are older, overweight, out of shape, female or swallow eggs and bacon in the morning remains unknown.
It also does not explain why the men who had skipped breakfast before exercise did not continue to shovel in food all day, but it is likely that the messages from the brain about replacing the lost carbohydrates might have been urgent but also transient.
Gonzalez and his colleagues hope to study those questions in coming trials.

No need to join a crowd on top Constable: Hubris, bad

Texto completo: Last week’s Associated Press photograph of Mount Everest shows a long line of hundreds of climbers in brightly colored gear inching their way to the peak as if they were waiting in line for Space Mountain at Disney World.
"How do they get down? There’s an elevator, right?" quips Joel Schauer, 58, of Hawthorn Woods. Schauer didn’t have to share his Everest moment with hundreds of fellow climbers when he scaled the peak in 2016.
He and a guide left the South Col at 25,938 feet at 7 p.m. and arrived at the summit at 6:45 a.m. by themselves.
"There were two people who turned around in front of me when I was making it to the top," Schauer remembers.
Exhausted after the last 12-hour climb, his zipper frozen by the condensation from his breathing mask in the below-zero temperatures, and with a dwindling oxygen supply at 29,029 feet, Schauer didn’t even remove his face mask for the photo of him displaying his "On The Top: Fairchild Automotive" flag from his Lake Zurich business.
"This is nice," Schauer remembers thinking during the hour he spent on top of the world before others arrived and safety became his top concern. "How long can I live here? Look around, enjoy it and get down."
More than 300 people have died climbing Everest since 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the top. So far this month, at least 11 climbers have died while scaling the world’s tallest mountain, the latest a 62-year-old Colorado attorney who had reached the peak and was starting his descent, which can be just as dangerous.
"On the way down, I was trying to suck oxygen, and there wasn’t enough there," remembers Schauer. At one point he slipped and found himself dangling from a rope. "I’m looking out at the Himalayas upside-down," he says. He somehow managed to get a grip with the crampons on his boots digging into the ice, pulled himself up and made it safely back to base camp.
A climber at crowded Everest last week told CNN about having to step over dead bodies on the path. Schauer, whose first Everest attempt in 2014 was canceled after an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas, says he didn’t see any bodies during his successful climb two years later. Some critics have blamed the deaths during this climbing season, which ended this week, on the growing number of climbers. Many are unprepared, and the crowding is caused by an increase in the number of companies leading the expeditions.
"Is it hubris? Might be. Is it bad preparation? Might be. Is it the line? Might be," Schauer says, adding that changing the protocol to call for more oxygen for the trip down from the summit might help. A story in The New York Times on Wednesday says Nepalese officials are considering changes that would bar inexperienced climbers and make it more difficult to get a permit.
Whether going up or down, the process is slow and tedious and climbers have to maneuver past each other. "You have to do the Everest dance," Schauer says, describing the process of moving along the guide rope. "You unclip, move, reclip, move. You’re clipping and unclipping 10,000 times."
And when you are exhausted, dealing with the altitude, short on air, and numb from the cold, it’s difficult to improvise.
"It’s really hard to get off that line. There’s nowhere to go," Schauer says. "You’re limited to the slowest person in line."
Schauer and his wife, Kathy, parents of three grown children, Jennifer, Melissa and Jake, became grandparents a week ago with the birth of Addison Grace to Jake and Elizabeth Schauer. Earlier in the year, Joel Schauer reached another milestone when he climbed to the top of Aconcagua in Argentina, making him just the 48th person to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents and ski to both the North and South poles.
The lessons he learns from climbing about building strong teams, planning well and taking "intelligent risks" help him run his business, Schauer says. Everest will always be one of his major accomplishments, but he doesn’t see the need to climb it again. His daughter Jennifer is going to run a not-for-profit for abused girls in Kathmandu, the Nepal city where most Everest climbers embark on their adventure. But Schauer says, "you can climb an equally beautiful mountain without so many people on it."
Considering all his world-famous climbs, ask him about what he is most proud of, and Schauer breaks into a big smile.
"That’s easy," Schauer says. "My granddaughter."

As Barr mulls declassification, a familiar tune from critics

Texto completo: In February 2018, the House Intelligence Committee released the so-called Nunes memo. In four pages, the document, from the committee’s then-chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, revealed much of what the public knows today about the FBI’s reliance on the Steele dossier in pursuing since-discredited allegations that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired to fix the 2016 election. Specifically, it revealed that the FBI included unverified material from the dossier in applications to a secret spy court to win a warrant to wiretap Trump foreign policy volunteer adviser Carter Page.
All that was classified. To release it, the committee appealed to President Donald Trump, who made a declassification order. That is the only way Americans know about the Page warrant. From that knowledge came later revelations about the FBI’s use of confidential informants and undercover agents to get information on Trump campaign figures.
It is good that the public knows such things, just as it is good that the public knows what is in the Mueller report. But in the days before the Nunes memo was declassified, many of the nation’s top current and former intelligence officials, members of Congress, and analysts in the press warned that declassification would do grave damage to American national security.
It didn’t happen.
Now, some of the same people are issuing somber warnings of the damage that will be done if Attorney General William Barr declassifies documents showing what else the nation’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the 2016 Trump investigation.
In 2018, former CIA Director John Brennan said of the Nunes memo, "I never witnessed the type of reckless partisan behavior I am now seeing." In 2018, Rep. Adam Schiff, the current chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the Nunes memo "crosses a dangerous line." In 2018, former Attorney General Eric Holder called the Nunes memo "unheard of," "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Many others echoed Brennan’s and Schiff’s and Holder’s sentiments. The problem is, they were wrong then, and they are likely wrong again now.
The revelation that the FBI used the Steele dossier — the collection of unconfirmed anti-Trump dirt compiled for the Hillary Clinton campaign by the former British spy Christopher Steele — set off a tremendous argument about the dossier’s reliability. But there was no doubt that the Nunes memo was correct, that the FBI had indeed cited the dossier as evidence in its argument that Carter Page should be wiretapped. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that some of the loudest voices denouncing Nunes were angry about the exposure of the FBI’s questionable actions, and not the fact that the FBI’s actions were indeed questionable.
Now, there is another fight about declassification. Nunes himself has heard this all before. "These people simply use national security as a false justification to hide information that would reveal their abuses," he said in a text exchange.
Nunes summed up with one more line: "Democracy dies in darkness."
The resistance to declassification is likely to be ferocious. Almost immediately after President Donald Trump ordered intelligence agencies to cooperate with Barr and gave the attorney general "full and complete authority" to declassify information from the Trump-Russia investigation, the intelligence world struck back when The New York Times reported that Barr’s project could endanger one of the CIA’s most prized sources.
Attributing its story to "former officials," the Times said the source was someone "close to (Vladimir) Putin" who gave the CIA "information about (Putin’s) involvement" in U.S. election interference, and specifically turned over evidence to support the conclusion that "Putin himself was behind the Russia hack." The source had been "long nurtured" by the CIA and was highly valued by Brennan when he was director. All of that work might be at risk if Barr moves ahead, the Times suggested.
Now, if anything might endanger such a source, it would be exposure in The New York Times. But the story showed that the intelligence world will push back hard against this new effort to investigate its record. The fight could be messy. But Barr, like Nunes, has heard such threats before. It’s time to find out what the CIA, FBI and other agencies did in those difficult days of the 2016 campaign.

The lesson and legacy of Bill Buckner In every field,

Texto completo: As news of Bill Buckner’s death spread Monday, reports chronicled his impressive 2,715 career hits — and revisited the error that would come to overshadow his accomplishments.
It was 1986, Game 6 of the World Series. Buckner, then playing for the Boston Red Sox after years as a Chicago Cub, let a ball roll through his legs, allowing the Mets to score and go on to win the series.
Yes, the error hit hard in a town that had not won a World Series since 1918. But the response was far more tragic than the error: Buckner received death threats and ultimately had to move his family out of Massachusetts.
Today, with the ease of the internet and the sting of social media, it likely would have been worse. To those who don’t understand the fervor surrounding professional sports — who find the culture at times distasteful — the Buckner incident goes a long way toward illustrating why.
In this country, we are too quick to turn athletes into heroes — and too quick to turn away from them when their talents, or bodies, fail them. And too often, we are just as fickle with people in other professions and even with ourselves.
We all make mistakes in our professional lives. And we all dread making one that will define the careers we work so hard to build.
As the Daily Herald’s own sports columnist Barry Rozner pointed out, Buckner finished his career with 2,715 hits, 498 doubles, 1,208 RBI and only 453 strikeouts in 10,000 plate appearances. In a perfect world, those are the numbers that should shape his legacy, rather than a single error.
At a news conference years after the World Series play, Buckner called the spotlight on his error "the ugly part of sports," The New York Times reported. "I don’t think that in society in general that’s the way we should operate," he said at the time. "What are you teaching kids? Not to try because if you don’t succeed, then you’re going to be buried, so don’t try?"
It’s a fair and important question, one given added emphasis as we glance over the pictures of high school graduates that have filled this newspaper’s pages and Facebook feeds in recent days.
Those graduates will venture out into the world. Some will start work after tossing their caps into the air. Others will head off to college. A select few will try their luck in professional sports.
Every one of them will make mistakes.
A verbal beating like the one Buckner took should never discourage them from chasing their dreams, but it should make them think twice before publicly trashing a colleague — or a stranger — for a mistake.
And they should take notes on how Buckner moved on from his. He didn’t pass blame. He didn’t give up. He soldiered on with grace.
Ultimately, that is the lesson we can all draw on, whatever our station or profession.

'I wanted to see how far I could get': Teen sneaked past Secret Service into Mar-a-Lago while Trump was there, court documents say

Texto completo: Jaime Harrison, the former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, formally kicked off his campaign Wednesday to topple Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, with a video that highlights his humble roots and Graham's evolving views on President Trump.
Harrison, who was the state party's first black chairman and is a former aide to Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, has been encouraged to run by national party leaders in a state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1998.
In his announcement video, Harrison highlighted his birth to a 16-year-old mother, his upbringing by his grandparents, his education at Yale University and Georgetown Law School, and his return to South Carolina.
The video also included clips of derogatory comments that Graham made about Trump as they both were pursuing the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, including Graham labeling Trump "a kook," "crazy," and "not fit to be president of the United States."
"He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot," Graham said in one highlighted clip.
In subsequent clips, Graham is shown saying, "No, I don't think he's a xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot," and that Trump "deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and then some."
"Here's a guy who will say anything to stay in office," Harrison said in the video. "Lindsey Graham can't lead us in any direction because he traded his moral compass for petty political gain."

Trump urges Moore not to seek US Senate seat
President Trump urged Roy Moore, whose 2017 special election loss made Doug Jones the first Democrat since 1992 to win a US Senate seat in Alabama, to forgo a 2020 rematch, warning of “devastating" consequences.
“Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama," Trump said Wednesday on Twitter. “This time it will be for Six Years, not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win. But he didn't, and probably won't."
Donald Trump Jr. foreshadowed Trump's engagement in a tweet Tuesday, saying Moore is the only Republican who could lose to a Democrat in Alabama and telling him to “ride off into the sunset."
Jones, a former federal prosecutor, prevailed in a solidly Republican state by running a low-key local campaign, while Moore was consumed by a national furor following allegations he had pursued relationships with teenage girls while in his thirties. Jones is up for reelection next year and could face a tough path against a strong Republican challenger.

Iranian jabs at Trump go viral on social media
Donald Trump's phone rings in the middle of the night. “It's the Iranians," he says, jolting upright in bed in his underwear.
But it isn't Tehran on the other end of the line, only a salesman shilling hair-loss treatments.
This scene, conjured by an Iranian animator after Trump urged the Islamic Republic to “call me," has gone viral, capturing the derision many Iranians feel for the US president who's trying to bring their country to heel.
It's one of a string of jabs at Trump that have swept Farsi social media since he made that unrequited offer to an Iran that's refused to bow to his scaled-up sanctions and displays of military force.
Prank callers have telephoned the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, after CNN reported the White House passed a phone number Iran could use to officials in Switzerland, which has represented US interests in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
“In my opinion Trump should've also given the Telegram I.D. for the White House," a user named Kev tweeted, referring to the messaging application used by tens of millions of Iranians. “It's the very start of a relationship and Iran might feel awkward calling straight away."
Others posted an image of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani holding a phone receiver to his ear, dialing a US phone number, and saying the dial code out loud. One Twitter user wondered who'd pay for the call, considering the strains on Iran's economy. Another mused what might have happened if Trump's tenure had coincided with the term of Iran's former hardline president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
“Why weren't these two in office at the same time??" the person said. “The two of them would've made a brilliant pair!"

Man seeks to walk into Mar-a-Lago and succeedsTo get inside Mar-a-Lago, where President Trump was staying last Thanksgiving, 18-year-old Mark Lindblom walked along the beach until he reached an underground tunnel, leading straight to the luxury club.
The narrow corridor dipped beneath South Ocean Boulevard, a shortcut so Mar-a-Lago Club members didn't have to cross the street on their way to and from the beach. There was a sign posted right outside the tunnel, warning, "UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE RESTRICTED AREA," according to federal court documents. But Lindblom, who was not a member of the club, was undeterred.
"I wanted to see how far I could get," the college freshman told a federal magistrate on Tuesday, the Palm Beach Post reported.
As it turns out, he got pretty far: past Secret Service and all the way inside.
For sneaking onto the property, Lindblom pleaded guilty Tuesday to entering or remaining in a restricted building. Lindblom, reportedly a business student at the University of Wisconsin, was sentenced to a year of probation and $25 fine after prosecutors acknowledged he had no ill intent, that he intended only to take pictures on his cellphone.
The security breach is the latest incident at Trump's private "Winter White House" in recent months, provoking concerns about inadequate security measures at the club.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Robert L. Bernstein, a publishing executive and human rights activist who presided over a generation of dynamic growth at Random House and advocated for dissidents around the world, from the Soviet Union to Argentina, died Monday at age 96.
Bernstein died in a Manhattan hospital after a brief illness, according to his son, Peter Bernstein.
The tall, sandy-haired Bernstein was president of Random House from 1966 to 1990, when authors included Toni Morrison, James Michener and E.L. Doctorow. He also helped found Helsinki Watch, Human Rights Watch and other organizations. He was among the first recipients of the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights, presented to him in 1998 by President Bill Clinton, who called Bernstein "a pathbreaker for freedom of expression and the protection of rights at home and abroad.
Through his years in the book industry and his travels worldwide, Bernstein came to know a remarkable range of artists, celebrities and historical figures, from Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov to Oscar-winning actress Claudette Colbert to children's author Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). He worked in publishing from 1946 to 1990, beginning when companies such as Random House, Alfred A. Knopf and Simon & Schuster still were run by their original owners, and departing during an era of growing consolidation and corporate control.
In the 1970s, he visited the Soviet Union and became a leading voice in publishing for the rights of Soviet writers, and later for those in South America, China and Czechoslovakia. He helped found Helsinki Watch, a watchdog for the human rights provisions in the Helsinki Accords signed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union in 1975. A handful of related organizations followed, including Asia Watch and Americas Watch, before all were combined under Bernstein's leadership into Human Rights Watch in 1988.
Meanwhile, Bernstein managed an artful balance at Random House between making enough money to satisfy his bosses and advancing his belief that literature should contribute to the common good. Sakharov; his wife, Yelena Bonner; Natan Sharansky and many other dissidents released works through the publisher.
One of Bernstein's proudest memories was of Argentine author Jacobo Timerman's damning memoir of persecution, "Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number, which came out in 1981, around the time Americas Watch arranged for Timerman to testify against President Reagan's appointment of Ernest Lefever as assistant secretary of state for human rights. (The nomination was eventually withdrawn).
"As I read it [Prisoner Without a Name'], I had something of an epiphany - I saw what we could do if we brought the advantages of a book publishing house with national and international contracts and hooked it up to the human rights movement, Bernstein wrote in his memoir, "Speaking Freely, published in 2016.
Bernstein married Helen Walter in 1950. They had three sons.
Descended from Jewish immigrants, Bernstein was born and raised in Manhattan, attending the progressive Lincoln School as a teenager and entering Harvard University in 1940, a year before the country entered World War II. Presuming he would be drafted, he enlisted in the Army in 1943 and was eventually stationed in Casablanca and India. His military service left deep impressions on him, whether the segregated North Carolina community where he trained or the extreme poverty of Calcutta.
After the war, he was hired as an assistant office boy at Simon & Schuster and eventually rose to sales manager, with a special eye for children's books. In the mid-1950s, he helped "Eloise creator Kay Thompson market a line of merchandise related to the Plaza's most famous fictional resident. Thompson would call his home on occasion and, in the voice of Eloise, invite the Bernstein children to the Plaza.
"When we got to the Plaza, Kay would come out and say, Oh, I'm so sorry. You just missed her,' Bernstein wrote in his memoir. "The kids didn't mind that much, though, because they loved going and having cocoa with Kay.
Fired by Simon & Schuster in 1956 after clashing with rival executive Leon Shimkin, Bernstein was recruited by Random House co-founder Bennett Cerf and joined the publisher as a sales manager. He was named first vice president in 1962 and was Cerf's chosen successor for company president, starting in 1966. Among those he promoted was a young educational editor named Toni Morrison.
Alternately hard-headed and diplomatic, Bernstein guided Random House through its rise to become the world's largest publisher. Shortly before he became president, Random House was purchased by RCA, which in 1980 sold the company to Advance Publications (Random, later owned by Bertelsmann AG, now is part of Penguin Random House). Thanks in part to Random's acquisition of the Crown Publishing Group, revenues soared from $40 million in 1966 to more than $800 million by the time Bernstein was forced into retirement 24 years later.
After his departure, which stunned the publishing industry, The New York Times described Random House under Bernstein as "a large and unusually harmonious empire, comprised of semi-autonomous fiefdoms, presided over by a benevolent emperor.
Bernstein headed Human Rights Watch from its founding to 1998, but later became a critic, saying the organization was unduly focused on Israel and relatively indifferent to human rights violations by neighboring Arab countries. In 2010, he started Advancing Human Rights, which advocated the internet as a way of protecting freedom of expression.
Bernstein's was a muse for at least one author. In "Speaking Freely, he remembered corresponding frequently with Geisel and visiting his studio in La Jolla, California, where "Dr. Seuss would read from a work in progress. In 1982, for Bernstein's 25th anniversary with Random House, Geisel honored him with an original poem:
Since that memorable day
back in Nineteen Five Seven,
most witnesses, long since
have packed off to heaven
But to those who still breathe
the great memory's still fresh
of the wild wind that blew
with a woosh and a wesch
when Bob Bernstein showed up
in his fine freckled flesh

Texto completo: Mindy Kaling 's newest essay collection, from Amazon Original Studios, has a summer 2020 release date. Amazon Publishing announced on Tuesday that the book will be available for free to Prime and Kindle Unlimited members, and that readers will also be able to listen to an audio version read by Kaling.
The essays will tackle everything from hanging out with Reese Witherspoon and Sandra Bullock to viewing “The Handmaid's Tale" during her pregnancy, according to Amazon.
“It's so exciting for me to share the secrets of how I balance being a professional writer, actor, and single mom in a new collection of essays," Kaling said in an Instagram post. “I mean, it would be so exciting to share those secrets. I don't have them. Like, not even close. This morning I bribed my baby with a remote control to get my car keys back. But I do have funny stories about my life and I can't wait for you to read them."
Kaling is also the author of a 2015 memoir, “Why Not Me?," and a 2011 essay collection, “Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?" Both books spent several weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers list. “Whether she's delighting fans on-screen or on-the-page — as 'The Office's' Kelly Kapoor, 'The Mindy Project's' Mindy Lahiri, Molly Patel in the upcoming film 'Late Night,' or as a New York Times best-selling memoirist — Mindy is guaranteed to entertain," Mikyla Bruder , of Amazon Publishing, said in a statement.

Tech View: Foundation’s program brings brightest thinkers to Hawaii

Texto completo: As an educator, I’m deeply troubled to see climate crisis and climate science denial emanating from the highest levels of government. This comes at a time when the need for global awareness and environmental stewardship have never been greater.
I believe the best way to counter misinformation is to bring people together and examine the facts.
In this regard the “Margins of the Sea” speakers series, recently inaugurated by the Honolulu-based Liljestrand Foundation, offers a bright ray of hope. Created in conjunction with the highly regarded University of Iowa International Writing Program, the presenters spoke truth to power on topics ranging from climate change to geopolitics.
My co-writer, Rob Kay, attended the program and was impressed by the array of voices, the depth of wisdom and the spectacular environs surrounding the iconic Liljestrand home. Located atop Tantalus, this architectural gem made an ideal setting for the gathering. The founders, Bob and Vicky Liljestrand, hope to make “Margins of the Sea” an annual international summit where distinguished writers, scientists, cultural practitioners and policy experts from around the Pacific Rim and Oceania can exchange ideas.
They got off to a great start.
The opening salvo of the three-day series was the keynote from New York Times best-selling author Simon Winchester. The prologue to his most recent book, “Pacific: Silicon Chips and Surfboards, Coral Reefs and Atom Bombs, Brutal Dictators, Fading Empires, and the Coming Collision of the World’s Superpowers,” described the landscape he covered.
Much like the title of his book, Winchester’s talk covered a great deal of territory, ranging from the indefensible radioactive poisoning of Rongelap islanders (following the United States’ 1954 Castle Bravo thermonuclear test on Bikini) to the current Chinese power play in the South China Sea. His message was unambiguous: Distant environmental and political events are coming home to roost in Hawaii.
This theme was further illuminated the second day of the series by University of Hawaii law school professor Maxine Burkett and activist Maya Soetoro-Ng, who tackled subjects such as international climate justice, policy and climate change-triggered human migration. Also on the podium was UH geology and geophysics professor Chip Fletcher, who delivered a sober message of looming environmental disaster. (Part of his talk featured a slide depicting the vast areas of Waikiki and Kakaako that would be flooded with a future 1-meter sea level rise.)
On the final day of the program, thought leaders from throughout the Pacific — Vili Hereniko (Fiji), Takiora Ingram (Cook Islands) and Meleanna Meyer (Hawaii) — spoke passionately about the impact of political and environmental events on their respective communities.
The “Margins of the Sea” program is still in its nascent stages, but the founders have tapped into an archetypal vein in several ways. Hawaiians have traditionally characterized Oahu as “The Gathering Place.” Bringing people together in a meaningful way to solve problems is also an indigenous concept. In a sense, the Liljestrands have channeled the tradition of hooponopono, the Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness.
The need for this has never been more critical.
In this spirit, I’m convinced that face-to-face dialogue in the Liljestrands’ quiet, nurturing setting will foster lasting, new international relationships through discourse, argument, mutual study and breaking bread. I also believe that cross-cultural interchange will heal relationships and act as an antidote to the uncivil discourse that is all too prevalent in the public sphere.

Christopher Steele won’t cooperate with John Durham review of Russia investigation

Texto completo: Christopher Steele, author of the dossier that played a key role in the Trump-Russia inquiry, will not assist Attorney General William Barr’s investigation of the investigators, according to a new report
A source close to Orbis Business Intelligence, which is Steele’s investigative firm, told Reuters that the British ex-spy “would not cooperate” with nor answers questions from U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr has tasked with reviewing the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's presidential campaign and the way that the Justice Department and FBI conducted the inquiry.

This revelation comes days after Trump’s order stating that Barr was given “full and complete authority to declassify information” and ordering the intelligence community “to quickly and fully cooperate with the Attorney General’s investigation into surveillance activities during the 2016 presidential election.” Barr said he picked Durham because he “was looking for someone who is tenacious, who is used to looking at sensitive material involving government activities, who has a reputation for being fair and evenhanded.”

Neither DOJ nor Steele’s business immediately responded to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment. Durham’s office said they had no comment at this time.
The report said Steele “might cooperate” with DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s independent investigation, signaling a shift in Steele’s thinking. In April, Politico reported that Steele “declined to be interviewed by the inspector general, citing, among other things, the potential impropriety of his involvement in an internal Justice Department investigation as a foreign national and former British intelligence agent.” That report said Steele might even “rebut the Inspector General’s characterizations” with a public statement.
Horowitz has been looking into potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse since early 2018 and is “homing in” on the potential misuse of Steele’s unverified dossier by the DOJ and FBI. Barr has said Horowitz's probe should be done by May or June.
Steele did cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and submitted written testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.
According to a New York Times report from April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

Steele’s dossier, which was packed with unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, formed a key part of the FISA applications that were used to justify surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, which received funding through the Perkins Coie law firm from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
Barr said this month that “it’s a very unusual situation to have opposition research like that — especially one that on its face had a number of clear mistakes and a somewhat jejune analysis.” Barr’s pointed critiques of the Steele dossier’s flaws comes after former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI General Counsel James Baker defended their handling of the dossier in recent weeks.

Abortion advocates hypocritically insult pro-life states for bigotry and ignorance

Texto completo: On a recent trip to Manhattan for a television appearance, my wife and I sat at the Tonic Bar near Times Square. With the day’s work behind us, we nibbled appetizers and had a couple of drinks as we waited for a performance of Jersey Boys.
I don’t know how they do it, said the server.
The twentysomething was referring to what was then on Chive TV, the ubiquitous bar entertainment playing on all the flat screens. A guy on a skateboard was performing some sort of extraordinary aerial cartwheel — or was it someone on a snowmobile or a jet ski? No matter, the remarkable nature of it had led her to socio-political speculation.
Our server attributed the athletic skill to living in Middle america where people have nothing better to do.
Friendly and professional, our server had nonetheless misidentified her guests as sharing the joke on the hairy unwashed masses living in what is here otherwise referred to as “flyover country. ”
Read more commentary:
I'm pro-life. That means protecting the unborn from abortion and also caring for women.
Alabama is showing the way to protect all human life from abortion
Roe v. Wade gave women a right to choose abortion. But doctors like me have a choice, too.
To the woefully uninitiated, this term refers to the vast space between the coasts, red states mostly, and therefore — in the words of Politico writer Sally Goldenberg — a “terrifying” place where “no one carries almond milk. ” Egads! Think Empty Quarter, Sea of Tranquility, irrelevant, and populated by Neanderthals.
Pro-life laws rooted in 'hate and ignorance'
Harmless though such comments are, they reflect a condescending attitude shared by the generally liberal American coasts, and that rhetoric has been infused with startling venom in recent weeks and days as a wave of abortion laws have been successively passed by Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, Georgia, and, most recently, Alabama.
This led the Boston Globe to announce that “America’s red state legislatures are on an abortion bender. ” Vanity Fair lamented how Democrats lost the red states. And Bill Maher served up some red state red meat to his sycophantic audience when he took aim at the Alabama law which restricts abortion even in cases of rape and incest: “How else are you supposed to get pregnant in Alabama?”
So, what’s the connection between red states and pro-life?
The New York Times suggests that it is rooted in hate and ignorance. So bad is it in this red state wasteland, writes Margaret Renki, “I’m tempted to say there’s never been a worse time to be a sentient human being in the American South. ” The illiterate folk in red state America just lack the sophistication to understand how wonderful abortion really is. Don’t they want the t-shirt?
The Huffington Post, with its characteristically moderate tone, says it is about white supremacists. (Or, at the very least, it is, they say, good news for them: more white babies!)
Bigotry is not why red states ban abortion
On CNN, Diane McWhorter, seeing life through the lens of her Pulitzer Prize winning book on civil rights, is certain bigotry and backwardness are responsible for the red state revolt. Apparently, racism and poverty no longer exist in places like New York and Boston and Chicago and Los Angeles.
Of course, McWhorter and her ilk are pioneering a bigotry currently in vogue with the Left. As for these efforts to link the pro-life position with all that is wrong in the world, they are overwrought and unconvincing to all but the liberal choir.
Then there is The Chicago Tribune’s Virginia Heffernan who, perhaps unwittingly, made the more perceptive and fundamental connection when she recognized that “the extremists …” — she means pro-life advocates, in case you weren’t sure — “… invoke God’s precious gift of life. ”
This little gem was difficult to unearth, buried as it was under a mountain of inflammatory language (words like “psycho” and “twisted” appear and she even manages a reference to “catastrophic internment camps”), but like a skilled linguistic gymnast, Heffernan nonetheless sticks the landing.
She zeroes-in on Alabama Governor Kay Ivey for saying that the state’s strict abortion law reflected “Alabamians’ deeply held belief that every life is precious and that every life is a sacred gift from God. ” To this, Heffernan expresses great indignation, saying that Ivey is “a politician in a nation founded on the principle of separation of church and state. ”
The pro-life movement is winning
What? America wasn’t “founded” on the principle of church and state. While it has become a principle of our government, the term does not appear in any founding document and doesn’t even appear in American jurisprudence until 1947. One presumes Heffernan means the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, but Ivey was no more in violation of that than Jefferson was when he wrote:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life …”
And that phrase does appear in a founding document, namely, The Declaration of Independence. (What do they teach people in them thar blue states?)
These are trifling details to the pro-choice lobby. They have shouted their view to the point of being — dare I say it? — blue in the face, and they will brook no opposition. On the contrary, they will cast about looking for an evil connection that sticks.
But don’t be fooled. The pro-life lobby isn’t stupid — they are, after all, winning — and they aren’t motivated by bigotry. The genuine connection between red states and pro-life legislation is a brand of political conservatism that has Christianity at its core. Progressives well understand this, and they want to trample under foot that which Christians hold dear: not animal life, which progressives vigorously defend and is, according to the New Republic, “the next frontier for the Left,” but that life which Christians believe is made in the image of God.
Human life.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
As Mayor Bill de Blasio enters the 2020 presidential race, an exclusive group of people would seem to be natural allies: the 115 people who contributed $ 458,000 to his federal political action committee.
Yet even among those who gave the maximum $ 5,000, few said they were willing to put their votes where their money went.
Dozens of interviews conducted by The New York Times with Mr. de Blasio's donors provided a snapshot of his lukewarm support for president -- even from a self-selected group of people willing to spend thousands of dollars to help the New York City mayor in his federal efforts.
Mr. de Blasio's fund-raising targets resembled those from his mayoral campaigns, as he tapped familiar sources of money from the middle rungs of the construction and real estate industries, and from ethnic business communities in and around New York City.
They said they gave to Mr. de Blasio's federal committee, known as Fairness PAC, for a variety of reasons. Some pointed to his record as mayor. Some said they did so to have a chance to talk to the mayor. Others donated after being asked by another member of their community.
"Honestly speaking, I was asked by a co-worker if I can help, and I did," said Nail Capri, an executive at a roofing and restoration company who contributed $ 5,000 last year. In March, Mr. Capri also attended a fund-raiser for the mayor, a Democrat, that drew attendees mostly from New York's Albanian community.
So is Mr. de Blasio your candidate for president?
"For me, personally, no," he said.
The same could be said for a better-known $ 5,000 donor: the billionaire media mogul Barry Diller.
"I'm certainly not a supporter of him running for president. I'm not a supporter of anyone at the moment," said Mr. Diller, who is funding the construction of a park-island on Manhattan's West Side. "He was very helpful to us in building, and supportive of building, the island that we're building in the Hudson River."
"And that's why," he said.
At least Mr. Diller recalled the $ 5,000 donation to Mr. de Blasio's federal committee. Howard L. Gottlieb, an Illinois political donor, said he could not even remember making his $ 5,000 contribution, one that federal filings show occurred in October.
"I'm 95 years old," he said. "Do you think I remember every dime that I've ever given to anyone, especially as insignificant as that?" He added that he had no interest in seeing Mr. de Blasio as president.
"For president? No," he said.
Mr. de Blasio's fund-raising practices have brought him scrutiny for years, including from federal and state prosecutors. Those inquiries ended without charges, but the Manhattan district attorney, in 2017, wrote that Mr. de Blasio violated the "intent and spirit" of the law.
As he raises money for his federal political action committee, he has said he goes further than is required by refusing donations from people listed in the city's "doing business" database. Mr. de Blasio has defended his fund-raising as legal and appropriate.
But that computerized database does not include many potential donors with active financial interests in giving to the mayor.
In recent months, as he entertained a run for president, Mr. de Blasio allowed a Boston-based construction firm seeking to expand its presence in New York City to host a fund-raiser for him. He has raised money from those seeking to influence city business through lobbyists and from a local Democratic fixture, Frank Carone, who was in the middle of an active real estate negotiation with the city.
"There's nothing wrong with the mayor's fund-raising," said Mr. Carone, a lawyer and fixture in the Democratic Party in Brooklyn who gave the mayor $ 5,000 last year while he was negotiating a real estate deal with the city. "If asked, I would be happy to support the mayor as he runs for president."
The Times first asked donors why they decided to donate to the mayor; for those who didn't immediately hang up, a second question followed: Do you think he should be president?
Out of 35 people who stayed on the line long enough to hear the question, five said yes -- including a lawyer in Pennsylvania, an architect in Brooklyn and a woman on the Upper East Side. Seven said no, and the rest either expressed no preference or declined to say.
Alex Tourk, a San Francisco public relations executive who gave $ 5,000 in September, had kind words for Mr. de Blasio. But as a presidential candidate? "I am supporting Senator Kamala Harris," he said.
Several less well-heeled donors said they had given to Mr. de Blasio's committee not so much out of personal support for the mayor's mission, but because of interpersonal ties in particular immigrant communities.
Donations to Fairness PAC clustered around a handful of such events: one fund-raiser last year in Queens drew many Asian-American donors; another tapped into bonds in an Indian-American community on Long Island.
An event in March saw a large number of Albanians gather for the mayor in a private room at Joseph's Italian restaurant in Lower Manhattan. The host, Ilirjan Rusi, said the event attracted a range of small business people, restaurateurs and those who work in the building trades. "The Albanians like the photo ops!" he said, laughing.
(That night's haul may have been offset by Mr. Rusi's brother, Selim, a longtime supporter of Mr. de Blasio's: Records show that a month earlier he had donated $ 41,000 to President Trump's re-election.)
What about a President de Blasio? "I don't know," said Mr. Rusi, who owns a contracting company.
"Well, somehow I guess I'm going to have to support him," he allowed. "He's the mayor and everything." (He expressed greater fondness for Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and was seeking to organize a fund-raiser for him.)
At the home of Maninder Sethi in Old Westbury, Long Island, several dozen people gathered last fall to hear from the mayor and donate. Many of those present gave relatively small amounts, in the hundreds of dollars, and said they were brought together by common communal bonds, not by affinity for Mr. de Blasio.
"It was at my uncle's residence," said one attendee who runs an online cellphone store and requested anonymity to discuss his $ 4,500 contribution. "My uncle asked me to donate and I did it."
Ravishankar Bhooplapur, the president of a medical school in Aruba, donated $ 500. He said he gives to "both parties" but had been a longtime supporter of the mayor, and would support his bid for president.
"Whether he appeals to the rest of the country, I don't know," he said of Mr. de Blasio. "As a New Yorker, I would love to have him."
David Jiang, who described his business as importing and manufacturing, said he gave $ 5,000 during a Queens fund-raiser last year because "it just seemed like this was an opportunity to meet the mayor and give my point of view."
"I support both sides," he added.
For the moment, pricey fund-raisers are not Mr. de Blasio's focus: He's seeking donations as little as $ 1 to $ 3 from thousands of people, to meet the Democratic Party's 65,000-donor threshold to qualify for the primary debate stage in June.
The mayor opened his federal political action committee last July, presenting it as an effort to help Democrats in state and federal races. Of the nearly $ 500,000 raised last year, only a small fraction went to 2018 candidates. (The next filings will be released in July.)
"The mayor has been very clear that all official decisions are based on merit," said Mr. de Blasio's campaign spokeswoman, Olivia Lapeyrolerie, adding that a "campaign finance plan" for the presidential run would be released soon.
Many donors had correctly viewed his federal efforts, starting last year, as a precursor to a 2020 presidential campaign.
"I don't recall exactly what he said, but my assumption was that it was for his presidential ambitions," said Scott Nash, who owns a chain of organic grocery stories in the mid-Atlantic region and, along with his wife, gave a total of $ 10,000. "I like the guy. He's my kind of politician. Do I think he's going to win? No."
"I'm a very pragmatic liberal," he added. "Right now, for me, it's Joe Biden."

'I almost hit one of those things': Navy pilots report close calls with UFOs on East Coast

Texto completo: Navy pilots reported close encounters with unidentified flying objects during training exercises off the East Coast in 2014 and 2015.
Navy pilots stationed on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt conducting training exercises off the coast of Florida and Virginia from the summer 2014 to spring 2015 reported multiple encounters with objects traveling at supersonic speeds and stopping and accelerating at rates that would kill a person, according to the New York Times.
The incidents caused the Navy to institute new reporting rules for pilots that encounter UFOs.
“There were a number of different reports,” Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher told the publication. “We don’t know who’s doing this, we don’t have enough data to track this. So the intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace.”
Members of the Navy and experts said that the UFOs are most likely commercial drone operations or other earthly objects. None of the pilots suggested that the incidents may have had extraterrestrial origins.
Navy Lt. Danny Accoin had two interactions with UFOs while part of the Roosevelt. Neither time did he see a UFO, but the objects showed up on his plane’s instruments.
“I knew I had it, I knew it was not a false hit,” Accoin said, describing the second incident when he locked on to an object with a training missile and saw it on an infrared camera. But “I could not pick it up visually.”
Navy Lt. Ryan Graves remembered speaking to another pilot that almost hit a UFO.
“I almost hit one of those things,” the pilot told Graves.
The object appeared to be a cube inside of a sphere. The incident prompted the pilot to file an aviation flight safety report, Graves said.
The Stars Academy of Arts and Science released footage of a UFO captured by a Navy plane off the East Coast in 2015 and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. In the video, pilots can be heard openly wondering about what the object is.
“What the f— is that thing,” one can be heard saying.
“Wow, what is that, man?” another said. “Look at that flying!”
iFrame Object
The Department of Defense closed down the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, the agency responsible for investigating issues such as the UFO encounters by the Roosevelt’s crew, in 2012. The program’s duties are still carried out by Pentagon officials, however, sources within the department told The New York Times in 2017.

Texto completo: A British climber who collapsed on the descent from Mount Everest's summit became the latest in a string of fatalities on the world's tallest peak.
Robin Haynes Fisher, 44, died Saturday when he became too weak and fainted in Everest's "death zone," a section at the top of the mountain known for its low levels of oxygen that can be fatal if climbers linger for too long.
Fisher's death is at least the eighth this climbing season on Everest, according to Reuters, and the mountain has been mired with dangerous overcrowding and delays that some have blamed for the deaths.
Because of poor weather this year, climbers have had only a few days to attempt to reach Everest's summit, CNN reported. Long lines of climbers at high altitudes have created near standstills at times.
Utah climber dies: He climbed the tallest mountain on each continent, then died as he descended Mount Everest
A stunning photo taken last week showed a packed queue of climbers waiting to reach the mountain's top.
“Before you reach the summit, you have to wait, and every minute counts at the height,” Krishma Poudel of Peak Promotion, a mountaineering agency in Nepal, told NBC News.
The problem is that the air on Everest's more than 29,000-foot peak has such low oxygen levels that climbers can stay there only a short time.
"Once you get above about 25,000 feet, your body just can't metabolize the oxygen," Grayson Schaffer, editor of Outside magazine, told NPR. "Your muscles start to break down. You start to have fluid that builds up around your lungs and your brain. Your brain starts to swell. You start to lose cognition. Your decision making starts to become slow. And you start to make bad decisions.
"And all of this is happening in the face of, you know, each person trying to sort of reach their ultimate dream. "
World's highest dump? Mount Everest is covered in tons of frozen trash
Schaffer said the problem has gotten worse each year with more climbers trying to make the ascent from the Nepalese side as the number of permits granted from the Chinese side has been limited.
Danduraj Ghimire, head of Nepal's tourism department, downplayed the effect the crowds have had on the death toll. Speaking with The New York Times, he blamed the fatalities on the fewer number of good climbing days and said Nepal had no plans to limit the number of permits it grants.
"If you really want to limit the number of climbers, let’s just end all expeditions on our holy mountain," he said.
Sherpas and climbers speaking with The Times also said a lack of experience in some climbers has exacerbated the problems. Some of the deaths this year, they said, were caused by people who could not climb up then down the peak fast enough to refill their oxygen supplies, while others should not have been on the mountain in the first place.
"You have to qualify to do the Ironman,” Alan Arnette, who writes about Everest and is a climber himself, told The Times. “But you don’t have to qualify to climb the highest mountain in the world? What’s wrong with this picture?”
Everest's glaciers are melting: And it's exposing the bodies of dead climbers
But experienced climbers have also been among the dead this year.
Don Cash, 55, of Utah died last week as he descended Everest's peak. For Cash, reaching the summit marked the completion of his dream: to climb the tallest mountain on all seven continents. He collapsed on his way down the mountain.
Though people die every year on Mount Everest, some say the problem in 2019 is particularly concerning.
“I’ve seen traffic, but not this crazy,” Nirmal Purja, who has summited Everest four times, told The Washington Post.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
I was stunned by "Polishing the Silver" (Thursday Styles, May 16), describing how wealthy women over 80 spend their time and money on the pursuit of youth through elaborate clothing, makeup and various beauty treatments. But there are many styles of growing old, not all of them focused on appearance.
The article implies that the only alternative to these women's choices is to "shuffle, unkempt and uncared for," into old age. On the contrary, many women over 80 lead vibrant, active lives, continuing their customary work, interests and relationships and contributing to the common good. Nor do they shuffle or appear unkempt.
Why not choose to highlight these exemplary women instead, or at least include them as well?
Lynne Sharon Schwartz
New York
The writer is a novelist and poet.
To the Editor:
If the biggest problem these women are dealing with is getting their makeup on for an evening out, they can consider themselves extremely lucky.
Most of us in our 80s are coping with ill health in its various devastating guises. We are facing the diminution of our selves, as we see frailty rob us of the competencies and capabilities we have relied on all our lives.
What matters is not that we look old but that we are old. Reality cannot be obliterated with designer clothes and makeup.
Elaine Yaffe
Denver
To the Editor:
The majority of women over 80 are not living in expensive senior housing. We are maintaining our own households and participating in civic affairs. We have the energy and the desire to serve the needs in our communities: religious, charitable, political and social.
We are most likely to be found wearing athleisure clothes and sunscreen rather than fringed vests and gold necklaces. Mostly we do this alone, partners lost to death or divorce. And yes, we read The New York Times!

Texto completo: ‘Miracles do happen,” said Julia Eller, mother of Amanda Eller, the 35-year-old yoga instructor and physical therapist who was found alive Friday after surviving 17 days in the rugged forest above Makawao.
During an emotional news conference at Maui Memorial Medical Center, where the younger woman was being treated for a broken lower leg and infection due to severe sunburn on her lower extremities, Eller’s mother recounted how her daughter survived by eating strawberry guava fruit and drinking stream water.
Eller got lost May 8 while hiking within the Makawao Forest Reserve, an expansive wilderness area with areas of dense forest, steep ascents and rugged terrain. In an interview with the New York Times, Eller said she lost her way after briefly leaving the trail and spent the rest of the day and night traveling in the wrong direction trying to make it back to her car.
Eller said that at times she felt like giving up, “but the only option I had was life or death.”
“I heard this voice that said, ‘If you want to live, keep going,’” she said. “And as soon as I would doubt my intuition and try to go another way than where it was telling me, something would stop me, a branch would fall on me, I’d stub my toe, or I’d trip. So I was like, ‘OK, there is only one way to go.’”
Eller’s situation grew more dire over the coming days when she fell 20 feet off a cliff, fracturing her leg and tearing the meniscus in one of her knees, and lost her shoes in a flash flood.
Julia Eller said her daughter’s training as a physical therapist enabled her to treat the injury, which in turn allowed her to continue foraging for food.
In the New York Times interview, Eller said she spent a night in a wild boar’s den and others on muddy ground covered in ferns and leaves.
“She was doing what she could to stay warm. Once the sun sets on the mountain, the temperature really starts to drop,” Julia Eller said.
The lost hiker took whatever sustenance she could, including unidentified plants and moths that landed on her body. There were multiple days when she decided against drinking any water because it was too muddy, according to search coordinator Sarah Haynes. It probably kept her from getting leptospirosis, a potentially deadly bacterial disease.
Despite her efforts, Eller grew weaker as the ordeal stretched into its second and third weeks and she started crawling instead of walking.
The day before her rescue, Eller made it to an area above a precarious cliff and waterfall near a spot known as Bamboo Forest. Unable to advance, she lingered for a day and a half, essentially resigning herself to a miracle. Her faith was rewarded the next day when she spotted a helicopter.
“I looked up and they were right on top of me,” she said. “I was like, ‘Oh my God,’ and I just broke down and started bawling.”
Rescue workers had been combing the thickly wooded 1.5-mile radius around Eller’s car. But on a whim, the searchers in the helicopter on Friday decided to go farther, about 7 miles away from the central search area by air — the equivalent of 30 miles walking in rough conditions, said Javier Canetellops, a search coordinator who was in the helicopter.
“Because of her physical condition — she had no shoes, she had an injury, she had watched her body fat melt away and she knew she didn’t have the physical strength to walk all the way back in the direction she came — she was at a standstill,” said Julia Eller.
“It was critical at that point that we found her,” she said. “Miracles do happen.”
Many others joined her Saturday in shedding tears of joy at her daughter’s rescue. It started early in the morning when a team of jubilant but still emotional friends, family and acquaintances began breaking down a base camp that had been used for search operations in the Makawao Forest Reserve.
It continued with tears and hugs at the Maui hospital.
“She looks amazing,” said Dr. Zora Bulatovic, Eller’s physician. “Boy, what she’s been through you would never be able to tell. She is beautiful, amazing and she is doing very well.”
Bulatovic said the woman would have to be hospitalized for a few more days while her infection is treated.
“I can’t believe what she did with that kind of fracture,” the doctor added.
Eller’s mother, embraced by friends who joined in the search, said family members and Amanda’s boyfriend stayed up late Friday night talking and enjoying the moment.
“We were up at all hours of the night working on getting the jungle out of her hair,” she said, smiling. “We were up until 3 a.m. loving each other. There were tears of joy and lots of love.”
Julia Eller, who came to Maui with her husband, John, from Maryland, repeatedly expressed gratitude to those who rallied around their daughter.
“The community was tremendous. There was worldwide support.”
Hundreds of community members had joined in the search, continuing the effort far after the time authorities had given up. They also launched a Gofundme page that raised some $ 75,000 to help pay for the helicopter flights, among other things.
While Amanda Eller was not at the press conference, she did release a video earlier in the day on Facebook tearfully praising all those who helped her.
“Seeing the way that the community of Maui came together … just under the idea of helping one person make it out of the woods alive … (it) just warms my heart. And just seeing the power of prayer and the power of love when everybody combines their efforts is incredible. It could move mountains,” she said.
Prior to her disappearance, Eller was captured on surveillance video shopping at Haiku Market and mailing a Mother’s Day gift at the Haiku Post Office.
Her white Toyota Rav4 was found in the parking lot of the Makawao Forest Reserve, where she was known to hike, and she was reported missing the following morning.
Julia Eller was asked if she ever gave up hope.
“There were moments of despair,” she said. “I’m only human, but I felt in my heart that my daughter was alive.
“She’s a real warrior, and I have no doubt that if anyone was going to survive an ordeal like this, it would be her.”

Texto completo: As the back-and-forth between President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi escalates, in what promises to be the most unusual national campaign America has ever seen, there's something we need to remember about social media.
Like it or not, Facebook, Twitter and other online sources are now major shapers of public opinion. They ought to be frivolous little cyber toys – a way to send friends pictures of our grandchildren or what we're having for lunch — but anything with billions of users was bound to wind up being used by politically.
There's serious stuff, and provocative opinion, and timely information about people and events in our neighborhood or around the world. And there's fake news – not just the stuff that irritates Trump, but deliberate lies planted by people who want you to think this way or that way about a candidate or issue.
As a Luddite who has learned just enough about computers to use email and click on URLs, I've developed two rules. They are:
Get information from multiple sources — print, broadcast and reputable sites —and disregard anything, good or bad, from sources you don't know. Anybody can hit "send" on anything, disguising themselves and their motives.
Everything you see is there because someone, somewhere wants you to buy a product or think a certain way about a person or topic.
Last week, Facebook announced it had removed nearly 3.4 billion fake accounts in just the last six months, twice the number it axed in the preceding six months. That's a billion more fakes than the 2.4 billion real people using the global system.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg said most of the fakes were nabbed within minutes of creation, doing no harm. The company also said it's making great strides in combating hate speech and online crime.
That's good, if true, but the danger of censoring hateful and stupid voices is greater than the comfort of not having them among my chit-chat with friends.
The unprecedented volume and reach of modern media has made a wistful memory out of that old line about a lie running halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on. Today, lies whiz past each other in hyperspace, unimpeded, and we're already forwarding some posts and contradicting others before anyone ventures a truthful rebuttal.
It was bad enough when people just spread crazy rumors. Did you get the message about "Congressional Bill 42-P," purporting to be a 5-cent tax on every email message you send? Or the online petition for a "28th Amendment" to set congressional term limits, make members obey all laws they impose on us, and do a few other nice-sounding things, depending on which version of the hoax you received?
And there was that old Obama-is-a-Muslim-from-Kenya favorite. Somebody would send me that one about once a week when I was reporting. If I asked where they got it, they'd invariably say, "Well it's all over the internet!"
Oh, gosh, if somebody typed it on a keyboard, you know it's true.
The nut stuff is easily spotted, but hoaxes are more sophisticated now. In an election year marked by sharp division on issues like abortion and guns, they're malicious.
The same day Facebook said it had smothered all those fake accounts, the Washington Post reported on a video that had been slowed down to make Nancy Pelosi sound drunk.
This was no computer glitch. Whoever floated the fake recording on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook – with views running into the hundreds of thousands – also altered the tone of her voice, so it didn't go too deep when the tape was slowed. Somebody with the equipment and know-how to do that is lying to make viewers think ill of her.
After a secret FBI briefing on attempts to hack Florida systems, Gov. Ron DeSantis told the Division of Elections to do a security survey. The state certainly has a duty to protect the elections machinery, but we're on our own for defending why we vote – what we think we know about candidates.
President Trump complains of "fake news" from the New York Times, CNN and other established media. But, like them or not, we know who they are and what business they're in. On the internet, we don't know who's spreading information, or where they got it, or why they want us to think it.

Texto completo: Headnote HBCU Commencement Round Up
More than 700 bachelor's candidates and 228 master's and doctoral candidates received their degrees at Morgan State University's (MSU's) jubilant 143rd Spring Commencement Exercises, which included a ceremony for undergraduates held on May 18, and a School of Graduate Studies ceremony on May 16. U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a member of Morgan's Board of Regents, was the guest speaker for the Undergraduate Ceremony held in Hughes Memorial Stadium on Morgan's campus, while across town in Baltimore City, the annual Preakness Day festivities were taking place. Retired New York Times sports columnist, journalist and author William C. Rhoden of Morgan's Class of 1973 received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters during the ceremony. More than 100 members of Morgan's Class of 1969 led the procession into the stadium and were honored as representatives of the 50th anniversary class, a day after the announcement of its $1.4 million in giving to the University in 2018, during Morgan's Alumni Day luncheon.
Morgan's Class of 2019 was rich with success stories reflecting the diversity which is one of the University's core values and a central part of its stated mission.

Assange's indictment 'crosses a bright red line'

Texto completo: For decades, journalists have received and published government secrets in the public interest with the protection of the First Amendment.
Think of the Pentagon Papers, which told Americans about their government's hidden (and often unsavory or illegal) behavior during the Vietnam War. The New York Times and The Washington Post received the highly classified information from a former Pentagon official, Daniel Ellsberg, and - though legal battles raged - were able to publish them.
Or think of The Post's reporting (along with that of the Guardian) that exposed the National Security Agency's massive global surveillance programs, with much of the information supplied by the former government contractor Edward Snowden.
Or, years earlier, the Times reporting about how the government was secretly monitoring the calls and emails of people inside the United States without court-approved warrants.
All won Pulitzer Prizes, and all informed citizens about activities their secrecy-obsessed government didn't want them to know.
That kind of reporting - perhaps the most important journalism there is - may have become an endangered species Thursday with a new indictment of WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange under the Espionage Act.
For good reason, press-rights advocates are far more alarmed now than they were last month when Assange was initially indicted.
"This is unlike anything we've seen before, and it crosses a bright red line for journalists," said James Risen, a longtime national security reporter for the Times and now director of the First Look Media's Press Defense Fund. While a Times reporter, Risen (co-author of the warrantless wiretapping story) struggled for years to avoid testifying about his confidential source during the leak investigation of Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer.
The new, expanded indictment goes after Assange for his role in obtaining and publishing secret military and diplomatic documents in 2010.
What's alarming about the indictment is the way it would criminalize some of the basic functions of newsgathering and publication.
"The message of this indictment is that national security journalism is possibly criminal," said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
And no matter what happens with the case, he said, "it's hard to see how that message won't change how news organizations operate." That is very much the intended message, he said.
And, in turn, that chilling effect would deprive the public of information it should know. Using examples from the recent past, Jaffer mentioned the long-secret American drone program and the abuse and torture of prisoners at the CIA's "black sites."
If whistleblowers are afraid to leak information and if news organizations fear receiving and publishing it, citizens will know only what the government wants them to know, through what he sardonically called "executive grace."
In other words, the architects of secret, and possibly illegal or immoral, government programs would be the same people who get to decide whether information about them is made public.
Underlying all of this is the monumental overclassification of government information that drastically increased after 9/11 - a system that's almost universally acknowledged to be badly broken.
That means that journalists and citizens are caught in a tighter-than-ever squeeze: Far too much that they should know has been labeled secret, and the accepted ways of informing the public are at risk of being criminalized.
The Trump administration's aggressive antipathy toward journalists is an undeniable element, too.
"The administration has gone from denigrating journalists as 'enemies of the people' to now criminalizing common practices in journalism that have long served the public interest," Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said in a statement.
Or as Risen put it: "It's very obvious that the White House and Trump are pressuring and politicizing the Justice Department to go after the press."
Julian Assange is such a divisive, even hated figure, that a straw-man argument often crops up when he is threatened with prosecution.
Assange isn't really a journalist, goes this thinking, so journalists and others who care about press rights shouldn't be worried about what happens to him.
In this case, nothing could be further from the truth.
Assange may be an easier target because he is such a lightning rod - and, for some, because of his role in publicizing Democratic National Committee emails that damaged Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign against Trump.
The ever-more-political Justice Department - and the press-baiting president - are no doubt well aware of his vulnerability.
But that is very far off the main point.
No one should diminish the danger or the importance of this despicable indictment because they don't approve of Assange.

Texto completo: Un video que la fiscalía en Nueva York aún no presenta como parte de la evidencia en el juicio contra Keith Raniere muestra el martirio al que fueron sometidas mujeres convertidas en esclavas sexuales a través de la secta NXIVM en Albany.
En la grabación se aprecia el rito de iniciación mediante el cual “tatuaban” a las mujeres con las iniciales del líder de la secta.
En el clip, presentado en exclusiva en el noticiero de Loret de Mola de Televisa , se ve a un grupo de cuatro féminas desnudas en una de estas ceremonias.
Una de ellas está acostada mientras la tatúan; se trata de Sarah Edmondson , quien denunció en 2017 las prácticas de la secta a The New York Times.
A Raniere, que camuflaba los abusos como cursos de “autoayuda” bajo “Programas de Éxito Ejecutivo”, se le ve en el video pronunciando una especie de juramento que las mujeres a su vez deben repetir.
“Por favor márcame, sería un honor que quiero portar por el resto de mi vida”, se escucha en la ceremonia.
A pesar del dolor que se refleja en la cara de Edmondson al ser marcada a fuego vivo con un cauterizador, ésta intenta disimularlo y ríe junto a las otras chicas.

Megan McArdle: Caution, Uber and Lyft, wrecking taxis may turn out to be a multi-company pileup

Texto completo: This week, The New York Times did something I would have thought impossible: They made New Yorkers feel bad for cabdrivers. Until Uber and Lyft arrived on the scene, a surefire way to liven up a dull Manhattan dinner party was to broach the topic of taxis — never around when you need one, everyone would moan, and if you do finally luck out, you'll discover it's filthy and invariably driven by a maniac.
But as revealed by the Times investigation of lending practices in the business of buying and selling the medallions required for yellow cab ownership in New York — with prices reaching $1.3 million in 2013 — it turns out that the cabdrivers have their own tales of woe. Many of them took out high-six-figure loans to buy the medallions, on income that barely did more than cover the loan payments. Bad enough when taxi medallions were a scarce and valuable commodity; ruinous now that ride-hailing services have cut into their profits.
Yet, funnily enough, Uber and Lyft aren't doing so well either. Both companies recently went public, only to see their stock trade well below the IPO price. That's because the companies are burning great bonfires of investor cash every quarter, having so far failed to discover a working business model.
Uber and Lyft are discovering that the regulatory monopolies they smashed had existed for a reason. Before Uber's 2009 launch, and Lyft's a few years later, almost every sizable city tightly controlled its taxi market. Government commissions set fares and limited the supply of taxi licenses. These regulations existed because without government intervention, no one would make any money. In a country with tens of millions of driver's licenses, and automobiles to match, the supply of potential taxis far outstripped any possible consumer demand.
Virtually everything people hated about taxis stemmed from that underlying market problem and the regulatory apparatus that tried to fix it. Couldn't get a cab when you needed one? Taxi commissions were protecting incumbent profits by sharply limiting the number of licenses or medallions. Cabs were disgusting and piloted through congested streets at death-defying speeds? Artificial scarcity normally drives up prices, so governments set regulated fares, usually by time and distance. There was no premium for a comfortable and soothing customer experience. Naturally, drivers focused on hauling the maximum number of people every shift.
Everyone complained about the result, but for decades, nothing ever changed. Then came Uber. The company did an end run around that regulatory stalemate, pushing into markets with better service and then daring the taxi commissions to shut them down.
Some cities did just that. But often, by the time the commissioners got around to it, Uber had acquired a rabid fan base, which the company wasn't shy about weaponizing. Amazingly, improbably, Uber broke the taxi commissions — and then broke the people who owned those previously valuable taxi medallions, from individual driver-owners to the operators of taxi fleets.
It was a triumph for libertarian ideals. For Uber's and Lyft's investors, however, it may have been an empty victory.
The companies' problems essentially boil down to this: The barriers to entry into the driving-people-around business are functionally nil. Whenever the profits in the market rise above a subsistence wage, more drivers will enter, thus competing those profits away.
That was the problem taxi medallions had been designed to solve. Drivers still didn't make much money because all you needed to get started in the business was a driver's license. But the people who owned the right to drive were able to make a tidy living, with almost no downside risk. That's why New York City taxi medallions got so valuable: Two decades of low-interest rates made them an attractive alternative to bonds offering yields in the low single digits.
Then a hidden downside emerged, as ride-hailing companies disrupted that previously stable regulatory equilibrium. People who had bought into the medallion market at inflated prices saw the value of their assets crater, and many of them ended up insolvent.
But destroying a profitable business isn't the same thing as creating one. Without the regulatory monopoly they disrupted, how are Uber and Lyft going to make money?
They could try to replicate the monopoly, only without the governmental assist, exerting such firm control over the ride market that new competitors effectively can't enter. The other option: They can't. Uber and Lyft may discover, like taxi-medallion owners before them, that in this business, there's always another guy with a car waiting around the corner to overrun your seemingly impregnable market position.

Texto completo: HOPKINSVILLE -- The pilot arrested at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport earlier in May in connection with a 2015 triple murder case in Western Kentucky pleaded not guilty to murder charges Wednesday.
During an arraignment hearing, Christian "Kit" Richard Martin, 51, appeared at the Christian County Detention Center and will remain held without bond.
A Christian County grand jury indicted Martin earlier this month in the 2015 murders of Calvin and Pamela Phillips and Edward Dansereau.
Calvin Phillips, 59, was found shot to death Nov. 18, 2015, in his home in Pembroke.
The bodies of his 58-year-old wife, Pamela Phillips, and the couple's 63-year-old neighbor, Dansereau, were found a few miles away in a corn field inside a burned car owned by Pamela Phillips.
Martin and the victims were neighbors on Main Street in Pembroke, a town of about 900 residents that is 10 miles southeast of Hopkinsville.
The murder case was cold until May 11, when Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear announced authorities had arrested Martin about 6:30 a.m. that day at a security checkpoint in the Louisville airport.
Martin has been a pilot for PSA Airlines, a subsidiary of American Airlines, since January 2018 and was arrested about an hour before Flight 5523 was set to depart for Charlotte with him at the controls.
Martin has been placed on administrative suspension by the airline pending the outcome of the criminal investigation, a spokeswoman said.
A criminal background check that all pilots undergo turned up no criminal history on Martin "that would disqualify him from being a commercial pilot," the spokeswoman said.
Beshear has declined to explain what helped investigators crack the case, saying he couldn't comment on evidence.
Beshear said the indictment came nearly two years after he said he met with Calvin and Pamela Phillips' son, who was worried the case had stalled.
After that meeting, Beshear accepted a request from the local commonwealth's attorney to appoint a special prosecutor from his office to handle the case.
Apart from being neighbors, Martin and Calvin Phillips were linked through a complicated court-martial case at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.
Martin, a former Army major, was accused in 2015 of sexual assault charges involving several juvenile witnesses.
Calvin Phillips was scheduled to testify in December 2015 in the case but would be killed before he could do so.
Martin was briefly taken into custody, but no charges were filed against him in relation to the triple homicide.
In May 2016, the Leaf-Chronicle in Clarksville, Tennessee, reported that Martin had been acquitted of the sexual assault charges, which arose after several juvenile witnesses accused him of physical and sexual abuse dating back to 2008.
But Martin, who had served in the Army for almost 30 years, was found guilty by the court-martial on lesser charges of two counts of mishandling classified information and two counts of simple assault.
He was dismissed from the Army and sentenced to 90 days in prison.
According to Beshear's office, Martin moved out of Christian County after the alleged murders and was living in North Carolina at the time of the indictment.
Martin has an address in Raleigh, North Carolina, according to online records.
He told a Nashville television station in a 2016 interview that Calvin Phillips was his "star witness."
But Calvin Phillips' son, Matt Phillips, told CNN his father had evidence that was harmful to Martin's case in military court.
Thompson, Martin's attorney, told the New York Times earlier this month that Calvin Phillips' testimony would have helped Martin and that Phillips was expected to be a witness for both the defense and the prosecution.
Martin's daughter and fiancée have told some TV stations that they believe Martin is innocent.
The Special Prosecutions Unit in Beshear's office is prosecuting the case.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Current and former military officers urged the White House not to pardon service members and security contractors implicated in war crimes, warning that forgiving their offenses would send a dangerous signal to U.S. troops and potential adversaries.
Aides to President Donald Trump have been examining high-profile war crimes cases from Iraq and Afghanistan, preparing paperwork so Trump could issue pardons during Memorial Day commemorations next week, according to two senior U.S. officials.
But the possibility that Trump could issue pardons has brought a flood of opposition from current and former high-ranking officers, who say it would encourage misconduct by showing that violations of laws prohibiting attacks on civilians and prisoners of war will be treated with leniency.
"Absent evidence of innocence or injustice, the wholesale pardon of U.S. service members accused of war crimes signals our troops and allies that we don't take the law of armed conflict seriously," retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a tweet Tuesday.
He added: "Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility. Risk to us."
Among those under consideration for a pardon is Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL awaiting court-martial on charges that he shot unarmed civilians and stabbed a teenage Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017, according to one of the officials, who discussed the internal deliberations in return for anonymity.
Gallagher has pleaded not guilty and commentators on Fox News have lobbied Trump to pardon him.
Other cases being examined by the White House include those of Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who is charged with killing an unarmed Afghan in 2010; three Marine snipers prosecuted for urinating on the corpse of a dead Afghan fighter in 2011; and a former security guard for Blackwater Worldwide who was convicted of murder in December for killing unarmed Iraqis in 2007.
Other officers warned that if U.S. personnel accused of such crimes escaped punishment, civilians on foreign battlefields would be less inclined to cooperate with U.S. forces, and U.S. service members taken prisoners would be more likely to be mistreated or even killed when taken captive.
"If President Trump issues indiscriminate pardons of individuals accused - or convicted by their fellow service members - of war crimes, he relinquishes the United States' moral high ground and undermines the good order and discipline critical to winning on the battlefield," said retired Gen. Charles Krulak, a former commandant of the Marine Corps.
Several officials said Trump is not believed to have consulted his senior military advisers about issuing pardons. The possibility of military pardons was first reported by The New York Times.
Senior officers have not spoken out publicly about the possibility Trump could pardon accused war criminals, but many are privately outraged, according to one currently serving at the Pentagon.
Asked about the possibility that Trump would pardon service members, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters Tuesday: "I'm not really going to speculate on any of the pardons, but I would just say we'll leave it to the White House to comment on the situation there."
Trump has repeatedly bypassed normal procedures for issuing pardons and granting clemency, seizing on cases mentioned on Fox News or that resonate with him or his supporters.
This month, he pardoned Army Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted of killing an Iraqi during questioning in 2008.

Lindh, a Californian who moved to the Middle East three years before the terror attacks Sept. 11, 2001, served 17 years of a 20-year sentence for supporting the Taliban regime.
He traveled to the Middle East to study Arabic at age 17, according to The New York Times. Lindh was a volunteer at an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan.
Lindh will be placed on probation, which bars him from going online or owning a device that can access the web without permission, the Times reported.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
It was only 11 months ago when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked the political world with a primary upset of Representative Joseph Crowley, the No. 4 Democrat in the House and a mainstay in the Queens Democratic machine.
Then the youngest woman ever elected to Congress took Washington by storm, using her savvy social media skills to help achieve mainstream buy-in for ideas once deemed too far left for Democrats.
Now Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, may be testing the extent of her influence back home: In a hotly contested seven-way Democratic primary for Queens district attorney, she has decided to endorse Tiffany Cabán, the candidate whose platform most echoes the first-term congresswoman's.
"Our criminal justice system needs to change," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times in a statement. "New Yorkers deserve a seat at the table, and a champion who will fight to realign our priorities toward equal treatment under the law. If Tiffany Cabán wins, things are going to change."
The Democratic primary on June 25 is seen as something of a referendum on whether a diverse borough like Queens is ready to embrace the liberal criminal justice reforms -- aimed at ending the era of mass incarceration -- that are sweeping the country.
At the same time, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez may also get some sense if her win in the 14th Congressional District, which covers parts of Queens and the Bronx, can be extrapolated to a boroughwide race with more than one million registered voters.
Ms. Cabán, 31, is only the second person Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed since being sworn in. This month, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Raul Fernandez, a candidate for the Brookline Select Board in Massachusetts.
Mr. Fernandez, a friend from her time attending Boston University, won a three-year term. Now Ms. Cabán is hoping an endorsement from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will help distinguish her in a crowded field.
"We are proud of all the endorsements we have gotten, but this is a big deal," Ms. Cabán, who previously worked as a public defender, said. "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a progressive champion and she's been an inspiration for me. It shows that we are building a national, grass-roots progressive movement."
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement was one of the most sought after among progressive candidates in the race to replace the longtime district attorney, Richard A. Brown, who died May 4 from complications of Parkinson's disease. Mr. Brown had previously announced he would resign on June 1, the 28th anniversary of his taking the office.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who has more than 4 million followers on Twitter, is expected to send an email to her supporters this week announcing her endorsement and asking them to donate to Ms. Cabán.
"Instead of criminalizing poverty, we're going to dedicate resources toward prosecuting abusive landlords," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. "Instead of targeting people who use marijuana, we can go after the drug companies that took advantage of working-class folks for profit."
She added: "We can end broken-windows policing and rebuild the relationship between our communities, and the justice system that's supposed to work for us. We can end cash bail, so that the rich and poor are held equal in the eyes of the law."
Ms. Cabán could not be more ideologically different than Mr. Brown.
She is in favor of closing Rikers Island, but she does not support the plan to build new borough-based jails. She is in favor of ending the prosecution of drug use and supports fully decriminalizing prostitution, including for the clients. She is also a proponent of ending cash bail for all crimes.
Ms. Cabán has received endorsements from the Democratic Socialists of America, VOCAL-NY, Real Justice PAC and the Working Families Party, among others.
Also running for Queens district attorney are Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president; Greg Lasak, a former judge who also worked as a senior prosecutor under Mr. Brown; Betty Lugo, a lawyer; Rory Lancman, a councilman from Queens; Jose Nieves, who worked in the New York attorney general's office as a deputy chief in the special investigations and prosecutions unit; and Mina Malik, a former prosecutor in Queens and Brooklyn and a deputy attorney general in the District of Columbia.
Ms. Katz has collected strong institutional support with endorsements from several powerful unions and politicians such as Representatives Gregory Meeks and Carolyn B. Maloney; Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the State Assembly; and Rubén Díaz Jr., the Bronx borough president. Mr. Meeks was elected chairman of the Queens County Democratic Party, replacing Mr. Crowley.
Ms. Cabán said she had spoken only once previously with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, but it was clear that their values aligned when they spoke before the endorsement. "We talked about racial, social and economic justice," said Ms. Cabán, who described Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as an inspiration.
"Having an example of a working-class Latina woman who made it work because the community rallied around her resonated with me, a queer Latina," Ms. Cabán said. "I never thought in a million years I would have the privilege to run for office because the barriers seemed too great."
Bruce Gyory, an adjunct professor of political science at the University at Albany, said that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement could be a game-changer but that it does not come without political risk.
"If Katz wins big, it's a devaluing of the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez political currency. Other legislators will ask: 'Why should I be afraid?"' Professor Gyory said. "If she powers Cabán to victory, then the giant killer strikes twice. There won't be enough Pepto-Bismol in the Bronx or Queens for incumbent legislators."

Texto completo: The typical New York City cabbie, let alone the typical business loan expert, has no idea that a New Deal agency set up to protect borrowers, the Bureau of Federal Credit Unions, later became the National Credit Union Administration.
And that cabbie and that loan expert probably has no idea that the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998, passed when Al D'Amato was chairing the Senate Banking Committee, allowed taxi medallion credit unions to lend out every penny, 100% of assets, far beyond the 12.25% cap of regular credit unions.
And that cabbie and that loan expert likely are clueless that Albany has failed to ban confessions of judgments, legal documents in which a person pleads at fault in advance of a civil lawsuit and can instantly lose all their property with a single late payment.
But the cabbie and loan maven surely know all about medallion values, once topping $1 million, that have collapsed in the face of the competition of 80,000 app-hail cars from Uber and Lyft.
Instead of a guaranteed ride to the middle class for industrious immigrants, scrimping and saving and borrowing to buy a medallion has led to bankruptcy and suicide for cabbies, a tragic and well-known tale. The New York Times' exploration of this history, of the systematic failure of city and state overseers to curb predatory lending practices despite full knowledge of what was happening, chronicle a cataclysmic government failure.
A year ago this page proposed using some of the congestion pricing fees from yellows to underwrite a focused bailout. The source is less important than the remedy: Restructure the bad loans so that cabbies can breathe, and live, again.

Texto completo: Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach expressed interest in serving as federal immigration czar for President Donald Trump if granted 24-hour service of a government jet, a West Wing office and walk-in access to the president, as well as the future nomination to become homeland security secretary.
The 10-item request was submitted to the White House, according to a report in The New York Times, as the president considered hiring someone to lead the administration’s work on overhauling legal immigration and reducing illegal migration to the United States.
Kobach, a Republican who lost the campaign for Kansas governor in November, wasn’t available to comment Tuesday. He said recently when asked about his future that he wasn’t certain where he would land. He had been providing legal counsel to an organization dedicated to building a wall along the border with Mexico, but was considering a 2020 campaign for the U.S. Senate seat to be vacated by GOP Sen. Pat Roberts.
“We shall see,” Kobach said in response to an interview question about his future at a recent Topeka anti-abortion rally.
The Times reported Kobach requested a staff of seven people, a security detail, title of assistant to the president and power to be the administration’s
central spokesman on immigration policy. He also
central spokesman on immigration policy. He also proposed that a handful of Cabinet secretaries defer to him on immigration issues.
He sought an assurance that he would be nominated as secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by November, The Times said. In addition to regular use of government aircraft to make visits to the U.S. border, he also requested weekends off to be with his family. He lives in eastern Kansas.
In the interview with Kobach, he joked “it might be fun” to be part of a rematch with former Gov. Jeff Colyer, who was defeated in the 2018 GOP gubernatorial primary by Kobach, if both entered the Senate race.
He also said the group We Build the Wall would soon break ground on construction of border wall, suggesting it might be easier to move forward on private land in Texas and saying that site was “a closely guarded secret.”
Trump campaigned in Kansas for Kobach during the 2018 cycle. After Trump was elected, he appointed Kobach to a commission that examined assertions of voter fraud. The project was inspired by comments by Kobach and Trump that millions of illegal immigrants voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton cost the president the popular vote in 2016.

Give Kris Kobach whatever he wants if he can fix the asylum scam

Texto completo: If former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach actually thinks he can fix the asylum insanity at the southern border in a matter of just six months, then he deserves whatever he wants from the administration.
Kobach is apparently so confident in his capability that when President Trump asked him about possibly serving as his “immigration czar,” Kobach submitted a list of conditions to be met in order for him to accept the job. According to the New York Times, included on the list were access to a private government jet, weekends off, and a “promise” that Trump nominate Kobach as Department of Homeland Security secretary by Nov. 1 of this year.
The report says that Trump met with Kobach after Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April as head of Department of Homeland Security, and the two of them discussed creating the czar position “to coordinate immigration policy across government agencies.”
Kobach showed up for the meeting with “a detailed plan to crackdown on asylum seekers entering the country” and submitted his list of conditions “in recent weeks.” If hired immediately, that would give Kobach, at the most, over six months to make any changes to the asylum sham that has turned border agents into a welcoming committee for Central America’s worst problems.
It’s clear already that Kobach isn’t wanted at the White House by some influential people inside. The Times said its knowledge of the list of conditions was made possible “by three people familiar with it” and that some in the administration “were taken aback by what they regard as its presumptuousness.”
Guessing who those three people are is very easy, and Kobach likely knows them — hence his request for maximum autonomy, “walk-in privileges with the president,” and an “assistant to the president” ranking.
There is nothing more important on the immigration issue right now than fixing the asylum fiasco. Trump should give Kobach whatever the hell he wants if his plan has even just a 51% chance of working.
But Kobach’s ability to do the job would require something extraordinarily scarce in the White House: Trump’s attention and support. Maybe Kobach should have made sure those were on his list.

The drumbeat for impeachment is growing. Can Nancy Pelosi stop it?

Texto completo: From the start, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has resisted calls to impeach President Donald Trump.
She’s called the move divisive. She refused to budge even as rumblings grew among House Democrats that special counsel Robert Mueller’s report had enough to start impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump on obstruction of justice grounds. On Monday night, Ms. Pelosi told Democratic leaders that impeachment would take away from the party’s legislative agenda and undercut ongoing investigations into the president by other congressional committees.
But the pressure is mounting, as the Trump administration continues blocking Democrats’ every effort at investigation. It’s unclear how long can Ms. Pelosi can hold the line.
“The more they stonewall, the more powerless people feel, and the more they want to take this immediate action,” says Krystal Ball, a political commentator and host on The Hill’s digital news channel. “The pressure comes from that sense of powerlessness and disgust.”
An April CNN poll found that 69% of Democratic voters want Congress to move forward with impeachment. Billionaire Tom Steyer this month launched a $1 million ad campaign accusing Democrats of doing nothing while the president got away with obstruction and corruption. Even Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a Republican and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said over the weekend that the president should be impeached for obstruction of justice.
All the while, Mr. Trump has stayed on war footing with congressional Democrats, almost daring them to go ahead. “If it’s an impeachment proceeding, then somebody should call it that,” Rudy Giuliani, one of the president’s personal lawyers, told The New York Times this month. “If you don’t call their bluff now, they’ll just keep slithering around for four, five, six months.”
At the Monday meetings, some Democratic leaders pressed Ms. Pelosi on the issue, arguing that impeachment proceedings would give them access to the documents that the administration has refused to provide. The situation intensified Tuesday after former White House counsel Don McGahn failed to obey a Judiciary Committee summons. Even members less explicitly in favor of taking that step say the White House is pushing them toward doing so.
“The initial aim was to investigate and then see what we have. The problem is we can’t get any information,” Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, chair of the House Oversight Committee, tells reporters. “The caucus is slowly moving toward saying, ‘Well, what do we do?’ Because he’s not leaving us with any choices.”
This group of lawmakers – reluctant to move toward impeachment but also increasingly willing to take that step – could be the tipping point for Ms. Pelosi, says Kris Miller, who teaches American government and legislative politics at the University of Maryland, College Park. Before this week, the loudest calls for impeaching the president had come mostly from progressive members in solidly blue districts, she says. Now, some combination of institutional duty and being boxed in by the administration’s stonewalling has caused a rise in this third camp.
“Their numbers are not huge, but they’re growing quickly,” Professor Miller says. “I think that changes a lot for the caucus overall.”
Still, Ms. Pelosi isn’t entirely out of options – yet. Democrats have managed to put the Trump administration on the defensive in one court case: On Monday, a federal district court judge ruled that the president’s accounting firm must turn over his financial records to the House Oversight Committee. Judge Amit Mehta rejected the Trump legal team’s argument that the committee had no authority to investigate the president.
There’s also a view that if Ms. Pelosi could hold her caucus together until a little closer to the 2020 primaries – if the burst of voices calling for impeachment dies down in the next day or two – she might be able to more successfully make the case that the best way to defeat Mr. Trump is through the ballot box.
And while some Democratic presidential candidates have voiced support for impeachment, “It’s not absolutely in their interest to have all this going on while they’re trying to introduce themselves to the public,” says John Fortier, of the Bipartisan Policy Center. “The argument that impeachment may not be good for [the Democratic Party] politically is a strong one.”
One big wild card could be the special counsel’s testimony, if it takes place. A public hearing relatively soon might be enough to defuse the pressure on Democrats to take drastic action, Professor Miller says.
For now, every option seems to be on the table. “Everybody in the Democratic caucus – including Pelosi – wants to hold the administration to account,” Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal told a group of reporters Tuesday.
“The question is … how do we best do that?” says Representative Jayapal, who co-chairs the Progressive Caucus and called for impeachment over the weekend. “And that is an ongoing discussion.”

Texto completo: The state of Mississippi will present arguments in federal appeals court today, defending the merits of its most recent effort to limit abortion in the state.
In March, Gov. Phil Bryant signed the "heartbeat bill" into law, banning abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can come as early as six weeks into pregnancy. The law does not allow exceptions for rape or incest. It's set to take effect July 1.
The law is being challenged in federal court by the Center for Reproductive Rights. The hearing will be held at 9 a.m. today. If the court rules against the state, the ban will not go into effect. If that happens, the state is likely to appeal.
Mississippi has been in a similar position before. Last year, Bryant signed a 15-week abortion ban into law. After an emergency hearing, the law was ruled unconstitutional and blocked from taking effect. Attorney General Jim Hood recently filed papers on behalf of the state, appealing the ruling. So, now, both the 15-week ban and the heartbeat bill are in court.
Before Tuesday's hearing, here are some things to know.
What is the heartbeat ban? Abortions would be banned in Mississippi once a fetal heartbeat is detected, around six weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman knows she's pregnant. The House and Senate both rejected efforts to allow exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. The law does allow an exception if the pregnancy endangers a woman's life or one of her major body functions.
The Mississippi law says a physician who performs an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected could face revocation of his or her state medical license.
Until the law goes into effect, abortions are still legal in Mississippi, even if a heartbeat is detected. The sole abortion clinic in the state, Jackson Women's Health Organization in Jackson, currently does not perform abortions past 16 weeks of pregnancy.
Of the legislation, Bryant previously said, "We think this is showing the profound respect and desire of Mississippians to protect the sanctity of that unborn life whenever possible.
"It also protects, we believe, the physical and mental health of the mother. We here in Mississippi believe in protecting and defending the whole life of that child."
What's happening with this lawsuit? The Center for Reproductive Rights, based in New York, has sued the state on behalf of Jackson Women's Health Organization.
The suit is an effort to stop the heartbeat law from going into effect. Arguments for the state will be presented by the AG's office.
The hearing will be held Tuesday in federal court in front of U.S. District Judge Carlton W. Reeves.
What's happened with prior lawsuits? Reeves struck down the state's 15-week abortion ban law in November, saying it "unequivocally" violates a woman's constitutional rights.
In his decision, Reeves wrote that "Mississippi's law violates Supreme Court precedent, and in doing so it disregards the 14th Amendment guarantee of autonomy for women desiring to control their own reproductive health."
Reeves also referenced precedent, saying, in part, "bans do not fare well in court."
How much have Mississippi taxpayers paid in legal fees? Margaret Ann Morgan, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Attorney General's Office, previously said the 15-week abortion ban has not cost the state additional money because staff attorneys have been working on the case.
In March, Morgan said staff attorneys had spent 916 hours on the case so far. Morgan said that time is valued at $65 hour, meaning the attorney general's office has spent nearly $60,000 on the impending litigation.
An updated cost analysis was not immediately available.
Lt. Gov Tate Reeves previously addressed the financial aspect, saying he would have "absolutely no problem supporting strongly whatever it costs to defend this lawsuit, because I care about unborn children."
How does Mississippi's ban compare to other states? Across the United States, there has been an increase in anti-abortion legislation, with the intent to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many proposed bills are similar to Mississippi's, attempting to ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected.
Alabama passed the most restrictive abortion law in the country last week, not only banning abortions after a heartbeat can be detected but punishing doctors who perform abortions with a possible 99-year prison sentence. Like Mississippi's law, the Alabama law does not allow exceptions for rape or incest.
Kentucky's governor signed a similar bill into law in March, the New York Times reported, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it just hours later, ruling it was "potentially unconstitutional."
In April, Ohio also passed a heartbeat abortion ban. The ban does allow exceptions in cases of rape or incest. Wednesday, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood filed suit against the state, challenging the ban.
In May, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill into law that would make abortions illegal if a heartbeat is detected. It will not go into effect until 2020.
On Friday, Missouri's Republican-led Legislature approved a ban on abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy and Republican Gov. Mike Parsonis expected to sign it.
In Louisiana, a heartbeat abortion ban is moving through the state Legislature and Gov. Jon Bel Edwards, a Democrat, signaled he would sign it.

Shannon Brewer, the director at the Jackson Women's Health Organization, watches a monitor with the live feed from security video cameras Friday in Jackson. Brewer is concerned about the growing number of abortion restrictive bills being passed by state legislatures.

EPA's plan seen as fudging number of pollution deaths

Texto completo: The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly looking into new ways to estimate the future health risks of air pollution that will make the dangers look less deadly.
The EPA in October 2018 released an extensive report about the impact of the administration's Affordable Clean Energy rule, which sought to block proposed Obama-era regulations on coal-fired power plants. The changes, the EPA estimated, could cause as many as 1,400 additional premature deaths annually by 2030.
But now, the EPA plans to create a new formula that will lower that estimate, and in turn defend Trump's proposal, according to The New York Times.
While details were limited on the new methodology, The Times reported that the calculations would discard "more than a decade of peer-reviewed EPA methods and relies on unfounded medical assumptions."
The assumption is that the lowered reported risks would allow the Trump administration to roll back more environmental protections.
"On paper, (this) would translate into far fewer deaths from heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease, even if air pollution increased," The Times reported.
Obama's Clean Power Plan never went into effect due to legal battles. But it would have helped avoid up to 3,600 premature deaths, 90,000 child asthma attacks and 300,000 missed school and work days a year by 2030, the EPA previously estimated.

'Jeopardy!' champ James Holzhauer wins again for the 23rd time, pushing winnings to $1.7M

Texto completo: James Holzhauer, the current reigning champ of "Jeopardy!," returned to the quiz show Monday night – and won his 23rd consecutive game.
Holzhauer, 34, a professional Las Vegas sports gambler, was back to defend his title after the popular game show took a break in its regular competition for a two-week Teachers Tournament.
He won $89,229, pushing his total winnings to $1,780,237.
Before Monday's win, Holzhauer had accumulated winnings of $1,691,008 in 22 victories going back to his first appearance on April 4.
So far, he's the second-most successful contestant in the game show's history, holding the number two spots on the lists for regular-season cash winnings and consecutive wins.
He trails only Ken Jennings, who remains in the top spot for both lists: 74 victories and $2,520,700 in prize money.
How is Holzhauer racking up such big winnings? He explained his strategy in a Q&A with The New York Times. Unlike most players, he picks the highest-value clues first.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game, I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy. "There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Also, he seems to have highly tuned hand-eye coordination when it comes to reaching for the buzzer.
Eddie Timanus, a five-time "Jeopardy!" winner who compiles the college coaches polls for USA TODAY Sports, describes Holzhauer as "a game-changer," both for his aggressive bidding and his mastery of the signalling buzzer.
"Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a Daily Double," Timanus says. "He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big. "
Meanwhile, USA TODAY's For the Win has done the math: How quickly can Holzhauer reach Jennings on the money list?
He’s averaged $76,864 per win so if he keeps up that pace, it’ll take him between 10 or 11 victories to reach Jennings, or about two weeks’ worth of games, says For the Win.
Easy-peasy.
"Jeopardy!" and host Alex Trebek are celebrating their 35th anniversary season. With a weekly audience of 23 million viewers, it's the top-rated quiz show on television.

Texto completo: As great as backpacking in the wilderness can be, far from cell towers and civilization, it can't beat the sweet simplicity of car camping. Just toss your gear (and children, if you have any) in the back of the car, roll down the windows and aim for the nearest state park. And if you bring the following items, you can combine a taste of the wild with almost all the comforts of home -- coffee included.
Big Agnes Dream Island 15° and Therm-A-Rest Luxury Map
This cozy double sleeping bag -- which has a sleeping-pad sleeve for extra comfort -- might help convince a less outdoorsy partner to try camping a little more often.
Coleman Quad Chair With Cooler
This is the Ford F-150 of camping chairs: big, tough, and widely beloved. It even comes with an insulated pouch that'll keep four cans of whatever cool.
Planetary Design French Press with Brü-Stop
Built for camping, this coffee maker has no glass to break, and its 4- or 6-cup carafe will keep the coffee warm until everyone gets up.
Coleman 70 Qt. Xtreme Marine Cooler
This cooler keeps ice frozen for a week, fits in most cars' trucks, and can double as a spare seat -- it can support up to 250 pounds.
Thermacell MR450 Armored Portable Mosquito Repeller
Don't put your faith in citronella candles -- instead, bring this rugged device, which can keep a bedroom-sized outdoors area mosquito-free for four hours.
Mophie Powerstation AC
Even if you are not bringing your laptop, pack a portable laptop charger -- this one is small but sturdy and reliable -- to power your USB-A and USB-C devices.

Texto completo: In the years since World War II broke out in Europe and President Franklin Roosevelt foreshadowed support for France and England in a radio fireside chat, presidents have spoken to the American people at length about conflicts threatening to involve the nation.
As tensions rise precipitously between the United States and Iran — with bombers set on hair trigger alert and naval battle groups on the move — that’s not what we’re getting from President Donald Trump. Standing in the front door of the White House last week he blurted out, “I hope not,” to a reporter’s shouted question about the prospect of war with Iran.
Then on Sunday, he seemed to contradict that sentiment in a tweet, “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!”
As tightening sanctions cripple the Persian Gulf nation, an American carrier group is rushed to the region and nonemergency personnel are evacuated from the U. S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U. S. Consulate in Erbil — a step not taken even when Islamic State terrorists were rampaging across Iraq in 2014 — Trump needs to explain what he is trying to achieve.
The commander in chief is preparing the military for the outbreak of violence, but he’s not fulfilling his role in preparing the public. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford will brief the House of Representatives in a secure auditorium. The New York Times reports that military officials expect Middle East commanders to ask for a fresh wave of American forces to deter Iran.
The White House and the Pentagon say the moves are a response to intelligence that Iran is planning attacks on U. S. troops in the region. But this conflicts with threat assessments by allies.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump replaces Barack Obama’s mirage with containment
Beyond this immediate urgency, confusion persists about the broader endgame behind the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions, levied against Iran ever since Washington last year withdrew from a 2015 agreement that was successfully containing Tehran’s nuclear program.
Now Iran threatens to resume stockpiling enriched uranium that could be the precursor to a nuclear warhead.
There’s no question Iran is a bad actor in the Middle East, growing its ballistic missile program and using proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to provoke violence and instability. But how Trump intends to change this is not at all clear.
The sanctions are aimed at making Iran “conform to the normal things that normal nations do,” Pompeo said this month. But he clearly doesn’t believe this himself. “I just don’t see it,” the secretary of State said earlier about Iran moderating its behavior.
And Trump’s other leading foreign policy consultant, national security adviser John Bolton, has made a career out of advocating force against Iran.
Is regime change the goal? This hasn’t worked in Venezuela, where a weaker dictator with a devastated economy still resists U. S. -led efforts to install a new government. And Iran has resisted U. S. efforts to moderate its behavior for 40 years.
Trump, who relishes summitry, has repeatedly offered to meet with Iranian leaders and cut a “deal” to curb their behavior and accept tougher nuclear restrictions. Tehran has thus far shown zero interest.
Trump has long promised to avoid foreign entanglements and has told the Pentagon that his wish is no war with Iran. Then why did he hire Bolton?
And what is the plan? Soundbites shouted at reporters and belligerent tweets can’t convey to Americans the risks Iran poses and what the United States is compelled to do about it.
If there is to be a face-off that includes the prospect of a wider conflict, President Trump owes it to the American people to speak before the saber rattling becomes a sobering reality.

Texto completo: After the college admissions scandal broke in March, with all the allegations about rich and famous parents resorting to lies and bribes to get their kids into elite colleges, I found myself thinking about Marilee Jones.
You may not remember Jones, but she was the subject of a different admissions-related scandal that dominated the news around here a dozen years ago. As the longtime dean of admissions at MIT, Jones had won considerable fame in higher-ed circles. She coauthored a book, Less Stress, More Success, and became what The New York Times called “the guru of the movement to tame the college admissions frenzy." Along the way, she attracted national media coverage for her crusade to make the college application process less stressful — and return some joy to the teenage years. Among the changes she made to the MIT undergraduate application: adding the question “tell us about something you do for the pleasure of it" and reducing the number of spaces for extracurricular activities, from 10 to six.
For Jones, everything came crashing down in the spring of 2007, when MIT asked her to resign after learning she had fabricated her educational background nearly three decades earlier. She had claimed to have undergraduate and graduate degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Union College, and Albany Medical College, when in fact she had earned just one degree: a bachelor's from the College of Saint Rose in Albany.
After the headlines faded and the crews from Inside Edition backed out of her driveway, Jones disappeared from public view as she tried to sort out what had happened — and who she really was. Her crusade largely disappeared as well, swallowed up by her personal scandal. That was too bad, since she had sounded an important alarm.
Her critique went like this: Elite colleges, fixated on keeping their U.S. News & World Report rankings high, worked hard to boost the number of applications they received, knowing that would increase the number of rejection letters they sent out, making them appear more selective. Parents, desperate for bragging rights in their circles, were sending their kids a message that anything less than an elite acceptance letter constituted failure. With the stakes becoming impossibly high and the odds vanishingly low, Jones warned, more and more kids and parents would try to game the system.
When I catch up with Jones this spring after the Varsity Blues scandal has just broken, she is working as dean of admissions and college counseling at a private high school in New Jersey and running a private college counseling service. As much as she had been warning about student stress when she worked in college admissions, she says she has a much deeper appreciation for the problem now that she is working directly with high schoolers.
“All the adults in their life are demanding perfection from these kids," Jones says. “They don't feel like who they are is good enough." They feel the pressure to present themselves as something more.
This is where she feels she can be especially useful, turning her own painful downfall into a cautionary tale. “If I've learned anything," she says, “it's the importance of authenticity."
Jones describes an exchange she had after noticing exaggerations in a student's college essay.
“This isn't the truth," she told the student.
“Well, it's sort of the truth," the student replied.
If you don't take that out, Jones said, “you're signaling to yourself that you're not good enough. I totally get that. That's what I did. But, let me tell you, it never helps."
Back in 2007, before her lies were exposed, things could not have been going better for Jones professionally. Yet she was a mess physically. She and her husband had separated, and she was suffering from debilitating episodes of arrhythmia, which her doctor attributed to stress. One day her newly installed boss called. Someone had told him she was passing herself off as a PhD. Was it true? Jones denied it, explaining that people sometimes introduced her at conferences as “Dr. Marilee Jones," and she didn't feel it appropriate to correct them.
“After I hung up the phone," she recalls, “I knew I had falsified my résumé. I went down the hall to see him. I took advantage of the moment. That was it. I told him."
Her boss was angry, she says, and her career was in tatters. She drove home in a daze, she says, and had to tell her estranged husband about this decades-long lie he knew nothing about. “But within an hour of getting home, my arrhythmia was gone."
The whole ordeal, she says, was a self-inflicted hell, but she's ultimately grateful for it. “It saved my health, for sure. And it gave me my life back."
She is now working to earn her master's degree through the University of Texas's online program. She plans to stick with it until she's earned her doctorate. That way, if someone at a conference someday introduces her as “Dr. Jones," all she'll need to do is smile with pride.

A Scent for a Cynical Age

Texto completo: Every once in a while a fragrance comes along that causes a rupture in the history of olfaction as we know it, and suddenly it is clear that the scent of the world will never be exactly the same.
Such was the case in October 1994, when CK One had its debut. It was the ultimate anti-1980s, anti-Boomer scent, a riposte to the showy perfumes of the "Dynasty" and Wall Street years, including Calvin Klein's own best-selling Obsession.
With a bright, citrusy beginning that segued into sweetness and then faded into muskier clarity, it smelled like teen spirit. It was the perfect sensory expression of a generation that grew up at the tail-end of the illusion that was the American dream, without the self-satisfied ambitions of their striving parents, alienated from gold chains, shoulder pads and "Miami Vice" pastels, ambivalent about the concept of ... well, pretty much everything.
In its first 10 days, CK One made more than $ 5 million, according to the company. Twenty bottles were sold every minute. It was available at all 85 Tower Records stores, next to Nirvana albums. (Record stores! Remember them?) Had it been an album, the salespeople said, it would have been the third-best-selling CD of the Christmas season.
Read more about the tech, music, style, books, rules, films and pills that scream Gen X.
In the mid-90s the annual ka-ching count reached approximately $ 90 million. It "disrupted the fragrance codes of the time," said Alberto Morillas, the master perfumer who created the scent along with Harry Fremont.
"Everything was a bull's-eye," said Mr. Fremont said. "Everything was created exactly with this market in mind. And it was a major turning point."
First, there was the concept itself: the first "unisex" (unisex was the genderless of the '90s) fragrance, a scent meant for the androgynous slackers that slouched around in one another's thermals and plaids, that slunk into work in skinny black pantsuits over ribbed tanks and believed in combat boots for all seasons. It was billed as "one for all," though what that really meant was one for all in this age group, and was greeted as revolutionary. In point of fact, the first perfumes were genderless, and only in the 1930s did the sexes start getting separated. It was then that it occurred to beauty companies that marketing to men might be lucrative. That is to say, CK One wasn't the first unisex fragrance; it was the first openly marketed unisex fragrance. Which, with its whiff of cynicism, was in itself somehow very Gen X.
That was no accident: According to Mr. Fremont, the original brief came from an extensive study Calvin Klein had conducted on what would appeal to this particular disaffected consumer group.
Then there was the perfume: top notes of bergamot, lemon, mandarin, fresh pineapple, papaya, cardamom, green tree accord; heart notes of florals like violet, rose, lily of the valley; and bottom notes of green tea, oak moss, cedar wood and sandalwood, among others. It was criticized by those who didn't like it for ultimately being, as one review went, "so intent on being gender-neutral from a perfume aesthetics perspective, that it literally comprises notes that act to neutralize each other, making the most anonymous and androgynous of beige pleasantries ever smelled at the time."
But that was exactly the point. It didn't call attention to itself. It lolled unidentifiably on the skin.
The bottle was part of it: a frosted glass flask with the thin, lowercase but architectural initials ck (a modified version of the Futura Light font, which pretty much says it all) etched on the front and a screw-on top. It looked like the kind of cheap rum you'd keep in your back pocket; dressed-down like CK, minimal in the Calvin mode, hinting at misbehavior without necessarily doing it.
And so, of course, were the ad campaigns. Shot by Steven Meisel in black and white, they were inspired by a 1969 Richard Avedon photograph of Andy Warhol and the denizens of the Factory. "I wanted to capture a liberal and rebellious attitude, featuring unique people, for our new anti-perfume," Calvin Klein told Yuka Yamaji in an interview for the Phillips auction house when a book on his photographs was released. "I knew Steven could do that."
The resulting images featured a rotating cast of weedy, lank boys and girls of all sizes, shapes and shades seemingly free of makeup and artifice, some with long hair, some with shaved heads, sometimes shirtless, sometimes crawling around on the floor for no apparent reason, sometimes kissing, sometimes jumping, often talking.
Kate Moss was there (she was the original spokesmodel, intoning "The only one, CK One, a fragrance from Calvin Klein" at the end of every ad), as well as Jenny Shimizu, the tattooed, openly gay model, and Stella Tennant, the grungy British aristocrat and, every once in while, a more mature fashion insider like Polly Allen Mellen, the fashion editor known for clapping with her hands over her head when excited.
Though its dominance could not last -- the scent wheel turned, and fruits and florals made a comeback at the turn of the millennium -- CK One remained a defining fragrance for a subsector of the industry. Calvin Klein-the-brand brought it back in different variations (in 2007, with CK in2u, the "the first fragrance for the technosexual generation," Tom Murry, then the Calvin Klein chief executive, told The New York Times; in 2011 as a lifestyle spinoff). But it never had quite the resonance it had at its introduction, when age group and olfaction had a meeting of the minds.
As Quentin Crisp, the then 80-something flamboyant British writer and actor who inspired the Sting song "Englishman in New York," said in an early TV ad for the original scent, "What does it all mean?" He was talking about the scent, sure. But also about the whole darn situation.

'Do over' proms pursue perpetual adolescence

Texto completo: Prom season is upon us. We all know what that means: More American adults are doing their proms all over again.
A New York Times headline about a growing number of adults says they are taking "A Second Shot to Have the Best Night of their Lives."
And carry on like a bunch of retrograde adolescents.
The modern prom, reports Slate, "may be traced to the Ivy League and the annual tradition of a 'presentation week,' during which formal dress and dancing accompanied a promenade concert."
Not content with only the well-to-do experiencing the awkwardness and misery of the prom, high schools across America embraced it, particularly after World War II. Now the prom is a rite of passage for American teens everywhere, with many blowing thousands of dollars on their big nights.
But I certainly wouldn't want to do my prom over.
I didn't know my date very well. She was in my photography class, and very pretty. When she agreed to go with me, she greatly disrupted the Bethel Park High School prom-date pecking order. Whereas my date greatly raised my social status — even my friends and family were shocked she'd go with me — I lowered hers.
She was awfully sore about it.
"I heard about you," she told me at our pre-prom date. "A regular class clown! You better not show up in a limo, wear a top hat or cane or do anything else to embarrass me!"
That set the tone for an incredibly unpleasant weekend.
We got lost on the way to the prom, lost on the way to my friend Cook's cabin in Ohio and lost on the way home. My first foray into the adult world was rough, to be sure — a precursor, regrettably, of many more unpleasant adult experiences to come.
Similarly awkward prom experiences may motivate the growing number of adults trying to "get it right" during a second round.
But there are no "do overs" in life. Didn't novelist Thomas Wolfe make it clear that we "can't go home again"? The prom is supposed to be a teen's first foray into the adult world, not an adult's eager return to adolescence.
That's not stopping ever more "adults" from trying. Too many are not just doing their proms over, they're doing summer camps over, too — another hot trend.
Look, if you had an unpleasant prom experience when you were 18, as I did, those are the breaks.
I wrote an earlier, light-hearted newspaper column about my experience. It was published all over the country. After that piece ran, I bumped into my old prom date at the grocery store. She still looked great, but, boy, she was really sore now.
It turns out her husband was so delighted by her rare rude behavior — so delighted, for once, that she, not he, was the one deserving a lecture — he carries the column around in his wallet, showing it enthusiastically to total strangers.
The joy I get from that story almost makes my lousy prom experience worthwhile — but certainly not enough to make me want to do the prom all over again.

Seven takeaways from this week's fall-TV peek

Texto completo: The major broadcast networks unveiled their coming schedules this week as part of the annual tradition known in the industry as "upfront week." The moment marks an opportunity for TV execs to talk about the new and returning shows they're excited about - in the hopes that advertisers will share their enthusiasm. But it's also a time when network suits are confronted with questions about topics ranging from their decision to cancel beloved shows to how well the people appearing in network offerings reflect those watching them.
Let's explore some of the biggest takeaways.
Disney basically owns everything Disney put on a whopper of a presentation introducing plans for its various properties, which have long included ABC, ABC News, Freeform and ESPN. Disney's reach expanded even more this year in the wake of the company's acquisition of Twentieth Century Fox, putting FX and National Geographic under Disney's vast umbrella.
On Tuesday, a conference call with reporters started with news of yet another asset in Disney's grasp: Hulu. Disney will now have full operational control of Hulu (though Comcast will retain its 33 percent financial stake in the streaming company for the next five years).
The news, viewed by industry insiders as Disney's attempt to compete with Netflix and its rapidly growing profile of original content, prompted questions both broad (What does it all mean?) and specific (Which TV shows will land on Disney+, the company's forthcoming streaming service?).
Yes, Constance Wu will still be on 'Fresh Off the Boat' Disney's call with reporters took place less than a week after Wu's Twitter outburst over the renewal of ABC's "Fresh Off the Boat." Obviously, the actress's controversial tweets (and subsequent statement) came up. Karey Burke, the head of ABC Entertainment, shut down any speculation Wu would leave the show.
"There's been no thought to recasting Constance," Burke said. "We love what she does in the show, and we love the show."
Fox faces questions about its commitment to diversity On Monday, Fox announced "Empire" will end after its coming sixth season. The network reiterated there are "no plans" for Jussie Smollett to return to the drama, but executives were mum on whether the actor's ongoing legal troubles contributed to the decision to cancel the show.
The "Empire" news, coupled with the cancellation of a slew of shows prominently featuring black actors, prompted some questions about diversity in Fox's fall lineup. In a conference call with reporters Monday, Fox Entertainment chief executive Charlie Collier said diversity was an "important" issue at the network.
"If you look across our slate in terms of scripted and unscripted and sports, we really are, I think, doing a good job, but the job never stops," he said.
'Bull' is getting a fourth season despite sexual harassment claims against its lead star The future of CBS's legal drama "Bull" looked bleak at the end of last year. In December, the New York Times reported the network paid a confidential $9.5 million settlement to Eliza Dushku after the actress alleged she had faced sexual harassment from Michael Weatherly, the lead star of the popular series.
In a subsequent essay for the Boston Globe, Dushku said she was fired from the show in retaliation for confronting her co-star about sexually charged comments he made on set. Her claims, and CBS's reported attempts to keep them a secret, drew even more scrutiny to a network that had recently ousted its CEO, Les Moonves, and prominent news anchor Charlie Rose, amid allegations of decades-long misconduct.
Not surprisingly, CBS's upfront presentation put the network's turmoil into glaring focus, and CBS Entertainment President Kelly Kahl faced questions about the company's decision to renew "Bull" - announced last week - after Dushku's allegations. According to Variety, he said Weatherly was apologetic and willing to take on coaching to create "a positive environment on the set." Kahl also said CBS found no previous complaints about Weatherly throughout his long history with the network - the actor was on "NCIS" for 13 seasons.
But "Bull" does not appear to be completely unscathed by the controversy. After the renewal news last week, Deadline reported Steven Spielberg's production company, Amblin Television - whose co-heads served as executive producers for the drama's first three seasons - had ended its association with the show.
The CW doubles down on what it does best The CW gave its current lineup a vote of confidence, renewing 14 shows including, in a first for the network, its entire freshman slate.
The CW will also expand its "Arrowverse" with "Batwoman," starring Ruby Rose ("Orange Is the New Black"). The series will lead into "Supergirl" on Sunday nights. In another well-suited pairing, "Nancy Drew," featuring newcomer Kennedy McMann in the title role, will follow "Riverdale" on Wednesdays.
"Riverdale" has spawned another series featuring an Archie Comics character: Katy Keene. Lucy Hale ("Pretty Little Liars") will star as the fashion-forward Keene, who moves to New York City to (what else?) pursue her dreams. Josie (of Pussycats fame) will be her roommate, bringing Ashleigh Murray of "Riverdale" over to the spinoff, which premieres at midseason.
Interracial couples/families take center stage in two new sitcoms ABC's "Black-ish" will be paired with the previously announced spinoff "Mixed-ish." The prequel explores the childhood of Johnson family matriarch Rainbow (Golden Globe winner Tracee Ellis Ross). Played by Arica Himmel, young Rainbow struggles to navigate her adolescence as the biracial daughter of hippies (Tika Sumpter and Anders Holm).
Over at CBS, Chuck Lorre is introducing "Bob Hearts Abishola," which stars Billy Gardell of "Mike and Molly" fame. Gardell plays a middle-aged businessman who falls for his cardiac nurse, a Nigerian woman named Abishola (Folake Olowofoyeku), while recovering from a heart attack. The network says the sitcom will focus on more than Bob's attempts to woo Abishola, calling the show a "comedy that examines immigrant life in America."
Tiffany Haddish will host a reboot of 'Kids Say the Darndest Things' The comedian is also an executive producer of the ABC show, a revamp of the series Bill Cosby hosted in the late '90s. "I'm excited to hear what kids have to say these days. because I can't understand what they are saying on social media," Haddish told Deadline. "They're using too many abbreviations!"

Texto completo: President Trump's family business saw its overall revenues decline modestly in 2018, according to his annual financial report released Thursday, suggesting a disconnect between the Trump brand and the still-growing national economy.
The revenue declines were most pronounced at some of Mr. Trump's best-known properties, including the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which experienced a nearly 10 percent drop. Hotels in Chicago and Hawaii, as well as golf courses in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and the Bronx, also saw declines, suggesting that sales are being affected by consumers deciding to turn away from the Trump brand, industry analysts said.
The results were somewhat better for the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which has become a favored spot for Republicans, lobbyists and some foreign governments and accounts for nearly 10 percent of the Trump Organization's revenues.
The hotel took in $ 40.8 million, up about 1 percent from what it reported in 2017. The intersection of Mr. Trump's business and his official role at the Washington hotel is at the heart of lawsuits accusing him of violating the emoluments clauses of the Constitution, which seek to limit the financial benefits a president can receive from foreign and state governments.
The fresh look at how Mr. Trump's businesses have performed during his presidency comes as the Trump family is facing increased scrutiny from government investigators, in part focusing on business operations at the Trump Organization, which is now run by two of Mr. Trump's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The filing, which totals 88 pages, covers the 2018 calendar year.
The company had small upturns at some properties, including an improvement at its single-biggest revenue-generating property, Trump National Doral in Florida, which the Trump family purchased in 2012 and then spent $ 250 million renovating. Trump Doral's revenue in 2018 increased to nearly $ 76 million, up about 2 percent from the previous year. The Trump golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, also had a considerable jump in revenues, reaching $ 23.4 million, up 15 percent.
In total, Mr. Trump reported 2018 revenues of at least $ 434.9 million, down about 4 percent from the $ 452.6 million he reported a year earlier. He reported assets worth at least $ 1.4 billion, about the same as 2017.
The disclosure made public on Thursday was the fifth that Mr. Trump has filed since declaring his candidacy for president in 2015. With his refusal to make his tax returns public, the annual disclosure offers an accounting of his assets, investments and debt related to his private business ventures. Mr. Trump reported investment and cash accounts with holdings of at least $ 47.5 million last year, down from $ 58.1 million in 2017.
The disclosure is limited; it does not show profits or losses, and assets are valued only in ranges, making it impossible to pinpoint Mr. Trump's precise net worth.
But the financial disclosure underscores how the president's business, the Trump Organization, has become a more modest company than it was just a few years ago, when Mr. Trump spoke of a large pipeline of new deals even as he pledged to back away from any involvement in its management. Since he took office, the Trump name has been stripped from some buildings, and his company has shelved plans to start two new midrange hotel chains.
Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Trump regularly travels during the winter months, had one of the largest declines of the company's major assets. The company said the drop-off could be attributed to fewer new memberships being sold, at a cost of $ 200,000 apiece.
Eric Trump said in a statement that he was pleased with the company's continued performance.
"Our company had an exceptional 2018," he said.
That retrenchment appears driven mostly by political factors, given that the economy has been relatively strong for the past several years. Mr. Trump's polarizing policies and increasingly intense clashes with Democrats have turned off some potential customers and clients, particularly in heavily Democratic cities like Chicago.
Hotel analysts said that the Trump family's hotels in Chicago and Hawaii appeared to be lagging behind hotel market trends, in terms of average room revenue, while the hotel in Washington appeared to be performing better than the overall city hotel market.
"You have the president of our country being on a hotel brand and being very controversial," said David J. Sangree, an Ohio-based hotel industry consultant. "You have some people who are choosing not to stay there. But in another market -- Washington -- he is gaining share."
Golf courses, by and large, showed mixed results, with revenue increases at the clubs in Bedminster, N.J., and another near Washington that Mr. Trump frequents on weekends, but declines at clubs in the Bronx and Jupiter, Fla.
The president's disclosure included 14 loans for at least $ 315 million, including a new financing of $ 5 million to $ 25 million from Florida-based Professional Bank, which stems from the $ 18.5 million purchase of a mansion from Maryanne Trump Barry, Mr. Trump's sister.
Mr. Trump is battling efforts to get further information about his personal finances, including demands by House Democrats for his tax returns, while the Trump Organization has gone to court to halt requests from Democrats for other financial records. The company also faces scrutiny from state and federal authorities for its insurance practices and other aspects of its business, including its relationship with one of its major lenders, Deutsche Bank.
At the same time, Mr. Trump's complex financial history was the subject of a recent New York Times investigation, which showed how he generated huge business losses in the 1980s and 1990s -- undercutting the image he has long promoted of himself as a real estate baron with a golden touch.
Last year's financial disclosure report showed that Mr. Trump had personally repaid $ 100,000 to Michael D. Cohen, his longtime fixer and a Trump Organization lawyer. Mr. Cohen this month began a prison sentence stemming from his guilty plea in a hush-money scheme to silence women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.
Given the intense scrutiny and the political headwinds, the Trump Organization has largely turned inward, focusing on its core portfolio of golf courses, hotels and real estate, while abandoning any short-term hopes of expanding.
Properties that the Trump name has been removed from in recent years include hotels in Toronto, Panama and the SoHo section of Manhattan.
To date, the performance of the family business appears to have fallen short of the gains that critics predicted when Mr. Trump declined to divest his assets upon beginning his presidency.
Eric Trump has acknowledged a change in posture, saying as early as December 2017 that it might be necessary to "take a break" while his father is in the White House.
This year, blaming the political climate, the Trump sons shelved their plans to roll out the two new hotel brands in cities across the United States, effectively abandoning their biggest new business initiative since Election Day 2016.
Instead, the Trump Organization has been battered by a series of questions about its own business practices, and how they square with the president's policies. The Times first highlighted its use of undocumented workers, revealing that such employees had worked for years at Mr. Trump's golf course in Bedminster and elsewhere -- a contrast with the president's "America First" policies.
But financially, the results also have not been as bad as Mr. Trump has made them seem at times.
Upon taking office, Mr. Trump pledged to abide by various restrictions to his business activities, including a ban on new deals in foreign countries, where the company had enjoyed significant growth over the past decade.
Mr. Trump, in an interview in January, complained that his election had caused him to lose "massive amounts of money," calling his decision to seek the presidency "one of the great money losers of all time."

What's On Friday

Texto completo: A new adaptation of "Catch-22" debuts on Hulu. And "See You Yesterday," on Netflix, is a "Back to the Future" for a Black Lives Matter era.
What's Streaming
CATCH-22 Stream on Hulu. When Joseph Heller's satirical World War II novel, "Catch-22," was released in 1961, Richard G. Stern, in a mostly negative review for The New York Times, wrote that Heller "is like a brilliant painter who decides to throw all the ideas in his sketchbooks onto one canvas, relying on their charm and shock to compensate for the lack of design." Stern might not have predicted the staying power and influence the book would have, but nobody can deny that it is a tangled read; the book's fragmented plot and non-sequential narrative make it particularly difficult source material for screen adaptation. (The 1970 film version with Alan Arkin was an exercise in compression.) That challenge was apparently attractive to George Clooney, who is a star, director and executive producer of this stylish new streaming mini-series adaptation. Christopher Abbott (Charlie on "Girls") leads as Yossarian, the protagonist and an Air Force captain stationed on an island in an Italian archipelago. Clooney and Hugh Laurie play higher-ranking military men.
42ND STREET Stream on BroadwayHD. Over 50 actors made up the ensemble of this English revival of the classic 1980s musical, which ran on London's West End in 2017. Directed by Mark Bramble, the revival drew praise for its dance numbers (Randy Skinner was the choreographer) as it brought back the musical's story of backstage drama on 1930s Broadway. When the show debuted on Broadway in 1980, it became a de facto tribute to its original director, Gower Champion, who died hours before the show opened. This revival can be viewed in a similar way for Bramble, who died in February and was also a writer of the musical's book.
SEE YOU YESTERDAY (2019) Stream on Netflix. The well-worn sci-fi tool of time travel is applied to tragedy in this directorial debut from the filmmaker Stefon Bristol. The movie follows C.J. (Eden Duncan-Smith) and Sebastian (Dante Crichlow), two New York City high school science prodigies who invent time machines. Soon after their successful invention, though, C.J.'s brother is shot and killed by a police officer, leading C.J. and Sebastian to travel back in time in an attempt to prevent his death. A "Back to the Future" for a Black Lives Matter era, the movie's inventive filming of Brooklyn at times evokes Spike Lee, which may not be coincidence: Lee was the film's producer.
What's on TV
BRENDAN SCHAUB: YOU'D BE SURPRISED 10 p.m. on Showtime. "Growing up, my heroes were not wrestlers, they were not fighters, they were not football players -- my heroes were stand-up comedians." Hearing that sentence during a comedy set wouldn't normally be surprising. But Brendan Schaub, who says that line in trailer for this comedy special, isn't most comedians: he's a former M.M.A. fighter who has more recently made a name for himself in the podcast world. Expect him to tell stories from his fighting days in this, his first comedy special.

Pete Buttigieg was Facebook’s 287th user. Now he says the company has too much power.

Texto completo: When Pete Buttigieg joined Facebook as a Harvard undergrad in 2004, he was the 287th user registered on the site. The social network’s founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.
“I don’t think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,” Buttigieg said.
Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for tougher regulation of the company and Silicon Valley’s other biggest tech firms.
The debate over Facebook’s future took on new resonance last week as one of the company’s co-founders, Chris Hughes, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, “made a very convincing case” that no company “should have the type of power that… these tech companies have.”
But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasn’t endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting “a spectrum” of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That’s attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.
Buttigieg’s vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a packed schedule of fundraisers around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.
In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the fifth-highest total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.
“Here in the Bay Area, we’ve been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete’s going to do it,” said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. “Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.”
Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg’s account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were created as tests) — if you go to facebook.com/287 while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad’s original page, which he still updates, will pop up.
At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like “a curiosity,” and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he’s used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor’s office.)
When Zuckerberg embarked on a cross-country trip to see more of the U.S. in 2017 — attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions — he stopped by South Bend to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg’s car.
Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.
As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, he’s also worked to attract tech investment to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.
“What they’ve done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,” marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who’s been to the city multiple times at the mayor’s invitation. “You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you’re in San Francisco.”
Rogers, who’s hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be “literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable” about tech issues.
Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called “political theater where very little actually got achieved.”
“What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing — which is incredibly dangerous,” Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders “need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.”
“This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips,” he added.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.
He said Friday that “a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they’ve increasingly turned into Goliath.” But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions “perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,” and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley’s executives have “become very introspective” and are “really reflecting on what they wrought.”
That more diplomatic approach — and Buttigieg’s avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook — “has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,” said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who’s hosted fundraisers for the candidate.
While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigieg’s refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.
“He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn’t want to offend anyone powerful,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate of splitting up the tech giants. “Take a position.”

WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SAY ABOUT BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES
Support it:
Sen. Elizabeth Warren: “Today’s big tech companies have too much power — too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else… That’s why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition — including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.”
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: “Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I agree with Senator Warren on the need to break up big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon. Will be introducing similar legislation in U.S. House.”
On the fence:
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Breaking up Facebook is “something we should take a really hard look at,” he told the Associated Press, saying Warren “has a very strong case to be made.”
Sen. Kamala Harris: “We have to seriously take a look at that… [Facebook] is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I’m concerned, that’s got to stop.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders: “We are living in an era of monopolies that dominate every aspect of our lives — including our government. It’s time to take that power back.”
Voiced concerns about it:
Sen. Cory Booker: “I don’t think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here. It’s not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, ‘I’m going to break up you guys.’”
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke: “I’m not sure if having five more Facebooks — if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media or technology companies — makes as much sense as regulating them.”

Texto completo: When Pete Buttigieg joined Facebook as a Harvard undergrad in 2004, he was the 287th user registered on the site. The social network’s founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.
“I don’t think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run,” Buttigieg said.
Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for tougher regulation of the company and Silicon Valley’s other biggest tech firms.
The debate over Facebook’s future took on new resonance last week as one of the company’s co-founders, Chris Hughes, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, “made a very convincing case” that no company “should have the type of power that… these tech companies have.”
But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasn’t endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting “a spectrum” of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That’s attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.
Buttigieg’s vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a packed schedule of fundraisers around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.
In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, the fifth-highest total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.
“Here in the Bay Area, we’ve been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete’s going to do it,” said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. “Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit.”
Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg’s account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were created as tests) — if you go to facebook.com/287 while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad’s original page, which he still updates, will pop up.
At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like “a curiosity,” and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he’s used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor’s office.)
When Zuckerberg embarked on a cross-country trip to see more of the U.S. in 2017 — attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions — he stopped by South Bend to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cell phone on the dashboard of Buttigieg’s car.
Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.
As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, he’s also worked to attract tech investment to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy work spaces for startups.
“What they’ve done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable,” marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who’s been to the city multiple times at the mayor’s invitation. “You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you’re in San Francisco.”
Rogers, who’s hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be “literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable” about tech issues.
Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called “political theater where very little actually got achieved.”
“What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing — which is incredibly dangerous,” Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders “need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly.”
“This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips,” he added.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.
He said Friday that “a lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they’ve increasingly turned into Goliath.” But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions “perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions,” and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley’s executives have “become very introspective” and are “really reflecting on what they wrought.”
That more diplomatic approach — and Buttigieg’s avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook — “has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry,” said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy advisor who’s hosted fundraisers for the candidate.
While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigieg’s refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.
“He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn’t want to offend anyone powerful,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate of splitting up the tech giants. “Take a position.”

Creative reinvention of tradition

Texto completo: There are different ways to read the resonant phrase "the invention of tradition," coined by the great Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm many years ago. One reading is debunking, skeptical, emphasizing the artificiality of all traditions, the extent to which all cultural narratives flatten or caricature the past.
Another reading is more favorable: It treats the element of invention in cultural traditionalism as a necessary way to bridge the gulf of years and keep the past alive. To invent or reinvent a tradition, in this sense, is not to craft a falsehood; it is to add your own bit of labor to a larger inheritance, which your heirs may renew and reinvent in their own turn.
The second understanding is implicit throughout Michael Brendan Dougherty's lovely little book, "My Father Left Me Ireland," about his complex relationship with his father and his father's country. Dougherty was raised by an Irish-American single mother, the son of a far-off Irish father whom he barely saw, and the hole left by paternal absence was filled - through his mother's efforts, then his own - by the attempt to claim an inheritance of Irish culture and language and tradition.
Much of that inheritance is now regarded skeptically in Ireland itself, which in the flush of prosperity has embraced a more technocratic, end-of-history vision of itself - one that regards the old sentimental nationalism with suspicion or embarrassment, the old Catholic religion with anger or contempt. This transformation is the work of Dougherty's father's generation, and the American son frames his book as a series of letters to his father, carrying on a meditative argument for the importance of inheritance, of a healthy nationalism as a "spiritual ecology" that links "the living, the unborn and the dead."
The complication at the heart of this argument, of which Dougherty is well aware, is that he did not really inherit the tradition in this way; he and his mother were reinventors, by necessity, of the Irishness he now seeks to pass down to his children. But something similar was true of the Irish nationalists who fascinate him, the intellectuals and poets associated with the 1916 Easter Rising, who strove not only to free their country politically but also to revive its language and impose a specifically Irish vision on its culture.
Were those men really responding, as the most mystical of them insisted, to the demands of Ireland's Gaelic-speaking ghosts? Or were they pilfering the past for usable relics, to invent a tradition that had not heretofore existed?
The answer to both questions could be yes. And that tension and complexity makes Dougherty's book important - as a testimony, rather than a mere argument, about what's lacking in late cosmopolitanism, and how a creative traditionalism might occupy the void that darker impulses are currently rushing in to fill.
But it also left me feeling a curious kind of envy for its author - not for his childhood fatherlessness, but for his potent personal connection to a tradition that even in its weakness, its abandonment by many modern Irish, still seems like a potentially coherent national narrative, an integrated thing.
I have some Irish blood and I like the same ballads as Dougherty, but my lineage and loyalties are more purely American, and what a similar creative traditionalism would mean for Americans seems to me about as clear as mud.
Of course we Americans have reinvented our traditions repeatedly over the years - going from a Protestant religious consensus to a "Judeo-Christian" one, from an Anglo-Saxon settler nation to a 20th-century melting pot.
But since the crackups of the 1960s, and especially lately, we have felt as divided over our national story as the factions of Dreyfus-Affair-era France - with polarized narratives of Who We Are that don't seem reconcilable, with partisan identities overriding communal ties, and without a common understanding of Americanness that doesn't just seem like a thin proceduralism, or the self-serving claims of the white man's past.
Like Dougherty I have young children, and I want to give them a story of America that coheres as an inheritance. But I'm not sure what that means, exactly, if I'm raising them Catholic in an increasingly post-Protestant or even pantheist America. Or if I want them to honor old ancestors whose commitments our culture now repudiates. Or if I want them to be conservative, in some sense, without being trapped by nostalgia or tempted by the darker side of nationalism. Or if I want them to see their country's sins clearly - as the left often sees more clearly than the right - without falling prey to the progressive tendency to remember the past only in order to hold it in contempt.
Some of the creative reinvention involved in answering these questions is every father's task. But it is also a common task, at which our society is failing. And our collapsing birthrate, our increasing failure to even have children to inherit, feels almost like a judgment on our inability to figure out, in common, what it is that we should wish to have passed down.

House Democrats fear Attorney General Barr

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats are threatening to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for not releasing the full Mueller report and for declining to appear in front of House Judiciary Committee. Barr has declined to appear as House Democrats want staff, instead of members of Congress, to question Barr. Only twice in history has a cabinet member been questioned by staff (Watergate and Iran Contra), so naturally Barr declined the invitation, resulting in Democrats threatening to hold him in contempt.
Barr has stellar reputation, and this is his second tour of duty as AG. He served from 1991 to 1993 after being confirmed by a unanimous vote, when then-Senator Joe Biden called him a "heck of an honorable guy."
So what changed? The starting point is Barr's testimony on April 10 that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign and that he is looking into it. In addition to that, there are several events that are scheduled to occur over this summer that are causing House Democrats concern resulting in this diversionary tactic. Here is a list of those events:
FBI involvement in Trump campaign: Last week, The New York Times reported that FBI sent an investigator posing as an assistant to meet with a Trump aide in September 2016 under the pretext "to discuss foreign policy issues." This raises serious questions on an administration from one party spying on a presidential campaign of another party. More importantly, how far up the chain did the approval for this investigation happen?
Leak investigations: During Congressional testimony on May 1, Barr said that there are multiple criminal leak investigations underway. If government officials leaked classified information, that would be a felony punishable up to 10 years. The list of leakers may include high-profile current and former government officials.
Inspector General investigation: Michael Horowitz, the highly respected IG, has been investigating if the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain warrants to investigate the Trump campaign. As James Comey admitted to Congress, FISA court operates on an honor system. In other words, the FISC typically approves FBI's request by rubber-stamping it. If it is proven that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the Steele dossier, which was then used to obtain warrants to spy on the Trump campaign without further corroboration, that could prove to be abuse of power. This investigation, which started in March 2018, is expected to be completed some time in May or June.
Declassification of Russia probe documents: The president held off on releasing these documents to avoid appearance of interfering with the Mueller investigation. With Mueller investigation now completed, there is nothing holding the administration back from releasing these documents. These documents, once released, will shed light on the extent of the FBI spying of the Trump campaign.
One final point: House Democrats want all documents from the Mueller report even though only 7.25 percent of this report is redacted (source: Vox). These redactions were approved by Mueller's team. In addition to the publicly available Mueller report, Barr has provided 12 senior members of Congress, six Democrats and six Republicans, with a less-redacted version (2 percent redacted, with only the redactions required by law). At last check, no Democrat has taken the time to read this less-redacted version (source: Politico). If the real issue is the report, then why is it that none of the Democrats have bothered to read the less-redacted version?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr tapped Connecticut's chief federal prosecutor, John Durham, to assist in an investigation into the origins of the Russia inquiry and the FBI's surveillance activities, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.
Durham, a Mob-busting federal prosecutor for more than three decades, has assisted the attorney general for several weeks to determine whether federal investigators acted appropriately in the early stages of the now-completed inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
Barr announced he had launched the review last month in an appearance before a Senate subcommittee. He expressed concern about the FBI's surveillance of associates of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign as authorities sought to understand Russia's interference efforts. Barr said he did not know whether officials had done anything wrong.
"Spying on a campaign is a big deal," Barr told lawmakers. "I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated."
The attorney general said he planned to examine the "genesis and the conduct" of the FBI's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. "I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred," he told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee. "I am concerned about it. There is a basis for my concern."
Durham has led several high-profile special investigations, including an examination of the FBI's handling of criminal informants in Boston during the Clinton administration, which led to the prosecution of former agent John Connolly. He led an inquiry during the George W. Bush administration into the CIA's destruction of videotapes depicting the torture of terror detainees.
"It's inconceivable to me that the appointment of someone with John Durham's record would be considered unless the use of a grand jury was contemplated," said former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who chose Durham for the CIA review.
President Trump enthusiastically endorsed Barr's action. "I am so proud of our attorney general that he is looking into it," he said Tuesday.
Democrats have seized on Barr's use of the term "spying," asserting that the attorney general sided with Trump to disparage the 22-month-long investigation, which the president repeatedly described as a "witch hunt."
Last week, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was unaware of any evidence indicating the FBI abused its authority, distancing himself from the attorney general. "That's not the term I would use," Wray told the same Senate panel, referring to the "spying" reference.
Rod Rosenstein, until recently the Justice Department's second-in-command, said in a speech Monday that based on what he knew in 2017, "the investigation of Russian election interference was justified, and closing it was not an option."
The review involving the attorney general and Durham marks the third such inquiry into aspects of the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. It was first reported late Monday by The New York Times.
The Justice Department's inspector general is reviewing surveillance warrants authorities used to eavesdrop on a former campaign aide, Carter Page, in October 2016. Barr said that effort should be completed by late May or June. The chief federal prosecutor in Utah, John Huber, is in the midst of a separate review.
Trump and Republicans in Congress have complained that the FBI targeted the president's campaign for political reasons, revealing text messages between two senior officials involved in the inquiry who expressed their personal contempt for Trump. Critics focused on the FBI's reliance on information from a former British spy who had been hired indirectly by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign to conduct research on Trump before the election.

Texto completo: Every time I see the latest economic news, I thank Hillary Clinton.
Every time I see those high GDP numbers (up 3.2 percent last quarter), I thank Hillary.
Every time I see those record low unemployment numbers for blacks, Latinos and women, I thank Hillary.
If she hadn't been such a horrible candidate in 2016, there's no telling what sorry state America would be in right now.
So thank you, Hillary, for being such a loser. You did your country a greater service than you'll ever know.
I don't really blame Hillary too much for refusing to accept her embarrassing defeat and deciding to spend the rest of her public life posing as a professional victim of a conspiracy that never happened. In the pretend world where she lives, the Trump-hating Democrats running the House of Representatives and the Trump-hating Democrats running the mainstream liberal media want to re-investigate the Russian collusion delusion from scratch.
They're still deluding themselves about bringing down Trump and they know it. They know that even if the House impeaches Trump, the Senate won't impeach him in a million years.
In other words, the Democrats know their multiple hearings are nothing but partisan TV stunts designed to constantly smear Trump and his family and discredit Attorney General William Barr before he digs up the dirt about the FBI's rogue spying operation on the 2016 Trump campaign.
The good thing is, you don't have to bother watching the House's hearings live or pay attention to how the committees vote. Everyone already knows exactly what the final scores are going to be — straight party-line votes in favor of the majority Democrats' efforts to impeach, probe or immediately hang the president.
Meanwhile, the liberal media never get around to asking the Democrats in the House why they aren't busy writing new legislation to reform health care or fund infrastructure repair.
Come on, Nancy. It's time to send your new legislation over to the Senate so it can be sent over to be signed by the President. Where is it?
While the liberal media keeps busy finding new ways to hate Trump, a hundred Democratic presidential wannabes who hope to go on their party's suicide mission in 2020 are wandering around Iowa, hating on Trump, doing bad impersonations of socialists and making wilder and wilder promises they can't keep.
"Medicare for all," free college for all, "free" federal money for all deposited in a bank account every year just for being born a future Democrat. Wouldn't it be nice if a journalist at CNN, MSNBC, CBS or the New York Times seriously challenged one of these irresponsible promise-makers?
Instead of the usual softball question, what if Wolf Blitzer threw a surprise fastball at the head of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren? What if he asked them something complicated like, "What do you think about passing legislation to end the monopoly protections given in each state to healthcare companies and allowing the companies to sell insurance across state lines?"
"I think it's called 'competition,'" Wolf could say. "It allows consumers to shop around for the best deal for themselves and their families. It's worked pretty well with cars, TVs and vegetables. Do you think it might work with health care?"
Don't worry. No one in the mainstream media will ever dare to ask that kind of question to a Democrat. They're only asked questions that can be answered with "I really really hate Trump."
Let's face it, we're going to have this kind of anti-Trump insanity in America for the next 18 months. The deranged mainstream media — electronic and what's left of print — is never going to go back to presenting what we used to call "the news."

Texto completo: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., may not be pumping the brakes very hard on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse after all.
Addressing reporters Tuesday morning, Graham, the committee chairman, said he would "back off" the investigation after learning Attorney General William Barr had tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham from Connecticut with examining the origins of the federal Russia investigation.
"You've now got a prosecutor. I don't want to get in their way, I don't want to mess up his criminal investigation, and I don't want to put people at risk, so I'm going to back off," he said.
But a source told the New York Times that Durham is only conducting a review and not a criminal inquiry. Informed about the difference, Graham acknowledged it altered his stance.
“That is completely different," he told the Times, adding that he would likely now wait for a FISA abuse investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, which is expected to wrap up in late May or June.
“If there is not a criminal investigation, then oversight will be different," he said.

Texto completo: President Trump on Tuesday denied that he instructed Attorney General William Barr to assign a federal prosecutor to examine the origins of the federal Russia investigation.
“No, I didn’t ask him to do it. I didn’t know it,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “I didn't know it, but I think it's a great thing that he did it. I saw it last night, and they want to look at how that whole hoax got started. It was a hoax. I am so proud of our attorney general that he is looking into it. I think it's great. I did not know about it, no.”

The New York Times reported Monday evening that U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut was tapped to head an investigation examining the genesis of the Russia investigation. There are two other known federal investigation dedicated to uncovering details of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.
Barr has raised doubts about whether the Justice Department behaved appropriately during the federal Russia investigation and has said he believes “spying did occur.” However, he said he needed to look into whether the spying was “adequately predicated.”
Trump has urged to “investigate the investigators” after special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation wrapped up. The report concluded that members of the Trump campaign did not collude with the Kremlin in a criminal manner, but it made no determination on obstruction of justice.
Barr has since said that there is not sufficient evidence to prove that Trump committed an obstruction crime, but Democrats in Congress want to investigate further.

Russian President Vladimir Putin calls special counsel Mueller's inquiry 'very objective'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Russian President Vladimir Putin called Robert Mueller's investigation "very objective" Tuesday and said he hoped the special counsel's final report would allow the United States and Russia to reboot their diplomatic relationship, which has been strained by the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 election and questions about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
"However exotic the work of special counsel Mueller was, I have to say that on the whole, he has had a very objective investigation, and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between Russia and the incumbent administration, which we said was absolutely fake," Putin said before a closed-door meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Sochi on Tuesday.
Putin said he believes President Donald Trump "intends to rebuild U. S. -Russian relations," and he hopes "right now the conducive environment is being built for that. "
Pompeo pressed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in an earlier private meeting Tuesday, to prove that Russian meddling in U. S. elections had stopped.
Pompeo said Trump shares the desire to "change the trajectory" of America's fraught relationship with Russia, but it could further deteriorate if Putin's government continues its efforts to undermine American democracy.
The back-and-forth about Russian election interference came during a high-stakes visit by Pompeo to Sochi, a Russian beach resort on the Black Sea, where Pompeo and Lavrov met for a wide-ranging discussion that touched on tensions over Iran, Venezuela and nuclear arms control. Pompeo then met with Putin for nearly two hours.
"We talked about nearly every issue facing our two countries, all the challenges and all the opportunities between us as well," Pompeo told reporters afterwards.
During a joint news conference with Pompeo, Lavrov raised Mueller's investigation unprompted, and said Russian officials hoped the release of the special counsel's report would close an acrimonious chapter in U. S. -Russian relations.
"We hope this tumultuous situation will die down and we can finally move on to building more professional, constructive dialogue between Russia and the U. S. ," the Russian diplomat said.
Pompeo said he pressed Lavrov on Russia's interference in the 2016 U. S. presidential election and "conveyed that there are things Russia can do to demonstrate that these types of activities are a thing of the past. "
Pompeo did not elaborate on what steps Russia could take, but he said if the Kremlin interferes in the 2020 election, "it would put our relationship in an even worse place than it’s been. "
The two men said they had a "frank" discussion about a range of other geopolitical flashpoints:
Iran
Kremlin officials have expressed frustration with the Trump administration's increasingly aggressive rhetoric about the threat Iran poses – and a possible U. S. military response. The Trump administration has made isolating Iran economically and politically the cornerstone of its foreign policy.
Pompeo warned that Iran or its proxies in the region planned attacks on U. S. interests in the region, and the Pentagon dispatched an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf to counter the alleged threats.
Pompeo declined to comment on a New York Times story published Tuesday, which said acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented a military plan to send as many as 120,000 U. S. troops to the Middle East in the event of an Iranian strike on U. S. forces or a move by Iran to speed up its development of nuclear weapons.
"We fundamentally do not see a war with Iran," Pompeo said. He said the United States wants Iran to stop funding terrorist groups and to "behave like a normal country. "
Lavrov said he hoped the report was "just a rumor" and expressed fears that tensions could spark a military confrontation.
"This region is so tense with different conflicts and different situations," Lavrov said. He said he told Pompeo he hopes they can find a "political solution" to the Iran situation, so it does not "tip over to the military scenario. "
Iran says Trump playing 'very dangerous game,' risking 'devastating war'
Venezuela
In the power struggle between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, Russia supports Maduro, a socialist leader who helped steer the country into a severe economic crisis.
The Trump administration backs Guaido, who has made several unsuccessful attempts to oust Maduro from power. The United States has imposed a series of severe sanctions on Venezuela.
After Guaido called for an uprising this month, Pompeo said Maduro was about to flee the country but was convinced to stay by the Kremlin. Maduro and Russian officials denied that account.
Pompeo said Tuesday that the United States wants "every country that’s interfering in Venezuela to cease doing that. "
Lavrov shot back by suggesting U. S. meddling in Venezuela's internal affairs. "Democracy cannot be done by force," he said.
'We need to know why': Lawmakers wary as Trump aides weigh military options for Venezuela
Nuclear weapons treaty
Perhaps the most consequential item on the agenda is a landmark U. S. -Russian arms control treaty called New START. Some advocates and lawmakers fear the Trump administration will abandon the treaty and spark a new nuclear arms race.
Trump administration officials said they’re pushing to broaden the U. S. pact to include China, aiming to craft a deal that limits China’s strategic warheads and other weapons.
They argue that China's growing arsenal has changed the dynamics of arms control, and this new era requires a broader approach than the New START treaty offers.
"The president has charged his national security team to think more broadly about arms control to include countries beyond our traditional U. S. -Russia framework and a broader range of weapons systems," Pompeo said Tuesday.
Chinese officials said they have no interest in such a deal.
“China does not see any necessity and does not intend to join bilateral talks between Russia and the U. S on nuclear disarmament,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Monday during his own meeting with Russian officials in Sochi. “We keep our nuclear arsenal at a minimum level, the bare necessary level to maintain our defense. ”
Critics questioned the Trump administration’s quest for a trilateral agreement, saying it’s a risky gambit that could jeopardize the New START treaty, which limits the United States and Russia to no more than 1,550 deployed strategic warheads, among other restrictions. That agreement lapses in February 2021, and experts said negotiations need to begin immediately if the Trump administration wants to renew New START.
If New START is allowed to lapse, “there will be no legally binding limits on the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals for the first time in nearly five decades,” Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan nonproliferation group, wrote in an analysis of the nascent negotiations.
Kimball noted that the U. S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, when combined, comprise more than 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons. He expressed fears that the Trump administration’s position is a ruse to kill the New START treaty, not broaden it, by making unrealistic demands.
Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, is an ardent opponent of arms control agreements, Kimball wrote, suggesting “this new grand-deal gambit does not represent a serious attempt to halt and reverse a global arms race. "
“It is more likely that Trump and Bolton are scheming to walk away from New START by setting conditions they know to be too difficult to achieve,” he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — While on a campaign stop in Concord, N. H. , former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden told voters that Republicans would have 'an epiphany' after President Donald Trump left the White House and find common ground to work with Democrats.
The former Vice President has spoken fondly of his friends in the Republican party and has framed himself as a dealmaker in a potentially divided government.
"I read in the New York Times today that I --- that one of my problems is if I ever run for president, I like Republicans," Biden told the U. S. Conference of Mayors in January. "Bless me father for I have sinned. But…from where I come from I don't know how you get anything done. "
John McCain: Why Joe Biden will eulogize his longtime friend. 'If he needed my personal help, I’d go'
This approach has drawn fire from progressive elements of the Democratic Party that do not to work with Republicans. Ezra Levin, the Co-Executive Director of progressive activist group Indivisible, asked, "wasn't Biden in the Obama Administration or am I remembering that wrong?"

Texto completo: Playwrights and investigative journalists can have a lot in common. Lynn Nottage, for example, was embedded in Reading, Pa., before setting the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Sweat" there.
Stephen Belber's new play, "We Are Among Us," is a reflection on the United States' military involvement in Afghanistan that was inspired by a trip he took there and the research that followed.
The Tony- and Emmy-nominated actor, producer and writer ("Match" on Broadway and co-writer of the "The Laramie Project" teleplay) also has a journalistic eye toward truth, having worked at the United Nations' wire service right out of college.
"I love and quite envy the media - you are always there and engaged and sussing out the story," he said. "But I learned quickly that you can't embellish as a journalist . so no dramatic flourishes."
As a playwright, he figured out how to fuse ideas in his head with dramatic flourishes and real life.
"Real life is more interesting than my brain," he said.
In his latest play, Laura, a former military contractor and single mother, is confronted by a journalist with accusations of a cover-up during her time in Afghanistan.
Belber describes "We Are Among Us" as "very cerebral in an old-school way." The play has been in development for nearly four years, with "The Sopranos'" Edie Falco doing an early reading. The focus has evolved to Laura (Lisa Velten Smith) and Afghan immigrant Khadija (Nilanjana Bose), whose lives become entangled when reporter Shar (Jo Mei) calls into question what happened to Khadija's father while in U.S. military custody.
Adrienne Campbell-Holt directs.
"Having a female perspective was vital for me in this play, which really is a woman's story," Belber said, noting that it he previously had worked on it with Doug Hughes.
"Doug and I were working on what was more of a mother-son story. The relationship between Khadija and Laura has come more to the forefront as it developed."
Belber was determined to write about the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and America's involvement when he spent 10 days there in 2013.
His own adventures will make for an interesting memoir - or perhaps a play - someday.
"I tend to go wherever my documentary friends let me hold their boom mic," he explained of his trip with David Holbrooke - son of Richard Holbrooke, an adviser on Pakistan and Afghanistan for President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The documentary "The Diplomat" was released in 2015.
"I spent 10 days in the country, in 2013, as we were kind of pulling out and the Taliban was making another surge for Kabul," Belber recalled. "It was dicey and weird enough that it was very invigorating."
He took a particular interest in the crew's Afghan "interpreter-fixer," who had worked with the American military and journalists as a cultural consultant and was trying to get a special visa to the U.S.
"He had been flagged in the system because once, helping a reporter from The New York Times, he answered a phone call from a Taliban officer claiming responsibility for a bombing," Belber said.
He eventually made it to Inglewood, Calif., where he and Belber renewed their friendship.
"I learned what it was like for him to come here," Belber said. "It made me think about his world a lot and what it was like to have one foot in two cultures."
In striving for accuracy, City Theatre brought in consultant Noorulhaq Fazly, of Herat, Afghanistan, who has worked with the U.S. focusing on human rights and moved here with his family in 2016. The South Side theater's City Connects' partner Literacy Pittsburgh helped find Fazly through the local branch of No One Left Behind, which helps Afghan and Iraqi combat allies re-settle safely in the U.S.
Belber has appreciated Fazly calling him out "on any shortcuts" he took, which usually fall into "that weird balance of getting it right and dramatic impulses" - although he added, "Nothing I've been writing here is particularly implausible."
On thing he has discovered to be true is that theatrical flourishes aren't always necessary, because in real life, "crazy [expletive] happens all the time."

Worzalla pulls out all stops for Jeff Kinney's latest book

Texto completo: STEVENS POINT – What does it take to print a best-selling book on a tight deadline?
If you ask employees of Worzalla Publishing Co. in Stevens Point, they can tell you — 1,934,100 pounds of paper, 456,314 pounds of ink and 7,166 employee hours. The result: author Jeff Kinney's latest book, "Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal," which was released April 9.
Kinney is best known for his "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series, which follows main character Greg Heffley on his adventures as a middle-schooler. The new series focuses on Greg's best friend, Rowley Jefferson.
It has spent four weeks on the New York Times bestseller list for Children's Middle Grade Hardcover books and is currently at No. 1.
Worzalla is very familiar with Kinney and his books. The company has published every domestic copy of the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series since the first batch of 25,000 copies in 2007. Last year, Kinney made a special stop at the Stevens Point plant to celebrate the 200 millionth copy of the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series.
So, when Kinney branched out to launch his new series, his production team turned to Worzalla.
The task was a daunting one, employees said. They print large orders all the time, but they only had four weeks to finish a project that normally would take six weeks.
So, just how big was the order?
If you laid out all of the books' 41,654,551 pages end to end, you would cover the distance from Stevens Point all the way to Manila, Philippines.
Kathy Ladwig and April Kemnitz were part of the customer service team that led the project at Worzalla. Last October, Amulet Books — part of ABRAMS, the series' publishing company — reached out to Worzalla, exploring the idea of working together on the new series, Ladwig said. The Worzalla team was given a fake project name, too, as details including the title were still top secret.
By January, the team learned the order would be twice as big as originally planned. In February, they learned they would print fewer paperback copies and more hardcover books. The publishing company even pushed back installation of new equipment, so they could focus on the Kinney project.
While the size of the project was not unusual, the quick turnaround time was, said Richard Letchinger, Worzalla's vice president of sales and marketing.
Worzalla printed almost constantly for a solid four weeks, met their goal, and even finished two days before their final deadline, Kemnitz said. And then they celebrated.
"Every time we're done with a Wimpy Kid job, we have a big pizza party for the whole plant," Kemnitz said.
This was Worzalla's fastest turnaround time for such a large volume with critical deadlines, said Jim Fetherson, Worzalla's president and CEO.
"Worzalla is so proud of all the men and women who worked long hours and gave up their weekends to finish this huge project," Fetherson said. "We are thrilled that our team exceeded expectations."

Cory Booker's tech startup failed but industry ties lasted

Texto completo: Cory Booker was the mayor of New Jersey's largest city and considering a run for higher office, but he had a different goal in mind when he appeared on stage at the 2012 Tech Disrupt Conference in San Francisco.
Booker was there to promote Waywire, the social media company that he had recently co-founded. He believed the video-sharing network could change the way millennials consumed news and participated in politics — a prospect that positioned Booker as a tech-savvy political leader of the next generation and stood to earn him millions.
Waywire aimed to improve on YouTube by making it easier to create, share and discover videos based on one's interests. Booker told the audience that the videos would elevate the voices of everyday Americans and their challenges, helping address everything from discrimination to joblessness. "We can change America at a far more rapid pace than it's being changed right now," he said.
Booker's grand ambitions for Waywire crashed. The company fizzled out in the way that many digital startups have over the years. Booker kept his focus on politics, winning two elections to the Senate and earlier this year launching a bid to be president.
But his one-time aspiration to be a revolutionary tech mogul is a revealing window into his close association to the industry, his optimism about the power of technology and his willingness to mix public service with a for-profit business. At the time his involvement raised questions about whether he was potentially beholden to influential Silicon Valley leaders, who invested in the startup.
At campaign stops, Booker does not bring up Waywire. But the company could resurface as a political liability at a time when many Americans — including Booker and his Democratic rivals — are calling for tougher regulations on tech companies.
Booker declined an interview request, but campaign spokeswoman Sabrina Singh defended his decision to start Waywire while leading Newark, a city of 285,000 people.
"Cory is passionate about bringing people together, and when presented with the opportunity to be a part of a new, forward-thinking and socially-conscious online video network, he jumped at the chance," she said.
Booker has taken a harder line toward the technology industry since Donald Trump's election. Just last month, he wrote on Twitter that tech platforms "are becoming engines for discrimination, harassment, misinformation and extremism while stifling innovation."
In an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's "This Week," Booker declined to endorse Sen. Elizabeth Warren's call to break up Facebook. But he said the Justice Department should study consolidation in the tech industry and others and more aggressively enforce antitrust laws.
At the 2012 tech conference, Booker called Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg "an American hero," praising his entrepreneurship and philanthropy. Booker had persuaded Zuckerberg to donate $100 million to help improve Newark's public schools.
Money from tech executives and employees has also helped fuel his political career. Former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, who were among the early investors in Waywire, earlier this year gave $2,800 apiece to his presidential campaign, the maximum allowed.
Booker raised more than $447,000 from the internet industry for his Senate campaigns and his political action committee from 2013 through 2018, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Supporters say his knowledge of the industry gives him valuable insight, noting that he pioneered the use of Twitter to communicate with constituents. They say he believes in the power of technology to be a force for social good, calling Waywire an earnest effort to improve political dialogue among young people.
"I think this indicates that he's a curious, and open and responsible person who doesn't use his authority or his influence for himself but to find more policies to help people," said Philip Stephenson, who was one of Waywire's first employees in 2012.
Stephenson said the day-to-day operations of the company, which was run out of a Manhattan office by Booker's founding partners Sarah Ross and Nathan Richardson, was plagued by uncertainty about its direction. He and other journalists were let go after a few months as the company struggled. Booker severed ties with it after a media firestorm surrounding his role, which became a bump on his path to the U.S. Senate.
Waywire aimed to capitalize on Booker's popularity on Twitter, where he had amassed more than 1 million followers and communicated about storms and potholes with residents. Booker used his connections to help raise $1.75 million to start Waywire, which included investments from Schmidt's Innovation Partners, Hoffman and LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga's manager.
The company was entwined with Booker's political brand from the start. The company posted videos that put Booker in a flattering light: delivering a commencement speech at his alma mater, Stanford; campaigning for President Barack Obama's re-election in 2012; and answering questions such as, "How do you feel about your superhero status?"
He urged his constituents and supporters to send him "wires," the homemade videos that he hoped would make the company compelling. A digital strategist who worked for him in Newark — and later in the U.S. Senate — joined the company.
Even as he was promoting Waywire publicly, Booker minimized his ties to it on the initial Senate financial disclosure form he filed as a candidate in 2013 running in a special election to replace the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg. He listed himself as a co-founder but didn't list his ownership as an asset.
Two months later, in July 2013, he amended his disclosure to list his Waywire stake as worth between $1 million and $5 million and to add his role as a board member. He said those details had been inadvertently omitted.
His rivals in the Democratic primary criticized Booker after his role in the company was the subject of a front-page New York Times article days before the election. They questioned whether he was seeking to profit at Newark's expense and was compromised by his tech associations. Tabloids pounced on a particularly juicy detail: that a Waywire advisory board included the teenage son of CNN President Jeff Zucker, who had been given a stock option for his role. The boy, 15, resigned.
Booker won the primary and shortly before the general election, announced that he had given his ownership stake to charity. A campaign spokesman said the donation wasn't itemized in his tax returns but that it went to the New Jersey Community Foundation. Foundation President Hans Dekker said he could not confirm the gift under its privacy policy but that Booker "has been wonderfully philanthropic not only to our foundation, but also to Newark in general."
Waywire was sold in 2013 for an unspecified sum to online video distributor Magnify Media, which took the brand in a different direction. Waywire's remaining assets were sold again, in 2017, to a company controlled by a Ukrainian entrepreneur and is no longer operating.
Steve Rosenbaum, of Magnify Media, said Booker's vision for Waywire was solid and remains relevant today. But he said Booker's role with the company was not sustainable once he started campaigning for Senate, which happened earlier than he expected following Lautenberg's death.
"All of a sudden, it was pretty clear that he just didn't have the bandwidth nor was it the right thing for him to be running for U.S. Senate and also running a startup," he said.

IT'S TIME TO STAND UP TO GUNS WE CAN HONOR THE FALLEN HEROES BY TAKING ON GUN VIOLENCE

Texto completo: Politicians fearful of the National Rifle Association have allowed the gun lobby to run amok so that America now has more guns than people, but there is still true heroism out there in the face of gun violence: students who rush shooters at the risk of their own lives.
Let's celebrate, and mourn, a student named Kendrick Castillo, 18, just days away from graduating in Highlands Ranch, Colo., who last Tuesday helped save his classmates in English literature class from a gunman.
"Kendrick lunged at him, and he shot Kendrick, giving all of us enough time to get underneath our desks, to get ourselves safe, and to run across the room to escape," Nui Giasolli, a student in the classroom, told the "Today" show. Kendrick was killed, and eight other students were injured.
At least three boys in the class - one of them Brendan Bialy, who hopes to become a Marine - tackled and disarmed the gunman. "They were very heroic," Nui said. Bravo as well to the police officers who arrived within two minutes of the shooting and seized the two attackers.
The courage of those students in Colorado echoes last week's bravery of Riley Howell, a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Riley, 21, charged a gunman there and continued even as he was shot twice. As he tackled the gunman he was shot a third time, in the head, and killed, but he ended the shooting.
Riley was deservedly given a hero's funeral, and presumably the same will happen with Kendrick. But their parents didn't want martyrs; they wanted children and grandchildren. And it is appalling that we as a society have abandoned American kids so that they must die to save their classmates.
When New Zealand experienced a mass shooting in March, it took the government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern just 26 days to tighten gun laws and ban assault rifles. In contrast, America has had 53 years of inaction since the University of Texas tower shooting in 1966 claimed 17 lives. Sandy Hook . Las Vegas . Parkland - so many dead; so little done.
Since 1970, 1.45 million Americans have died from guns - suicides, murders and accidents. That's more than the 1.4 million Americans estimated to have died in all the wars in American history going back to the American Revolution.
This should also make us all cringe: In a typical year, more American children ages 4 and younger die from firearms (110 in 2016) than police officers do in the line of duty (65 in 2016).
So let's send thoughts and prayers to the families of victims in Colorado and North Carolina, but let's also push for a sensible gun policy that would make such heroics less necessary.
Granted, this is complicated. America has so many guns out there that new restrictions may not be as effective as we would hope. The 10-year ban on assault rifles from 1994 to 2004 had trouble defining assault weapons and had an uncertain impact.
Still, there are obvious steps worth taking. A starting point would be to require universal background checks before all firearms sales. Some 22 percent of guns are still acquired in the U.S. without a background check; a person wanting to adopt a rescue dog often undergoes a more thorough check than a person buying an assault rifle.
Safe storage of guns - in gun safes or with trigger locks - prevents children and others from accessing firearms. Voluntary gun buybacks would reduce the pool of firearms out there. We should also invest in "smart gun" technologies that require a code or fingerprint to fire. We need more "red-flag laws" that make it more difficult for people to obtain guns when they present a threat to themselves or others.
And tell me: Why do we bar people on the terrorism watch list from boarding planes while still allowing them to purchase guns?
Every day in 2017, the last year for which we have figures, an average of 107 people died in America from guns. We're not able to avert every shooting, but we can save some lives. We need not have the courage of the students who charged gunmen; we just need to demand action from our members of Congress and state legislators.
That's the best way to honor heroes like Kendrick Castillo and Riley Howell, by making such heroics less necessary in classrooms around America.

Texto completo: Renaissance Voices, the 21-voice choir directed by Harold Stover, gives only two programs a year - one around the holidays, the other in the spring. But its programs always offer a combination of rarities and familiar works - with poetry readings interspersed - in such finely polished performances that you find yourself wishing they would perform more often.
Stover named this year's spring offering "New, Old and Unexpected," a title that could easily be applied to most of his presentations. Actually, it was a bit of sub-rosa nostalgia: Stover borrowed the name from an influential, widely-loved and stunningly eclectic daily radio show, produced and hosted by music critic Tim Page, who later won a Pulitzer for criticism, between the late 1970s and early 1990s, first at WKCR, Columbia University's station, then at WNYC, the public radio outlet in New York.
Naturally, the "unexpected" offerings on Stover's program held the greatest allure; who doesn't want to be surprised? The showpiece here was Ernst Toch's "Geographical Fugue," a work from the 1930s that is sufficiently quirky that, shortly after Toch fled Germany for the United States in 1935, two young avant-gardists - John Cage and Henry Cowell - obtained his permission to publish an English version.
The twist in "Geographical Fugue" is that it is spoken, more or less. There actually are pitches, which rise slightly as the speed of the performance increases. But you hardly notice them, because the much more crucial element is the rhythm of the text, which includes multi-syllabic, variously accented place names, such as Trinidad, Honolulu, Mississippi, Titicaca, Canada and MÃ¡laga. Once Toch arranges the stream of names in fugal form, with each section of the choir beginning the text at a different time, the rhythms become an interlocking swirl.
Also "unexpected," in terms of the choir's usual repertory, were a handful of Richard Rodgers songs - "Blue Moon," "This Nearly Was Mine," and "If I Loved You" - in sumptuous choral arrangements. All three were performed with an exquisitely suave sound, but the standout, and one of the concert's most memorable moments, was Jonny Priano's richly harmonized recasting of "Blue Moon."
The "old" offerings were Elizabethan madrigals, with bright-hued, cheerful examples by Thomas Tomkins, Thomas Greaves and John Farmer. Strictly speaking, these pieces would have been performed by smaller, more homespun groups, in their day. But if the sound Renaissance Voices produces is bigger and more carefully burnished than these composers would have been used to, that's hardly cause for complaint - except, perhaps, for antiquarian purists.
Tomkins' "Come shepherds, Sing With Me" and "To the Shady Woods Now Wend We," Greaves' "Come Away, Sweet Love" and Farmer's "Fair Nymphs, I Heard One Telling" are all energetic, wonderfully contrapuntal settings that flourish in the nuanced, modern readings Stover gave them.
In his introductory comments, Stover admitted that he stretched the definition of "new" to include 20th century works such as Hindemith's "Six Chansons on Poems by Rainer Maria Rilke" (1939). Prefaced by readings of the Rilke texts, both in French by Kirk Read, and English by Cevia Roso and Niki Norman, the choir's performance brought out both the warmth and occasionally dark turns in the music, and negotiated its chromaticism and full textures with impressive clarity.
There was one inarguably new piece, "Remember'd Songs, Most Dear," by Matthew Emery, a Canadian composer born in 1991. But Emery's style - in this piece, at least - is solidly conservative; if you hadn't noticed the date of his birth, you could have mistaken it for a 19th century work, and the choir sang it in that spirit. It was preceded by an amusing Ogden Nash poem, "Pretty Halcyon Days," in a spirited reading by Bernie Horowitz.
As an encore, Stover led the choir in a beautifully textured rendering of Leonard Marshall's "Sweet Spring Is Returning," an appealing rarity that he discovered in "The Harp of Praise," a choral collection published in Boston in 1875.

Texto completo: Welcome to Crossing the Border, a limited-run weekly newsletter from The New York Times.
Waiting at the Whataburger
By Mitchell Ferman in Hidalgo, Tex.
The Whataburger next to the bridge is where you wait.
Usually for a ride, sometimes for food -- after you've just crossed the border from Mexico. People wait outside, leaning against the building; they wait inside, thumbing through their phones. The popular fast-food joint next to the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge has become an informal border way station: A Grand Central without the grand.
Next door, thousands of cars, buses and people every day cross the quarter-mile span over the Rio Grande that connects the United States to Mexico.
Juda Castellanos, a Mexican-born American who lives in South Texas but works at an auto parts manufacturer across the border in Reynosa, Mexico, was sitting one night this week in a booth at the Whataburger, waiting for his wife to pick him up.
At the moment, he didn't know where she was. His phone had died, and he had to borrow a stranger's to send a text, and then another one.
As it turned out, his wife was already on her way; she pulled up presently in the minivan. The passenger door slid open.
"Ah, there's my son," Mr. Castellanos said.
Family dinner that night was fast-food salads and sandwiches.
Whataburgers are a dime a dozen in Texas, but in the South Texas city of Hidalgo, the clientele is unique. Almost everyone passing through has a foot in two countries.
Parents keep their children's birth certificates on the seat next to them in zip-lock bags. One man waited in the parking lot in his Chevrolet Camaro for his girlfriend, who lives in Reynosa. A woman waited for her boyfriend, whom she had met there at the Whataburger. Not long ago, someone walked in carrying a Donald Trump piñata, sold on the other side of the bridge.
"Some friends from high school I saw here waiting for a ride once -- I couldn't even remember the last time I saw them before that," said Mr. Castellanos, who grew up in Monterrey, Mexico, a large commercial city about 140 miles from Hidalgo.
The unmistakable orange-and-white exterior of the Whataburger makes it a natural meeting point, the easiest and most recognizable landmark within sight of the bridge.
Mr. Castellanos said he feels safer having his wife drop him off and pick him up there, rather than taking his car into Mexico. "The security situation in Reynosa is not great," he said.
Before violence surged in Reynosa about 10 years ago, young people would convene at the Whataburger ahead of a night out across the border in Mexico, then return for a late-night burger at the end of the night.
Some use the fast food outlet as a place to pick up temporary work assignments or rendezvous with business contacts. Mario Vargas, a 37-year-old industrial engineer, was waiting recently in a corner booth in the hope that his sister-in-law would pick him up to do some work on her ranch. He'd been having problems with his regular employer, a construction contractor in Reynosa, and needed the extra work.
But he had been waiting for hours, parts of a No. 1 combo meal sitting uneaten next to his straw hat.
"She's supposed to call at 9," he said with a shrug.
Dozens of buses cross the Hidalgo bridge into Texas every day, and when traffic backs up at the border, people often bail from their bus, grab their belongings, walk through Customs and wait to get picked up.
"It was a three-hour wait," said Nancy Ramirez, a South Texas resident who had just taken a three-hour bus ride from the Mexican state of Nuevo León after a vacation in Mexico.
"I wasn't going to just sit there," she said.
So Ms. Ramirez made her way off the bus, phoned her daughter and walked into Texas. Then she settled into a booth at the Whataburger with her luggage and no appetite.

Quote of the week
Sometimes teachers can see you differently or judge you, so I don't tell many people that I go back and forth. Sometimes I miss out on a lot of things because I don't live over there. And I don't live over there because my parents can't live over there with me. They're not U.S. citizens.
-- Jocelyn Guzman
Ms. Guzman, 18, lives in Matamoros, Mexico, but crosses the border to attend high school in Brownsville, Tex. She was featured along with six other young women in a collection of essays about what it's like to come of age along the border.

The tricky language of border-speak
By Caitlin Dickerson, n ational immigration reporter
In all things, words matter, and the emotions they convey can be powerful. For evidence, look no further than the opposing sides in our national debate over immigration, which seem to draw from entirely separate dictionaries when they describe the situation at the border. One person's "refugee" is another one's "illegal immigrant." It's often a gut-based evaluation in which political views shape language and vice versa.
Some Americans look to the border and see huddled masses of desperate mothers and fathers fleeing with their children from violence and destitution. They see asylum seekers who should be offered not just protection, but also opportunity, by their more prosperous northern neighbor.
Others view the new arrivals as opportunistic and reckless because they have chosen to put vulnerable children at risk, bringing them on a dangerous, sometimes deadly journey in order to exploit the American legal system to get an unearned leg up in life.
Almost no one calls the newcomers "foreigners," though it would be an accurate and relatively dispassionate term to use.
For its part, the federal government takes a clinical approach to the discussion. Some people argue that doing so dehumanizes migrants, which can also tilt the debate. For example, in government parlance, the foreign-born are referred to as "aliens." Youth who migrate alone are called "unaccompanied alien children" or "unaccompanied minors." Anyone intercepted by the Border Patrol while crossing the Rio Grande into Texas is considered "wet," which, to many ears, sounds too much like a racist term for Mexican people. Even asylum seekers who look for Border Patrol agents and turn themselves in and ask for protection are counted in official data as "apprehended," suggesting, inaccurately, that they were caught trying to sneak into the United States.
Readers pay close attention to the words we use as journalists to describe these issues, and for good reason. A few choice terms can shift the entire tone of a story. Years ago, the complaint I heard most often was about whether to call immigrants living in the United States without legal status "illegal" or "undocumented" (I see problems with both and try to avoid them). But now the questions are evolving. Should the situation with large numbers of people overwhelming Border Patrol stations be called a "crisis," even if some of the chaos is self-imposed by the administration? Should rules intended to protect the welfare of children be called "loopholes" because they also make it easier for children to enter and remain in the United States?
Recently, a reader pointed out that this newsletter used the word "deployment" to describe a temporary assignment that sent two of my colleagues to live on the southern border for several months. While inside newsrooms, editors and reporters often use that word to describe story assignments of all kinds ("Caitlin, you're being deployed to help with coverage of the royal wedding,") the phrase itself doesn't typically appear in print, except in stories about a military response in a violent conflict. In this case, "deployment" may have conjured images of chaos and danger along the border that don't match up with reality, so we scrapped it. Likewise, President Trump's favorite way of describing the process of detaining and then freeing migrants captured at the border -- "catch and release," he calls it. Sounds like fishing, many people pointed out, and desperate migrants, whatever you call them, are not quarry. Our preference now is to avoid the phrase, unless referring to the way the administration describes it.
The challenge here is not that a few of the words that are used in the immigration debate are politically charged, but that the majority of them are. In light of that, one useful exercise might be to pause for a moment, wherever you stand in the debate, and switch out the terms you typically use for those of people who see things differently -- not as a way to make your views more like theirs, but to more fully understand the space between them.

Dozens die as migrant boat capsizes off the coast of Tunisia

Texto completo: Dozens of migrants drowned Friday after their boat capsized off the coast of Tunisia, a monitoring group reported, the latest disaster on a perilous but frequently used crossing in the Mediterranean.
At least 50 people were killed, according to the International Organization for Migration, the United Nations migration agency, and 16 people were rescued. Most of those who died were reportedly from sub-Saharan Africa.
The state-run Tunis Afrique Presse agency said at least 70 migrants drowned after the boat capsized near the Kerkennah Islands off Tunisia's eastern coast on Friday.
The boat left from Zuwara, Libya, and was headed toward Italy when it capsized about 40 miles from the coastal city of Sfax, the Tunisian Ministry of Defense said.
The movement of refugees and migrants from Northern Africa and the Middle East across the Mediterranean has dropped significantly from its peak in 2015, when more than 1 million people traveled the route, but it has remained deadly.
The International Organization for Migration called the latest migrant boat sinking the deadliest since January.
The crossing from Libya to Italy has grown increasingly treacherous. Charity vessels that carry out rescue operations and respond to distress calls are finding themselves unwelcome in many European ports, forcing many to stop operating.
The Italian navy officially began coordinating rescue missions in the central Mediterranean after a devastating shipwreck in 2013 near Lampedusa left hundreds dead, but the approach has shifted as migrant rescues have become highly politicized.
Italy's populist government has cracked down on immigration and says the charity ships that once partnered with navy vessels are aiding smugglers who shuttle migrants from Libya to Europe.
The journey from Libya has always been fraught with risk, and the country's policy of rounding up and detaining migrants and refugees has left them in an even more precarious position, given the country's poor human rights record and the continuing civil war that has reached the outskirts of the capital.

Texto completo: Happening at the end of this month, Fruita’s Mike the Headless Chicken Festival is but one odd celebration held every year here in Colorful Colorado. Add these to your calendar:
Packer Days — May 25, lakecity.com/calendar-of-events/packer-days
Lake City is one of the state’s scenic, hidden gems. If you’ve never been, or if you’ve never heard the story of the state’s most famous cannibal, then plan a trip for Memorial Day weekend.
That Saturday will mark the annual Mystery Meat Cook-off. $5 gets you a taste and guess of every dish. The Run for Your Life 5k is a backcountry survival test honoring the victims of Alferd Packer, who haunts these San Juan Mountains after his bloody exploits in 1874.
Madam Lou Bunch Day — June 15, go to Facebook event page
Happening one day and one day only, come one and come all to the 45th remembrance of this fair lady. OK, so “fair” isn’t a popular description for a brothel owner. She might have been notorious during Central City’s gold rush, but beloved Madam Bunch is today. She’s known for keeping her shop open longer than anyone else in town.
The main event? The race of elaborately decorated beds on wheels, pushed by teams of two men and one woman.
Lavender Festival — June 28-30, coloradolavender.org
When you think Palisade, you think peaches. You’ll think lavender if you visit this last weekend of June. Tour the wavy, fragrant fields of purple as part of this grand showcase, which also includes workshops and seminars. The area’s wineries also figure prominently, along with artisan goods.
Telluride Mushroom Festival — Aug. 14-18, tellurideinstitute.org/telluride-mushroom-festival/
Expand your fungal knowledge in this postcard mountain town. Once again, myco-luminaries from around the country will share the magic ways of shrooms, from their place in nature to the pan in your kitchen. Take a cooking class or foray in the hills. Or simply spectate as vibrant characters take to the streets before the famous feast.
Longs Peak Scottish-Irish Highland Festival — Sept. 6-8, scotfest.com
Kilts, bagpipes, jousting knights, dancing girls, racing terriers, strong men lifting stones and others throwing hammers. Expect all of that and more at a spectacle unlike anything in Colorado. For three decades, Estes Park has played host to the sights, sounds and tastes of Celtic culture.
Vinotok — Details TBD
This is a proudly local affair, but that hasn’t stopped Crested Butte’s official visitor source from posting details at travelcrestedbutte.com. Be on the lookout. And be prepared to blend in with a quirky costume of your own as residents eat, drink, sing, dance and tell stories as they ring in the autumnal equinox this Sept. 23.
The harvest culminates in the Trial of the Grump, a monstrous edifice set aflame with everyone’s past woes and worries.
Ullr Fest — TBD, gobreck.com/event/ullr-fest/
The Norse god Ullr is worshiped every January in Breckenridge with a great parade. Don your Viking helmet and take your place at the annual attempt to break the longest shot ski record. Also featuring a polar plunge and massive bonfire.
Frozen Dead Guy Days — TBD
It was best described by The New York Times not long ago: “the gleefully ghoulish late-winter bacchanal of ice and death and beer.” And it might have come to an end this past March. After 18 years, the festival’s owner has dropped out with no heir apparent.
But with this space we’re offering a toast. Here’s to you, Nederland, and all of your weirdness, including the frozen Norwegian man preserved in one of your sheds.

Success may turn on giving it your last 10% of effort

Texto completo: I was nearing the end of my 3-mile run (I'm no marathon candidate), and was feeling awful. Tired, hot, sore, and ready to throw in the towel. Looking at the fitness app on my phone, I realized that I only had 10% remaining.
As much as I wanted to quit, I forged ahead and completed the full run as planned. That moment of difficulty, angst and exhaustion at the 90% mark is a place where many of us stop in fitness, business and life.
This inflection point got me thinking ... how many of us do 90% of the work but give up just before we win the prize? Think of the lawyer who studied hard, made it through law school, landed the job at a great firm, did solid work for a client, but ultimately lost in court when success was only that last 10% away.
Or the sales executive who conquered B-school, mastered all the jargon, scored a prized gig at a great company, learned the product features, but then lost the big deal to a competitor when that last 10% could have changed the outcome in her favor.
I firmly believe that many of us are within that last 10% zone, but may not even know how close victory is. We've done the hard work to make it this far, but too often fall short in giving that last burst of energy to conquer our challenges or seize our opportunities.
Instead of producing "acceptable" work or stopping when you feel like you've given it enough, think of the fatigue as a signal to forge ahead. You've already done the vast majority of the sacrifice; endured the lion's share of the suffering. The point where you want to quit is a signpost telling you that you're awfully close to the target.
In boxing, the last stretch of a fight has a special name: the championship rounds. These last two rounds separate the history-makers from the also-rans. They provide a platform to dig deep and fight through adversity in order to earn the title of champ. Tackle your greatest victories by fighting through that last 10%, giving it everything you have until you finish strong.
Those who suffer through the last 10% of hardship are the ones who enjoy what only 10% of elite performs earn: success at the highest levels.
The last 10% is hard on purpose, encouraging those who deserve the victory to fight for it.
Seize your own championship by forging ahead at the very point where most other quit. The extra pain will only last a little longer, but the win will be permanent.

WHAT IF?

Texto completo: It wasn't the most reviled deal the Mets ever made - sending Tom Seaver to the Reds tops that list - but history showed that dealing Nolan Ryan to the Angels for Jim Fregosi couldn't have turned out worse for the New York team.
As Ryan, 72, prepares to return to Flushing for a reunion of the 1969 world champions the weekend of June 28, major league baseball's all-time strikeouts leader and Hall of Famer still wonders what might have been had he remained with the Mets.
"I would have liked to have had the opportunity to pitch an extended period of time with Tom,'' Ryan said in April from his home in Round Rock, Texas.
Ryan said it was Seaver's leadership that helped set him on the course to 324 wins, seven no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts over 27 seasons. The two righthanded legends totaled 635 major league victories
"I give Tom a lot of credit for having an impact on my career,'' Ryan said. "He was the first guy that I was around who was truly focused on his career and had goals and set out to achieve those goals. His work ethic and just being around and observing him had a very positive influence on me.''
Unfortunately for the Mets, they did not reap the benefits.
The 22-year-old Ryan went 6-3 with 92 strikeouts in 89⅓ innings during the 1969 season in which the Mets had a miraculous world championship run. Though he allowed only 53 walks, he often found himself working out of unfavorable counts.
He was, to say the least, a project for manager Gil Hodges.
"Nolan always had great stuff and when he was on was unbelievable,'' recalled teammate Jim McAndrew, 75. "When he had trouble finding the strike zone, it drove Gil crazy. Nolan made him an old man early.''
Ryan spent two more seasons on the Mets' staff, finishing his tenure with a 29-38 record, a 3.58 earned- run average, 493 strikeouts and 344 walks in 510 innings.
In 1971, he struck out 137 but walked 116 in 152 innings, a 1.18 strikeout-to-walks ratio. Ryan blamed his erratic control on missing time because of a military obligation.
"I was in a top-priority reserve unit, so I was going back to Houston every other weekend,'' he said. "Because of that, it didn't allow me to stay in the rotation and because of that, also I think the inconsistency of my schedule, contributed to my control problems."
In 1971, at 24, Ryan was sent to the Angels for Fregosi, a respected third baseman.
"We've had him three full years and although he's a hell of a prospect, he hasn't done if for us,'' Mets general manager Bob Scheffing told the New York Times after the deal. "How long can you wait? I don't rate him in the same category with Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman or Gary Gentry.'' Scheffing died in 1985.
Hodges, who died before the 1972 season, reportedly agreed with the trade. "He hadn't done it for us and the Angels wanted him,'' he told the Times in 1971. "I would not hesitate making a trade for somebody who might help us right now, and Fregosi is such a guy.''
Fregosi hit .233 in 1972 and part of 1973 before being traded to the Rangers. Fregosi, who later became Ryan's manager in Anaheim, died in 2014. Ryan blossomed almost immediately after the trade, becoming a 19-game winner with 329 strikeouts and a remarkable 2.28 ERA in 1972.
"I said he'd become a superstar,'' former Mets catcher Jerry Grote, 72, said from Belton, Texas. "One reason. The strike zone. He pitches upstairs. They won't give him that strike here. In the American League, he'll get it, guys will be chasing balls over their head.''
In all, Ryan led his league in strikeouts 11 times, his best being 383 in 1973, when he was 21-16 with a .287 ERA and finished second to Baltimore's Jim Palmer in the American League Cy Young Award voting. It was the closest he ever came to winning the coveted award.
That same year, Seaver won the National League Cy Young with a 19-10 record, 2.08 ERA and 251 strikeouts for the Mets, who reached the World Series but fell in seven games to the Oakland A's.
Imagine if the Mets had had both that season - or any season during both of their primes.
"That would have been a pretty strong 1-2 combination,'' Ryan said.
Consider this: In 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 against the Phillies, only to have Seaver surpass it four days later when he set a record with 19 against the Padres.
Ryan was a big factor in the 1969 National League Championship Series, throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3 against the Braves for his first playoff victory. He also saved Game 3 of the World Series, his only appearance in the Fall Classic.
The fact that Ryan won his only World Series ring with the Mets is something he never forgets.
"That very much means a lot to me,'' he said. "Anytime you win with an organization and a group of guys, that always has a special place in your heart.''
EPILOGUE
Seaver was traded - at his insistence - on June 15, 1977 to the Reds for Pat Zachry, Doug Flynn, Steve Henderson and Dan Norman in a deal that would have set the Twitter universe on fire if it happened today. But it still was monumental at that time. "When you pick up a newspaper and it says 'Midnight Massacre,' it kind of gives you an idea,'' Flynn, a banking executive in Louisville, Kentucky, said in 2017. "I can understand what was going through the minds of the fans. They were getting rid of The Franchise.
Seaver came back to the Mets in 1983 but was snapped up as a compensatory pick by the White Sox in 1984 when the Mets failed to protect him on the roster. Then-GM Frank Cashen said it was his mistake. "Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa,'' he was quoted. Seaver got his 300th victory on Aug. 5, 1985 at Yankee Stadium. His last appearance came for the Red Sox on Sept 19, 1986.
Ryan, a Texan at heart, signed a free-agent deal with the Astros in 1979, and the Rangers in 1988, finishing his career with that team in 1993. He pitched four no-hitters for the Angels, one for the Astros and two for the Rangers. Besides the strikeout record, he owns the MLB record for career walks with 2,795.
Seaver was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1992. His plaque was the first to bear a Mets cap.
Ryan was elected in 1999, a Rangers cap on his plaque.

Texto completo: HBO says goodbye to Selina Meyer. And "The Simpsons" closes out its third decade on TV.
What's on TV
VEEP 10:30 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. After seven seasons, Julia Louis-Dreyfus's term as Vice President (and then briefly, as President) Selina Meyer has come to an end. Many political dramas have crossed the TV landscape, from "West Wing" to "Homeland" to "Scandal," but this absurdist comedy can sometimes feel like the closest representation of our reality. We've watched Meyer and her team try to put out fire after fire, often concerned more with the optics of the office than the actual job. But despite her failures and shortcomings, Meyer has always been a woman who fights for exactly what she wants. And at the end of the series, we find her wanting the presidency, on her own terms.
OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT 8 p.m. on Showtime; Stream on Showtime platforms. As one satirical president departs, another returns. This animated show finds President Trump and his team of advisers in cartoon form, grappling with all kinds of White House chaos. In Season 2, viewers can expect to see Sarah Huckabee Sanders parachute out of an airplane and Rudy Giuliani use a spray bottle to hydrate his eyes on live TV. The ever-expanding number of Democrats who have decided to run for president, like Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, will be introduced. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also makes an appearance. In his review of the first season for The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote: "The Trump of 'Our Cartoon President' is a collection of animated-buffoon types. He's hapless but harmless. He whines about presidential duties like Fred Flintstone being asked to take out the saber-toothed cat."
THE SIMPSONS 8 p.m. on Fox. Ahead of the show's 30th season, which ends Sunday, Brian Tallerico wrote for The Times that Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie have "witnessed five American presidents, the dawn of the internet age, the end of the Cold War, at least two prolonged conflicts in the Middle East, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and more." And with each season, it's "reflected -- or failed to reflect -- the state of comedy, and of the culture, as a whole." In the finale, Marge uses healing crystals to help Bart with his Attention Deficit Disorder, and starts her own crystal empire after her method shows signs of success.
What's Streaming
[Video: Easy - Season 3 | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix Watch on YouTube.]
EASY Stream on Netflix. A robust cast that features Marc Maron, Dave Franco, Zazie Beetz, Sophia Bush and Jake Johnson shake up their love lives and question conventional relationships. Some of the stories are loosely connected to one another and they all take place in Chicago. "If 'Easy' doesn't work for you as drama, it's at least a touching love poem to a city," Mike Hale wrote in his review in The New York Times.

Texto completo: The Senate is a problem for Democrats.
Well, it's two problems.
The first is short term. The odds that the Democratic Party will win a Senate majority in 2020 are slim. To get to 50 seats -- which is enough only if they win the White House -- they need a net gain of three seats.
[Jamelle Bouie will answer your questions about his column on Twitter on Monday at 1 p.m. Eastern: @jbouie]
But while there are 22 Republicans up for re-election next year, only two of them are in Democratic-leaning states, and one of those incumbents -- Susan Collins of Maine -- is incredibly popular with her constituents. There are almost-swing states that Democrats could win, but the strongest candidates have either declined to run (Stacey Abrams of Georgia) or set their eyes on the presidency (Beto O'Rourke and Julián Castro of Texas). And there are states that Democrats hold, like Alabama, that will fall back to Republicans unless everything breaks in the incumbent's favor.
If, somehow, Democrats win a Senate majority and defeat President Trump, they'll have to make fundamental changes to the rules of the chamber -- like ending the filibuster -- if they want their agenda to move forward.
And if they can't win a majority, Mitch McConnell may cripple a Democratic presidency from the start, blocking judicial and executive branch nominations in an even more extreme replay of his blockade of President Barack Obama's final Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Without the Senate in hand, Democrats could win the immediate fight against Donald Trump in 2020 but lose the larger battle against the Republican Party that supported and enabled him.

The second problem is a set of long-term trends that will benefit the Republican Party as long as it maintains its hold on the least populated states and will burden the Democratic Party as long as it represents most of the densest, most diverse and fastest-growing major metropolitan areas in the country.
In 1790, the largest state was Virginia, with 747,610 people, and the smallest was Delaware, with 59,094 people. Because of the Senate's equal representation of states, Delawareans had more than 12 times the voting power of Virginians -- a large disparity, but not a yawning one. Today, the largest state is California, with nearly 40 million residents, and the smallest is Wyoming, with just under 600,000 people, a disparity that gives a person in Wyoming 67 times the voting power of one in California.
These population disparities will only get worse. By 2040, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, half the population will live in eight states, with eight other states representing the next 20 percent of the population. The remaining 34 states will hold 30 percent of the population. In the Senate, this would give them 68 seats. Over all, half the country's population would control 84 of the 100 seats in the chamber.
As it stands now, the Senate is highly undemocratic and strikingly unrepresentative, with an affluent membership composed mostly of white men, who are about 30 percent of the population but hold 71 of the seats. Under current demographic trends this will get worse, as whites become a plurality of all Americans but remain a majority in most states.
The Republican coalition of rural whites, exurban whites and anti-tax suburbanites may not be large enough to win the national popular vote in a head-to-head matchup with Democrats. But it covers a much larger part of the country's landmass, giving it a powerful advantage in the Senate. And while this coalition -- or its Democratic counterpart of liberal whites and the overwhelming majority of nonwhites -- isn't set in stone, it could be years, even decades, before we see meaningful change in the demographic contours of our partisan divides.
Politics is unpredictable and events matter, but it's also clear that Republicans are on the verge of a durable structural advantage in the Senate that will make Democratic majorities rare outside of the occasional "wave" election.
There are no immediate solutions to this problem. But progressives -- who have the most to lose if the Senate becomes an even larger obstacle to their preferred policies -- have started to brainstorm about reforms that might make the Senate more democratic and representative without changing the Constitution itself.
One path involves statehood. In his book "It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority," David Faris, a political scientist at Roosevelt University in Chicago, calls for at least eight new states. The first is Washington, D.C. The second is Puerto Rico, assuming its inhabitants agree to statehood. And the next six would be formed from America's superstate, California. "If the state were more or less evenly divided between left and right, its comparative lack of power in the federal government would be less of an issue," Faris writes. "But California is now one of a handful of the most left-leaning states in the entire union, and Californians' lack of voting power and Senate representation means that the country is pulled inexorably to the right."
It's a radical solution, and while it might work, it has one clear downside -- Republicans could respond in kind with similar schemes for conservative megastates like Texas and, to a lesser degree, Florida. And that's assuming California voters would sign on to the project. But finding ways to expand the Senate with new members is the right idea, and a recent report from the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, offers an approach that doesn't rely on extreme forms of constitutional hardball.
To accommodate the demographic trends of the next few decades, the institute calls for expanding the Senate to include other federal units besides states, for the sake of greater democracy and representation: "A modern Senate should reflect a modern federalism encompassing not only states and the federal government but also the district, territories and tribes."
Under the Roosevelt Institute proposal, Washington, D.C., the Atlantic territories, the Pacific territories and the Native tribes would each receive two senators and a voting member in the House of Representatives. Individual units could still pursue statehood, but the lack of that recognition wouldn't preclude representation in Congress.
The logic is straightforward. Native Americans have long been grossly underrepresented. And in addition to states, the United States has dominion over a number of other political units with little or no representation in Congress. Not only is this unfair in principle, but excluding those districts and territories also serves to exacerbate the Senate's problems with representation, since most of those areas are majority nonwhite.
Other democracies -- Australia, Brazil, France, Finland and Denmark, for example -- grant equal representation to federal districts and overseas territories. New Zealand, notes the Roosevelt Institute, "has had reserved seats for the Maori Indigenous population in its unicameral legislature since 1867."
What's more, it's far from the most radical change made to the Senate. That distinction would go to the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, which allowed direct election of senators. This move, which decoupled the interests of a state's senators from the state's legislature, was a fundamental change to the Senate, virtually obliterating the direct link the framers envisioned for the Senate and the states. If Congress "was willing to renege on a central purpose of one of its chambers," the Roosevelt report argues, "a mere expansion of the Senate's numbers for the purpose of representational equality is modest in comparison."
The Democratic Party's singular focus on Donald Trump makes sense: Beating him removes the most immediate threat to the nation's political health. But America's problems are also structural, and reform, whether short-term or long-run, depends on an active Senate that represents the entire United States. Given a Republican Party whose political interests lie in restricting the scope of our democracy, it's up to Democrats to act. They need to win the Senate so that they can fix the Senate.

Asian Americans keep winning in the Trump economy

Texto completo: May is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, which honors the remarkable accomplishments of Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage that have enriched our nation and helped shape our history. As the White House proclamation put it, “These Americans bolster our economy as entrepreneurs, business owners, and employees who initiate and expand opportunities for their families, communities, and country.”
Asian Americans represent the nation’s fastest-growing multicultural group, with a population projected to reach over 25 million by the end of this year. Culturally, Asian Americans exemplify the entrepreneurial mindset, with an ethos centered on self-reliance, innovation, and resilience. From 2007 to 2012, where a record number of businesses went under after the recession and the slowest ever recovery, Asian American-owned businesses grew by 24% and had the highest percent sales increase of any racial group, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Asian American-owned businesses are also wildly successful. In fact, Nielsen reports that “of the 87 U.S. start-up companies valued at over $1 billion, 19 were founded by Asian-Americans.”
After two years of a booming Trump economy, the Asian American community has much to celebrate. The overall economy enjoyed an astounding 3.2% GDP growth in the first quarter of 2019, and the Asian American unemployment rate, at an incredible 2.1%, has reached the lowest levels in the history of our country. Without question, President Trump’s deregulatory agenda and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act have been a boon for Asian Americans. In a thinly veiled attempt at race baiting, New York Times columnist Jim Tankersley unintentionally confirmed that Asian Americans were the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts in 2018. Funny how Tankersley's headline says that whites "gain the most," as if Asians, who actually gained a lot more than whites, according to the study he cited, are too insignificant even to count.
Overall, Asian taxpayers saw an average tax cut of $2,560, which means more money to invest in their small businesses and the economy as a whole. Access to capital continues to be an issue for many Asian American small-business owners, so the ability to keep more of their own money is a huge benefit. This is especially true for more recent Asian immigrants who simply do not have the required credit history to obtain credit lines or startup loans. For the most part, they are forced to rely on personal savings to start their businesses.
Fortunately, the tax-cut legislation contained another provision poised to help Asian American small business owners. The Opportunity Zones program encourages long-term investments in low-income urban and rural communities nationwide by deferring tax on capital gains invested in zones designated by state governments and approved by Treasury.
Opportunity Zones are a bipartisan exercise in cooperative federalism — the original legislation was co-sponsored by Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Cory Booker, D-N.J. As the Democratic mayor of Vicksburg, Miss., George Flaggs summed up while speaking at the White House, he’s “never seen any piece of legislation that allows more collaboration between federal, state, and local government” in 25 years in public office.
In counties with a concentration of Opportunity Zones, wages have risen by 8%, which is more than the national average. In addition, property values in Opportunity Zones have shot up by more than 20%. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin estimates that as much at $100 billion could be invested in Opportunity Zones. Opportunity Zones could be another big win for Asian American business owners. The influx of capital, increase in property values, and the potential tax savings all create a business climate that produces results.
As the Asian American Hotel Owners Association CEO, Chip Rogers wrote that tax cuts and Opportunity Zones are “creating the conditions for economic revitalization and prolonged growth.” With the 2020 presidential election looming, Asian Americans will be a key demographic in several swing states. For instance, in the battlegrounds of Virginia, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, the number of eligible Asian American voters will eclipse the 2016 margins between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Only time will tell if the economic gains and propensity for growth are enough to sway this key voting bloc in support of Trump.

Texto completo: NASHVILLE, Tenn. – The unexpected death of Christian author Rachel Held Evans on Saturday has led to an outpouring of support from those touched by her writings, with many saying she is the reason they kept their faith in God and the church.
In mid-April, Evans was hospitalized and put into a medically-induced coma when doctors found she was experiencing seizures while treating her for an infection.
On Saturday, her husband, Dan Evans, announced her death on her website and shock and grief overtook many at the news.
A GoFundMe campaign, launched to help cover medical expenses during her hospital stay, had a goal of $70,000. By Sunday morning, it had exceeded $179,000.
Rachel Held Evans was known for her progressive Christian voice. She was a speaker, writer and author of numerous best-selling books, including "Faith Unraveled," "A Year of Biblical Womanhood," "Searching for Sunday" and "Inspired."
Her writings resonated particularly with those struggling with their faith, traditional evangelicalism and the treatment of women and LGBT persons within the church.
"Yet instead of throwing out God or church, Rachel demonstrated a robust Christian faith outside the bounds of evangelicalism," Katelyn Beaty, author of "A Women's Place," wrote in a tribute column for the Religion News Service.
"She showed that that world's gatekeepers, its voracious 'discernment bloggers,' don't have the final say about one's standing before Christ."
Beaty wrote that Evans, in her "Searching for Sunday" book, traced her own personal journey through the Episcopal church.
"Along the way, she helped many readers stay tethered to faith when they wanted to bolt," Beaty wrote.
Indeed, after her death, the #BecauseofRHE hashtag began trending as people told their own stories about how Evans inspired them to keep their faith and remain active in their churches.
"When I was still struggling with my faith, this woman was one of the voices who made me feel like no one had the right to reject me," wrote one woman under the name Jamie Holderman. "She held space for me to feel loved."
The Rev. Emmy Kegler, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in Minneapolis and the founder of Queer Grace, an online resources guide around LGBTQ life and faith, told of how Evans inspired her.
"She taught me how to hold my faith upside down and shake it till grace fell out," Kegler wrote Sunday. "I'll do the same again today, not just for myself but for all in need. #BecauseOfRHE."
Others paid similar tributes.
But it wasn't just progressive Christians who felt touched by Evans, her writings and her life.
Most notably, Russell Moore, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, took to Twitter to urge people to support her family and donate to the GoFundMe campaign.
Evans "leaves behind a husband and two small children, one 3 and one less than one year old. As many as can, let's please help this grieving young family with the overwhelming medical bills," Moore wrote.
Moore regularly tangled with Evans online but said conservative Christians are better off because of her.
"I was on the other side of her Twitter indignation many times, but I respected her because she was never a phony," Moore told The New York Times. "Even in her dissent, she made all of us think, and helped those of us who are theological conservatives to be better because of the way she would challenge us."
Evans, 37, was from Dayton, Tennessee, and in addition to her writings, served on former President Barack Obama's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. She was a regular speaker across the nation.
Rachel Held Evans, author of "Evolving Growing up in Monkey Town," is pictured in front of the Rhea County (Tennessee) Courthouse, the site of the 1925 Scopes monkey trial, in 2010. Evans died May 4, after a brief illness.

Texto completo: When the Tony Award nominations were announced, Jeremy Pope was dancing with his mother. Here he tells about when he found out.
Jeremy Pope
The tireless Jeremy Pope has had a virtually unfathomable debut season on Broadway. He starred in Tarell Alvin McCraney's "Choir Boy" and, with no break and even some overlap in rehearsals, jumped immediately into the musical "Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations." And, as an emerging actor in his mid-20s, he has managed to receive Tony nominations for both shows: a nod for best leading actor in a play, and for best featured actor in a musical.
Q: Where were you when you found out?
A: My mom came to town, and we were like, We're just going to have breakfast and do our own thing. She's been wanting to learn the Beyoncé "Before I Let Go" challenge, so I began helping her with that as we were watching the countdown for the nominations. We were out of breath, and of course best actor is the first category. I cried, and we FaceTimed my dad. I have two group texts going on - with my "Choir Boy" family and "Ain't Too Proud." Everyone's going crazy.
Q: But what did your mother do?
A: She was shocked and crying with me! I think as a mother you have to do this thing where you have to be OK with whatever happens. And she led me in prayer. But I felt this release for her as well.
Q: The playwrights you worked with on these shows - Tarell Alvin McCraney and Dominique Morisseau - were also nominated. How does it feel to see these typically off-Broadway writers getting Tony recognition?
A: They're like big bro and big sis to me, because they're such giants. It's always been about the work, but it is their Broadway debuts as well. And people are seeing them for the giants that they are. I feel like we've already won. Let it be a marker that we can tell these stories and dream the unimaginable.
Q: Do you think this also signals something for Black artists and audiences?
A: People are embracing these shows with love. And it's a narrative they don't always see, even if they don't know why. Nothing is watered down about them: We are Black, and we are unapologetically Black. Hopefully the moneymakers see that these stories matter, how important they are. Take us for all that we are.

Texto completo: In Miami Beach, the city sends compliance officers to pound on doors of illegal vacation rentals in residential neighborhoods and tell the tourists they have to get out.
On Oahu, government officials gnaw on their knuckles and complain that they just don’t have the enforcement, or the money for enforcement, or a system in place to get all the information to truly understand and manage the scope of the situation — anything to keep from making a bold decision.
In Miami Beach, fines for owners of illegal vacation rentals in residential neighborhood start — START! — at $ 20,000 and go up in $ 20,000 increments for every subsequent time they are caught.
Meanwhile, here, the out-of-control vacation rental market in residential neighborhoods keeps growing more out of control. The marketing campaigns of big online booking companies that make their money off every night a stranger sleeps next door make it look like it’s only sweet Aunty Dottie or beloved Grandpa Joe renting out a room in their hale so they can cover the mortgage, nevermind all the wealthy absentee owners who are running small hotels in small neighborhoods and along our beaches.
The New York Times ran a story in March about Miami Beach’s war with illegal short-term vacation rentals. That city prohibits rentals of less than six months and a day in many residential neighborhoods. This paragraph from the story sounds like some neighborhoods in Hawaii:
“An outsider might not notice, but locals walking through Flamingo Park point out the signs that homes are being rented out. There are the lockboxes on the sides of buildings, attached to bike racks or slightly hidden behind hedges. These boxes are where renters pick up the keys to their vacation homes. Sometimes these are the people wandering through the neighborhood looking a little lost, or the ones who ring the wrong buzzer because they aren’t quite sure where to go … ‘You get to a point where you feel like you’re living in a hotel room,’ said Kathaleen Smarsh, a resident of Flamingo Park. ‘You don’t know who is coming and going at all hours.’”
The article describes the sounds of suitcases rolling down the sidewalk, through a building’s lobby or hallways, at all hours. It describes businesses that have popped up in neighborhoods to service the illegal vacation rentals, like laundry vans parked on the street selling clean towels. This is what comes next for Hawaii: Mobile beach gear rentals; mobile moped drop-offs; convenience stores in some guy’s garage; all of Waikiki’s infrastructure built to cater to tourism migrating to quiet neighborhoods.
The article also points out that Airbnb is suing the city of Miami Beach over a rule that recently went into effect that requires platforms only to allow posts from hosts with resort tax registration and business license numbers and to remove listings in neighborhoods that don’t allow short-term rentals. Hey, Honolulu City Council, sound familiar?
Hawaii residents have fought to save beaches from development and to keep the country country. The fight is now right at our doorsteps. Keep residential residential. This is not about the Hawaii tradition of warm hospitality or the rights of people to make money off their home. It’s about maintaining neighborhoods as stable places where people live, not where tourists come for vacation.

Texto completo: In brief
MIAMI - The FBI has opened a public corruption investigation into Republican donor and South Florida massage-parlor entrepreneur Li "Cindy" Yang, focusing on whether she illegally funneled money from China into the president's re-election effort or committed other potential campaign-finance violations, the Miami Herald has learned.
Investigators obtained a federal grand jury subpoena Tuesday seeking records from Bing Bing Peranio, an employee of Yang's family's spa business who last year contributed $5,400 to President Donald Trump's re-election effort, according to a source familiar with the probe. Yang came to Peranio's workplace and helped her write the check, Peranio told reporters from the New York Times, who first reported the contribution. Peranio told the Times she didn't "say no."
FBI agents based in West Palm Beach are trying to determine if Yang reimbursed Peranio for that contribution or delivered "anything of value" to her over that period to benefit the Trump campaign. Reimbursing someone for a political contribution without disclosing the original source is illegal, as is making a contribution in someone else's name.
Yang, a naturalized American citizen, ran a business that promised Chinese executives access to Trump and his family, particularly at the president's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach.
That raised questions of whether she was using funds paid by foreigners to purchase tickets for political events. Foreign nationals are not allowed to contribute to American political campaigns unless they have a green card.
Suspect faces 109 hate crime charges
SAN DIEGO - Federal officials announced Thursday that they have filed 109 hate crime charges against the man suspected of opening fire in a Southern California synagogue and said he called a 911 dispatcher afterward to report that he had done it to "defend my nation" against the Jewish people.
The gunman, identified as 19-year-old John T. Earnest, killed a woman and wounded an 8-year-old girl, her uncle and Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who was leading a service at the Chabad of Poway synagogue on the last day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday.
After the gunman fled the scene April 27, he told a 911 dispatcher he opened fire at a synagogue, thought he killed some people and said he did it because "I'm just trying to defend my nation from the Jewish people  They're destroying our people," according to the federal complaint.

Only question is how much the FBI spied on Trump campaign

Texto completo: At his contentious hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General William Barr dropped a big hint about his investigation into the conduct of the Trump-Russia investigation.
"Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant," Barr said. "I would like to find out whether that is, in fact, true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort designed to stop the threat as it is being represented."
Here is what he meant: There has been a lot of discussion on the right about the FBI’s use of a confidential informant, an England-based college professor named Stefan Halper, to spy on some Trump campaign figures, including the sometime foreign policy volunteer advisers George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. There has also been talk about the FBI’s use of a so-called FISA warrant — a court-approved permission to wiretap — against Page.
There was also speculation about other possible FBI surveillance, but the Halper operation and Page FISA case were the only ones definitely known. So Barr was saying that if the FBI really took the Trump-Russia matter seriously, if they thought it was a threat to the republic, would that be all they would do? No other wiretaps or other surveillance? No other confidential informants? Nothing?
Given that Barr was already looking into the question, his phrasing suggested he suspected there was more.
Sure enough, just days later, The New York Times reported that in the summer of 2016 the FBI sent an undercover agent, a woman who went by the alias Azra Turk, to London to pose as Halper’s research assistant and tease information out of Papadopoulos. (The Times was so reluctant to call Turk a spy that it referred to her, in a headline, as a "cloaked investigator.") So now there are Halper, Turk and the Page FISA warrant. If they represent the totality of the FBI’s surveillance, that would still be a pretty anemic response to what some in the bureau viewed as a full-scale Russian attack on American democracy.
So the key question of the Barr investigation will be: Is there more? The answer is not publicly known. But consider this: The Mueller report noted that on Aug. 2, 2017, the Justice Department authorized the special counsel to investigate specific allegations against four Trump campaign officials: Page and Papadopoulos, plus former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former security adviser Michael Flynn. Is it reasonable to believe that the FBI pulled out the big investigative guns, the spies and the wiretap warrant, against the two smaller figures — Page and Papadopoulos — and not against the far more important figures of Manafort and Flynn? Or if not against them, perhaps against others?
It wasn’t that long ago, on April 10, when, during another Hill appearance, Barr set off a firestorm by declaring that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign. Democrats pounced; how dare Barr call the FBI’s investigation "spying"?
"Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of attorney general," tweeted Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.
It is abundantly clear that Barr was correct. He was careful to add that the unknown factor about the spying was "whether it was adequately predicated" — that is, whether the FBI had a legitimate reason to do it. But there was no doubt that spying happened.
Now, the question is whether there was more than is now publicly known. Congressional investigators are anxiously awaiting the results of an investigation into at least some of the surveillance by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. That report is thought to be coming in the next couple of months. They are also watching to see what Barr will investigate on his own.
Both are deeply important efforts. Just as the public needed to know what is in the Mueller report, it needs to know about the FBI’s secret political operations in the 2016 campaign.

Texto completo: Jordan Klepper's new immersive documentary series comes to Comedy Central. And a deeper look at the Larry Nassar scandal is available to stream.
What's on TV
KLEPPER 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. Jordan Klepper has spent his career as a "Daily Show" correspondent with Jon Stewart and Trevor Noah, and as the host of his own Comedy Central talk show, "The Opposition With Jordan Klepper," which was canceled last June. Now, this comedian is getting out from behind a desk to embed with people across America who are fighting for change, from veterans' care to inequality in the marijuana industry. In the first episode, Klepper jumps into the ring with a group of military veterans who use wrestling to cope with PTSD.
PARADISE HOTEL 8 p.m. on Fox. This new reality TV show, hosted by the "Laguna Beach" star Kristin Cavallari, seems to follow a similar format as the British phenomenon "Love Island." Eleven competitors enter a tropical resort, where they will pair up to go on dates and compete in challenges for the chance to win $ 250,000. Each week, one person must leave the hotel to make room for a new guest, and fans are encouraged to follow along at home, using social media to help decide who stays and who leaves. The series's executive producer is SallyAnn Salsano, who created "Jersey Shore."
What's Streaming
[Video: At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal (2019) | Official Trailer | HBO Watch on YouTube.]
AT THE HEART OF GOLD: INSIDE THE U.S.A. GYMNASTICS SCANDAL (2019) Stream on HBO platforms. Last year, over seven days, more than 150 women publicly confronted the disgraced U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar, who was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for multiple sex crimes by Judge Rosemarie Aquilina -- who likened the sentence to signing his "death warrant." But questions remain as to how Nassar was able to prey on so many girls for so long. This HBO documentary, from the filmmaker Erin Lee Carr ("Mommy Dead and Dearest"), examines how the competitive nature of the sport helped contribute to a culture of silence and allowed Nassar to groom his victims and the adults around them. After watching the film, The New York Times's Maya Salam wrote, "In a sport where girls are militarily broken down physically and emotionally, Nassar established himself as a rare compassionate figure and confidante."
THE ENGLISH PATIENT (1996) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube and Vudu. Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe star in this drama about a plane crash victim who, just at the end of World War II, can't remember his life before the crash. As a young nurse (Binoche) tends to him, he begins to reveal his history and past love affair in a series of flashbacks and memories. The film won nine Academy Awards, including best picture, and Janet Maslin praised it as a "fiercely romantic, mesmerizing tour de force" in her review in The Times.

On mayor Buttigieg

Texto completo: Now that Joe Biden has formally announced his candidacy the Real Clear Politics (RCP) polling averages from April 11 to May 1 show Good Ol’ Joe in the lead with 36.8% support, followed by Bernie Sanders with 16.4%. These percentages will change as all the “progressiver” candidates and their supporters make the case that Joe is a “corporate” status quo Democrat, with hints of misogyny and racism in his record.
Nothing surprising here. What’s surprising are the RCP numbers for Mayor Pete (“Peter” to his friends and husband) Buttigieg. According to the most recent data his 7% rating has not changed. This is surprising since few people outside of Indiana had ever considered him as a presidential material before he announced his candidacy on April 14. His 7% does not make him a rival of Biden and Sanders, but it does make him an immediate rival of Warren (8%) and Harris (7.4%). Both women have been in the public eye for months, constantly yelling about the iniquity of bankers, the terrifying Trump Tower Gargoyle, the wicked rich, and Republicans in general.
Kamala Harris is a senator from California, Warren a senator from Massachusetts; Buttigieg is a mere mayor from insignificant South Bend, Indiana. Senator “Spartacus” Booker must wonder why he finds himself polling a pitiful 2.4%. Newark, of which he was mayor, is a much bigger city. You have to wonder also if Mayor Ethan Strimling feels as if he missed an opportunity. Portland, Maine (pop. 66,000), isn’t much smaller than South Bend (101,735) and it’s a lot more interesting yet nobody is talking about a possible President Strimling. Doesn’t seem fair to me. Does it seem fair to him?
And what does Beto O’Rourke make of his paltry 4.6%. At the beginning of April his table-jumping, wildly gesticulating speechifying, and frat boy enthusiasm brought him rapt attention from the nation’s Muddy Stream Media. Now he finds that the Indiana latecomer has displaced him in MSM circles. Senator Klobuchar has barely registered above 1% while Yang, Inslee, Gabbard, Castro, Hickenlooper, Ryan, Gillibrand and Delaney all receive mere fractions.
The mayor has some hikes up the greasy pole of presidential ascent which are his alone. Unless the mayor of an even smaller town jumps into the competition he is the only true stealth candidate. An April 23 NBC report,
“Rivals Are Scrambling to Dig up Dirt on Pete Buttigieg,” tells the tale. There we read that five officials working for other Democrats admitted that their candidates were “scrambling to find vulnerabilities and lines of attack that can be used against him.” They are looking filing Freedom of Information Act requests, collecting everything he has written or said in public and even examining South Bend budgets. Don’t forget the social media; “oppo” researchers have turned up some damaging material in old internet babble.
I’ve found a Reuters report that claims Peter has “presided over an economic turnaround” that is probably going to become the “central plank of his presidential campaign.” Really? His achievements as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, during less than two terms have so been prodigious that the American voters will be dazzled? I have not, so far, found any details about his tenure as mayor.
Hold on, that’s not exactly right. I’ve found a couple of conservative columnists who provided details suggesting more substantive failures. We will have to wait for his defenders to supply the details of his successes.
Alexander Burns of the New York Times wrote a reserved, objective, and very interesting analysis back in April. It’s worth quoting in full: “Mr. Buttigieg’s distinctive political passion appears to be storytelling, wrapping conventional liberalism in an earnest, youthful persona that Democrats might see as capable of winning over the middle of the country.” That sounds about right. We’ll have to see how this approach works out when the opposition research is unleashed.

President defends reported business losses

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday defended the more than $1 billion he reported in business losses between 1985 and 1994, a previously undisclosed amount revealed in a New York Times investigation, as a best practice that other real estate developers had also used.
Yet even as he tried to explain in a pair of Twitter posts that showing “losses for tax purposes" was considered a “sport" among real estate developers like himself, the president also said the Times' account was “a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!"
It was not immediately clear what specifically in the Times investigation Trump disputed.
The article reported the staggering figure of $1.17 billion in losses between 1985 and 1994, an amount calculated from 10 years of his tax information obtained by the Times. It also raised questions about the image that Trump presented of himself, and whether he is a tarnished, not triumphant, businessman. In some years, Trump appears to have lost more money than any other single taxpayer among an IRS sampling of high earners. Trump has portrayed himself as a self-made billionaire and master deal maker.
The new details about the president's steep financial losses provide the fullest picture yet of his taxes. And his defense of the losses that he reported in the 1980s and 1990s will fuel House Democrats in their fight to get his tax returns for the past six years.
Trump has refused to release his tax returns, bucking a common practice of presidential candidates for the past four decades. Earlier this week, the Treasury Department announced it would not release the tax returns despite a formal request from House Democrats, kicking off a legal battle that will likely go to the Supreme Court.
Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said the revelations about Trump's losses were shocking.
“Trump was perhaps the worst businessman in the world," said Pascrell, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has broad authority to ask for the tax returns of any taxpayer. “His entire campaign was a lie. He didn't pay taxes for years and lost over $1 billion — how is that possible? How did he keep getting more money and where on earth was it all going? We need to know now."
Pascrell insisted that the IRS comply with his committee's request. “We now have another part of the truth," he said. “We need a lot more."
During a weekly meeting with reporters Wednesday, the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, said the new details bolstered Democrats' demand for Trump's tax returns. He dismissed Trump's longtime excuse that he was unable to release them because they were under audit.
“Presumably any time they get a piece of paper from Donald Trump, they put it under audit," he said.

Pelosi says Trump is becoming 'self-impeachable'
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, on Wednesday said President Trump is "becoming self-impeachable," pointing to his efforts to fight all subpoenas from congressional investigations and prevent key aides from testifying before Congress.
"The point is that every single day, whether it's obstruction, obstruction, obstruction — obstruction of having people come to the table with facts, ignoring subpoenas . . . every single day, the president is making a case — he's becoming self-impeachable, in terms of some of the things that he is doing," Pelosi said at a Washington Post Live event.
It was not immediately clear what Pelosi meant by "self-impeachable." The House speaker has thus far resisted calls by some members of her party to pursue impeachment proceedings against Trump.
On Tuesday, she made a similar argument about Trump's actions, comparing him to President Richard Nixon and noting that one of the articles of impeachment against the former president was that he ignored congressional subpoenas.
Democrats have repeatedly decried Trump's resistance as stonewalling, maintaining that the president is thwarting Congress's ability to conduct oversight.
Pelosi's interview with the Post's Robert Costa came hours before the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for not complying with a subpoena for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report.

Bush, of 'Access Hollywood' tape fame, returning to TV
More than two years after losing his morning show job because of his appearance in the infamous “Access Hollywood" tape, Billy Bush will return to television in the fall, Warner Bros. announced Wednesday.
He will anchor an entertainment news show called “ExtraExtra," which is distributed by Warner Bros. and will air on a number of local Fox stations beginning in September.
In the final sprint of the 2016 presidential campaign, The Washington Post released a recording from 2005 in which President Trump, then the Republican nominee, could be heard making vulgar comments about groping women while Bush laughed and goaded him on. Bush was recording an “Access Hollywood" segment with Trump on the set of “Days of Our Lives," where Trump was making a cameo.
Bush, 47, was widely criticized for his role in the tape and quickly lost his job as one of the 9 a.m. hosts of NBC's “Today."
In an op-ed in The New York Times a year after the recording was published, Bush said he and the other men on the bus “assumed we were listening to a crass standup act."
“He was performing," Bush wrote of Trump. “Surely, we thought, none of this was real. We now know better."

Trump's tax returns won't save Democrats from drowning

Texto completo: That Democrats actually think there might be a point to score in seizing President Trump’s tax returns says everything about how clueless they are heading into 2020.
There is no indication that voters actually care about this (they didn't in 2016), nor that there’s anything to gain in waving around a piece of paper from the IRS. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders released 10 years' worth of tax returns last month, and he’s sitting a comfortable 20 points behind Joe Biden in the latest RealClearPolitics national average.
Remember Rachel Maddow’s massive scoop two years ago — that she had obtained a copy of Trump’s 2005 federal tax return? The tension built and built and built!
Until the climax: Trump had paid a higher effective tax rate than either Bernie Sanders or former President Barack Obama! Scandal!
After the ensuing backlash from her loyal viewers for the letdown, Maddow blamed her them for getting their hopes up. Her show should have been canceled after that.
And remember that painfully long New York Times investigative piece last October? The paper dedicated three of its reporters to spend a year combing through financial records and talking with sources to find that Trump’s father avoided paying a lot of taxes and gave his kids a lot of money.
The Times published a separate “11 Takeaways” story and a “How Times Journalists Uncovered the Original Source of the President’s Wealth” article to accompany the deep investigation. The paper even worked with Showtime for a documentary on the same topic.
Did you even hear about it? The general public reacted to the investigation by hitting the snooze button. NPR reporter Domenico Montanaro acknowledged that the Times piece had “the least impact” because of “the lack of apparent caring or lack of surprise."
When Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas ran for president in 2016, they released five years' worth of returns. Trump didn’t, and he ran away with the party’s nomination. In the general election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton released her tax returns. Trump didn’t. She lost. He won.
A Morning Consult-Politico poll last month said that just half of registered voters supported Democrats in their attempt to get Trump’s returns. I’m convinced they’re just bitter that Trump has failed to on his campaign promise to make tax filing simpler for average people.
Actually, anyone upset about the annual nightmare that is tax filing can first thank Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. He just advanced a bill that would ban the IRS from creating a free filing program. How nice. As head of the Ways and Means Committee, Neal also happens to be the one with authority to demand that the IRS turn over anyone's tax returns.
He’s been so far rebuffed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, but what does Neal think he’s going to find in them anyway? That Trump, a well known BSer, isn’t as rich as he says he is? (By the way, tax returns don't necessarily give any indication of wealth.) That Trump pays as little in taxes as possible, something everyone does and something Trump has proudly admitted a million times?
Seizing any individual’s private, legally filed tax returns so that you can leak them to the public — which is exactly what Neal would do — is nothing short of abuse of power. It’s a stupid abuse of power, given that tax returns have proven to be a nonfactor, but it's abuse nonetheless.
Democrats are drowning as we march into 2020, and Trump’s tax returns won’t rescue them.

Richard Neal, D-Mass., ranking member on the House Ways and Means, reads over papers on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, May 24, 2017, prior to the start of the committee's hearing on the Treasury Department's fiscal 2018 budget proposals where Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin testified.

Daily on Healthcare: A congresswoman’s push to have gun violence treated as a public health issue

THE PUSH TO HAVE GUN VIOLENCE TREATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE: Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., says gun violence should be considered a public health issue, and she is promoting legislation that would require the federal government to treat it as such.
Kelly is the author of a first-of-its-kind bill to require the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue.
An annual report on gun violence, in Kelly's view, could help tip the balance of the gun control debate toward stricter regulation.
Kelly introduced her bill, which has 48 co-sponsors, just a few months after the National Rifle Association on Twitter told “self-important anti-gun doctors” to "stay in their lane" and keep far away from the gun violence debate.
Kelly calls the idea that doctors shouldn't tell patients about the risks of guns "absolutely ridiculous."
"They are well in their lane. It’s a big lane,” she told the Washington Examiner’s Cassidy Morrison for an interview in our weekly magazine.
Only trauma surgeons and emergency room doctors can fully grasp the ramifications of violence inflicted with guns, supporters of Kelly's bill argue. By treating victims, physicians gain an understanding of the human costs of shootings that participants in the gun rights debate lack.
The NRA has long opposed having federal agencies research shootings as public health incidents. Gun rights supporters instead generally couch the issue as one of rights, specifically the right guaranteed by the Second Amendment.
Kelly represents Illinois’ 2nd Congressional District, which comprises Chicago suburbs and parts of southeast Chicago, an area of the city where gun violence is common.
The tragedies unfolding in Kelly's district are wearying, she says, but they serve as a reminder of the need for legislation. “That’s what actually keeps me going," she said.

GEORGIA PASSES SIX-WEEK ABORTION BAN: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, has signed a bill into law that would ban abortion when a heartbeat can be detected, which is roughly six weeks into a pregnancy and before many women know they’re pregnant. Kentucky, Mississippi, and Ohio have passed similar bans, but none have yet been enacted because they have faced lawsuits. Proponents hope the laws will challenge Roe v. Wade, turning the legalization of abortion to the states.
The ACLU has vowed to sue before the bill would take effect in 2002. The bill has exceptions for rape, incest, and when a pregnant woman’s health is at risk.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, MORE DOCTORS ARE EMPLOYED BY HOSPITALS THAN WORK IN PRIVATE PRACTICES: An American Medical Association study released Monday found more than half of physicians are employed by hospitals and health systems, compared to about 45% who own private practices. The rates of physicians with their own practices has been in decline since 1988. Both young physicians and female physicians are more likely to work in a larger healthcare system, whereas in past AMA studies, the rates of physicians in private practices has depended on their specialties. Historically, more family physicians have worked in hospitals and large health systems, while surgical specialists have been inclined to own private practices. These rates have fallen slowly yet steadily since 2012.
NUMBER OF MEASLES CASES RISES: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of confirmed measles cases in 23 states has reached 764 as of May 3. This is an increase of 60 cases from the previous week. More and more cities in affected states, including California, New York, Oregon, and Washington, are introducing mandates that all individuals get vaccinated. Many states are also reexamining the merits of philosophical exemptions from vaccinations.
A FEW HEADLINES ABOUT DEMOCRATS AND ABORTION:
Abortion rights groups back challenger to rare anti-abortion Democrat: A coalition of leading progressive organizations, including EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, announced Monday they will endorse Marie Newman, a Democrat running to represent Illinois’ third Congressional District. Newman wants to unseat Democrat Dan Lipinski, one of very few anti-abortion, anti-LGBT rights Democrats in Congress. Newman already has a wide grassroots following and is leading in fundraising efforts. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has pressured four of Newman’s campaign consultants, vendors working with primary challengers, to quit because they were working against incumbent Lipinksi. The DCCC said their business in the party would suffer if they continued working with Newman.
Alabama Democrat said Doug Jones backed him up on his controversial abortion remarks: Alabama state legislator John Rogers said Monday that Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., told him “I know you’re right” about his controversial abortion comments. Rogers was heavily criticized last week after defending abortion by saying you can either abort unwanted kids now or execute them later amid a debate over a bill that would restrict abortion to cases where it could prevent a serious health risk for the mother.
Pennsylvania Democrat offers reward for "doxxing" teenagers protesting Planned Parenthood: Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims, a Democrat and LGBT activist, has generated major controversy by offering a $100 reward for anyone who could release the personal information of three young girls protesting outside of a Pennsylvania Planned Parenthood. “What we’ve got here is a bunch of protesters. A bunch of pseudo-Christian protesters who have been out here shaming young girls,” Sims said in a livestreamed video posted Monday.

Denver’s magic mushroom vote is the democratic experiment we need

Texto completo: Under the federal system, states and cities are laboratories of democracy. And on Tuesday, citizens in Denver are voting on a unique ballot initiative: decriminalizing “magic mushrooms.” That’s great. Even for those who aren’t on board with the idea that adults should generally be free to ingest what they please, there’s plenty of reasons to cheer on Denver’s democratic experiment.
First a bit about the bill. The initiative, Initiated Ordinance 301 or the Denver Psilocybin Mushroom Decriminalization Initiative, “ would make the personal use and personal possession of psilocybin mushrooms by persons twenty-one (21) years of age and older the city’s lowest law-enforcement priority.” The ordinance, if passed, would also bar the city from spending money on criminal enforcement for those adults and establish and “psilocybin mushroom policy review panel.”
That’s pretty benign. Prosecutors could still go after those buying or selling magic mushrooms and they would still be quite illegal under federal law. Moreover, psilocybin isn’t a problem in Denver: In the last three years only 11 cases were prosecuted, according to the New York Times.
By decriminalizing hallucinogenic mushrooms, Denver is offering itself up as a real-life case study. For both proponents and opponents of psilocybin, that’s important and will either make a case for further decriminalization efforts or sound the alarm against more permissive laws.
Moreover, decriminalization in a major city will also help pave the way for a broader conversation on psilocybin which, as recent studies have demonstrated, has real medicinal potential for treating depression and other health issues. That’s undoubtedly a good thing that will, hopefully, enable more research that sheds further light potential uses or dangers.
Although decriminalizing psilocybin might seem like an off the wall proposal, it’s not and several other countries do not regulate magic mushrooms. In the U.S., a little democratic experimentation will enable a policy debate based on real results rather than broad claims extolling the virtues of psychedelics or claims of implantable danger. That’s how democracy should work and if Denver wants to be that experiment, assuming the initiative passes, great.
Photo Caption:Voters fill out their ballots at the Denver Elections Division Tuesday, May 7, 2019, in Denver. Voters could make Denver the first U.S. city to decriminalize the use of psilocybin, the psychoactive substance in "magic mushrooms" if the measure passes.

Texto completo: DID YOU KNOW?
Children's Book Week (May 7-11)
"The Cat in the Hat" was born out of Dr. Seuss' desire to find a more compelling way to teach kids basic reading skills.
* In the book "Goodnight Moon" a mouse appears on each page, and the clock slowly changes from 7:10 to 8:10 as the book progresses.
* The title character in "Clifford the Big Red Dog" was almost named Tiny. Author Norman Bridwell changed the name after a suggestion from his wife.
* The famous girl detective Nancy Drew might have been known by a different name. In the early stages of the series, the publisher considered naming her Stella Strong, Nan Nelson or Diana Dare.
* Dr. Seuss bet his publisher $50 that he could write a book using 50 words or less. He won, his book "Green Eggs and Ham," contains exactly 50 words.
* When Maurice Sendak was illustrating a book about horses, he realized he wasn't very good at drawing them. Instead, he turned them into strange beasts. The book became "Where the Wild Things Are," the Caldecott Medal award-winning children's book.
* Beatrix Potter's manuscript "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" was rejected by publishers six times. Potter was determined to see her book in print and self-published 250 copies. Since then, it has sold more than 45 million copies.
* The Harry Potter books were the first children's books on the New York Times Bestseller list since E.B. White's "Charlotte's Web" in 1952.
* Before Google bought it from them, the domain name 'gmail.com' was originally used by Garfield.com to reply to fans of the comic strip.
* Dr. Seuss' first book, "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," was rejected by over 20 publishers.
* Carolyn Keene, to whom every book featuring Nancy Drew is attributed, is not a real person. Keene is a pseudonym for the many authors who contributed to the mystery series.

Texto completo: Let us now praise two almost-famous men who served in the Senate for a combined total of 74 years and died recently within three weeks of each other. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, and Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, both took a bipartisan approach to legislating and left their country a stronger, safer place.
Today, lawmakers who dare to reach across the aisle are branded as heretics and threatened with primary challenges. So it’s important to remember a time when working with political rivals to solve problems was not just possible, but popular.
Lugar was compact and colorless, known for his early-morning runs around Capitol Hill, even in lousy weather. A political ally, William Ruckelshaus, once joked about him, "Dick has maintained that childhood capability of walking into an empty room and blending right in."
Hollings was tall and lanky with a crackling wit that sometimes got him in trouble. When a political opponent challenged him to take a drug test, Hollings fired back, "I’ll take a drug test if you’ll take an IQ test." The New York Times once wrote, "Providence has blessed him with an appearance so striking that rank strangers assume he must be important."
In many ways, however, their political lives took similar paths. Both were military veterans. Hollings won a Bronze Star as an artillery officer in World War II. Lugar was too young for the war, but time as an intelligence officer briefing the Navy’s top brass deepened his interest in defense and foreign policy.
Hollings was elected governor of South Carolina at age 36. Lugar became mayor of Indianapolis at 35. Both lost their first tries for the Senate, and ran for president with abysmal results. And both represented vanishing political breeds that are sorely missed in Congress today.
Hollings was a pragmatic Southern Democrat in a state that was rapidly turning Republican, and after he retired in 2004, he was replaced by hard-edged conservative Jim DeMint. Lugar, a dedicated internationalist, was defeated in a GOP primary in 2012 by a doctrinaire right-winger, Richard Mourdock.
But the most important trait they shared was a capacity to change, grow and apply their new knowledge to practical legislative solutions. In 1986, Lugar led 31 Republicans in joining 47 Democrats to override President Reagan’s veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions on South Africa. The Republican’s most enduring success was working with Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, to enact legislation that financed the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. The Washington Post editorialized, "the program ranks as among the most successful congressional foreign policy initiatives in a generation."
One of Lugar’s protÃ©gÃ©s was a young first-term Democrat from Illinois, Barack Obama, who said of his mentor: "In Dick, I saw someone who wasn’t a Republican or a Democrat first, but a problem-solver — an example of the impact a public servant can make by eschewing partisan divisiveness to instead focus on common ground."
Hollings grew up in the segregated South, but as governor, he presided over the peaceful integration of Clemson University. "This General Assembly," he told state lawmakers, "must make clear South Carolina’s choice: a government of laws rather than a government of men."
As a senator in the late 1960s, he toured poor areas of his state and became a strong supporter of federal programs like food stamps. "There is hunger in South Carolina," he told a Senate committee. "I know as a public servant I am late to the problem, (but) we’ve got work to do in our own back yard ."
In the 1980s, he worked with Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire to enact the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, which placed strict limits on congressional expenditures. It worked for a time, but eventually, clever congressional budget-busters found ways around the restrictions.
Perhaps the most memorable moment of Hollings’ career came in 2015, when he proposed that a federal courthouse named in his honor be renamed for Judge J. Waties Waring, an early and isolated voice for racial equality. "I just got the money for the building, he made history in it," Hollings explained.
The senator was being too modest. Fritz Hollings and Dick Lugar both made history. And today’s lawmakers can learn a lot from their lives of honor and courage. .

'The best is yet to come'? Some reasons to be cheerful, or not

Texto completo: The economy is expanding at a decent clip, inflation has been MIA for years, and the jobless rate is at its lowest level since Peter, Paul and Mary were at the top of the charts with “Leaving on a Jet Plane."
But the good news doesn't end there.
A quick perusal of the Internet yields so, so many examples of why, as the president tweeted last week, “AMERICA is now #1. We are the ENVY of the WORLD — and the best is yet to come!"
Here are just a few I found — ripped, as the say, straight from the headlines:
Income inequality increases to pre-Great Depression levels (Fortune)
The rich getting richer is proof positive that capitalism is working. Should the rich be getting poorer? Of course not. That wouldn't be progress, would it?
Plus, being stuck in the middle is really hard. You envy all the good things rich people enjoy — a health care plan with affordable deductibles, kids who aren't buried under $100k in student loans, a Prius — but know you'll never get them.
Meanwhile, the poor hate you for what you do have — like drinkable tap water, decent public schools, and trust in the police.
How global warming has made the rich richer (BBC)
Talk about a two-fer, a win-win, a daily double. First, see above. Second, to be honest, as I get older, New England winters are starting to lose their charm. Cranking up the snowblower at 5 in the morning isn't the thrill it used to be. Would I mind if our climate became more like, say, South Carolina's? Would I prefer to retire in a community that had South Carolina's climate but not the Confederate flags and white supremacy marches? Put me down as a definite maybe (while I figure out just how many feet above sea level my house is).
Stocks plunge as trade-war worries rattle investors (Business Insider)
One question: Would you prefer a real war or a war over tariffs with China? If you answered “real war" — or sold stock Tuesday — you should be ashamed of yourself.
One million species face extinction, UN report says (Washington Post)
C'mon, how many species of plants and animals do we need? How many can you even name? After homo sapiens and cannabis sativa, I am lost. Think how easy biology class would be for future generations with 40 percent fewer species to study. Should a master's in zoology really take six years? And do we really need all those snakes, scorpions, and killer bees? Make America safe again.
Nearly half of college students surveyed for a new report are going hungry (New York Times)
This absolutely breaks my heart. Colleges are admitting students who can't find the dining hall? Standards have really dropped. Sad. In my day, I lived off Domino's. (They took a check and would deliver to the dorm at 1 a.m., after we were done studying the effects of cannabis sativa.) These days there are so many options: GrubHub, DoorDash, the church soup kitchen. In the land of Super Stop & Shops with 42 varieties of cereal, how is campus hunger a real problem?
US won't escape the pain of Brexit (NBC News)
So true. The headlines just won't stop. How much do we want to read about the Irish backstop and that second-rate Margaret Thatcher called Theresa May? Let's face it, most Americans didn't even know Britain was part of Europe. The good news? We don't really care if Britain becomes a third-rate country. Wake me up when California votes to leave the United States.
Feds say we are all getting fatter (USA Today)
This is such good news, which is why I saved it for last. I am already living on the border between paunchy and obese. The more the rest of the country catches up with me, the better I will look at my high school reunion in November. I am tired of beating myself up for not going to the gym, for ordering Diet Coke with a double bacon cheeseburger when I really want a Guinness, and for sizing out of Abercrombie & Fitch.
I want more company when I shop at DXL.

Plenty of high-profile athletes are refusing to stand with Trump. Not Tiger Woods.

Texto completo: A growing list of athletes have declined invitations from President Donald Trump to visit the White House as a stance against his racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Sadly, Tiger Woods isn't one of them.
The golf legend was due at the White House on Monday to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom for winning the Masters last month in what marked a career comeback for the 43-year-old after a decade of injuries and losses. He won't be the first athlete to garner such an accolade. Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali, Arthur Ashe, Jackie Robinson and Arnold Palmer are among those bestowed the honor since President John F. Kennedy created the award in 1963.
Mr. Woods made an indelible mark on the sport of golf and certainly is as legendary and deserving of the honor as the athletes who came before him.
Despite this, we wish Mr. Woods would have taken a stand against hatred and declined the award given the racial and ethnic rift Mr. Trump has widened and exploited in the country since taking office. (As we have noted many times before, hate crimes have unmistakably risen under Mr. Trump.)
Just because he is famous doesn't mean Mr. Woods has any obligation to be a spokesman against racism in America. He did indeed train all his life to play golf, not lead a modern day Civil Rights movement. But his position as a star athlete, particularly as an African-American in a sport that has historically been overwhelmingly white, makes him a role model in this regard whether he likes it or not. He could use this opportunity to raise awareness of an issue that has surely impacted his life, as well as those of many of his relatives and ancestors. Or he could at least decline to allow the president to co-opt his glory with a White House photo-op.
Is Mr. Woods oblivious or does he just not care that the president regularly demonizes minorities and emboldens those who hate? He has been spotted on golfing outings with the president on at least two occasions since he took office, including most recently in February, when golfer Jack Nicklaus also joined the pair.
When asked once about his association with Mr. Trump, Mr. Woods suggested it is OK to disregard the things you don't like about people.
"He's the President of the United States," Mr. Woods said at the Northern Trust golf tournament, according to GolfDigest.com. "You have to respect the office. No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office."
Taking a kid glove approach to race is nothing new for Mr. Woods, so his feelings toward Mr. Trump should not come as a complete surprise. Some African Americans have long taken him to task for saying he gets offended when called African American, instead referring to himself as "cablinasian," a term he coined to reflect his mixed Caucasian, black, American Indian and Asian heritage.
He may want to divorce himself from the legacy of racism in this country, but not everybody sees it that way. Consider golf legend Fuzzy Zoeller's reaction to Woods' historic 1997 Masters Tournament win:
"He's doing quite well. Pretty impressive," Mr. Zoeller said. "The little boy is driving it well. He's putting well. He's doing everything it takes to win. So you know what you guys do when he gets in here? Pat him on the back. Say congratulations. Enjoy it. And tell him not to serve fried chicken next year. Got it? Or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve." (Mr. Zoeller later said he was joking, but not everybody believed this. Mr. Woods let it slide.)
But taking a stand on race can be bad for business. (Just ask Colin Kaepernick.) And Tiger Woods has always been about the business of Tiger Woods, and this trip to the White House is no exception.
Politics aside, this was a brand-building opportunity for two business associates. As recently outlined by The New York Times, Mr. Woods has a contract to design a golf course for one of Mr. Trump's properties in Dubai, and a villa at a Trump Miami property is named after Mr. Woods. This award only helps Mr. Trump prosper off the association with Mr. Woods' celebrity.
Mr. Woods has made his choice, and part of his legacy will be embracing a man who incited bigotry and racism. That's the opposite of athletes like basketball players Stephen Curry and Lebron James who have declined White House visits and openly criticized the president. Red Sox manager Alex Cora said he will not visit the White House when his team is honored for last fall's World Series title Thursday because of Mr. Trump's response to the devastation left on his native Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Many families are still living without basic necessities such as electricity.
Unlike Tiger Woods, these athletes are using the platform they have been granted to stand up for something they believe in. They will be remembered for it.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump on Sunday reversed course, saying special counsel Robert Mueller should not testify before Congress just two days after telling reporters the attorney general should make that decision.
In a pair of tweets, Mr. Trump said the special counsel should not appear before the House Judiciary Committee and questioned why the Democratically controlled committee would need Mr. Mueller's testimony after concluding his two-year investigation into allegations of collusion between Russian operatives and Trump associates during the 2016 presidential campaign and transition.
"Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION," he wrote, adding, "No redos for the Dems!"
On Friday, however, the president - when asked by reporters at the White House about Mr. Mueller potentially testifying - said Attorney General William Barr should determine whether or not Mr. Mueller would provide congressional testimony, saying: "I don't know. That's up to our attorney general, who I think has done a fantastic job."
Mr. Trump's Sunday tweet came hours after House Judiciary member David Cicilline told "Fox News Sunday" that the committee has reached a "tentative date" of May 15 for Mr. Mueller to testify, though he later clarified that the date for Mr. Mueller's appearance had not yet been finalized.
"Just to clarify: we are aiming to bring Mr. Mueller in on the 15th, but nothing has been agreed to yet," the Rhode Island Democrat tweeted later Sunday. "That's the date the Committee has proposed, and we hope the Special Counsel will agree to it. Sorry for the confusion."
In his interview with "Fox News Sunday," Mr. Cicilline said the agreement was still tentative because "the representative for the Special Counsel has" signed off, "but obviously until the day comes, we never have an absolute guarantee." He added, "The White House has so far indicated they would not interfere with Mr. Mueller's attempts to testify."
Mr. Mueller's appearance before the committee would allow lawmakers to hear from the special counsel on the investigation he spearheaded. The Department of Justice released a redacted version of the special counsel's long-awaited findings last month.
Peter Carr, spokesman for the special counsel, declined to comment.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer picked up on the misstatement by Mr. Cicilline at a news conference Sunday saying, "I heard this morning that Mueller is testifying on the 15th. I think it's imperative for Mueller to testify. ... Given the fact that Mr. Barr does not seem to be a neutral observer here, Mueller's testimony is all the more important. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo avoided saying on Sunday whether the Trump administration would impose targeted sanctions on China over mass detentions of Muslims, in another sign of the administration's paralysis on the issue.
Mr. Pompeo was asked on CBS News's "Face the Nation" about whether the administration might punish Chinese officials for the detention of hundreds of thousands to millions of ethnic minority Muslims in camps in Xinjiang, a vast region in northwest China.
The New York Times reported on Saturday that after months of debate, American officials had shelved proposed targeted sanctions for fear of jeopardizing continuing trade talks, and are unwilling to raise the issue in the talks.
When pressed on CBS on the matter, Mr. Pompeo said he had raised the issue of human rights "in multiple conversations" with Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, and other officials. But he did not answer a question about any potential move on sanctions.
Mr. Pompeo has criticized the camps and said last week on Fox News that their use was "reminiscent of the 1930s." But the State Department has been unsuccessful in pushing through proposed sanctions. Last fall, American officials drew up a policy to impose sanctions on specific Chinese officials and companies over the camps, with a legal basis in the Global Magnitsky Act, but the policy failed to get through an interagency review process.
While the State Department and the White House National Security Council approved the action, the Treasury Department voiced concerns about the effect on trade talks, according to American officials. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has generally been a proponent of reinforcing strong business ties with China, the world's second-largest economy.
Trade negotiators for the two sides are meeting this week in Washington and could conclude the talks. On Sunday, President Trump threatened to ramp up tariffs, a move that appeared to be aimed at forcing China to agree quickly to a deal.
In defending the administration's approach to China, Mr. Pompeo said on Sunday that Mr. Trump had pushed back against China's "enormous trade abuses" and was working to end intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer by Chinese companies and the government.
However, as the trade talks continue, it has become clear that the end result probably will not address critical issues like China's cybertheft, state subsidies and regulations on trade in data. Economists say the trade deficit, which Mr. Trump is focused on, is not nearly as important as those other issues.
On the issue of China's detention of Muslims, who are mostly Turkic-speaking ethnic Uighurs, Democratic and Republican members of Congress have expressed frustration at the lack of sanctions from the Trump administration. They have been pushing since last year for economic penalties on senior officials, including Chen Quanguo, a Politburo member who is party chief of Xinjiang. On Friday, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told The Times that "words alone are not enough."
The host of "Face the Nation," Margaret Brennan, also pressed Mr. Pompeo on Sunday on why the State Department and the Pentagon had different estimates of the number of detainees and used different labels for the camps. Mr. Pompeo has said the detention centers are "re-education camps" that hold up to one million people. On Friday, Randall G. Schriver, an assistant secretary of defense, told reporters that he considered the centers to be "concentration camps" that held "at least a million but likely closer to three million citizens."
It was by far the largest estimate from any official on the number of detainees. Human rights groups have generally said the number is hundreds of thousands to more than one million.
Despite the obvious difference in estimates, Mr. Pompeo said there was no gap between the State and Defense Departments on their assessments.
"Don't play ticky-tack," he said. "There's no discrepancy."

Rashida Tlaib slams New York Times for 'dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free'

Texto completo: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., accused the New York Times of "dehumanizing" Palestinians after the Times released a story with a headline recounting the most recent exchange of attacks between Israel and Palestinians.
"When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free?" Tlaib tweeted. "Headlines like this & framing it in this way just feeds into the continued lack of responsibility on Israel who unjustly oppress & target Palestinian children and families. #FreePalestine."
Tweet
Israel has since denied that the pregnant mother and her daughter were killed by Israeli attacks, blaming terrorist "propaganda" and saying the two were killed by a Gaza misfire instead.
The Israel Defense Forces also shared videos of its work against Hamas, the anti-Israel terrorist organization, including the removal of a Hamas cyber warfare headquarters and the bombing death of a Hamas financier, who was killed in a vehicle explosion while traveling down a road.
Tweet
Freshman congresswoman Tlaib has been a staunch critic of Israel policies, going so far as to have a map in her office where Israel is covered with a sticky note that says "Palestine." She's been a proponent of BDS movements in the country, pushing for more entities to divest from Israel to try to force peace.
Several media members, including from Jewish outlets, called Tlaib out on Twitter for blaming Israel for hundreds of rockets being shot at them, claiming she was justifying the violence against Israel.
"Holy s**t!! @RashidaTlaib is justifying the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel," NewsMax's John Cardillo tweeted. "This woman needs to resign from Congress today. @SpeakerPelosi has lost control."
Tweet
Tlaib has dismissed criticism of her views as anti-Semitic, claiming this was by "right-wing media" because she's a Palestinian woman.

Ilhan Omar defends Palestinians after terrorists rain rockets on Israel

Texto completo: Rep. Ilhan Omar appeared to take the side of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad Sunday night after terrorists fired hundreds of rockets at civilian targets in Israel this weekend.
“How many more protesters must be shot, rockets must be fired, and little kids must be killed until the endless cycle of violence ends? The status quo of occupation and humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unsustainable. Only real justice can bring about security and lasting peace,” the Minnesota Democrat said in a tweet Sunday night.
Tweet
Omar’s comments follow terrorists firing over 600 rockets into southern Israel, killing at least four Israelis. Israeli counterstrikes at what the Israel Defense Forces said were military targets killed at least a dozen Palestinians.
A pregnant Palestinian woman and her infant niece were among those killed but the Israelis said a misfired Palestinian rocket — not an Israeli airstrike — caused those deaths, disputing a Gaza Health Ministry statement that Israel was to blame.
[Opinion: Why Israel is so good at targeting Hamas]
President Trump condemned the rocket attacks on Twitter and expressed American support for Israel.
“Once again, Israel faces a barrage of deadly rocket attacks by terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. We support Israel 100% in its defense of its citizens,” Trump said on Twitter Sunday. “To the Gazan people — these terrorist acts against Israel will bring you nothing but more misery. END the violence and work towards peace - it can happen!”
TweetTweet
Omar’s criticism of Israel and support of Palestine follows a long history of comments many have characterized as anti-Semitic. After her election in 2018, Omar had a 2012 tweet resurface in which she said Israel had “hypnotized the world.”
[Opinion: Hamas is stuck between ideology and Gaza's people]
Earlier this year, Omar said the American Israel Political Action Committee was bribing members of Congress to be pro-Israel. She later apologized for the comment calling it anti-Semitic.
Tweet
In February, Omar was criticized for playing on the anti-Semitic trope of dual-loyalty of Jewish Americans in a discussion of progressive issues at a panel event discussion.
"I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country. I want to ask why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the NRA, of fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policies?" Omar said at a Busboys & Poets town hall. Omar refused to apologize for the comments, doubling down a few days later.
“I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee,” Omar said on Twitter. “I am told everyday that I am anti-American if I am not pro-Israel. I find that to be problematic and I am not alone. I just happen to be willing to speak up on it and open myself to attacks.”
Omar has continued rhetoric Jewish leaders have called anti-Semitic since her initial apology, refusing to back down even as her own Democratic leadership has denounced her comments.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., a close ally of Omar’s in Congress, went after the New York Times Sunday accusing them of “dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free.”

The imperative of taking a stand against hatred

Texto completo: Over the years, non-Jews have occasionally come to me asking about converting to Judaism. This leads to a series of conversations, in which, among other things, I ask people why they would voluntarily want to become part of what has been the most despised people on the face of the planet.
I have explained that feeling the sting of anti-Semitism is not an “if” but a “when” and “in what form,” and I’m sure some have believed that I was hypersensitive. I follow that statement with a reminder that for people of a certain age, deciding to convert might also impact their children who had no choice in the matter.
Up until very recently, I have been able to say that the era of violent, physical anti-Semitism seems to be a thing of the past, but that they would still hear insensitive comments about “jewing someone down” to get a better price or having a Jewish child told by a Christian “friend” that he is going to hell because he hasn’t accepted Jesus. How painful these comments can be, and how incredibly naive I was to believe that this would be the worst of it.
This was all before chants of “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville, Virginia. This was before the Oct. 27 massacre at Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh, and before the fatal shooting at the Chabad of Poway in San Diego County, California, on April 27 — exactly six months later, on the last day of Passover.
This was before we again heard the canard about Jews and money, and had our loyalties to the United States questioned. This was before a cartoon appeared in the international edition of The New York Times depicting President Donald Trump holding the leash of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, caricatured as a dog with a Star of David around his neck.
This was before I had to figure out how to explain to children that, yes, some people want to kill us, not halfway around the world three lifetimes ago, but in our own country today.
This is my story, the story I deal with every day, but it is only part of the story. I can’t live in a world in which I let attacks on me shut out the culture of hatred that has been unleashed in this country and around the world against many of those who are othered in any variety of ways. Racism, Islamophobia, vicious anti-multiculturalism and hatred of those in the LGBTQ community rarely even make the front pages anymore unless the body count reaches a threshold like that seen in the massacres in New Zealand and Sri Lanka.
Abraham Joshua Heschel, a 20th-century rabbi, author and activist, observed that, “Morally speaking, there is no limit to the concern one must feel for the suffering of human beings, that indifference to evil is worse than evil itself, that in a free society, some are guilty, but all are responsible.”
Yes, in sharing this quote, I’m calling you out. I’m calling out all of the decent people who would rather tut-tut in response to hatred than take a stand. We can’t accept a childlike whine of “but I didn’t do anything.” We are all responsible.
As theologian and anti-Nazi dissident Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, “Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.”
Bonhoeffer paid for that attitude with his life at the hands of the Nazis. This is a time to do more than speak. This is the time to shout. And this is the time to show up.
The Hebrew word, “Hineini,” appears only 14 times in the Hebrew Bible, most often, but not exclusively, as a response to a call from God. It means “Here I am,” but it is not about longitude and latitude. It is about presence. It’s about saying, “I’m ready to do what’s needed.” It’s about saying, “I stand with you.” Sometimes that simple act, the act of just showing up, is an act of heroism.
Now there is a choice to make. Please, don’t tell me how sorry you are unless you are ready to stand with me. I am forever grateful to all of those in the Lancaster County community who showed up in our synagogues after Pittsburgh and who reached out after Poway. I am honored to partner with Christians and Muslims in the Lancaster Interfaith Coalition and in other interfaith efforts, people who understand that friendship is about more than words. I can only hope that my efforts in return have been worthy of the support I have received.
In Lancaster and beyond, in word and in deed, in response to anti-Semitism and to other forms of hatred, we must say together, “Never again.”

Texto completo: BOSTON - The new face of the NBA is so refreshing, so different, that he's impossible not to like.
Basketball's newest star never played AAU, didn't have his hand out on the recruiting trail or pretend to care about freshman English like all those One-and-Dones.
Meet Giannis Antetokounmpo, the 6-foot-11, do-it-all big man born in Athens, Greece, to Nigerian parents. Six years ago he stopped hawking watches and sunglasses to tourists gawking at the Acropolis and got his feet wet in pro basketball in a second-tier league in Greece.
When the Milwaukee Bucks used the 15th pick of the 2013 NBA draft to select Antetokounmpo, the basketball world yawned. Heck, no one could even pronounce his name.
Fast forward to 2019 and everyone knows his name now. You can call him Giannis (Yahn-is) or the tired and trite Greek Freak. At 24 years old, it's already clear that the successor to LeBron James and Kevin Durant atop the basketball world is a kid from Greece who didn't know what a basketball looked like for the first 12 years of his life.
Anyone doubting this fact can ask Coach Brad Stevens and the Boston Celtics. A year ago the Celts needed seven games to squeeze past Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in a first-round playoff series.
Well, now the Bucks are a year older, much improved and have grabbed the Celtics by the collar and pushed them up against a wall. After ripping the Celtics by 21 points in Game 2, the Bucks gained control of the series with a 123-116 win in Boston on Friday night. Up 2-1, Milwaukee can all but bury the Celtics in Game 4 on Monday night.
This is a perplexing predicament for the Celtics and their fans. For much of the last decade, the NBA's winningest franchise has fielded strong teams but never could get past the dominance of LeBron James. In 2011 and 2012, the latter stages of the Paul Pierce-Kevin Garnett-Rajon Rondo teams were sent packing by James and the Miami Heat.
Once the Celtics transitioned to a new era and Stevens came on the scene, James had returned to Cleveland. He and Kyrie Irving knocked the Celtics out in 2015 and 2017, and James outlasted the Celts one more time in last season's Eastern finals.
Now LeBron is stuck in Nowhere's Land in Los Angeles but the Celtics have a new problem and it's spelled Antetokounmpo. Stevens may have Kyrie and a deeper, more talented roster, but he doesn't have the best player. And the value of running with the top player in an NBA playoff series is unequaled.
Friday night, Antetokounmpo used his unparalleled combination of talents to continually drive by his defender, sashay into the lane and attack the basket like some overgrown 14-year-old dominating a youth league. Giannis paraded to the foul stripe, sinking 16-of-22 tries, and finishing with 32 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists.
The Freak is just that, a physical freak unlike anything the NBA has seen. He's the rare talent who at 6-11 can take one dribble and glide from the 3-point line to the basket. If the Celtics achieve their goal of building a defensive wall to slow him, he'll happily skip a pass to open shooters like Khris Middleton and move on to the next play.
So there you have it. The newest star in the NBA, the likely Most Valuable Player, is in the midst of a playoff battle and talking pass-first. Maybe that's what happens when you don't grow up matching moves on inner-city playgrounds or fantasize about being the next Larry Bird or Steph Curry.
Instead we have a kid from inner-city Athens who came of age fearing attacks from racist militants and deportation to Nigeria even though Greece was the only home he ever knew. In a New York Times profile of Antetokounmpo, the coach who discovered him on an Athens playground, Spiros Velliniatis, said he stopped in his tracks the first time he laid eyes on the tall, skinny 13-year-old.
"It was like something stopped me from the sky. The moment I saw him, lightning struck me," he said.

Texto completo: Picked-up pieces while wondering whether freedom fighter Bob Kraft will make another triumphant, crowd-rousing appearance at a Garden playoff game any time soon . . .
■ The death of John Havlicek inspired some amazing commentary on Twitter.
“It is getting difficult each time I hear about another contemporary that passes," Bill Russell wrote. “He was not just a teammate & a great guy, but he was family."
From Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: “I met John Havlicek at the same time & place that I met Red Auerbach and Bill Russell @ my high school gym in Autumn of 1961 — my freshman year. He was still playing when I entered the league and our friendship grew."
From Jack Nicklaus, who crossed paths with Havlicek at Ohio State from 1959-61, on Facebook: “John loved the outdoors, loved to fish, and frequently when he played golf at Bear Lakes Country Club in West Palm Beach, he carried a fishing pole in his bag. But if there is one thing we should all remember about John Havlicek, it is his heart. John always made himself available to help others. Every time there was a charity event, or any time someone could make a difference in someone else's life, John Havlicek was there."
Paul Pierce wrote about accepting the 2008 NBA championship hardware from Havlicek: “Will never forget you handing me that championship trophy and how emotional I was."
In an e-mail, former major league pitcher Jim Kaat wrote, “I was always flattered when people would pass me on the street and say, 'That's John Havlicek.' Hondo and I had a good laugh about that when we would meet.
“My favorite memory was when we were competing in a made-for-TV event for retired athletes. John and I were running the 100-yard dash against Drew Pearson and Alexis Arguello. We were so far behind we were carrying on a conversation with one another.
“What an all-around player and great all-around man."
Auerbach never saw Havlicek play at Ohio State, but according to Sports Museum curator Richard Johnson, Havlicek was selected by Auerbach “on the recommendation of sportscaster and college basketball player Curt Gowdy."
Havlicek was a three-sport star at Bridgeport (Ohio) High, where one of his basketball teammates was future baseball Hall of Famer Phil Niekro.
Finally, it you look closely at the Walter Iooss photo of “Havlicek Steals The Ball" that ran on the front page of the Globe the day after Hondo died, you can see the “Coming Events" sign on the old Garden's second balcony, and it includes 1965 Finals dates for Celtics vs. Lakers and a pitch for “Clay vs. Liston May 25."
That was the second Cassius Clay-Sonny Liston bout, which was eventually moved to Lewiston, Maine, after Clay (Muhammad Ali) suffered a hernia in the days before the fight was scheduled to be held in Boston.
■ Some of the Red Sox are scheduled to visit with President Trump Thursday at the White House. Manager Alex Cora has yet to say whether he'll go. I'm betting no.
Regarding attendance, nothing has changed since the Globe polled players during spring training. With the exception of Sandy Leon (Venezuelan) and J.D. Martinez (Cuban heritage, born and raised in southern Florida), all the players who have committed to going are white and all the players who have said they are not going are persons of color.
This would not seem to be a team bonding experience. Red Sox owners John Henry and Tom Werner said they are going.
■ It's downright hideous that the Patriots Hall of Fame committee annually produces a “final three" ballot without the name of Bill Parcells.
■ Very cool that the Mets' Noah Syndergaard hit a homer in his 1-0 win over the Reds Thursday. Providing the only run in his shutout win, Syndergaard joined the likes of Bob Welch, Juan Pizarro, Jim Bunning, Early Wynn, Spud Chandler, and Red Ruffing.
More impressive was Red Sox starter Earl Wilson hitting a homer in his 2-0 no-hitter against the Angels at Fenway in 1962.
■ Can everyone stop crying about NBA officiating? If the other team is taking more free throws than your team, it probably means the other team is working harder than your team. It does not mean the officials are out to get your team.
■ The James Harden-Scott Foster feud reminds me of Orioles manager Earl Weaver vs. umpire Ron Luciano in the 1970s.
Luciano regularly ejected Weaver, and the American League took him off Orioles games for a couple of seasons. When Luciano returned to work an Orioles game in Chicago in 1979, Weaver was ejected in Game 1 of a doubleheader, then announced he was protesting Game 2 because of the “integrity of the umpire."
Weaver was suspended three games by American League president Lee MacPhail.
■ Maybe Kraft can claim he was duped again. Like when he ran up the white flag in Deflategate or when he gave Aaron Hernandez the big contract.
■ According to the Patriots media cartel, they just had the best draft day since Auerbach came away with Hall of Famers Russell, Tommy Heinsohn, and K.C. Jones in 1956.
■ Speaking of good drafts, Theo Epstein gets too much credit most of the time, but still doesn't get enough credit for his last Red Sox draft in 2011. That was the year Theo and the minions got Mookie Betts, Jackie Bradley Jr., Matt Barnes, Blake Swihart, and Travis Shaw. Among current Sox, Theo also gets credit for Xander Bogaerts, Dustin Pedroia, Christian Vazquez, and Brandon Workman.
■ Speaking of JBJ, what does a guy have to do to drop out of the Sox lineup? Going into Friday night, Bradley was at .149 with an on-base percentage of .236 when the Sox mercifully inserted Tzu-Wei Lin — who is not an outfielder by trade — into the lineup in center.
Bradley, who banged into the center field fence twice Thursday night, had zero homers, 10 walks, and 32 strikeouts to that point. Where are Chris Young and Darnell McDonald when you need them? It was Lin's seventh career game in the outfield, his second start.
The Sox simply don't have anybody else and they don't want to use Martinez in the outfield regularly. So JBJ plays. Virtually every day. Regardless of his numbers. Bradley is a career .234 hitter. He'll be 30 next season.
■ QUIZ: What two National League teams have never had an MVP? (Answer below.)
■ Holy Cross is searching for a new athletic director.
■ There's a giant spoked “B" on the carpet in the middle of the Bruins dressing room, and the rug is guarded religiously by team staff to keep media nitwits from accidentally stepping on it when walking across the room. (Why not put the “B" on the ceiling, instead of the floor, some might ask?)
So why was MMA fighter Conor McGregor not shooed off the B when he gave his pep talk to the Bruins before a late-season game at the Garden? Check the video. McGregor walked all over the sacred spot.
■ Underrated spring baseball book is “Inside the Empire," a deep dive on the inner workings of today's Yankees by Bob Klapisch and Paul Solotaroff. You also want to check out “Son of Havana," by Luis Tiant with Saul Wisnia.
■ In March, the New York Times wrote a lengthy story on the Kraft family's Revolution ownership. The article noted that the Krafts spent $20 million to buy an e-sports team in 2018, adding, “The sardonic joke among some Revolution supporters is that now they're not even the neglected second child, but something even worse: the ignored middle child."
According to the Times, Bob and Jonathan Kraft declined to be interviewed for the story.
■ Folks in the athletic department at Boston College do not like 98.5 The Sports Hub.
■ The Joe Andruzzi Foundation raised more than $185,000 on Marathon Day this year. Jen Andruzzi, Joe's wife, ran in the race. The JAF has raised more than $6 million for families affected by cancer.
■ Quiz answer: Mets and Diamondbacks.

Texto completo: "Hello guys, I just finished high school," the fresh-faced, bubbly young woman tells the camera. "This year I'm admitted to Stanford."
For more than 90 minutes, she offers a mix of inspiration and advice, mostly in her native Chinese, occasionally breaking into British-inflected English and often rocking closer to the lens as if she's sharing a long talk with a good friend. Excerpts of her video popped up throughout the social media world Friday, identifying her as the daughter of a prominent Chinese family that paid $6.5 million to the mastermind of the national college admissions scandal to get the young woman into Stanford.
Among the advice she shares on how you too can get into an elite American college: "Try hard."
"I'm very lucky I would like to say," the young woman identified as Yusi Zhao says on the video, apparently made a couple of years ago. "I'd like to thank everyone that's helped me and all of that. I just felt like you can always achieve the things that you want to be if you try hard."
Yusi Zhao comments stand in contrast to the younger daughter of actress Lori Loughlin and designer Mossimo Giannulli who have pleaded innocent to charges of paying Singer to slip their girls into USC as phony rowers. Olivia Jade Giannulli in a posted video says she "doesn't really care about school" other than the "partying."
The video surfaced late Thursday with a New York Times story about Yusi Zhao, whose father is Zhao Tao, chairman of Buchang Pharmaceuticals. The company specializes in the development, production and sale of patent medicines and boasts of being among the country's top pharmaceutical enterprises. The company had no immediate response Friday.
According to Forbes, Zhao Tao earned a master's degree in business at Fordham University in New York City and is worth $1.8 billion today. His company specializes in traditional medicine to fight heart disease.
A lawyer representing the young woman's mother, Vincent Law, told the New York Times that the family gave $6.5 million to the college admissions scandal's mastermind, William "Rick" Singer, believing it was a legitimate donation to Stanford. Earlier this week, Stanford said it did not receive a contribution that large tied to Singer. Law, whose office is listed in Shanghai with the state bar association, could not be reached for comment.
The lawyer released a statement from the mother stating that "this generous act was not only done for the good of the school and its students, but also done out of the love and support of Yusi by a caring mother," the New York Times reported.
Stanford has said it expelled one student linked to contributions through Singer after concluding that the student's application contained false information. Citing federal student privacy law, the university would not say whether that student was Zhao, who is not currently listed as a student.
Federal prosecutors in March charged Singer and 49 others, including 33 American parents from coast to coast, in a wide-ranging scheme of taking payments from wealthy families to pay for cheating on entrance exams and bribing college coaches to get their kids into elite universities.
Zhao and her parents have not been charged and are not named in the affidavits and charging documents. The U.S. Attorney's office in Boston, which is prosecuting the case, would not comment on their reported gift and involvement.
Singer, who ran a Newport Beach college admissions consulting firm, has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges and cooperated with investigators in the ongoing investigation. Stanford's head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, also has pleaded guilty, as have coaches from Yale and the University of Texas and a hired test cheater.
Parents charged in the case include two Hollywood actresses and Silicon Valley business executives. Fourteen of the 33 charged parents have pleaded or agreed to plead guilty in agreements to cooperate in the ongoing investigation. No students whose parents are implicated in the case have been charged. Many apparently were unaware of their parents' alleged scheming and payments on their behalf, while others participated in the effort.
Vandemoer worked with Singer to accept payments to his sailing program in exchange for reserving student athlete recruitment slots open for Singer's rich clients.
Stanford has said it received a total of $770,000 in contributions through Singer to its sailing program on behalf of three students. Two were applicants Vandemoer recommended as student sailing recruits who declined to enroll. An additional $500,000 came in on behalf of a third student who had been admitted months earlier, though not as a student sailor, and that the student was expelled after the university found falsified information in the application.
Stanford this week said it was unaware of any $6.5 million payment on behalf of a student and insisted it has not received more than the $770,000 it has said was received through Singer. The university would not say whether some of that money could have come from the reported $6.5 million payment to Singer.
The Zhaos are the second Chinese family said to have given seven-figure payments to Singer far more than his American clients to secure college admission for their children. Another family reportedly paid Singer $1.2 million after their daughter, Sherry Guo, was admitted to Yale. The university rescinded admission for a student connected to Singer whom Yale wouldn't name.
Guo's lawyer told the Los Angeles Times that Singer preyed on foreign families and that, like the Zhaos, her parents believed they were making charitable donations. She and her family haven't been charged.
By contrast, a Hillsborough couple pleaded guilty this week to paying Singer $600,000, much of it in Facebook stock, for his help getting their daughters into USC and UCLA as rowing recruits. Actress Felicity Huffman has agreed to plead guilty to charges of paying $15,000 for test cheating on behalf of a daughter.
The New York Times sent reporters to the Zhao family mansion outside Beijing, where Ferrari, Tesla and Bentley automobiles were parked outside. The Times said the family in a 2015 profile stressed to a Chinese magazine their belief in their children succeeding on their own merits.
"I really look down on those kids who don't rely on their own abilities," Zhao Tao said in the article, according to the Times. In the video said to be his daughter, she implores others to believe they can succeed on their own.
"I just want to encourage everyone and I want everyone to believe in yourself that you can do it," she says. "Everyone, you can do it."

Texto completo: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren warned about the financial crisis of the 2000s before it happened, she claimed during a CNN town hall where she pitched herself as the best option for president in the 2020 election.
“And starting in the early 2000s, the crisis was coming,” Warren said April 22 in Manchester, N.H.
We confirmed that Warren did raise the alarm about the looming housing and financial crisis. She spoke about debt, financial lending practices and other factors affecting families and the economy years before the financial crisis peaked in 2008.
Sounding the alarm when Warren was a Harvard professor
Millions of people lost their jobs and homes during the recent Great Recession, generally regarded as happening from late 2007 to mid 2009. Experts say the financial crisis resulted from a number of colliding factors, including an unsustainable housing boom partly driven by an easy availability of mortgages, banks taking on too much risk, government policies and lax regulation.
Subprime loans — loans at higher interest rates made to people perceived to be at greater risk for defaulting on loans (including families with low and moderate income and poor credit histories) — played a key role in the housing crisis.
Warren’s presidential campaign cited several blog posts and comments to media outlets in 2005 and 2006, and Warren’s 2003 book, “The Two-Income Trap,” co-authored with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, as examples of Warren warning about subprime lending and an imminent housing crisis.
Subprime lenders defended their business practices by saying they were helping more families own homes, Warren’s book said, but that’s “little more than public relations hot air.”
“In the overwhelming majority of cases, subprime lenders prey on families that already own their own homes, rather than expanding access to new homeowners,” Warren said in the book. “For these families, subprime lending does nothing more than increase the family’s housing costs, taking resources away from other investments and increasing the chances that the family will lose its home if anything goes wrong.”
Warren’s campaign noted that The New York Times quoted Warren in an October 2005 article that said homeowners in suburbs were taking on more and more home-equity debt to stay out of bankruptcy.
The article said: “Professor Warren of Harvard believes that disaster lurks as homeowners borrow against their homes to forestall bankruptcy. When the stock market tumbled five years ago, people in trouble could sell stocks to stay afloat, she said. But home equity doesn’t work the same way. As she put it, ‘You can’t sell a part of your home like you could a stock in the stock market bubble.’”
Warren was “substantially correct” in her assessment that home prices were going up rapidly relative to incomes (particularly for households with a one wage earner), said Ed Pinto, co-director of the Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
Consumer advocate groups credit Warren for alerting about the crisis
Warren was also a vocal opponent of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, because she thought the law would hurt consumers, said Deborah Goldstein, an executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, which advocates for consumer financial protections.
Rising credit card debt hurt Americans already struggling with mortgage payments.
“I remember (Warren) talking about credit card abuses and how they were harming families,” Goldstein said. “People were using credit to manage basic daily expenses.”
Goldstein said that her group, also concerned about the imminent financial crisis, in the early 2000s communicated with Warren on what could be done about it.
“I’d give then-professor Warren the credit for banging the drum and ringing the bell early on unfair financial practices,” said Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of the Federal Consumer Program at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Warren was the “No. 1 go-to academic expert” in the mid-to-late ‘90s and 2000s in the debate over changes to the bankruptcy code, he said.
Our ruling
Speaking of the financial crisis that gained traction in 2007, Warren said, “I talked about it to anyone who would listen, a crisis is coming.”
There is documented evidence that Warren spoke against risky mortgage lending practices, rising debt and other factors that contributed to the financial and housing crisis years before it materialized.
We rate Warren’s claim True.

Texto completo: CAMDEN – Key South Jersey Democrats blasted Gov. Phil Murphy Thursday in a deepening dispute over a state program that's provided some $1.6 billion in tax breaks to city businesses.
The local Democrats, including Camden County's top freeholder and Camden's mayor, said they were "deeply appalled" by the Murphy administration's "relentless, unfounded and disingenuous attacks" on many of the city's largest employers.
The broadside, which described Murphy as a hypocrite and compared him to President Donald Trump, came one day after the governor said he was "deeply troubled" by two media reports on state tax breaks for Camden businesses.
The governor asserted the stories showed the need for "a total revamp of the tax incentive program."
But a subject of both stories, Democratic powerbroker George Norcross III, suggested the publicity was a positive.
Norcross said a joint story by WNYC and ProPublica — headlined "How Companies and Allies of One Powerful Democrat Got $1.1 Billion in Tax Breaks" — showed "all of the hard work that went into getting the city on its current path forward."
"I join with other Camden leaders to thank WNYC Radio for its lengthy story detailing the massive undertaking to help rebuild Camden's future," Norcross, the chairman of Cooper University Health Care, said in a statement.
In Murphy's view, that story and a separate New York Times article reinforced his desire to see results from a task force reviewing the Economic Development Authority's incentive programs.
The task force, assailed by the South Jersey Democrats as "blatantly political leaning," held a public hearing Thursday.
It was formed in January after the state Comptroller's Office released an audit critical of the EDA's programs, which were revised in 2013 to steer more money to Camden.
"Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for," the governor said in a statement Wednsday.
"If there was fraud in this program, I expect the task force will uncover it and those individuals will be held accountable," he said.
Advocates say the generous tax breaks to Camden firms — worth about $1.6 billion in all — have attracted economic development that would otherwise have bypassed the city.
"I will stand on top of that dirt pile over there and yell it from the top of my lungs," Mayor Frank Moran said Monday at a ground-breaking in East Camden.
The ceremony was held by ResinTech Inc., a Berlin Township firm that makes water treatment products. It's relocating to a 27-acre tract between River Road and Federal Street with support from nearly $140 million in EDA incentives.
In Thursday's statement, the local Democrats said Murphy's "invective has been particularly targeted at Camden companies" and not at North Jersey firms that also received tax breaks.
"Perhaps in the age of Donald Trump, the governor has learned all the wrong lessons of leadership and adherence to the truth," said the statement from Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli Jr., Mayor Frank Moran, Assemblywoman Nilsa Cruz Perez and Camden Council President Curtis Jenkins.
It said Murphy "was fully prepared to give away $5 billion to the planet's richest company, Amazon, but has feverishly insinuated without proof that irregularities exist for tax programs that would help Camden."
It claimed Murphy's actions have caused "a chilling effect" on Camden's business community in Camden and have raised "legitimate questions" regarding the governor's intent to honor agreements between companies and the EDA.
"It has occurred to us that the governor may be holding Camden, and the business community, hostage to get his massive tax increases through the legislature," the statement added.
The WNYC/ProPublica story detailed how almost two-thirds of Camden's incentives went to companies with ties to Norcross and to his allies in business and politics.
It noted his brother, Rep. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, had co-sponsored a law revising the EDA's Grow New Jersey program in 2013, when the congressman was a state senator.
And it said a law firm run by a third brother, Philip Norcross, collected lucrative fees from firms that received tax credits.
The New York Times story also mentioned the Norcross brothers, but focused primarily on Kevin Sheehan, a real estate attorney who represented several firms that received tax breaks.
According to the Times account, Sheehan added language to the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013 to aid Camden firms.
It contends Sheehan's efforts yielded tax breaks worth $260 milllion for Holtec International, which built a technology campus in the port district, and $118 million for the Subaru of America's headquarters in the Gateway area.
The Times noted Holtec's tax break, the largest for any Camden firm, is estimated to have a net benefit to the state of just $155,520 over 35 years.
When Holtec was awarded the tax breaks in July 2014, a Courier-Post story noted a critic's assessment that the project would support 160 jobs already in New Jersey and 235 new position at a "sky-high" cost to taxpayers of $658,228 per job.
Sheehan could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
His firm, Parker McCay of Mount Laurel, released a statement to the Times saying it "was asked by policymakers, including those in the Legislature, to review this legislation and offer input and suggestions on ways it could be strengthened."
Philip Norcross is Parker McCay's CEO.
In commenting on the WNYC/ProPublica article, George Norcross noted "much of the story has previously been reported by other outlets."
He offered an upbeat assessment of several points made in the story.
The WNYC/ProPublica story, for instance, noted Camden "reaped more than four times as many tax breaks as the combined amounts of other cities designated as 'growth zones.'"
In Norcross' view, that showed "an unprecedented partnership between residents, government, business and community leaders."
And while the story described Camden's crime rate as "the second highest in New Jersey," Norcross noted it was down almost 59 percent since 2012.
Norcross also described efforts to craft the 2013 law to help Camden as "legislative back and forth."
"The fact that private investment is returning to Camden is no accident — it was planned and fought for," he said.

Texto completo: Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, launched a blistering verbal assault on the Trump Justice Department Friday, saying that it has been corrupted by the “moral dead zone” of the White House.
“You enter that dead zone and you end up with an attorney general who can’t even tell me that telling the White House counsel to lie is not okay,” Hirono said in an appearance on MSNBC. “He can’t answer that.”
Hirono generated one of the more dramatic moments of Attorney General William Barr’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday when she ripped Barr for his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.
"Mr. Barr, now the American people know that you're no different than Rudy Giuliani or Kellyanne Conway or any of the other people who sacrificed their once-decent reputation for the grifter and liar who sits in the Oval Office," she said during the hearing.
She was cut off by Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-SC., who accused her of "slandering" Barr.
Tweet
Hirono’s comments Friday were in reference to a revelation in Mueller’s report that President Trump had directed White House counsel Don McGahn to lie to federal investigators, an instruction McGahn ignored.
It was one of 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice identified in the Mueller report, in which Trump made veiled threats, complained about press coverage of the investigation, and talked about either ending the investigation or pressuring aides to make his biggest political problem go away.
Democrats have seized on these moments as examples of obstruction of justice and have criticized Barr for determining no such obstruction occurred.
“So this is the president, once again, doing the two things that he cares about most: protecting himself, and money,” Hirono said.
The senator’s comments echoed a recent op-ed in the New York Times by former FBI Director James Comey, who wrote Trump’s selfishness was “eating the souls” of otherwise good officials, such as Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
“I agree with that,” Hirono said. “Anybody who disagrees with the president is out the door. All of the people around him can’t make decisions based on a moral compass because there is none. It’s all about protecting himself.”

Avenging reality

Texto completo: The $1.2 billion, record-breaking opening weekend for "Avengers: Endgame" last week was cause for much rejoicing in Hollywood. Variety reported that the movie, which made $350 million of that sum in North America alone and nearly as much in China, “is providing a badly needed jolt to the North American box office, which for 2019 was down 16.7% to $2.94 billion as of April 24. As of Sunday, the gap had dropped to 13.3%, according to Comscore.” Money-watchers say "Endgame" seems certain to top "Titanic" as the second-highest grossing movie ever, and it may have a shot at beating out the $2.8 billion "Avatar" raked in for the top slot.
For those whose interest in movies is aesthetic rather than financial, however, there may be less reason to celebrate. "Endgame" has already joined five other "Avengers" movies among the top-20 highest grossers of all time, according to Box Office Mojo. But wherever it finishes on that chart, it will be among 15 straightforward fantasy flicks on that top-20 list, and that’s giving the benefit of the doubt to the other five — two from the "Fast and Furious" and two from the "Jurassic Park" franchises, plus "Titanic" — all of which have strongly fantastical or cartoonish elements to them as well.
Filmgoers’ seemingly insatiable appetite for fantasy is nothing to cheer.
One of the greatest works of scholarship of the 20th century, Erich Auerbach’s Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, first published in German in 1946 and in English translation in 1953, demonstrated how the mimetic principle, what Shakespeare described as “hold[ing] the mirror up to nature,” was at the very foundation of Western art and literature from Homer to Virginia Woolf. But Auerbach’s book came at the end of that long tradition and, as we can now see, at the beginning of one which has superseded it. Namely, a new fashion for overproduced versions of the fantasy and science fiction that were formerly the province of children’s books and movies.
[Related: 'Avengers: Endgame' — a goodbye like no other]
To be clear, the problem is not inherent in the format, but rather what overwhelming demand for it indicates. Here’s how it works: Marvel Comics owns the copyright to its version of reality, which makes that version much, much more valuable, at least to Marvel and those in collaboration with it, than reality itself. On that, of course, there can be no copyright, since it belongs, or used to belong, to everybody. So we can, like those millions who are flocking to "Endgame," pay up for access to this more exciting version of reality and even proceed to live in it or we can go away and invent our own reality. What we cannot do anymore, it seems to me, is sell the public a representation of reality itself, reality that’s real for everybody and not just mine or yours.
Which makes sense when you realize that there is no longer broad agreement on what that reality is. We’ve become so accustomed to the idea of proprietorial reality that we’ve started treating it as some kind of human right. I, you, he, she, and ze all have a right, not just to their own reality but to have it respected by others, just as all have a right, in a not unrelated development, to their own favored pronouns. The latter right is now enshrined in Canadian law.
A few years ago, Rachel Dolezal, then the president of the NAACP in Spokane, Wash., claimed the right to be considered black because she “identified” as black, even though she was born to two white parents of European descent. We’re likely to see a lot more Dolezals in the age of social media, the great appeal of which to many appears to be the chance to create a private reality online as the face they present to the world. Government enforcement of ever-stricter privacy regulations can only make this tendency more pronounced. In Europe and Argentina, and no doubt coming soon to a country near you, there is already a “right to be forgotten” online, which means a right to be known for only what we want to be known for.
[Opinion: Marvel’s gay moment shows the problem with virtue signaling]
Nor is social media alone in honoring claims to proprietorial reality. The media as they used to exist, before Facebook et al., have in the past three years gone the same way, exchanging news for narrative. And what is narrative but fabricated and overproduced reality? We don’t mind this when the fabrication is in a movie or a novel — something avowedly fictional but in the service, presumably, of some higher truth. But the fabricated media narratives of today claim to be real, and they are only in the service of the media’s political purposes.
For although the storied names of the New York Times and the Washington Post are now indistinguishable from that of any pajama-clad blogger making claims to his own reality, the former rely on their legacy of prestige to deny, at will, the same right to others. They are frantic with annoyance at what they call the “lies” of President Trump — the Post is now preposterously purporting to have catalogued 10,000 of them — while taking a mostly relaxed view of such demonstrable lies such as the president calling neo-Nazis “fine people” or that the Trump tax cuts went only to the rich.
These are just two examples from the first two days of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign of his own private reality. The Washington Post, to its credit, gave four Pinocchios to the latter to set against the thousands it has given Trump. But the balance of media attention remains overwhelmingly on anything it can represent as mendacity by Trump and rarely if ever on the media's own falsehoods, or those of their favorite Democrats.
These are most often of the type which moralists call suppressio veri, but the Post’s outrageous suggestio falsi last week that Attorney General William Barr lied in his summary of the Mueller report was obviously made in the confidence that the paper’s readers would never see it fact-checked. The media not only have a right to their own reality but also a right to ignore or discredit anyone who might dare to question its correspondence to the real thing.
[Also read: Bernie Sanders wants to snap Disney’s 'Avengers' profits]
Likewise, when the FBI, in collaboration with Fusion GPS and the Hillary Clinton campaign, fabricated a narrative, told at first only to a compliant Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, of Donald Trump’s “collusion” with Russian spies to steal the 2016 election, it inspired the dominant media narrative of the past two years and was rarely if ever questioned. Commentators and politicians of the Left have continued to treat the Mueller report and its aftermath as if it had pronounced Trump as guilty as they have always known and will continue to believe he is. Some even say Mueller doesn’t believe his own conclusions. A law professor at Fordham University claimed in the New York Times that the Mueller report did prove that there had been criminal collusion, in spite of what Mueller himself said explicitly to the contrary. It just goes to show you that, in our era of privatized reality, anything can be asserted as truth with the help of sufficiently ingenious legal reasoning.
We may see the same process at work elsewhere in today’s media, much of which no longer even pretends to represent objective reality but has instead reverted to the open partisanship, along with the partisan rancor, familiar from the early days of the republic. Then the rival realities were based on regional identification; now the identification and therefore the realities are racial, ethnic, or sexual, or as much so as Democrats can make them. The result for our country appears to be endless and evermore rancorous contention.
Families, friendships, and marriages have already been sundered or become embittered over the divergence between national and ideological loyalties that began long before Trump’s election. Moreover, shots have already been fired in this culture war, most recently by a spate of sad, little fantasists of social media, most of them barely if at all out of childhood, who have shot up schools or places of worship, ostensibly in the service of some more or less self-manufactured and incoherent ideology but really, I believe, because they see themselves and want the world to see them as a kind of real-life superhero or supervillain. The one is as good as, or perhaps better than, the other. Just count the number of Darth Vaders, as opposed to Luke Skywalkers, who come to your door next Halloween.
The vogue for fantasy movies is not responsible for such incidents or even for the lamentable state of our cultural affairs that has given rise to them, but I do think these things spring from the same impulse, which is the land rush to claim a small plot of reality as one’s own, which ensued upon the breakdown of a hard-won national consensus in the 1960s.
Fantasy, not the film genre but the insistence on living inside one’s own manufactured reality, is something out of which nature intended us to grow, such as our baby teeth. As St. Paul so memorably put it in I Corinthians 13:11: “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.” It is the ultimate fantasy that we can live our lives, or at any rate live them in peace and contentment with each other, without ever having to share a common reality.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - When the rapper and entrepreneur Nipsey Hussle was shot to death in March outside his clothing store near Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles, the world lost a Grammy Award-nominated artist and his community lost an activist and mentor. "He was South Central's superhero," said artist Lauren Halsey, a 31-year-old native of South Los Angeles who knew and admired the musician, born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, two years her senior.
At Frieze New York near the north entrance to the art fair opening Thursday, Halsey is presenting "Prototype Column for tha Shaw (RIP the Honorable Ermias Nipsey Hussle Asghedom) I & II" - two monumental, columns 12 feet high and 2 feet in diameter with hieroglyphic carvings referencing the rapper's lyrics and world in the neighborhood now known as South Los Angeles. Halsey's project was selected from well over 100 international applications for the 2019 Frieze Artist Award, a commission for emerging artists supported by the Luma Foundation.
"Prototype is not a word she's using lightly," said Courtney J. Martin, curator of the project and one of the selecting jurors who was recently named director of the Yale Center for British Art. "There are people in her community who stand up for things that she sees as models for how things should work."
The columns are also prototypes for elements of an ambitious public project Halsey intends to build in South Los Angeles as a gathering space and a way to honor her community. She is negotiating with the city of Los Angeles on a proposal that includes plans for a white mausoleum-type structure with seating and planters and covered in her contemporary form of hieroglyphics. She sees it as a living archive of the people, businesses, culture and beauty of her neighborhood, rapidly changing and being erased with gentrification.
"In my dream world, there would be 15 to 20 of these columns - 30 feet tall and 5 to 6 feet in diameter - that would coexist with the permanent structure and that people would move through like a corridor," Halsey said in a telephone interview. She used the Frieze commission as an opportunity to experiment with a new durable industrial plaster that was incredibly difficult to carve into but that forced her to learn new techniques. "I'm really happy with the results," she said, "and now that I have the prototypes, I can share this with more fabricators around the country."
Halsey, who studied architecture at her local community college, first envisioned some kind of public project as an art student at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. "I would take the bus down these main boulevards from my grandmother's home to Cal Arts and started thinking deeply about activating these vacant lots because there are so many," she said.
After receiving her MFA from Yale in 2014, Halsey was an artist in residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem. Long interested in Parliament Funkadelic musicians who appropriated Egyptian archetypes into their cosmologies, she was seeing vendors on 125th Street selling scale models of Pharaonic architecture and then visiting the Metropolitan Museum to view actual ruins from ancient Egypt covered with paintings and reliefs.
"I thought I could sample the function of the hieroglyph - the pharaohs' record - and remix it into contemporary neighborhood poetics and news to describe this moment for people," said Halsey, who showed her initial experiments with carving on gypsum panels and painting colorful portraits on columns in 2015 at the Studio Museum.
Last year for the Hammer Museum's biennial "Made in L.A.," the artist made another architectural prototype that was installed on the terrace. Visitors could enter a large-scale open-air pavilion built from carved gypsum panels that echoed both Egyptian and Modernist structures. It was a way for Halsey to think through questions of public access and practicalities of how her future South Los Angeles monument might function outside.
"The hieroglyphic imagery is both uplifting and upsetting and speaks to gun violence, police violence, gentrification, economic insecurity - all things that we're having to address both at a local level in LA and nationally," said Anne Ellegood, a co-curator of the biennial. "Lauren manages to strike a really compelling balance between the fact that communities like hers are being challenged by these societal pressures and yet there's so much positive occurring in those spaces as well." The artist was awarded the $100,000 Mohn Award in conjunction with the museum's biennial.
Halsey will have her first exhibition at the David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles in early 2020. She has asked the dealer to contribute the proceeds from the eventual sale of her Frieze, commission to a workers' center in South Los Angeles. She plans to employ carpenters and apprentices there once she gets the green light from the city for her civic proposal "so it becomes a small alternative development project," she said.
She also intends to throw open the doors of her Los Angeles studio for six months and invite people to carve their own stories on the panels for her architectural structures or drop off images for others to incorporate in designs.
"It will be a collaboration with me and the people within the neighborhood," Halsey said. "We're all authoring narratives around what it means to be alive now."

Texto completo: The novelist Salman Rushdie co-founded the PEN World Voices Festival 15 years ago, when he was president of PEN America, but it has roots in a conference that occurred decades earlier. In 1986, more than 600 prominent writers from around the world, including Rushdie, gathered for a PEN Congress in New York City.
"It was sort of exciting for a young writer to be there amongst all these giants yelling at each other," Rushdie said. "There were lots and lots of really terrible arguments."
Women writers felt underrepresented in the conference's panels. South African writers were upset that a government official who supported apartheid had been invited to speak. It was this sort of cross-cultural dialogue that Rushdie hoped to emulate when he started the PEN World Voices Festival in 2005, in the wake of 9/11 and amid a resurgence in isolationist attitudes.
"We felt that that kind of distance between America and the world was not good for America, and not good for the rest of the world either," Rushdie said.
Since then, the festival has convened hundreds of authors and intellectuals from dozens of countries to sit in conversation with American writers. Every year, the festival -- a week's worth of public events across New York City -- is organized around a theme tied to issues dominating public discourse. After Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election, the following year's events revolved around the subject of gender and power. Last year, following Donald Trump's first year in office, the theme was "resist and reimagine," and panelists discussed how other parts of the world had handled their own political unrest.
Chip Rolley, the festival's director, said his goal was to draw a connection between what we're reading and "the stories in the news, the things we're talking about to our friend over dinner, what we're reading about on the subway station, the things we're tweeting about."
The theme of this year's festival, which kicks off Monday, is "open secrets," with events devoted to exploring the positive and negative effects of the increasingly blurred lines between public and private information.
Some of the events highlight social movements that have emerged anchored by personal testimony. "It Happened to Me" for instance, will bring together seven writers, poets and essayists, including the French memoirist Édouard Louis and the Japanese journalist Shiori Ito, to share personal traumatic experiences. "Siri, Where's My Democracy?" will focus on the decrease of privacy online, with several journalists and a privacy expert discussing foreign intervention in the 2016 presidential election and what it means that our lives can now be monitored online.
"It's not about trying to hammer out an agreement or settle differences necessarily," Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive officer of PEN America, said. "But rather using literature and dialogue as a way to shift perspective, spark new ideas and ways of thinking."
PEN America, founded almost a century ago, is both a literary and an advocacy organization, which means its content is "much edgier" and more political than that of many other literary groups, Nossel said. The organization's international reach also allows the conference to introduce attendees to new writers. Ito's book "Black Box," for instance, has not yet been translated into English.
"It's oxygenating," Nossel said, "to hear these different perspectives and to consider how our country looks from the outside."
The festival starts on Monday, and will close with a keynote lecture by the Indian writer Arundhati Roy at the Apollo Theater on May 12. More than 200 writers will participate, including Marlon James, Jennifer Egan and Masha Gessen.
If in the past PEN World Voices was meant to unify American writers and intellectuals with the rest of the world, it's now also trying to do the same within the United States' borders. This year, for the first time, there will be additional days of programming in Los Angeles -- part of an attempt to nationalize the festival, Nossel said.
"After the 2016 election, there were threats that we were used to combating around the world, but we never thought we would encounter on our own doorstep," she said, adding that it's essential that we "keep the channels of connection and communication, people to people, alive."

Our Picks
Joe Drape's win-place-show picks: Tacitus, Roadster, Improbable
Melissa Hoppert's picks: Improbable, Game Winner, Tacitus
Here's how we see the field:
1. War of Will
Trainer: Mark Casse Jockey: Tyler Gaffalione Odds: 15-1
Drape: This colt's only chance is to gun it from this awful post and take the field gate to wire. Good luck!
Hoppert: A misstep in the Louisiana Derby resulted in a ninth-place finish, and the No. 1 post here will do him no favors.
2. Tax
Trainer: Danny Gargan Jockey: Junior Alvarado Odds: 20-1
Drape: One of the few in here who has never run a bad race. But is his best good enough? Nice odds if you believe so.
Hoppert: The second-place Wood Memorial finisher was claimed by new owners after his second race and has steadily improved. But the Derby is a tough task.
3. By My Standards
Trainer: Bret Calhoun Jockey: Gabriel Saez Odds: 15-1
Drape: This one is going to be bet down because of backstretch buzz. A reminder: He was a 22-1 shot when he won the Louisiana Derby. I'm looking elsewhere.
Hoppert: He has wowed while training at Churchill Downs, earning him the "wiseguy pick" distinction, and is a good choice for exotic bets.
4. Gray Magician
Trainer: Peter Miller Jockey: Drayden Van Dyke Odds: 50-1
Drape: My mother always bet gray horses. This guy will be in my all-gray exacta, trifecta and super boxes along with Tacitus and Roadster.
Hoppert: He flew all the way to Dubai for Derby points, finishing second in the U.A.E. Derby. No thanks.
5. Improbable
Trainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Odds: 5-1
Drape: With Omaha Beach out, this colt may end up the favorite. There is a lot to like here, except the fact that he has not won a race since last year.
Hoppert: He finished second in the Arkansas Derby on a sloppy track. He also has the same connections as the Triple Crown winner Justify, and lately all they do is win, win, win.
6. Vekoma
Trainer: George Weaver Jockey: Javier Castellano Odds: 15-1
Drape: The Blue Grass winner is lightly raced and has won three of his four starts. He is worth a look.
Hoppert: He has talent, but his awkward running style could compromise him in a crowded field.
7. Maximum Security
Trainer: Jason Servis Jockey: Luis Saez Odds: 8-1
Drape: The Florida Derby champ is the only undefeated horse in the field and will go to the front and try to hold on.
Hoppert: This speedy colt's victory in Florida did little to shake his wild-card status.
8. Tacitus
Trainer: Bill Mott Jockey: Jose Ortiz Odds: 8-1
Drape: The Wood Memorial winner is regally bred and has made winning look easy. He is gray. He is your winner.
Hoppert: This striking colt has looked imposing during training, and a win would give his storied trainer his Derby victory at last.
9. Plus Que Parfait
Trainer: Brendan Walsh Jockey: Ricardo Santana Jr. Odds: 30-1
Drape: The name rolls off the tongue and will be a favorite among Francophiles. Not me.
Hoppert: He bested a weak field in the U.A.E. Derby, a race that has never produced a Derby winner.
10. Cutting Humor
Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Corey Lanerie Odds: 30-1
Drape: His Sunland Park Derby victory was a big move forward. He will be there late. He's definitely worth betting across the board.
Hoppert: Sunland Park Derby. Enough said. Pass.
11. Haikal
Trainer: Kiaran McLaughlin Jockey: Rajiv Maragh Odds: 30-1
Drape: This colt will be coming from way, way back and will need some luck negotiating traffic. If he gets it, he could very well be in the mix.
Hoppert: A late-developing foot abscess puts the third-place Wood finisher's start here in jeopardy. He faced an uphill climb, anyway.
12. Omaha Beach (Scratched)
Horses in Posts 13 to 20 will move over one position in the starting gate; program numbers do not change.
13. Code of Honor
Trainer: Shug McGaughey Jockey: John Velazquez Odds: 12-1
Drape: He closed to win the Fountain of Youth but followed that with a so-so third-place finish in the Florida Derby. His trainer won the 2013 Derby with Orb.
Hoppert: Would love to see the longtime trainer McGaughey return to the Derby winner's circle, but I'm not sold that this is the horse to deliver him there.
14. Win Win Win
Trainer: Mike Trombetta Jockey: Julian Pimentel Odds: 12-1
Drape: Great name and solid closer. But it is hard to make a case for the second-place Blue Grass finisher to pass all of these.
Hoppert: Love the hockey connection in that his sire is Hat Trick and his name borrows from the Nashville Predators' anthem. But that's not enough to bet him.
15. Master Fencer
Trainer: Koichi Tsunoda Jockey: Julien Leparoux Odds: 50-1
Drape: This Japanese invader has won twice and finished second in his last two stakes attempts. Your guess is as good as mine.
Hoppert: Hopefully he's better behaved than the last Derby horse from Japan, Lani. If this horse finishes higher than 20th it's a victory.
16. Game Winner
Trainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Joel Rosario Odds: 9-2
Drape: The 2-year-old champion will vie for favoritism after two narrow losses in the Santa Anita Derby and the Rebel. He just might be sitting on a big one.
Hoppert: Some think Baffert likes this horse best. Others say Roadster. But who cares? Play them all.
17. Roadster
Trainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Florent Geroux Odds: 5-1
Drape: This one beat Game Winner in the Santa Anita Derby and is getting better. He is gray. If Tacitus doesn't win, this colt will.
Hoppert: I went back and forth between him, Game Winner and Improbable, and either way Drape will give me grief for picking "chalk." But take this to the bank: A Baffert horse will win.
18. Long Range Toddy
Trainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Jon Court Odds: 30-1
Drape: He beat Game Winner in the Rebel before finishing a well-beaten sixth in the Arkansas Derby on a sloppy track. With rain in the forecast, look elsewhere.
Hoppert: He has talent, but he clearly doesn't like the slop. Pass.
19. Spinoff
Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Manny Franco Odds: 30-1
Drape: The Louisiana Derby runner-up might have been better off waiting for the Ohio Derby.
Hoppert: This late-developing colt needs to take a big step up, and he has the trainer to do so, but it's likely too much to ask.
20. Country House
Trainer: Bill Mott Jockey: Flavien Prat Odds: 30-1
Drape: This will be his third start in six weeks for a Hall of Fame trainer who doesn't show up to this race unless he thinks he has a chance. Lousy outside post, though.
Hoppert: The third-place Arkansas Derby finisher seems to like the slop. But Drape's right: His spot in the starting gate will do him no favors.
21. Bodexpress
Trainer: Gustavo Delgado Jockey: Chris Landeros Odds: 30-1
Drape: This colt drew into the field with the scratch of Omaha Beach. He has yet to win in five starts, and it is highly unlikely that streak will be broken here.
Hoppert: The second-place Florida Derby finisher is in way over his head here.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — While constitutional lawyers, ethicists and theologians — in descending order of importance in the abortion debate — have been arguing in the 46 years since the Supreme Court attempted to settle the debate, some technologists have been making a consequential contribution to it. They have developed machines that produce increasingly vivid sonograms of fetal development. This concreteness partially explains the intensification of the debate.
Six states have passed "heartbeat bills" to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, approximately six weeks after conception. Such bills are, indeed, unconstitutional given the court's Roe ukase that abortion cannot be restricted before a fetus is viable outside the womb — which means, presumably, before the fetus is a child.
But why should "viability" be the dispositive criterion? Viable means capable of surviving outside the womb, which no infant can do without constant help that others must give. Must. No infants are "viable" in that all are helpless, and the law requires that help be given by those responsible for the infant.
A New York Times editorial (Dec. 28, 2018) opposing the idea that "a fetus in the womb has the same rights as a fully formed person" spoke of these living fetuses — that they are living is an elementary biological fact, not an abstruse theological deduction — as "clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings." Now, delete the obfuscating and constitutionally irrelevant adjective "viable," and look at a sonogram of a 10-week fetus. Note the eyes and lips, the moving fingers and, yes, the beating heart. Is this most suitably described as a "cluster of cells" or as a baby? The cluster-of-cells contingent resembles Chico Marx in the movie "Duck Soup": "Who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"
The "heartbeat bills" are wholesome provocations: One of their aims is to provoke thinking about the moral dimension of extinguishing a being with a visibly beating heart. Furthermore, pro-life people are being provoked in different ways.
Last month, Kansas' Supreme Court found in this from the state constitution — "All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" — a reason to overturn the state's ban on D&E (dilation-and-evacuation) abortions that involve dismemberment of the living fetus. In February, after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order to enforce taxpayer-funded abortions, Democratic legislators decided that not even that was enough. They introduced a bill to create a right to abortion for any reason at any point in a pregnancy, a bill similar to legislation enacted or advancing in other Democratic-controlled states. In February, all but three Democratic U.S. senators opposed, thereby killing, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would have required, in the rare cases in which a child survives a botched abortion procedure, that the survivor receive the standard professional care that would be given to any child born alive at the same gestational age.
The 1850s debates that propelled Abraham Lincoln to greatness concerned not whether slavery should be abolished forthwith, which was neither a constitutional nor political possibility. Rather, the debates concerned two other questions: Would national policy stigmatize slavery as a tragic legacy and a moral wrong? And: Would policy confine slavery to its existing dominion by banning it from the territories, thereby, Lincoln thought, putting it on a path to ultimate extinction?
Temperate pro-life advocates, practicing Lincolnian prudence, consider the abortion debate akin to the slavery debates for three reasons: Abortion shrinks the scope of the concept of personhood. The issue has been inflamed by judicial fiat (Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott v. Sandford). And confining a morally objectionable practice is a worthy, albeit not fully satisfying, objective.
The changed composition of the Supreme Court, and the supposed imminent danger that Roe will be overturned, is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want to do anyway: to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother's stomach. (Most European nations restrict abortions by at least week 13. France and Germany are very restrictive after 12, Sweden after 18.) The court's new composition has encouraged some pro-life advocates in their maximum hope, that Roe can be overturned, which would not proscribe abortion but would restore its pre-1973 status as a practice states can regulate. This is not a foreseeable possibility; a more nuanced abortion regime is.

SWB 30 Countdown: Many Memorable Moments From 30 Years

Texto completo: In this business, you hear the word “project” and it typically means it’s going to take you time.
This one just took me back.
Back to an expansive, comfortable press box that came crashing to the ground in 2012. Back to some of the most historic ballparks in the International League. Back to cities that no longer have professional baseball teams. Back behind the wheel of a yellow Nissan Sentra I bought to follow the Red Barons up and down the East Coast, the car a few players took to calling “the taxi.” Back to those green box seats down the left field line at Lackawanna County Stadium that I sat in beside my grandfather the first night 12-year-old me ever stepped foot in that ballpark.
Today, in The Citizens' Voice and online on our SWB RailRiders Blog, we start a month-long project where we’ll count down the Top 30 Moments in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre’s history, spanning the 30 years since the team debuted April 6, 1989. Each day, we’ll unveil a moment that made our list, from No. 30 today to No. 1 on May 31. We’ll go more in depth into each memory - with sidestories and backstories and interesting tidbits of history - on the blog. We hope you’ll be as engrossed by reading the content as we were in putting it together.
It was not an easy chore, of course, to scour 4,284 regular-season games and 92 more postseason ones, and pick the best. Nor did it turn out to be easy to weigh the biggest on-field moments with all the ones that happened off it. And this franchise, as we all know, has been as interesting in the boardroom over the years as it has been on the diamond.
At one point, there were about 70 moments considered. It’s still difficult to believe someone graduating from high school this year wasn’t around to see a good portion of them. Makes you realize how long 30 years really is.
The temptation was to put on the fun moments that nobody saw, the behind-the-scenes happenings that made covering the baseball beat as a professional, and simply growing up around here as a baseball fan, such a unique experience.
For every Cary Williams catch and every Governors Cup championship celebration, there were smaller moments. Moments that putting this list together reminded me of so often over the last month since we started thinking about putting this together.
Like that time I, accidentally, had my first sip of a beer. I was 12. A fan sitting in front of me in the upper deck at Lackawanna County Stadium lost control of his innings-old brewskie in celebration after Floyd Rayford beat Tidewater with a walk-off, pinch-hit grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning. My mouth agape at the sight of the ball arching toward the left-center field wall, a tablespoon or two of the oat soda found its way onto my tongue. Disgusting.
Like that time Red Barons manager Marc Bombard and I worked to complete the New York Times crossword puzzle one summer Sunday morning, with just minutes to spare before first pitch. Or the time Bomby mercilessly poked fun at me - yelling at me from one side of a Buffalo drug store as I shopped for cough drops on another - in front of a small and very confused group of customers, for losing a small, friendly bet we made on a preseason football game.
I’ve thought about Bomby a lot over the last few weeks.
I thought about Chase Utley popping up to end a game and, in complete frustration, screaming a word not suitable for publication in a family newspaper. Problem was, there were about 100 people in the seats, and the word echoed throughout the seats. Several fans booed his colorful language, and I remember how genuinely sorry Utley - who played the game without apology, with reckless abandon through a brilliant major league career - felt after the game.
I thought about the night the game rained out for the threat of bad weather, and hours after the game was slated to start, getting a phone call from manager Dave Miley, asking if it was raining at the Red Lobster where my wife and I went to eat on our impromptu and rare Friday night off, because “it sure as (heck) isn’t raining at the ballpark yet.”
I thought about all those great players I interviewed on the way up. About Utley’s day-to-day intensity. About Austin Romine’s determination. About David Wright’s pure class.
I thought about all those great players I interviewed as it was all winding down. About Dave Hollins’ resolve. About Mark Prior’s appreciation for the art of pitching. About how much an old Derek Jeter still reminded me of a young Wright.
These aren’t memories that are going to make this list, obviously. But they have their own chapter in the history of this franchise, which has survived its share of issues and has come out strong after all of them.
What you’ll read today and every day for the rest of this month are the biggest moments. The ones we talked about most when they happened. The ones that set standards and made us shake our heads in amazement. Their the ones you’d like to see repeated every day, and the ones you never want to see again.
No matter what they were, they took me back to days gone by, a different time in the franchise and a different time in life when baseball here seemed so new.
Here’s hoping they take you back as well.

Moore may be his own worst enemY

Texto completo: Stephen Moore, one of President Trump's many exotic picks to staff the federal government, declared this week that his opponents are "pulling a Kavanaugh against me."
Moore, Trump's pick for the Federal Reserve Board, is so convinced he is being treated like Brett Kavanaugh, whose Supreme Court confirmation was marred by sexual-misconduct allegations, that he reportedly hired a PR firm that helped Kavanaugh.
Any day now, Moore will appear before the Senate Banking Committee, sniff prominently, turn pages furiously and testify thunderously: "I LIKE QUANTITATIVE EASING!"
But there is a key difference. In Moore's case, the enemy is  Moore - specifically, what he wrote 15 to 20 years ago for conservative outlets such as National Review.
Now CNN, the New York Times and others are reprinting Moore's greatest hits, including his joke about how he potty-trained his son by "pasting a photo of Hillary Clinton with a bullseye target on the bottom of the potty." And his hilarious tale about showing his children pictures of the "mangled and bloody" corpses of Saddam Hussein's sons with the message "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO KIDS THAT GROW UP TO BE DEMOCRATS!" And the riotous bit about him "hitting on" a "gorgeous 20-something blond," then telling his concerned son "how nice it would be if you had a much younger mommy."
He's in town all week, folks!
In other writings, Moore defended misbehavior on college campuses: "If [women] were so oppressed and offended by drunken, lustful frat boys, why is it that on Friday nights they showed up in droves in tight skirts to the keg parties?" He reserved particular derision for his wife. After she voted Democratic, he wrote: "Women are sooo malleable! No wonder there's a gender gap."
Moore is now divorced from her - and was held in contempt of court in 2013 for failing to pay more than $300,000 in child support. There's a tax lien against his home because he owes the Internal Revenue Service $75,000.
In other words, Moore should fit in perfectly with his fellow Trump appointees.
I'm fascinated by the je ne sais quoi that mutually attracts Trump and an endless parade of oddballs. Just before Moore's writings resurfaced, another Trump pick for the Fed, Herman Cain, withdrew from consideration after the revival of sexual harassment allegations dogging the pizza magnate and "9-9-9 Plan" originator.
Trump's 2016 campaign chief is doing time in federal prison for international criminality. Former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, of Stormy Daniels and taxi-medallion fame, is headed to prison, too. Numerous aides have come to grief - Scott Pruitt, Ryan Zinke, Tom Price, Ronny Jackson - after discovering they couldn't get away with stuff the boss does.
For important jobs, Trump has seen fit to tap the unfit - a cabana boy, a party planner, a bartender, a muffler-shop guy, a judicial nominee who didn't know the law. (Trump's previous attorney general had recently pitched hot tubs.) Even the qualified tend to depart in disgrace: John Kelly, Gary Cohn, Jeff Sessions, Rex Tillerson, Kirstjen Nielsen. Now comes Attorney General William Barr, already trashing his reputation with his dishonest unveiling of the Mueller report.
I have some sympathy for Moore and what the New York Times called his "attempts at humor." My entire career might be so labeled. But now he's sacrificing his integrity like many others, serving a president whose immigration policies he once called "extreme nativist," "crazy" and "dangerous."
Among Moore's writings were parodies of year-end letters to friends in which he referred to himself in the third person. One shudders to imagine this year's version:
Steve had a rough year. First came news that he didn't pay child support or his taxes. And for some reason, people didn't think his jokes about mangled corpses and urinating on Hillary Clinton were funny. Wet blankets! Anyway, the really bad news came when the Senate had to confirm Steve, and - of all the rotten luck - 24 senators, including seven Republicans, turned out to be women. Ewww!
The senators didn't like Steve's claim that female tennis pros "want equal pay for inferior work" or him calling it an "obscenity" for women to referee men's games. ("Is there no area in life where men can take vacation from women?" Steve asked.) They didn't join his cry for "no more women refs, no women announcers, no women beer vendors, no women anything" - unless they "look like Bonnie Bernstein," a sportscaster who, Steve wrote, should wear halter tops.
Now Steve is enjoying the private sector. He didn't get the Fed job, but the publicity earned him a consolation prize: a vacation from women.

Gillibrand wants to give voters up to $600

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand unveiled a plan Wednesday to provide each voter a credit of up to $600 to donate to federal political candidates of their choice in their state.
Gillibrand, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said her "Democracy Dollars" program is aimed at getting big money out of politics by making politicians less reliant on wealthy donors.
If enacted, Gillibrand's plan — which is based in part on a program in Seattle — would allow voters to request a credit of up to $200 each for House, Senate and presidential race, with the money equally split between primaries and general elections.
Politicians would only be eligible for the contributions if they voluntarily limit themselves to maximum individual donations of more than $200, well under current federal contribution limits.
"My Clean Elections plan is a critical structural change that gets big money and special interests out of politics, and ensures that elected officials in Washington are beholden only to the people who sent them there," Gillibrand said in a statement.
Gillibrand's plan comes as she struggles to gain traction in the 2020 presidential race.
Public-opinion polls, including a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, have put her near the bottom of the crowded Democratic primary race.
And she has not yet surpassed the 65,000 individual donors needed to qualify for Democratic debates, though she will likely qualify based on her having at least 1 percent support in more than three polls, according to The New York Times.
The first Democratic debates are scheduled for June 26 and 27.
Gillibrand's election plan calls for allowing voters to spend their credit in $10 increments. She told NBC News the credit could only be used in a voter's home state, though they would be able to spend it on House races in their state but outside their home district.
"It will change who has a seat at the table and who gets elected in this country within one election cycle," Gillibrand told NBC.
Gillibrand was first appointed New York's junior senator in 2009 after former Sen. Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.
She was re-elected to her second full term last year.
Presidential hopeful Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand visited with college students and supporters in Denison, Iowa, on April 19.

Texto completo: The team of lawyers named by Gov. Phil Murphy to investigate New Jersey's controversial tax breaks will follow up its bombshell inaugural meeting, where a whistle-blower said her former company lied to win incentives, with more interviews Thursday.
The task force said it plans to interview "several" witnesses in its mission to determine if tax breaks were properly awarded and whether the agency that administers them, the Economic Development Authority, "applied appropriate scrutiny" to incentive applications.
Those key questions have come to the forefront of debate in Trenton since the task force met for the first time in March. A pair of reports Wednesday raised more questions about the integrity of the incentive programs used heavily under Republican former Gov. Chris Christie and passed by Democrats in the Legislature.
The New York Times found that a lawyer with deep connections to Democratic politicians had a hand in writing the tax incentive legislation, the Economic Opportunity Act. That lawyer, Kevin Sheehan, helped edit portions of the bill that opened "sizable" tax breaks to clients of his law firm, Parker McCay.
Earlier Wednesday, a joint WNYC and ProPublica investigation found that two-thirds of the tax break awards in Camden, or more than $1 billion, went to companies connected to George Norcross, the powerful unelected Democrat who is allies with Senate President Stephen Sweeney, and business partners and clients of his brother's law firm.
One of Norcross' two brothers, Phil Norcross, is chief executive officer of Parker McCay. Phil Norcross told the Wall Street Journal in an earlier interview that he helped write amendments to the tax break bill. Another brother, Donald Norcross, was a union leader who served in the state Legislature and co-sponsored the bill. He is now a U.S. Representative.
Murphy said he was "deeply troubled" by the findings of the two reports.
"Coupled with what we already know about how the tax incentive program operated over the past six years, I believe now more than ever in the importance of the task force I commissioned," Murphy said in a statement. "Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for. If there was fraud in this program, I expect the task force will uncover it and those individuals will be held accountable."
Norcross issued a lengthy statement Wednesday responding to the WNYC report and even thanked the news outlet for "its lengthy story detailing the massive undertaking to help rebuild Camden's future."
"The fact that private investment is returning to Camden is no accident — it was planned and fought for. As WNYC and other media outlets have reported, the commitment to rebuilding Camden's future began years ago and focused on the city's three biggest challenges: improving public safety, reforming education and bringing jobs and economic investment to the city," Norcross said.
While the Murphy task force and a legislative committee looking into the incentive programs continue their work, Murphy has tried to assert his influence in the debate. He sought the resignation of certain authority board members, but most of them defied him and remain in positions to grant future awards. And Murphy's Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, accused the Democrat of engaging in "political assassination" to gain support for his own incentives.
It does not appear that Murphy plans to apply pressure on the holdout board members, who were named to their seats by Christie.
"They're the government appointees. We approached them, we laid out our case, they made their decision. We have to respect that decision. We don't agree with them," Murphy said last week.
Days later he named Kevin Quinn, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, where Murphy worked for two decades, the authority's next board chairman. He replaces Laurence Downes, the only person who stepped down at Murphy's request.
The members of the task force are expected to hear from current and former executives of the authority when they meet Thursday in Newark. The witnesses have been subpoenaed by the task force, according to an announcement of the meeting.
Since it is armed with subpoena authority and includes white-collar crime lawyers, the task force poses perhaps the greatest threat to those who may have abused the tax incentives. At its first meeting, a woman testified that her former company lied to win tax breaks.
The panel has also said it has "obtained robust cooperation" from companies who received tax breaks, including one that admitted it was out of compliance and agreed to repay its grant, saving taxpayers $1.5 million. It has also made a criminal referral and said it has uncovered evidence of unregistered lobbying on behalf of special interests.
"As we have said, we are going to follow the facts in a search for the truth," said Ronald Chen, chairman of the task force. "Whether that means recertifying companies, seeking voluntary payments and terminations, or making referrals, we plan to be thorough, objective and efficient."
In the meantime, a group of activists signaled legal trouble for the authority by having its lawyer send a letter requesting that it preserve all documents related to tax incentives from 2010 on. Such letters typically precede a lawsuit.
Sue Altman, a board member of South Jersey Women for Progressive Change, which is one of many groups represented by the law firm Weissman & Mintz, said Tuesday that the potential lawsuit is partly an attempt to obtain documents from the authority and to convince authority board members to leave.
"It would be amazing if the board would resign. Keeping up the pressure on them is a tactic we're trying to use to make it loud and clear," Altman said.
A task force investigating New Jersey's tax incentive programs held its first public hearing in the Trenton War Memorial on March 28.

Texto completo: The Democratic fundraising machine found another target on Wednesday, soliciting donations from supporters angered by Attorney General William Barr’s handling of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on 2016 collusion between Russians and the Trump campaign.
Even before Barr finished his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on that and other related issues, longtime Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, up for reelection in 2020, dispatched a fundraising email citing Barr and a reported clash he had with Mueller.
Screen Shot 2019-05-01 at 2.07.49 PM.png
“Barr has lost all credibility,” said the plea for donations up to $2,500 via the Democratic fundraising site ActBlue.com.
“News just broke that Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote a letter to Attorney General William Barr objecting to his description of the Russia investigation’s conclusions. Why am I all fired up about this? Because, according to the New York Times, Barr’s description ‘appeared to clear President Trump on possible obstruction of justice’ — which is a fundamental mischaracterization of the special counsel’s findings,” said the email.
“This type of political interference is exactly why I said Mr. Barr should never have been confirmed in the first place. At this point, he has lost all credibility,” he added.
Warner included a poll asking supporters if they would back his call for Mueller to also testify.
It concluded, “Thank you for standing with me as we fight for the truth. Mark.”

SWALWELL QUALIFIES FOR DEBATES

Texto completo: East Bay Rep. Eric Swalwell earned his place on the Democratic presidential debate stage Tuesday after getting 1 percent in his third qualifying poll since becoming a White House candidate.
Tuesday's CNN poll found him at 1 percent nationally following polls earlier this month that put him at 1 percent in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The Democratic rules require candidates to qualify either by getting donations from at least 65,000 individual people, or getting at least 1 percent in three polls from approved polling organizations nationally or in one of the first primary states.
The CNN poll found former Vice President Joe Biden leading the field with 39 percent of respondents saying they would vote for him, and getting a bump after he officially announced his long-expected presidential bid last week. California Sen. Kamala Harris was in sixth place with 5 percent among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters.
While the poll results reinforce what a long shot Swalwell is for the presidency, the debate will give him an opportunity to make his case for gun control and student debt reform in front of what could be one of his largest audiences yet.
But the stage will be packed, and the 38-year-old representative will be under pressure to produce a breakout moment. He's the 17th candidate to qualify for the event, which will take place in Miami on June 26 and 27 with the candidates randomly split up between each night.
And there's still a chance Swalwell could eventually be shunted out of the debate. If more than 20 candidates qualify for the debates through either the donor or polling thresholds, they'll be winnowed down based on those who meet both measures. There are currently 20 Democrats running for president, with several other politicians eyeing a bid.
Swalwell hasn't yet received donations from 65,000 people, although his campaign said he was making progress toward that goal. A New York Times analysis this week found that only eight candidates had qualified through both methods so far, including Harris. (Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii became the ninth after CNN's latest poll.)
"I'm grateful that I'll have a place on the debate stage to discuss ending gun violence, providing affordable healthcare for all while finding cures in our lifetime, ensuring all communities have top-notch schools, and making sure student loan debt isn't a lifetime burden," Swalwell said in a statement.
Since he entered the presidential race with an announcement on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert earlier this month, Swalwell has campaigned across the early states, near the site of the Parkland, Florida school shooting, and in his hometown of Dublin, Calif. He met Democrats at house parties and forums across Iowa this weekend, focusing on rural towns. He's also kept up a steady stream of appearances on cable TV.

DERBY IS BIGGER THAN 'CROWN' FOR BAFFERT

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE - To become the best, it helps to be obsessed. Except for his family, nothing means as much to Bob Baffert as the great race at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May. Even after sweeping the Triple Crown with American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify last spring.
"The Kentucky Derby is still the one," said Baffert, who has won five of them. "It's still the most important race. To me the bar is the Derby. The Triple Crown is great, but there's just something about the Derby. I could just win the Derby and just go home."
Since their marriage in 2002, Jill Baffert has lived with his dream. "The Kentucky Derby is a driving force in Bob's life," she told NBCSN. "He starts thinking about it very early in a horse's career."
If Roadster, Game Winner or Improbable wins Saturday, Baffert will tie Ben Jones' record of six Derby wins. He was asked if he knew anything about the man who trained 1941 Triple Crown winner Whirlaway. Starting in the 1930s, "Plain Ben" Jones (1882-1961) from tiny Parnell, Missouri, transformed Calumet Farm into thoroughbred racing's version of the Yankees dynasty.
"Ben Jones? The golfer?" Baffert joked. "I just know what you guys tell me about him. I don't want to be thinking about things like that. I feel like I'd super-jinx myself. I feel lucky I won one Derby, let alone five."
That's how many Jones actually won, because he wouldn't be credited with six if he hadn't made probably the most selfish move in racing history. Ben's son, Jimmy, had trained Citation for his entire career, starting in 1947, a year after Ben retired to become Calumet's manager. But Ben wanted to match Herbert "Derby Dick" Thompson's four wins, so he demanded to be listed as Citation's trainer of record for the 1948 Derby.
Ben hadn't done the work, but wanted the glory. Jimmy bit his tongue and went along with the charade.
"Ben didn't train that horse," longtime race caller Dave Johnson said many years later. "Jimmy did."
Heavily favored Citation dominated and Ben posed proudly with his fourth trophy, but he alienated his son. Jimmy reportedly told journalist Heywood Hale Broun: "The son of a gun just stole him from me."
"That was a battleground for us," Jimmy Jones (1906-2001) told Daily Racing Form columnist Jay Hovdey the year before he died. "That wasn't right. I almost quit, but I couldn't. I never had a better job."
As bitter as he was, walking away from Citation, an all-time great, would have been madness. Jimmy got the credit for the Preakness and Belmont as Citation became the last Triple Crown winner until Secretariat in 1973. Jimmy Jones took the Derby with Iron Liege (1957) and Tim Tam (1958). Ben got his fifth and sixth victories (fourth and fifth, to be honest) with Ponder (1949) and Hill Gail (1952).
By all accounts, big, arrogant Ben was a hard guy to like. Before becoming a world-class trainer, he was a saloon brawler and a wandering horse trader who supposedly crossed paths with the Mexican bandit Pancho Villa. Jones had a unique touch with thoroughbreds. He was called "half horse" for his knack of bringing out their best.
His New York Times obituary ignored the adage to say nothing bad about the dead: "His son, Jimmy, officially trained two Derby winners, but did most of the actual handling of several others, while allowing his father to take the credit and break Derby records."
But they're in the books forever, and Baffert really doesn't care about what happened long ago. This week he's focused only on revisiting his happy place, the winner's circle in Churchill's infield.
"I've got three nice horses, and I just hope that turning for home all three are right there," he said. "There's nothing more exciting than when they're heading into the stretch of the Derby and your horse is in contention."

Texto completo: Our Question of the Week asked readers, Shut down social media after attack?
Sri Lankan authorities overstepped in shut down
No, in all respects. Shutting down social media would put a host of people without any alternate way of receiving information, especially about their families and loved ones. The internet is their main source of communication.
Sri Lankan authorities overstepped their bounds. Granted the perpetrators would be online touting their success, however, the common good is at stake and the terrorist elements can be tracked and brought to justice.
Freedom of speech is nebulous, subject to social mores and judicial interpretation. In a nutshell, your freedom to swing your fist begins where my nose begins. The internet is the advent of the Wild West — almost anything goes. Legislative bodies have little or no concept of the vast implications or how to control the “cloud.” Aldous Huxley, author, perhaps saw this “Brave New World” coming.
Our current president is the King of Tweets. It is up to the end user to be educated, ever cognizant to decipher the content and hyperbole that is inherent in our immediate need for info/response gratification, often propaganda and false in content.
— William Lewis, Irvine
Shut down was justified in wake of terror attacks
Although Sri Lanka, an island country off the southeastern coast of India that experienced a terrorist attack Easter Sunday, killing almost 300 people, was criticized for shutting down social media for fear of more violence, the government must have felt it was necessary to do in order for police and government officials to seek out those involved while protecting others.
According to The New York Times, the main reason given for the Sri Lankan government to shut down social media such as Facebook and Instagram was out of the fear that misinformation and hate speech could spread and create even more confusion and violence.
This lack of communication with citizens may also be due to their political system, which appears to be both democratic and authoritarian.
Hopefully, Sri Lanka’s current Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena will more effectively work together to improve the country’s communication system with their own people and other nations.

Texto completo: Funeral services were held Monday for Lori Gilbert-Kay, the only person to die during a shooting at a San Diego synagogue as she courageously blocked bullets from hitting the rabbi who had been overseeing a Passover service. We offer our condolences to her family and all who knew and loved her.
President Donald Trump offered his condolences over the weekend, too, calling Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who described the president as comforting and the conversation with him as meaningful. And at a political rally in Wisconsin, he told the large crowd of MAGA-hat-wearing supporters that "We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate."
We're sorry, Mr. Trump, but too little, too late. You don't get to use this tragedy to inoculate yourself against claims that you encourage hate, not after years of validating white nationalists.
We can't say what led the 19-year-old accused of the Chabad of Poway shooting to walk into the synagogue and open fire on the congregation using an AR-style assault weapon. Police say John T. Earnest posted an online manifesto rife with racist slurs and praise to Adolf Hitler and that he expressed support for mass shootings at a New Zealand mosque and Pittsburgh synagogue. But the rise in hate crimes like that one since Mr. Trump took office is unmistakable.
Is it because Mr. Trump has given people like Mr. Earnest permission to act on hate with his own lack of tolerance and disregard for people of other races and cultures?
In the same speech in which he expressed outrage over the shooting, Mr. Trump once again called presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren "Pocahontas," a nickname Native Americans said mocks their heritage, but Mr. Trump keeps on using.
He even infused a bit of racism into the sports arena as he congratulated the second round pick of the NFL draft, Nick Bosa, who deleted social media posts with racist and homophobic language to better his prospects of landing at a good team. The Ohio State defensive end and Trump supporter, who was picked by the San Francisco 49ers, also called Colin Kaepernick a clown for protesting police brutality by "taking a knee" during the national anthem before games. Mr. Trump did not offer congratulations to the overall first pick, quarterback Kyler Murray, who is black.
This kind of behavior has become par for the course for our president. He can't change the narrative now, although he sure seems to be trying.
Remember all the support he threw behind the tiki torch carrying white nationalists who stormed the town of Charlottesville in 2017? Joe Biden reminded those who forget during his presidential campaign announcement last week. Rather than publicly vilify their actions, Mr. Trump insisted there were "very fine people on both sides." Now, in his revisionist history of the event, Mr. Trump now claims he was talking about those who were against removing the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Does he not remember all the television newscasts and stories written about his controversial words at the time?
White House spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway continued to run with that narrative Sunday on CNN when she said the president's words have been distorted over time and that he had condemned white nationalism after the Charlottesville incident. As did Newt Gingrich, who got into the issue with hosts of The View.
It's true, Mr. Trump did condemn white nationalism at the urging of his staff, shortly after his initial words. But then he backtracked again a day later, according to The New York Times. "I think there is blame on both sides," the president told reporters with the newspaper. "You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say that. I'll say it right now."
Really? A denouncement of hate should not be that hard to figure out.
President Trump can continue to blame the "fake media" for twisting his words. He can condemn an act of hate-fueled violence when it suits him. But after while the truth is not that hard to see.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a "witch hunt" nearly two hundred times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch. After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared "the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." He didn't do it.

Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.

The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up. As Mueller put it, "unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference."

This lack of an "underlying crime" is the source of Trump's justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You'd be angry and frustrated. You'd want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.

For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of "treason" and crimes of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate." He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia -- evidence he knew did not exist.

Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn't end it. He didn't obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials. The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn's cooperation. The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, "that investigators would not have learned of otherwise." This is evidence of Trump's cooperation, not obstruction.

As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel's report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.

If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: "Go ahead, make my day." Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump's reelection. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president. Second, Trump's supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d'état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election. And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump's approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.

While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump's tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump's returns to assess how "the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president?" Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.

Both the Democrats' attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump's privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

HISTORIAN LAUDS JOURNALISTS AT CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER

Texto completo: The historian Ron Chernow may have summarized the mood of the 2019 White House Correspondents' Dinner in one sentence.
"We now have to fight hard for basic truths that we once took for granted," he said.
Mr. Chernow, the author of the Alexander Hamilton biography that inspired the hit musical "Hamilton," was invited in place of a comedian. The historian was well received as he alternated between clever jokes and a call to arms for democracy.
He only mentioned President Donald Trump by name once, but the president's "enemy of the people" rhetoric came up repeatedly.
"When you chip away at the press, you chip away at our democracy," Mr. Chernow said.
He also said that everyone in attendance is part of "Team USA, not members of enemy camps."
His advice for the press? He quoted billionaire investor Warren Buffett saying "always take the high road. It's far less crowded there."
Mr. Chernow was not the only change at the black-tie gala this year. Mr. Trump snubbed the event for the third straight year, and he instructed administration officials and aides to stay home as well.
News organizations that had bought tables for the annual fundraiser and invited White House aides suddenly had some seats to give away to others.
At cocktail parties before the sit-down dinner, several journalists commented that the event felt less tense without the presence of White House press officials who are torn between their day-to-day jobs and the president's anti-media attacks.
This year, amused guests listened with smirks and smiles instead of side-eye and awkward stares exchanged last year when comedian Michelle Wolf took down White House press secretary Sarah Sanders as she sat at the head table just a few feet away. (The comedic roasting at last year's dinner is widely believed to have led to Saturday's reformatted event.) And Mr. Trump still made himself visible, holding a rally at the same time in Green Bay, Wis., and boasting about a "massive crowd" on Twitter.
Joining Mr. Trump in Green Bay was Ms. Sanders. As she strode onstage to wild applause and alluded to the dinner that was unfolding in Washington, the crowd began a tailor-made chant: "Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!"
"Last year this night I was at a slightly different event," Ms. Sanders said. "Not quite the best welcome. So this is an amazing honor."
A small number of Trump aides, including counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, did attend some of the social events that took place before Saturday night's dinner, however.
Ms. Conway, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and comedian Jay Leno all posed for photos at a Saturday morning garden brunch that sought to raise money for veterans.
Later in the day after the presentation of several awards, it was Mr. Chernow's turn.
He cracked a few jokes and said America needs comedians "now more than ever, during this surreal interlude."
Mr. Chernow ended by paraphrasing a quip from Mark Twain: "Politicians and diapers must be changed often -- and for the same reason."

Barr has to answer for Mueller report summary, Lindsey Graham says

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr will have to answer for his four-page summary on special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Wednesday's hearing with Barr will focus on whether Barr misrepresented the findings from the 22-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by President Trump.

"Well, he gave a four-page summary. Does the report support his summary? Does the report actually indicate there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians?" Graham said during a "Face the Nation" interview Sunday on CBS.

Barr released a four-page summary of Mueller's report last month, days after the special counsel investigation came to a close, which said Mueller did not find evidence of conspiracy. The summary also took a partial quote from Mueller that said he did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined no such crime had been committed.

Barr's summary has come under heavy scrutiny. Following the redacted release of Mueller's report, the New York Times published an analytical piece comparing excerpts from Barr's summary to Mueller's findings. Critics have slammed Barr's decision to hold a press conference as a ploy to spin the special counsel's findings and pointed to instances in the past in which he wrote summaries they view as obscuring the truth.

Democrats have rallied around the report, which lays out nearly a dozen instances of possible obstruction of justice and signals the question should be left up to Congress to answer, as a cornerstone for more investigations into the president.

Graham dismissed the possibility of obstruction outright.

"I think the idea that this President obstructed justice is absurd," Graham said. He turned over a million documents to the special counsel. Almost everybody around him testified. I can't think of one thing that President Trump did to stop Mueller from doing his job. He never claimed executive privilege. From my point of view I've heard all I need to really know. Now I want to look at it and find out how all this happened."

He was specifically asked to comment on the report's excepts about Trump ordering former White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. "I think it's just all theater. It doesn't matter. I don't care what he said to Don McGahn. It's what he did. And the president never obstructed," Graham said.

Graham also discounted the possibility of asking for testimony from McGahn and Mueller. "I'm not going to re-litigate it," Graham said.

Barr also has hearing on the Mueller report scheduled with the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, which is now in doubt due to disagreement over parameters. "Discussions are still ongoing, to be picked back up tomorrow," a Justice Department official told the Washington Examiner .

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden formally entered the 2020 race for the White House on Thursday with a video that portrayed him as ready and raring to take on President Donald Trump and win the "battle for the soul of this nation."
But the Democrat must first win his party's nomination.
Biden, 76, of Wilmington, Delaware, currently enjoys frontrunner status in nearly every poll but can't take for granted that he'll stay on top, political observers say.
"The expectations are higher for him," said Christopher Galdieri, an associate professor of politics at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, an early-primary state. "If he comes out of the gate and he stumbles in fundraising or in endorsements, that's going to be damaging in a way that's different for anybody else but Bernie Sanders."
Sanders, an independent Vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate, is trailing Biden in the polls but also has double-digit support and currently leads the Democrats in fundraising.
Here are key factors that could determine whether Biden prevails or fails in the primaries:
Renown
Biden, who served three decades in the U.S. Senate and then eight years as second-in-command under President Barack Obama, is atop the polls due in large part to universal name recognition, experts say. His favorability ratings are high as well.
"Every single living, breathing Democratic primary voter knows who he is," said Brad Bannon, a Washington, D.C.-based Democratic pollster and consultant. "He's been around. He certainly has the experience to do the job well."
Electability
National polls also consistently show that Biden performs best among the Democratic contenders in a head-to-head with Trump. Many Democratic primary voters who said they are undecided have told Newsday that a top criterion for them is a candidate's chances of unseating Trump.
Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), in an early endorsement of Biden, similarly looked to the general election. "In order to accomplish the urgent task of defeating President Trump, Democrats must win Pennsylvania," Casey said in a statement. "Joe Biden can and will win Pennsylvania if he is the Democratic nominee for President."
Anita Hill
Biden's team said Thursday that he has spoken with and expressed regret to Anita Hill, who testified at 1991 confirmation hearings of future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas that Thomas sexually harassed her. The law professor had worked under him at two federal agencies.
Biden, then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, faced criticism for how Hill was treated by the all-male, all-white panel. His role has come under greater scrutiny in this #MeToo era.
Hill in a New York Times report said she was not satisfied by her conversation with Biden earlier this month and called for "real accountability."
Affectionate style with women
The former vice president last month was forced to respond to accounts by women who said his physical style of interaction made them uncomfortable. Lucy Flores, a former Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada, had said he kissed the back of her head at a 2014 event.
Biden in a video said that in his years of handshaking, hugging and expressing affection, he never believed he acted inappropriately, but: "If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully."
He then joked in the days later at an electrical workers event that he had "permission" to hug a union leader and a boy who were on stage.
Monica Klein, a Democratic strategist who works with female candidates and was a regional press secretary with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, called Biden's response out of touch. "The way he treated Lucy Flores and the way he treated Anita Hill and his general attitude toward women definitely turns a generation of women off who feel disrespected by him," Klein said.
Working-class roots
Biden, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who speaks frequently about his hardscrabble upbringing, may have the blue-collar credentials to help the Democrats win back white working-class voters in the parts of the industrialized Midwest that voted for Trump in the last election, Bannon said.
His ties to the bellwether state of Pennsylvania also are unique in the packed field of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Biden is set to kick off his stumping on Monday in Pittsburgh with a visit to the Teamsters Local 249 banquet hall, sending a clear signal that he's courting blue-collar labor votes.
"Donald Trump barely won Pennsylvania," CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said on the network. "Biden, although he is from Delaware, is really knocking things off in Pittsburgh. He is going to have AFL-CIO people everywhere around him. He's going to have firefighters, policemen. Those are the base of Joe Biden."
Age
Biden would be 78 at his inauguration, if elected. Trump, 70 at his inauguration, currently is the oldest president ever to assume the office. Biden began his Senate career nine years before Pete Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in this cycle's Democratic presidential primary, was born.
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in March found only 37 percent of respondents said "someone over 75" was desirable as a presidential candidate.
Biden, already known to be gaffe-prone, must be wary of perceived "senior moments" on the trail, Galdieri said.
Record on race issues
Biden in the early 1970s sought to balance supporting the desegregation of schools with opposing busing, or transporting black and white students outside their neighborhoods in efforts to integrate schools. Then, in 1994, he championed a crime bill that led to a crackdown that contributed to mass incarceration that disproportionately impacted people of color.
But he also served for two terms as vice president to Obama, the country's first black president, and is the subject of countless memes based on their close friendship. Black voters have come to associate Biden with the popular Obama, said Andra Gillespie, an Emory University associate professor of political science.
Position as a moderate
Biden presents as a centrist Democrat in a time when the national party is shifting to the left and includes young stars such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Bronx, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Biden's closest competition at this point in the primary, Sanders, is a self-declared socialist.
Political observers say Biden will appeal to a very important part of the Democratic electorate, the bloc of older, moderate, white working-class voters who will be alienated by the more progressive wing of the party.
The far-left Justice Democrats group that helped Ocasio-Cortez win her House seat tweeted Thursday that Biden is "out-of-touch with the center of energy in the Democratic Party today." It said, "The old guard of the Democratic Party failed to stop Trump."
Attack-dog personality
Biden was a defender of Obama, who was willing to say things and go to lengths that the president would not.
"Biden has the personality to go back and forth with Trump. He's willing to go to combat with Trump," Bannon said. "Biden gives as good as he gets."
Trump earlier this month tweeted a doctored video that showed Biden speaking while another Biden massages his shoulders with the message: "WELCOME BACK JOE!" Biden responded in a tweet that read: "I see that you are on the job and presidential, as always."

Texto completo: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is neither whistleblower nor journalist. He is an Australian citizen charged by the Justice Department with conspiring to hack into a U.S. government computer.
The report by special counsel Robert Mueller released Friday amply documents that Assange, with the support of Russian intelligence, played a critical role in the 2016 presidential election. He is a potential missing link in the chain of understanding the extent to which foreign intervention affected the American electoral process.
This is not a partisan issue. Democrats certainly would have agreed with Mike Pompeo, speaking in 2017 as CIA director before becoming secretary of state last year, when he said, "It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is: a nonstate hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia."
The special counsel's investigation had long ago established that WikiLeaks distributed materials obtained from Russian military intelligence's hack of the computer networks of Democratic organizations and the private email account of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. Now the Mueller report has refocused attention on the degree of contact during the campaign between WikiLeaks and Trump associates.
WikiLeaks launched in 2006. In the years that followed, Assange released classified information about the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was hailed as a whistleblower. But his actions over time indicate that he is not. To have a meaningful national conversation on whistleblowing, we must deploy a nonpartisan definition: A whistleblower is an insider who has evidence of misconduct (illegal or improper conduct) and exposes it, either to the authorities or to the news media. In government, misconduct is illegality or a violation of constitutional norms.
By this definition, former U.S. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg blew the whistle on the United States' dishonest conduct regarding the Vietnam War. He was a whistleblower in a way that Assange could never be, because Assange is a foreign national who reportedly collaborated with Russian intelligence to derail Clinton's candidacy. As unredacted portions of the Mueller report show, during the 2016 presidential election campaign, WikiLeaks communicated both with Trump advisers and with Russian-intelligence (GRU) front organizations, DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0. WikiLeaks subsequently sought to cover up its connections with the GRU. The pattern of redacted passages suggests that investigators continue to look into the link between WikiLeaks' election sabotage and longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone.
If Assange is not a whistleblower, is he a journalist? When he had mainstream media outlets such as The New York Times, The Guardian in Britain and Der Spiegel in Germany curate and redact documents stolen by the Army intelligence analyst now known as Chelsea Manning, Assange could have been construed as such. But WikiLeaks ultimately wound up releasing the entire cache of unredacted materials to the internet, something a journalist would not do. And no journalist would conspire to hack into the Pentagon's computer network, as the U.S. Justice Department accuses Assange of doing. (His lawyer says Assange will resist extradition to the United States from Britain.)
Some of the confusion surrounding Assange is a product of WikiLeaks' complete transformation since its inception. WikiLeaks once was something wholly new: a site designed for whistleblowing targeted at corruption anywhere in the world. The optimistic values that originally animated its mission were expressed on the WikiLeaks beta site, the test version before its official launch: "We propose that every authoritarian government, every oppressive institution, and even every corrupt corporation, be subject to the pressure, not merely of international diplomacy or freedom of information laws, not even of quadrennial elections, but of something far stronger: the individual consciences of the people within them."
The original idealism quickly morphed into an exclusive focus on the alleged transgressions of the United States. After it began releasing the State Department cables in November 2010, American companies backed away from WikiLeaks. Amazon stopped hosting WikiLeaks. PayPal announced it would no longer process donations to the site. MasterCard and Visa Europe severed ties. Assange called it "economic censorship."
He eventually found a new source of cash in the Kremlin's main global propaganda outlet, RT, formerly called Russia Today. "World Tomorrow," otherwise known as "The Julian Assange Show," ran for 12 episodes in 2012. When he sought refuge in Ecuador's London embassy around that time, Assange was being sought for questioning by Swedish police regarding sexual assault allegations. From the time Donald Trump announced his presidential candidacy in 2015 through his election in November 2016, Assange did not publish a single document that was damaging to Russia or Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Assange's indictment by the United States is not the attempted silencing of a whistleblower or a threat to press freedom or an abuse of power. It is about prosecuting Assange on a specific criminal charge. Questioning him more broadly might yield potentially valuable information about how Russia intervened in the 2016 election, enabling the United States to mount a better defense of the electoral process's integrity in 2020.

Texto completo: The New York Times apologized Saturday for a cartoon published internationally that contained “anti-Semitic tropes.”

The cartoon was a drawing of President Trump wearing a skullcap and being lead by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is portrayed as being a service dog for the blind.

“A political cartoon in the international print edition of The New York Times on Thursday included anti-Semitic tropes, depicting the prime minister of Israel as a guide dog with a Star of David collar leading the president of the United States, shown wearing a skullcap,” the statement on the New York Times Opinion Twitter account said.

“The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it,” the statement concluded.

The offending cartoon was not associated with an article.

Netanyahu won his fifth term as prime minister this month, surviving multiple scandals to win the election.

Trump and Netanyahu have developed a close relationship as Trump has implemented aggressive pro-Israel stances, including moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing Israel’s claim to the Golan Heights, where Netanyahu said he would name a settlement after the president.

Texto completo: Few companies singularly affect the U.S. economy more than Boeing.
The largest aerospace company in the world, Boeing boasts more than 150,000 employees and has annual sales of more than $100 billion. It's the largest segment of the Dow Jones industrial average, and on Wednesday, it reported a drop in earnings that is costing the company at least $1 billion. In the first quarter of 2019, Boeing's delivery of new planes dropped by 19 percent compared with last year.
It's never good when you have to defend your firm's handling of a crisis during a conference call with investors. But it's not just Boeing's reputation that's at stake - U.S. leadership in world aviation is at risk, too. Last year, the United States exported $130 billion in civilian airplanes and equipment, much of it built by Boeing.
Disturbing news about industrial giant
After two fatal crashes of 737 Max airliners less than five months apart, the Boeing model was grounded around the world. That led the company to work on a software fix to flight-control software that is the focus of investigators. Pilots complained that Boeing kept them in the dark about the software.
And the news keeps getting worse.
The New York Times recently reported problems with another Boeing airplane, the 787 Dreamliner built in South Carolina, that include a lack of oversight, and concerns with safety, defective manufacturing and leftover debris. While Boeing has denied some of the claims, more challenges to its safety record certainly will not help the company - and will ripple through the rest of the economy.
Those concerns are magnified by the Federal Aviation Administration's lack of oversight, particularly in how it allowed Boeing to self-regulate and certify its own planes, and by the tight, intertwined relationship the Trump administration seems to have with Boeing.
The FAA's top safety officer was previously part of an industry association that advocated for manufacturers to certify their own work. The acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan, spent decades at Boeing before coming to the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has lavished praise on Boeing and wants it to sell more planes to China to help close the trade gap.
Heavy risks of lax regulation
The unfolding Boeing story is a clear sign of the risks of lax regulation. Even as the Trump administration suggests that less regulation means better economic growth, that's clearly not true when massive failures occur - failures that result in hundreds of fatalities - and hold the potential for an economic crisis that could go far beyond Boeing's doors. A federal investigation of Boeing and the FAA must go forward unimpeded. Trust in the FAA and Boeing is what we sell to the world.
Meanwhile, competitors across the globe wait in the wings. Beyond Europe's Airbus, aerospace experts point to the potential for China to establish its own airline manufacturing industry. Without tougher regulations, and far more attention on what's happening inside Boeing, the U.S. aerospace industry, and even the overall economy, could be grounded, too.

FROM THE ASHES OF NOTRE DAME HOW A BURNING CATHEDRAL REBUKES A DIVIDED CATHOLIC CHURCH

Texto completo: A first draft of this column was written before flames engulfed the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, before its spire fell in one of the most dreadful live images since Sept. 11, 2001, before a blazing fire went further than any of France's anticlerical revolutionaries ever dared.
My original subject was the latest controversy in Catholicism's now-years-long Lent, in which conflicts over theology and sex abuse have merged into one festering, suppurating mess. The instigator of controversy, this time, was the former pope, the 92-year-old Benedict XVI, who late last week surprised the Catholic intelligentsia with a 6,000-word reflection on the sex abuse crisis.
Portions of the document were edifying, but there was little edifying in its reception. It was passed first to conservative Catholic outlets, whose palpable Benedict nostalgia was soon matched by fierce criticism from Francis partisans, plus sneers from the secular press at the retired pope's insistence that the sex abuse epidemic was linked to the cultural revolution of the 1960s and the 1970s.
The column I was writing before the fire was mostly a lament for what the document's reception betokened: A general inability, Catholic and secular, to recognize that both the "conservative" and "liberal" accounts of the sex abuse crisis are partially correct, that the spirits of liberation and clericalism each contributed their part, that the abuse problem dramatically worsened during the sexual revolution (a boring empirical fact if you spend any time with the data or the history) even as it also had roots in more traditional patterns of clerical chauvinism, hierarchical arrogance and institutional self-protection.
So the column was a defense of Benedict's argument, in part, against secular sneers and liberal-Catholic sniping. But then it also agreed with certain criticisms of his letter, and worried about the ways that such an intervention contributes to the sense of a church in pieces, a church almost with two popes, each offering partial diagnoses to their respective factions.
That's where I was, what I had at least half-written, before the fire began in Paris. But now let me try to say something larger, something commensurate to the symbolism of one of Catholicism's greatest monuments burning on Holy Week, a day before Benedict's own birthday, on the day after Catholics listened to a gospel in which the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom.
That larger thing is this: The problem of Catholic narratives that can't find synthesis, of "liberal" and "conservative" takes that feed angrily off one another, of popes and former popes as symbols grasped by partisans, is not the problem of the sex abuse crisis. It is simply the problem of Roman Catholicism in this age - an age in which the church mirrors the polarization of Western culture, rather than offering an integrated alternative.
The church has always depended on synthesis and integration. That has been part of its genius, a reason for all its unexpected resurrections and regenerations. Faith and reason, Athens and Jerusalem, the aesthetic and the ascetic, the mystical and the philosophical - even the crucifix itself, two infinite lines converging and combining.
Notre-Dame de Paris is a monument to a particularly triumphant moment of Catholic synthesis - the culture of the high Middle Ages, a renaissance before the Renaissance, at once Roman and Germanic but both transformed by Christianity, a new hybrid civilization embodied in the cathedral's brooding, complicated, gorgeous sprawl.
The Catholicism of today builds nothing so gorgeous as Notre-Dame in part because it has no 21st-century version of that grand synthesis to offer. The reforms of the 1960s, the Second Vatican Council and everything after have left the church partially and unsuccessfully transformed, torn between competing visions of how to be Catholic in modernity, competing promises of renewal and reform, competing factions convinced that they are the firefighters inside Notre-Dame, and their rivals are the fire.
I belong to one of these factions (or to a faction within a faction; who can keep track?); I am a conservative of some sort, who fears that liberal Christianities usually end up resembling a post-inferno cathedral, with the still-grand exterior concealing emptiness within.
But I am also doubtful that anything so simple as a conservative "victory" will return the church to cathedral-raising vigor and make it feel, to outsiders, like something more than a museum whose docents all seem to hate one another. Especially given how often conservative Catholicism is in thrall to orthodoxies that are political rather than theological, how often - especially as it reacts to the destabilizing style of Pope Francis - its climate feels more like an airless bunker than a Gothic nave.
And it is impossible, as a Catholic, to be writing about this subject while the Cathedral of Notre-Dame is literally burning on Holy Week and not feel that everyone engaged in Catholicism's civil wars is being judged, and found wanting, and given a harrowing lesson in what is actually asked of us.
The cathedral will be rebuilt; the cross and altar and much of the interior survived. But all preservation is provisional. The real challenge for Catholics, in this age of general post-Christian cultural exhaustion, is to look at what our ancestors did and imagine what it would mean to do that again, to build anew, to leave something behind that could stand a thousand years and still have men and women singing "Salve Regina" outside its cruciform walls, as Parisians did tonight while Notre-Dame burned.
What is the synthesis that could make that possible? What lies beyond the stalemates and scandal and anger of our strange two-pope era?
Go ask the Catholics of 3019 A.D. It's for them to know, and us, if God wills it, to find out.

Texto completo: The White House on Tuesday ordered an administration-wide boycott of this weekend's Correspondents' Association Dinner, a lighthearted event meant as an opportunity for government officials to mingle with journalists.
A White House aide confirmed to the Daily News that neither President Trump nor any "members of his administration" will attend the Saturday dinner in Washington, which is held to dole out scholarships, "salute" the First Amendment and honor award-winning journalism, according to the association's website.
Trump, whose publicly professed hate for journalists is unmatched by his predecessors, announced this month he was ditching the "boring" dinner in favor of holding a campaign rally in Green Bay, Wis.
As his administration alerted officials Tuesday morning to also skip the shindig, Trump fired off a familiar press-bashing rant over Twitter.
"The Radical Left Democrats, together with their leaders in the Fake News Media, have gone totally insane!" Trump declared as part of a string of tweets slamming The New York Times and other outlets as "truly the Enemy of the People!"
This is the third year in a row Trump will skip the press dinner, which has traditionally been attended by sitting presidents and vice presidents of both parties. This will mark the first year administration officials will also boycott the event.
Oliver Knox, the president of the Correspondents' Association, responded to news of the boycott with a statement praising reporters who cover Trump's administration.
"We're looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present and future," Knox said.
Trump's social media salvo came shortly before he was set for a closed-door, grip-and-grin session with the winners of the annual White House photographers awards.
Most of the winners work for media organizations that Trump regularly derides.

Texto completo: Robert K. Kraft won a temporary victory on Tuesday when a Palm Beach County judge ruled that videos from his visits to a massage parlor in Florida would not be released for now.
Judge Leonard Hanser noted the conflict between the public's right to know and the right of a defendant to a fair trial, but ruled in favor of Mr. Kraft, saying the videos could not be released until a jury was sworn in or the case was concluded in one of several possible ways.
The judge wrote that the incident that is alleged in the massage parlor "seems like a rather tawdry but fairly unremarkable event." He added: "But if that man is the owner of the most successful franchise in, arguably, the most popular professional sport in the United States, an entirely different dynamic arises, especially if the encounter is captured on videotape and the incident is the focus of much media attention and pretrial publicity."
Judge Hanser said the video could be released once one of these conditions occurs: a jury is sworn in; the case is resolved in a plea agreement; the state drops the charges; or at a time when the judge deems Mr. Kraft's right to a fair trial is no longer jeopardized.
Mr. Kraft has contended that he is being unfairly targeted by the police and prosecutors because of his fame and wealth. He has also alleged that the police obtained the surveillance video improperly. In asking for a warrant, the police said sex trafficking was thought to be taking place inside the massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla.
A circuit court judge is handling the felony charges against two women who ran the massage parlor, the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, that Mr. Kraft visited in January, but neither of them has been charged with sex trafficking.
That judge also delayed the release of the videos last week after prosecutors said they were obligated to release them under Florida law.
Mr. Kraft has been charged with two misdemeanor counts of solicitation of prostitution. In cases like these, most defendants take a quiet plea deal leading to a fine or community service. But Mr. Kraft, 77, who contends he did nothing illegal, has fought the charges and called in legal firepower.
His team has focused on the release of the videos. "What is the interest the public has in seeing it? It's basically pornography," his lawyer William A. Burck said this month at a hearing.
The threat to release the videos, which would have portions blurred, could be seen as an effort by prosecutors to gain leverage over Mr. Kraft and encourage him to accept a plea deal.
Mr. Kraft has apologized to fans and his family.
The New York Times is one of several news organizations that have filed a motion to oppose keeping evidence in the case private.

ProPublica’s Hannah Dreier Wins Hillman Prize and Daniel Schorr Journalism Prize

Texto completo: The Sidney Hillman Foundation announced Tuesday that ProPublica reporter Hannah Dreier is the winner of the Hillman Prize in the magazine category for “Trapped in Gangland.” Co-published with New York magazine, Newsday and the New York Times Magazine, the series detailed how the government’s bungled crackdown on MS-13 has torn apart the lives of Latino immigrants on Long Island.
WBUR and Boston University also announced this week that Dreier is the winner of the Daniel Schorr Journalism Prize for “The Runaways,” an audio story in the series produced with “This American Life.”
For her first story, “A Betrayal,” Dreier spent months gaining the trust of Henry, a teenage informant who helped the FBI catch fellow MS-13 members. He believed authorities would offer him a new life, but instead they handed him over to ICE. Another article featured Alex, an asylum-seeker accused of gang membership and deported for drawing a devil — his school mascot but also an MS-13 symbol — after a school-based police officer reported the doodle.
In response to these powerful narratives, ICE changed a practice that jeopardizes informants, and a fundraiser brought in $35,000 to help Henry find a safe place to live once he was deported. Alex’s school district removed police from school buildings, and, along with other districts, it sought a formal agreement with the police limiting officers’ roles in schools.
“In a time when this country’s highest powers have taken it as their business to demean the work of journalists, it is particularly significant for us to honor those who have taken up the tools of journalism to challenge corrupt power wherever it may reside,” Hillman judge Ta-Nehisi Coates said.
In “The Runaways,” an hourlong audio story, Dreier documents how the Suffolk County Police Department failed to investigate more than a dozen MS-13 gang murders when the victims were immigrant teenagers. When teens disappeared, the police missed leads, ignored important evidence, failed to follow their own procedures (such as providing Spanish interpreters for parents who struggled to communicate with officers) and brushed aside distraught parents who had key information. They told parents that their missing children were runaways and classified them that way internally, which led to more perfunctory investigations.
Days after the story aired on “This American Life,” the Suffolk County Legislature forced the Police Department to conduct an internal investigation into how it had handled the MS-13 murder cases. The department also hired a civilian liaison to work with Latino residents and committed $215,000 toward a campaign to recruit more Spanish-speaking employees.
“Hannah Dreier’s ‘The Runaways’ is solid reporting of the most important kind, reporting that holds public officials to account for their incompetence, indifference and hollow self-serving claims of victory,” said Robert Siegel, retired host of NPR’s “All Things Considered,” who served as a judge for the Schorr Journalism Prize.

Deportaciones de inmigrantes con esta característica crece 266% en Nueva York

Texto completo: La mano dura de ICE bajo el gobierno de Donald Trump se sigue sintiendo con fuerza en la vida de inmigrantes que nunca han cometido un delito.
Según un reporte del New York Times la deportación de inmigrantes del área de la ciudad de Nueva York sin antecedentes penales, incluidos solicitantes de asilo con órdenes de deportación de años o décadas anteriores, aumentaron a 1,144 en el año fiscal de 2018 pasando de 313 deportaciones en 2016, lo que representa un aumento del 266% por ciento, según un informe reciente del contralor de la ciudad.
“Ese es el mayor aumento porcentual de cualquier oficina de campo de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas en el país”. , asegura el reporte.
La administración de Trump dijo que los agentes de ICE están siguiendo la ley al tratar de devolver a los solicitantes de asilo que han perdido sus casos y que por lo tanto no tienen derecho a permanecer en el país. Política que va de la mano con el aumento de la tasa de denegación de asilo que fue de casi el 62% en 2017, frente a un 57% por ciento en 2016, según el Foro Nacional de Inmigración.
Durante el gobierno de Obama, los jueces de inmigración recibieron instrucciones de utilizar su discreción para permitir que indocumentados sin pasado judicial permanecieran en el país, como solicitantes de asilo que habían perdido sus casos, pero a quienes se les daba la capacidad de permanecer y trabajar legalmente en los Estados Unidos mientras se registraran con ICE. Sin embargo bajo la administración de Donald Trump esa política ha cambiado drásticamente.
Uno de estos es el caso de Indra Sihotang , un inmigrante que literalmente se aferró a una silla cuando los funcionarios de ICE trataron de cargarlo en un vuelo de regreso a Indonesia, donde ” la persecución de cristianos como él” se “intensificó”, continuó el New York Times .
Sihotang al igual que muchos otros inmigrantes, fue arrestado durante lo que supuso que era un registro de rutina de ICE. Los defensores de los derechos de los inmigrantes han apodado este tipo de arrestos como “redadas silenciosas”.
Tras la escena en el aeropuerto, ni a Sihotang ni a ICE se les permitió abordar el vuelo comercial. ICE una vez más intentó deportarlo, y él estaba sentado en una camioneta de camino al aeropuerto cuando los agentes recibieron una llamada para detener su deportación.
Si bien Sihotang había perdido su caso de asilo hace cinco años, “un juez determinó que el Sr. Sihotang enfrentó miedos creíbles de persecución en Indonesia y reabrió su caso de asilo, que sigue sin resolverse”.

Mueller report an unsettling peek inside White House

Texto completo: No, not that of Russia collusion or obstruction of justice, but the one outlined in a much vilified op-ed about a Trump resistance movement within the White House published last September in the New York Times.
The Mueller report's confirmation that Trump is volatile and reckless with little regard for ethical consideration isn't enough to get him impeached. But, as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote in a commentary following the Mueller report's release, voters now have all the information necessary to "render the verdict they see fit - in the 2020 election."
Trump's bumbling attempts to influence the Mueller investigation as outlined in the report shed far more light on the situation than what Attorney General William Barr outlined in his summary released in March. Failing to act presidential is one thing; behaving like a buffoon is another.
Thankfully, as the anonymous New York Times op-ed read, "there are adults in the room." Mueller himself wrote Trump failed to impede the investigation "largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."
The Mueller report underscores their success in protecting our democracy. That their work also shielded Trump from putting himself in an impeachable, perhaps even criminal, position is a blessing - they preserved the integrity of the office in the process.
Own worst enemy
So many of Trump's political bruises are self-inflicted.
His incessant and thoughtless tweeting is annoying. His divisive rhetoric is stomach-turning. And, as the Mueller findings show, his bullying and meddling ways are absurd to the point of being comical.
He fires James Comey as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, believing this will end the initial investigation into Russia's interference in the election. Instead, the move led to Mueller's appointment.
Then Trump tries to discredit Mueller and get him dismissed. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and White House Counsel Donald McGahn disagree with Trump's assertions. McGahn then refuses Trump's edict to fire Mueller.
Trump's next tact is to order then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself and limit the Russia probe. Sessions refuses and takes to carrying a signed resignation letter with him at all times.
Witness intimidation backfires. Fixer Michael Cohen and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn flip. Mueller's team is able to independently verify many of their allegations.
The Mueller report clearly illustrates that Trump attempted to use his power to manipulate the investigation. He saw this as a means to guarantee his exoneration. Ironically, he would have found vindication had he just let the process play out.
Focus on what's ahead
Trump devotees will wave away these revelations.
They're already calling them exaggerations or isolated incidents. Some say Trump's frustration with being falsely accused of conspiring with Russia led to his actions. Some even claim Trump acts this way to test people and see whether they do the right thing.
Nothing will curb their loyalty to Trump.
The rest of the populace sees Trump for the boorish incompetent the Mueller findings describe. As we look to 2020, we can only hope this evidence, piled on top of all the rest, is enough to inspire new leaders to step forward. And not just on the Democratic side but among the Republicans, the Libertarians and independents.
Our short-term political energies should be divided between identifying and vetting those individuals while pushing Congress to advance legislation that can receive bipartisan support. Further Mueller report-related inquiries, including impeachment hearings, are unnecessary.
Our leaders, both in the White House and on Capitol Hill, need to narrow their focus. There are too many issues ailing this country to continue probing the Mueller findings. The resulting partisan squabbling poisons everything at a time when the economy, disaster relief, immigration and budget appropriations - just to name a few - demand action.
Trump belongs in the Oval Office, not preparing for and participating in congressional hearings. At least for now.

EXTREMIST GROUP BLAMED FOR BOMBINGS OFFICIALS IN SRI LANKA SAID TO HAVE WARNINGS

Texto completo: COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka on Monday accused a local Islamist extremist group, the National Thowheed Jamath, of being behind a string of Easter bombings at churches and hotels that killed at least 290 people, and the United States pledged support for the investigation, dispatching FBI agents to help.
At least four U.S. citizens are among the dead - including a fifth grade student on leave from a Washington school - and "several" Americans were seriously injured, the State Department said Monday. Sri Lankan Tourism Minister John Amaratunga said 39 foreigners were killed and 28 wounded.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne called for the police inspector general, Pujith Jayasundara, to resign because security agencies had received a report warning of attacks by Thowheed Jamath on churches and hotels weeks earlier.
Additionally, Hilmy Ahamed, vice president of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, said in the wake of Sunday's butchery that he warned military intelligence officials about the group and its leaders about three years ago.
Mr. Senaratne also said the extremist group, whose name roughly translates to National Monotheism Organization, used suicide bombers at three churches and three hotels. He added that a foreign network was probably involved.
"We do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country," Mr. Senaratne said. "There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded."
President Maithripala Sirisena said he would seek "international assistance" with the investigation. Intelligence agencies have reported that "international organizations" were behind these "acts of local terrorists," his office said in a statement. The statement also said the government would implement anti-terrorism measures that give military sweeping police powers, effective at midnight.
FBI agents are being sent to assist Sri Lankan police in their investigation, according to a law enforcement official. The FBI has also offered laboratory expertise in testing some of the bomb evidence, and analysts have been scouring FBI databases for any pieces of information that could shed additional light on the plotters, officials said.
Officials said 24 suspects have been taken into custody for questioning, news agencies reported
Authorities said the main attacks - on churches and hotels - were carried out by seven suicide bombers.
A Sri Lankan security official characterized Thowheed Jamath as a shell for the Islamic State terrorist group and said it has been active in Kattankudy, an area in the eastern part of the country and home to one of its largest Muslim populations. The group's leadership is believed to be based there, the official said.
The official said there could be additional explosives or potential suicide bombers.
"Right now, they are searching everywhere for possible bombs and people involved," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation.
In Washington, President Donald Trump called Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday morning to express condolences and received an update on the investigation. Mr. Trump pledged U.S. support in bringing the perpetrators to justice, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the fight against global terrorism, a pool report said.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
It took only five hours for a jury to convict a Brooklyn man this month in the high-profile slaying of Karina Vetrano, whose badly beaten body was found partially clothed in a Queens park after she had gone out for a late-afternoon jog.
Then one of the jurors in the case came forward to say he was improperly pressured to convict the defendant, Chanel Lewis, of first-degree murder and sexual abuse. Based on the juror's sworn statement, Mr. Lewis's defense lawyers accused other jurors of misconduct and asked the judge to throw out the verdict.
On Monday, the judge rejected the request for a new trial after a highly unusual two-hour hearing in which three jurors testified about their deliberations. "Motion denied," Justice Michael B. Aloise said, without explaining his reasoning.
Mr. Lewis is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday morning. He faces life in prison without parole. He confessed to beating Ms. Vetrano, and traces of his DNA were found on her body. The defense argued his confession was coerced and the DNA evidence was unreliable.
Christopher Gooley, the juror who had come forward, said he was the final holdout against finding Mr. Lewis guilty and had accused other jurors of violating the judge's orders not to discuss the case before deliberations. He said that on the second day of the trial, after Ms. Vetrano's parents had testified, the foreman told him that his mind was made up.
In an interview, Mr. Gooley said he had deep misgivings about the verdict and still harbors doubts about Mr. Lewis's guilt. He spoke to The New York Times on Saturday, and the newspaper granted him anonymity until his name was revealed in open court.
"This is bigger than Chanel Lewis," he said on Saturday. "I'm standing up to the system. Showing people what the inside of a jury room is really like."
The allegations were an unexpected coda in a case that had already become embroiled in a broader debate over police conduct in the investigation into the killing of Ms. Vetrano, 30, in August 2016.
The first trial of Mr. Lewis ended in a hung jury in November, after some jurors agreed with the defense theory that the confession was false and the DNA evidence unreliable.
Some of Mr. Lewis's supporters have gone so far as to assert, without proof, that DNA evidence was planted in order to convict him. Mr. Lewis's mother, Veta Lewis, has said her son was framed. She has vowed to appeal the verdict.
In court papers filed by the Queens district attorney's officer, six jurors either denied Mr. Gooley's claims or said they did not recall the incidents he described.
Two of them testified in court on Monday and said they did not see other jurors pressure Mr. Gooley.
The lead prosecutor, Brad A. Leventhal, argued that the defense "had not made out any claim to disturb this good and valid and fair verdict." Mr. Leventhal also suggested that Mr. Gooley was lying and that he was seeking "15 minutes of fame."
But Jenny Cheung, one of Mr. Lewis's lawyers, argued that Mr. Gooley did not have a reason to lie. Most of his allegations had not been denied, she said, and his accounts to the news media were made anonymously, a move that is inconsistent with someone interested in fame, she said.
Ms. Vetrano's family have said they have no doubt of Mr. Lewis's guilt. On Monday, her father, Philip Vetrano, called the defense's request for a new trial "a joke."
"Nothing but fools," he said. "All fools."
After the jury received the case on April 1, deliberations became contentious, Mr. Gooley said. He said he had doubts about Mr. Lewis's guilt, but gave in to the other jurors because he believed that the judge was going to keep the jurors there well into the night until they delivered a guilty verdict.
He said he was also dismayed about technical difficulties that prevented the jury from viewing Mr. Lewis's videotaped confession. The two jurors said in court, however, that Mr. Gooley had decided after dinner that he did not need to see the confession again.
When the jurors voted to convict Mr. Lewis, it was after 9 p.m. and they had been in the courthouse for about 12 hours.
"I was getting flustered, having migraines, and they were serving food from a pizza joint -- not the healthiest," Mr. Gooley said. "I felt I needed to get out of there."
Mr. Gooley said he also felt subtly pressured by Justice Aloise to reach a guilty verdict.
He said he noticed during the trial that the judge was wearing purple, which he learned was Ms. Vetrano's favorite color, and he believed it was a deliberate show of solidarity with the victim's family.
The judge did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Gooley said he tried to send a note to the judge to find out how long the jury would have to stay that evening, but Brian Morrissey, the foreman, ripped up the message.
Mr. Morrissey, in an affidavit, said he did not recall making any statements to Mr. Gooley about his opinion before deliberations, nor did he remember ripping up a note. Mr. Morrissey was not called to testify on Monday.
Mr. Gooley said he told his fellow jurors that he did not believe prosecutors had proven Ms. Vetrano had been sexually abused, and noted the absence of DNA establishing that there had been such an attack. The jurors could convict on the first-degree murder charge only if they also found Mr. Lewis guilty of sexual abuse.
Mr. Lewis's lawyers said two jurors offered expert opinions about the sexual-abuse evidence based on their own experiences, including with other rape cases, which would have violated the judge's instructions.
But one of those jurors denied those claims on Monday, while the other acknowledged drawing a comparison between evidence in Mr. Lewis's trial and another case, but said he dropped the subject at another juror's request.
On Aug. 2, 2016, Ms. Vetrano was killed as she was jogging in Spring Creek Park in the Howard Beach section of Queens.
When investigators learned the DNA found on her body belonged to a black man, they sought samples from hundreds of black men who had been arrested in nearby parts of Queens and Brooklyn.
Detectives focused on Mr. Lewis on the recommendation of a police lieutenant who had seen him on two occasions "acting suspiciously" in Howard Beach, a predominantly white neighborhood.
Mr. Lewis lived three miles away in East New York, Brooklyn, with his mother and had graduated from a school for students with learning disabilities.
The DNA taken from Mr. Lewis matched traces found on Ms. Vetrano's neck and cellphone, and a mixture sample from two of her fingernails.
Mr. Lewis initially denied killing Ms. Vetrano, but after 11 hours in police custody, he confessed in a videotaped interview to beating her. At times during the confession, he appeared confused and mumbled through some of his responses.

Texto completo: We're closing in on the time of year where many high school seniors choose where to attend college, while college seniors get ready to hear the advice of commencement speakers.
While I am deeply honored to have Gov. Mills address our graduates next month, I am reminded of a column last year by the New York Times' Frank Bruni, in which he wondered why universities offer such guidance as students prepare to leave their institutions, but much less so when they enroll.
It is somewhat ironic that so many universities fail to offer such advice at the outset of college, since the derivation of commencement is "to begin." So why not start at the beginning, helping students to make the most of their college years?
This is especially important for students who are the first in their family to go to college. Such students frequently arrive with little or no understanding of the college environment or how to make the most of the opportunities before them.
I know, because I was once one of those kids. The first in my family to attend a four-year college, I arrived as a freshman lacking confidence in my abilities and uncertain of how to proceed. I felt like an imposter.
What made all the difference were faculty members who showed an interest in me. They took me under their wing and helped guide me.
While it's not unusual for caring faculty to reach out to mentor students in need, here is my No. 1 "commencement" advice to incoming college students: Don't wait for faculty members to find you. Find them. Seek them out, ask for help and ask questions.
Having a faculty mentor is key to success in college and afterward, studies show. As mentor-mentee relationships are established, so, too are research opportunities, internships and networking in your fields of interest.
But don't limit yourself to just faculty members - which brings me to commencement advice No. 2 for incoming students: Lean on your professional advisers. After all, it's their job to support you.
Seek out your advisers early and often. At the University of Southern Maine, we actually mandate that every incoming student meet with their university advisor for at least 90 minutes before their first semester even starts.
During these advising meetings, advisers are able to get to know each student, ask them questions about their interests, goals and fears and assure students that help exists. And it's the student's first opportunity to ask questions, from where to pick up a form to what major might best suit his or her interests.
I implore students, though, to go beyond these initial sessions, and to lean on your advisers throughout college. Surely, you could use their help, because I guarantee you will face twists and turns, triumphs and setbacks, and challenges and opportunities throughout your college career.
Piece of advice No. 3 for incoming students is to seek out yet another key university group: the career services staff. Don't wait for your senior year to meet with them. Do so early on to ensure you have multiple opportunities to do job shadows, internships and more. This real-world experience will give you a leg up in launching your career after graduation.
Internships also enable you to test out whether a field of interest actually truly appeals to you. Sometimes you'll find it does. And sometimes you'll find it doesn't.
Either way, it's best to find out before you graduate.
This leads me to my final piece of commencement advice for incoming students: Be flexible and open to opportunities. It's great to arrive at college thinking you know exactly what you want, but don't be afraid to sample other programs and fields.
It benefited me. I entered college with the vision of becoming an attorney. Yet, just a few years later, I found myself happily teaching history and economics at Gorham High School. With the exception of a diversion into politics, I have been blessed to be in education ever since.
I received the right guidance and support when I needed it most - and that was well before I donned a cap and gown. Don't be afraid to ask for this support, and let your future commence.

LETTER FROM WASHINGTON; What would Mueller say? Here are 10 questions Congress should ask -- and how he may answer

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was supposed to provide clear answers to two questions: Did Donald Trump collude with Russia in his 2016 presidential campaign? And as president did he try to obstruct the investigations that ensued?
On collusion, the special counsel found that the Trump campaign welcomed Russia's offer to provide "dirt" on Hillary Clinton, but that its actions didn't meet the definition of a criminal conspiracy.
On obstruction of justice, Mueller amassed considerable evidence that Trump tried to hamstring investigators -- but he chose not to say whether charges were warranted.

Now it's Congress' turn. House Democrats have summoned Mueller to appear before several committees, although those hearings may be a month or more away.
Here are 10 questions Congress should ask and, drawing on Mueller's report, answers he might give. Passages in quotation marks come directly from the report.
President Trump says your report was a "complete and total exoneration" -- "no collusion, no obstruction." Is he right?
No. "While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."
"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.... We are unable to reach that judgment."
The report doesn't offer a judgment on "collusion" either, because that's not a crime. Instead, it examines whether Trump engaged in "conspiracy," a charge that requires "agreement, tacit or express, between the Trump campaign and the Russian government." The investigation did not find that kind of agreement, so it didn't charge conspiracy.
What about the 2016 meeting at Trump Tower involving three top campaign aides, including Donald Trump Jr., and the Russian lawyer who purportedly promised "dirt" on Clinton? Doesn't that look like collusion?
Maybe. "The office considered whether to charge Trump campaign officials with crimes in connection with [that] meeting," including conspiracy to violate the law against foreign contributions. But lawyers concluded that prosecution might fail for two reasons. It wasn't clear Trump Jr. knew that accepting that kind of help could break the law. And a prosecutor would have to prove that the promised "dirt" was worth $2,000 or more.
Does the evidence add up to a case for obstruction, even though you chose not to make a decision on that?
Yes. "Our investigation found multiple acts by the president that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations."
But he didn't succeed.
That doesn't mean he didn't try. "The president's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."
Any examples?
One of the clearest is Trump's June 2017 order to his White House counsel, Donald McGahn, to fire the special counsel. "Substantial evidence" indicates that Trump's aim was to impede investigations of his conduct. McGahn considered the request improper and refused to carry it out. "There also is evidence that the president knew he should not have made those calls to McGahn."
Later, when the New York Times revealed the episode, Trump ordered McGahn to deny the newspaper's account even though it was true. "The president acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn's account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny." Those are all elements of an obstruction charge.
Anything else?
Also in 2017, Trump tried to order Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions to limit the investigation's mandate to future elections, not the 2016 campaign. The intent of his order was "to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the president's and his campaign's conduct." Again, aides didn't carry it out.
What about the decision to fire James B. Comey as FBI director in May 2017?
Yes, the evidence indicates that Trump believed removing Comey would "protect [him] from an investigation into his campaign."
But if there was no underlying crime of collusion -- at least, no conspiracy you could prove -- can there still be obstruction?
Sure. "Proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction [charge].... The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong."
Despite all that evidence -- and there's more -- you avoided saying whether obstruction charges were warranted. Why?
The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has issued an opinion that a prosecutor cannot indict a sitting president while he's in office. The report not only accepts that rule; it endorses its reasoning.
"A federal criminal accusation against a sitting president would place burdens on the president's capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct," the report says.
Are you saying that if the president committed obstruction of justice, the proper remedy is for Congress to consider impeachment?
I never used the word "impeachment." I used "constitutional processes." But yes, that's what I meant.

Texto completo: Clare Bronfman, heredera del imperio licorero Seagram’s, se declaró culpable ayer en un tribunal del distrito neoyorquino de Brooklyn por el caso de la secta sexual Nxivm, acusada de tráfico y esclavitud en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Bronfman (40) era considerada la directora de operaciones de la organización Nxvim, junto con su fundador, Keith Raniere, y la actriz Allison Mack, de la serie de televisión “Smallville”.
El 8 de abril, Mack (36) admitió la culpabilidad de dos cargos de crimen organizado y conspiración, pero aún tiene pendientes otros relacionados con tráfico sexual, usurpación de identidad y blanqueo de dinero.
Raniere (58) es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de quince años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.
Además de Bronfman, también se espera que se declare culpable otra de los miembros del grupo, Kathy Russell, apuntaron medios locales.
El pasado 13 de marzo, la presidenta de Nxivm, Nancy Salzman, también se declaró culpable de conspiración para crimen organizado, robo de identidad y alteración de documentación. Otra acusada es su hija Lauren Salzman.
Así, Raniere es el único de los acusados que podría acabar enfrentándose a un juicio , destacó EFE.
Raniere ha negado todos los cargos presentados contra él. Su abogado, Marc Agnifilo, ha informado que piensan ir a juicio, y se mostró aliviado de que Bronfman y Russell no vayan a pasar por el proceso judicial, ya que no cree que “se las debía haber acusado”.
La fiscalía acusa a estos miembros de la cúpula directiva de Nxivm de una serie de crímenes, entre ellos conspirar para cometer robo de identidad, blanquear dinero, tráfico sexual, extorsión y posesión de pornografía infantil.
En abril de 2018 Raniere fue deportado desde México tras ser acusado formalmente en un tribunal de Nueva York.
En 1998, este supuesto gurú de la motivación personal creó la organización “Programas Ejecutivos de Éxito”, a través de la cual impartía talleres de cinco días por los que cobraba hasta $5 mil dólares.
Años más tarde fundó Nxivm, la secta que estableció en el norte de Nueva York y donde obligaba a los asistentes a tomar clases adicionales a mayor precio y a traer a otras personas para “ascender” dentro de los rangos internos de la organización y así obtener “privilegios”.
En 2015, Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes”, donde él era el único hombre y líder. La secta operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.

Texto completo: Imagine that. Playoff thrills locally, after all.
It was supposed to be over by now. The Lakers left us months ago except for their managerial meltdown. The Clippers were supposed to be finished off by Golden State before anyone noticed they were in the postseason.
Instead, in yet another miracle, the Clippers staged the biggest playoff comeback in NBA history, coming from 31 down to win Game 2 in Oakland to make a series of it, after making a season of it when no one expected that.
Or, as Coach Doc Rivers told his players: “We don’t die. We multiply. We’re like roaches.”
Whatever they are, they have a promising future as well as a lot of heart, about to pursue Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard with salary cap space, with charismatic figures such as Rivers and Jerry West to lead their recruiting effort and an inspiring story to tell.
Then there are the Lakers … or there would be if they weren’t in hiding.
Since Magic Johnson dropped the big one on them – 12 days ago – no team official has appeared in public. This suggests its own message:
The Lakers’ road ahead involves massive secrecy and an inability to handle hard times?
Suggesting how overwhelmed Jeanie Buss is, she hasn’t told her people to make an appearance, or said anything herself, other than her flowery Twitter paean to Johnson (“Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.”)
Did Jeanie miss the one about someone trying to pin the blame for drafting Lonzo Ball on her?
Oh, well, kids fight in the best of families.
There has been no sign of General Manager Rob Pelinka, whom Buss is standing by after Magic reportedly tried to fire him for “back-stabbing” him.
LeBron James, the mainstay of social media, has yet to mention Magic’s departure or his own hopes going forward.
Of course, no one has glimpsed the secretive Kobe Bryant, who declined Jeanie’s offer to take over with Magic in 2017 and doesn’t look interested in doing it now.
If no one knows what’s going on, it’s likely that she has reached out to Bryant.
A source says Kobe’s importance to Jeanie explains why Pelinka, Kobe’s former agent whom Magic gored, remains in place with enhanced powers and no thought of replacing him.
Elsewhere, Pelinka is regarded with open skepticism. The New York Times’ Marc Stein called him “a polarizing figure” with “numerous reports of trust issues – not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises.”
Actually, “broken promises,” or reassurances that don’t turn out to be true, are common enough for GMs.
Nevertheless, Pelinka did, indeed, have a controversy-filled career as an agent. Now in the bullseye after Magic’s accusations – if only for joking, “Where’s Earvin?” – the buzzards have come home to roost.
As for any hope that Bryant will ride to the rescue, he’s not one to agonize about decisions. If he had any interest in taking over, we would have heard about it by now.
Kobe isn’t taking questions about it but did in March, telling Slam Magazine’s Tzvi Twersky, “The answer is no, I’m not doing it.
“I’m not interested … not even (for) a couple years. I’m just not interested. I don’t want to be a GM. I don’t want to own a team. I don’t want to coach. I have no interest in any of that. That’s an easy answer for me.”
Of course, Kobe might still be in the loop, even if he has no desire to run anything day by day. As such, he’s like the man behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.”
Whether Kobe’s counsel is helpful remains to be seen. Bold and intelligent as he is, he has no experience running teams and enthusiastically endorsed Magic’s half-baked idea about not needing shooters.
In a perfect irony, there is one former Lakers great who’s still in the game and would have been invaluable. Of course, that’s West, whom the Lakers – presumably, Magic – declined to hire when he was hoping to be invited back.
Jeanie is widely considered good people, but her obsession with Lakers Family … which she treasures as her birthright from the father she worshiped … keeps her from thinking clearly, or at all.
Outside her cocoon, it looks like they’ve gone as far as they can with former Lakers … the approach that backfired so badly with Magic proving temperamentally unsuited to his job … but it’s continuing.
With the Lakers’ marquee stature and the vast resources conferred by a $3 billion TV deal, they should attract top management people like Golden State GM Bob Myers, San Antonio’s R.C. Buford, Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti or Houston’s Daryl Morey.
Reaching out to them would have meant asking their teams for permission. Nothing like that happened.
The well-regarded David Griffin, a LeBron ally as Cleveland GM, was available. With no Lakers interest, he accepted a job with New Orleans days after Magic stepped down.
“Jeanie is great,” a GM said, “but she is too insulated and has made no effort to expand her knowledge base outside the Laker family. They won’t get A.D. (Anthony Davis) because they don’t have the best package.”
Ominously for whoever’s in charge, the Lakers’ scheduled return to greatness is based on acquiring Davis in a trade with New Orleans, which looks ever-more problematic.
For months, I wrote the Lakers were the favorites as A.D.’s preferred destination. Now NBA people say several Western Conference contenders, desperate at being capped by the Warriors, could make attractive offers without assurances he will re-sign in the summer of 2020.
Teams never used to run such risks, but things have changed.
Toronto did it a year ago, trading DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio for Leonard.
Presti did it two years ago, trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for Paul George, who was supposedly Lakers-bound but re-signed in OKC. If that wasn’t enough, Presti might be ready to offer Steven Adams for A.D.
Houston, run by Morey, another tightrope walker, could offer Clint Capela.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Trail Blazers players are wooing A.D. openly, as if they were Lakers.
“I’m saying, ‘OK, Anthony Davis, we’ve got a winning culture. We win. We’re not jealous of each other. We have a good time,’ ” Damian Lillard told The Ringer.
“He’ll win. He’ll get to be himself and he’ll get to be on a team that fits. I think he would be perfect for us.”
By week’s end, the Warriors had reasserted themselves, leading the Clippers by 36 in Game 3 at Staples Center and winning by 27, showing what happens when you get them mad.
Still, it was magical for the Clippers, if only for the three days between Games 2 and 3.
As for the Lakers, everyone might have to scale down hopes. At present, their fans just want to make sure they haven’t left town.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election identified 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. Mueller said in his report that he could not conclusively determine that Trump had committed a crime or that he hadn’t. The following are the 10 instances.
Pressure on Comey
to end Flynn probe
This includes the president’s statement to then-FBI Director James Comey regarding the investigation of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump told Comey: “I hope you can see your way to letting this go.”
President’s reaction
to continuing probe
Among the evidence is the president telling then-White House counsel Don McGahn to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation and Trump’s subsequent anger at Sessions. Trump also contacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders to ask them to push back publicly on the suggestion that Trump had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.
Firing of Comey
and aftermath
Mueller’s report says “substantial evidence” indicates Trump’s decision to fire Comey in May 2017 was the result of the FBI director’s unwillingness to say publicly that Trump was not personally under investigation. On the day after Trump fired Comey, the president told Russian officials that he had “faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”
Appointment of special counsel, removal efforts
Trump reacted to news of Mueller’s appointment by telling advisers it was “the end of his presidency.” The president told aides Mueller had conflicts of interest and should have to step aside. His aides told Trump the asserted conflicts were meritless. Following media reports that Mueller’s team was investigating whether the president had obstructed justice, Trump called then-White House counsel Don McGahn at home and directed him to have Mueller removed. McGahn refused.
Further efforts
to curtail probe
Trump instructed former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to have Sessions publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was “very unfair” to the president, the president had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with Mueller to limit him to “investigating election meddling for future elections.”
Efforts to prevent
public disclosure
In summer of 2017, Trump learned the news media planned to report on the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials and Russians offering derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. The president directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up the meeting. Before the emails became public, the president also edited a press statement for Donald Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was “with an individual who (Trump Jr.) was told might have information helpful to the campaign.”
Efforts to have
Sessions take control
At several points in between July 2017 and December 2017, Trump tried to get Sessions to declare he was no longer recused from the Russia investigation and would assert control over it. The report says there’s evidence that one purpose of asking Sessions to step in was so that the attorney general would restrict the investigation’s scope.
Trump orders McGahn
to deny firing attempt
In an Oval Office meeting in February 2018, Trump told McGahn to “correct” a New York Times story that reported Trump had earlier instructed McGahn to fire Mueller. Trump also asked why McGahn had told Mueller’s investigators about the directive to remove Mueller. McGahn told Trump he had to tell the investigators the truth.
Trump’s actions toward Flynn, Manafort
Mueller looked at whether Trump’s sympathetic messages to Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort and others were intended to limit their cooperation with Mueller’s investigation.
Trump actions
toward Cohen
Mueller noted that Trump’s conduct toward Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise to castigation after Cohen began cooperating with prosecutors. The evidence could “support an inference that the president used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter” cooperation and undermine Cohen’s credibility, Mueller wrote.

Texto completo: The National Enquirer along with its sister publications is reportedly being sold to James Cohen, CEO of Hudson Media Inc.
America Media Inc. is selling the Enquirer and other tabloids to Cohen, who is part of the family that founded Hudson News Distributors, the leading magazine distributor on the East Coast, according to the Washington Post.
The sale is expected to reduce AMI's debt to $355 million, the Washington Post reported, citing a person familiar with the company's finances.
Representatives of AMI and Hudson Media did not respond to requests for comment.
Earlier this month, New York-based AMI, owner of the Enquirer and the Globe and National Examiner, said its board had concluded a strategic operational review of its tabloid business, which began in August, leading to the decision to explore strategic options for the brands.
The move will "likely result in their sale in the near future," the company said in a release.
Among the potential bidders was supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle, who controls L.A.-based Yucaipa Cos., according to the New York Times. A spokesman for Burkle denied he was buying the Enquirer.
The tabloid has drawn the growing scrutiny of federal prosecutors for its ties to President Trump during the 2016 campaign.
AMI's decision to sell comes on the heels of the Jeff Bezos scandal in which the Amazon founder accused the Enquirer of extortion using leaked text messages and nude photos that the publication had obtained. Bezos claimed that the Enquirer was threatening him after he attempted to investigate the publication over its earlier articles about his extramarital affair with TV host Lauren Sanchez.
Though the Enquirer has long had a reputation for using questionable tactics to score celebrity scoops, the Bezos scandal put a new spotlight on AMI Chairman David Pecker, a former accountant who took over the company in 1999.
Pecker has been a longtime friend of Trump and has admitted employing catch-and-kill techniques to protect Trump from unfavorable stories. American Media paid $150,000 to buy a story from a Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump.

Satisfy your soul; Aretha Franklin's long-dormant soulful and uplifting '72 concert film; 'Amazing Grace' ****

Texto completo: A massive rookie mistake - director Sydney Pollack and his 16 millimeter film crew forgot to use a clapperboard synchronizing the sound with the image for each new take - delivered roughly 20 hours of footage captured for the 1972 Aretha Franklin concert film "Amazing Grace" into a maddening purgatory. There it stayed for nearly half a century.
But now it's here. For a concert movie of straightforward, self-effacing technique, "Amazing Grace" delivers one of the purest, most concentrated blasts of satisfaction in a long, long time. Franklin was 29 at the time she recorded the best-selling gospel album in history. For anyone who grew up with the double album on the stereo, seeing her record renditions of the title song, Marvin Gaye's "Wholy Holy" and so many more will bring them closer to what they already adore.
For sinful newcomers to the album, it's 87 minutes of better late than never.
Franklin recorded with the 25-member Southern California Community Choir, inside the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in the LA neighborhood of Watts. Backed by a four-piece band, Franklin, the super-smooth Rev. James Cleveland (on screen nearly as much as Franklin) and exuberant choir director Alexander Hamilton's singers split the session into two evenings.
The second night brought, among others, Mick Jagger into the church. He's seen, fleetingly, sitting in the back; Pollack and his crew can be seen in "Amazing Grace" hustling, weaving around, trying to get as close to the music and what it meant for those people, in that church, on those nights.
The close-ups say it all. Beads of sweat intermingle with Franklin's blue eye shadow, and at times she seems to be blinking back tears. This is hard work in a place of worship; the joy it brings out in the crowd is the undeniable result.
The call-outs, spontaneous bursts of dance and shouts of affirmation from the choir and the audience, especially during "Amazing Grace" but throughout the entire film, serve as a glorious reminder that sometimes all a filmmaker needs to do is be there, and be awake and responsive to the talent.
"Amazing Grace" finally fell together thanks to the tireless efforts of producer and music executive Alan Elliott. Near the end of her life, Franklin sued and was granted an emergency injunction against the finished film's planned 2015 unveiling at the Telluride Film Festival. Shortly after Franklin's death last year, Elliott came to an agreement with Franklin's estate for the release.
There are a hundred little stories going on in "Amazing Grace," some unrelated to the music. Bassist Chuck Rainey told The New York Times recently that Franklin felt marginalized by her own movie, probably owing to the screen time afforded Cleveland (her childhood mentor) and, on the second night, the big-footing presence of her father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin. His imposing, vaguely patronizing speech seems to turn Franklin into a meeker, compliant version of her adult self.
Even if Aretha Franklin doesn't dominate every second of "Amazing Grace," she's indisputably the reason the film exists, and the reason it's so good. Her voice could lift people straight out of their seats in jubilation; her vocal flourishes and deep readings of the simplest, most elemental lyrics remain incomparable. When she sings "my soul is satisfied," she's speaking for anyone listening to what she achieved here, in this Watts church with the walls painted various shades of blue, like countless prom tuxes of the era. "Satisfying" doesn't really do it justice, but it's a start.

Texto completo: BARR TESTIMONY
Attorney General William Barr is expected to testify before the Senate and House judiciary committees on May 1 and May 2, where lawmakers are likely to bombard the attorney general with questions on the investigation. Barr also spoke before Senate and House subcommittees last week, reiterating a stance that minimizes the Mueller report's findings.
THE UNREDACTED REPORT
Saying they believe Barr is protecting the president by not publicly sharing the full Mueller investigation, Democrats are likely to continue to press the attorney general to turn over the full, unredacted report.
The House Judiciary Committee has already voted to authorize a subpoena for Mueller's full report and all evidence gathered by investigators. A court battle could ensue.
WILL MUELLER TESTIFY?
If the House Judiciary Committee gets its way, yes. The committee's top members have called on Mueller to testify following receipt of the full report and Barr's testimony in early May.
Mueller has not made any public statements about the report or his plans to testify. Barr said Thursday morning he had no objection to Mueller testifying.
RELATED probeS
n
Federal prosecutors in New York are still investigating the hush-money payments that led Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, to plead guilty last year to campaign-finance violations. There are mounting indications the probe is winding down, but a federal judge this year ordered portions of a search warrant to be kept secret until prosecutors tell him the investigation has concluded. Cohen helped orchestrate six-figure payments to a porn actress, Stormy Daniels, and a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep them quiet during the campaign about alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen has implicated Trump in the case, saying he ordered the payments and later reimbursed him for his efforts.
n
In all, Mueller's team said it referred 14 cases to prosecutors in other jurisdictions, including the Cohen case, which was handled by the Southern District of New York.
A dozen of those investigations were blacked out of Mueller's report because those inquiries remain ongoing. It's not clear whether they will result in any charges.
n
New York's attorney general has opened a civil investigation into Cohen's allegations that Trump exaggerated his wealth to obtain loans. Letitia James, a Democrat, issued subpoenas last month to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank seeking loan applications and other records related to Trump real estate projects and his failed 2014 bid to buy the Buffalo Bills.
James' office is also overseeing a lawsuit alleging Trump turned his charitable foundation into a wing of his White House campaign. The Trump Foundation reached a deal in December to fold and distribute about $1.7 million in remaining funds, but the lawsuit is continuing as James seeks millions of dollars in restitution and an order banning Trump and his three eldest children from running any New York charities for 10 years.
At the same time, New York's insurance regulator is investigating Cohen's allegations that Trump also misled insurance companies about his financial worth and the state's tax department has said it's "vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation" into a New York Times story last October that reported Trump and his family cheated tax authorities for decades. New York City also said it would investigate.

Federal prosecutors in New York are also investigating Trump's inaugural committee, which raised an unprecedented $107 million to celebrate his election.

Texto completo: President Trump’s anger over then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal from the Russia investigation was “not a surprise” to one of his top advisers at the time, according to special counsel Robert Mueller.

Trump “expressed anger” about Sessions’ decision in March of 2017, the day after the former Alabama lawmaker announced that he would not oversee any federal investigations into the 2016 campaign due to his role as an adviser during the election. His recusal left Trump feeling vulnerable, but then-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon defended the decision.

“Bannon recalled telling the President that Sessions's recusal was not a surprise and that before the inauguration they had discussed that Sessions would have to recuse from campaign-related investigations because of his work on the Trump Campaign,” the report said.

Trump fumed at Sessions publicly for months. "Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” he told the New York Times in July of 2017.

Sessions announced the recusal while fending off accusations that he had lied to lawmakers about his contacts with the Russian government, but he maintained at the time that he was in the process of evaluating his ethical obligations before that controversy emerged.

“Sessions believed the decision to recuse was not a close call, given the applicable language in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which Sessions considered to be clear and decisive,” Mueller’s report said. "Sessions got the impression, based on calls he received from White House officials, that the President was very upset with him and did not think he had done his duty as Attorney General.”

The report indicates Bannon and then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus were protective of Sessions after the embattled attorney general complied with Trump’s request to submit a letter of resignation in May of 2017.

“Priebus told Sessions it was not good for the President to have the letter because it would function as a kind of ‘shock collar’ that the President could use any time he wanted,” the Mueller report notes. “Priebus said the President had ‘DOJ by the throat.’ Priebus and Bannon told Sessions they would attempt to get the letter back from the President with a notation that he was not accepting Sessions's resignation.”

All three officials would eventually be pushed out amid various controversies. Priebus was ousted in July of 2017 , during Anthony Scaramucci's brief tenure as the White House communications director tasked with identifying advisers responsible for embarrassing media leaks. Bannon was forced out a month later.

Sessions remained in place until after the 2018 midterm elections, the subject of regular criticism from the president throughout his tenure, and was eventually replaced by current Attorney General William Barr.

"As the Special Counsel’s report makes clear, the Russian government sought to interfere in our election," Barr said Thursday morning. "But thanks to the Special Counsel’s thorough investigation, we now know that the Russian operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump or the Trump campaign – or the knowing assistance of any other Americans for that matter. That is something that all Americans can and should be grateful to have confirmed."

Reporters throw tantrum over a press briefing that has not happened

Texto completo: Journalists who have bungled the Russian collusion story for the last two years are getting ahead of the release of the special counsel report Thursday by hinting strongly at the idea that the fix is in for President Trump.

Because they have come this far being wrong. Why not keep a good thing going?

Attorney General William Barr will hold a press briefing with Justice Department reporters at 9:30 a.m. Thursday morning to discuss the forthcoming release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s completed two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Barr is expected to take questions. The DOJ will then release two separate versions of the Mueller report; one will have minimal redactions, which will go to select members of Congress, and another version will have an increased number of redactions to comply with the Roger Stone gag order. The second version is the one that will be made available to the public.

To be clear: The press briefing has not yet taken place, and no one outside of select White House and DOJ attorneys has read the Mueller report. Yet certain straight news reporters are willing to declare a conspiracy anyway.

At CNN, senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju, who is personally responsible for a major collusion “fuck-up” in 2017, got heavy with the innuendo, tweeting, “If true, this means Barr will have released a four-page letter outlining findings, spent three-plus weeks with special counsel redacting report, had discussions between DOJ and the WH about report and Barr will hold presser – all before Congress and public have seen report.”

“Sorry but this is not a press conference – it’s an opportunity for Barr to put a spin on the ball or defend himself,” the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, who has a history of botched collusion reporting of her own, tweeted Thursday. “No one can ask real questions here.”

Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post's factchecker on Wednesday night declared the Thursday morning press conference a "pathetic effort[] to spin apparently bad news in Washington."

It is possible Barr is playing a dirty trick. It is possible everything is exactly as rotten and corrupt as these reporters suggest. Anything is possible, especially with the powerful.

But shouldn't we at least wait for something to happen Thursday before flirting with the idea that the attorney general is engaged directly in an active cover-up of serious crimes, including the possible Kremlin infiltration of the White House, and that the DOJ press conference is all part of the scam?

Here is a crazy idea: Let's wait and see what happens at the press conference. Let's also read the Mueller report. After that, let’s circle back and compare notes. Let’s wait before we hint and wink at a narrative suggesting serious wrongdoing at the highest levels of the U.S. government. It is not like we have been consistently wrong on the collusion story for the last two years or anything.

‘Think like an old person’

Texto completo: In our daily life, aging and dying are not topics that most of us want to confront.
We live in a time when youth and beauty are constantly revered, and must be preserved at any cost, particularly in the age of Instagram selfies and Facebook humble bragging. Wrinkles, gray hair and aching joints have no place in the perfect universe of social media and carefully crafted lifestyle stories which broadly cater to the 18-25 age group.
But John Leland, author of “Happiness Is a Choice You Make,” wasn’t interested in the comings and goings of Millennials or their younger Gen Z counterparts.
He wanted to only look at the lives of ‘the oldest of the old.”Leland, a reporter for The New York Times, was recently at the West Boynton Beach library for a Writers LIVE! event.
He began to chronicle the lives of a group of seniors that he selected for a Times story titled “85 & Up,” which he would later expand into a book that would give more insight into a series of life lessons that these older New Yorkers had given him.
For Leland, choosing the people that he would profile in both the Times and his book, was the fun part.
“I spent a couple of months just looking for older people and trying to meet as many as I could,” Leland said. “I went to senior centers, assisted living facilities, book groups and public libraries and friends of friends. I also looked for people who were foreign born, different levels of mobility, classes and races. I wanted their portrayals not to be similar to each other.”
Leland himself had recently gone through a divorce and was just starting a new relationship, which fueled his interest about how America’s older population felt about the difficulties of getting older.
“They have real challenges, and go through their ups and downs like everyone else,” Leland said. “But they don’t worry as much about the future like some of us.”
Modern society constantly refuses to hear the voices of older people because they are believed to have opinions that are considered obsolete and no longer relevant, he said. “If somebody traveled to the far ends of the earth, we would think: ‘What can we learn from this person? We wouldn’t dismiss them so easily. These people have traveled to the far end of aging, so don’t we want to know what they’ve learned, what they can share with us and how we can put it to use in our lives now?”
Leland spoke to University of Florida associate professor of sociology Monika Ardelt, who is examining the details of “elder wisdom.”
“At the end of life you have the whole book in front of you,” Ardelt told Leland. “Sometimes younger generations don’t want to listen. But you take something away from the last stage of life.”In addition to seniors’ idea
of happiness, there was something else that Leland touched on during his conversations with his interview subjects: the often unmentionable topic of sex in old age.
He explains that the idea of older people no longer engaging in sex, is a damaging misconception. “Love among the elderly is a topic that many see as squeamish,” Leland states in the book. “Sagging skin, fragile bones, poor circulation, growing memory gaps — these aren’t exactly the stuff celebrated in Victoria’s Secret ads or chick flicks.”
The only couple Leland interviewed, Helen Moses and Howie Zeimer, live in an assisted living facility which encourages relationships as a way to keep patients emotionally healthy, while constantly monitoring for signs in behavior that may indicate someone is unhappy with a partner.
“I wanted to portray this couple who met later in life and had the courage to love one another,” Leland said of Moses and Zeimer, who have a 21-year age difference between them. “I think that takes a lot of guts particularly after nursing a spouse in their final years.”
The idea of older people and sex as an uncomfortable notion is something we should just get over. “It’s a way of not having to think about them having sex, fitting them into either the cute older person or ‘the dirty old man.’ These labels are just ways to dismiss people.”
But despite seeing many of the seniors living life as best they could through their final years, death was something that was imminent, particularly in a group of people who were already in their 90s. Before the book was published, Leland experienced what he referred to as “a great sadness” in his life: the deaths of two of his subjects, Fred Jones and John Sorensen.
But conversely, he was equally happy to see that the others were absolutely thrilled with the book. “They got to see themselves in the Times and in a bestselling book, how fun is that?” Leland said. “People at that age feel invisible. They’re not asked about their opinions, they think no one cares about what they have to say. I came into their lives and told them that what they were going through was important, and I believe that meant something to them.”
One of the most compelling parts of the book, is a conversation Leland had with Jones about the meaning of happiness. Leland told Jones that, for him, happiness was “a sense of purpose and worth.” The older man, with a smile, cheerfully contradicted him. “Happiness to me is what’s happening now,” Jones said. “Not the next world; it’s not the dance you’re going to tonight. If you’re not happy at the present time, then you’re not happy.”
Leland also remembered something that Jonas Mekas, a famous independent filmmaker he interviewed for the project, had told him.
“I work in a newsroom where we’re obsessed with politics, with the wave after wave of negative stories that cover any political situation,” Leland said. “But something Jonas said stayed with me. He told me ‘I’ll worry when something happens. Why waste time worrying if nothing has happened? I’ll worry when the time comes.’ It made me understand that most of the time, the sky isn’t actually falling.
“Most of us live with this future every day, laboring under its weight,” Leland said. “To think like an old person, is to journey unencumbered.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election identified 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. Mueller said in his report that he could not conclusively determine that Trump had committed a crime or that he hadn't.
A look at the 10 instances:
PRESSURE ON COMEY TO END PROBE OF MICHAEL FLYNN
This includes the president's statement to then-FBI Director James Comey regarding the investigation of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump told Comey: "I hope you can see your way to letting this go."
PRESIDENT'S REACTION TO THE CONTINUING RUSSIA INVESTIGATION
Among the evidence is the president telling then-White House counsel Don McGahn to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation and Trump's subsequent anger at Sessions. Trump also contacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders to ask them to push back publicly on the suggestion that Trump had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.
FIRING OF COMEY AND AFTERMATH
Mueller's report says "substantial evidence" indicates Trump's decision to fire Comey in May 2017 was the result of the FBI director's unwillingness to say publicly that Trump was not personally under investigation. On the day after Trump fired Comey, the president told Russian officials that he had "faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off."
APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL AND EFFORTS TO REMOVE HIM
Trump reacted to news of Mueller's appointment by telling advisers that it was "the end of his presidency." The president told aides that Mueller had conflicts of interest and should have to step aside. His aides told Trump the asserted conflicts were meritless. Following media reports that Mueller's team was investigating whether the president had obstructed justice, Trump called then-White House counsel Don McGahn at home and directed him to have Mueller removed. McGahn refused.
FURTHER EFFORTS TO CURTAIL THE SPECIAL COUNSEL's INVESTIGATION
Trump instructed former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to have Sessions publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was "very unfair" to the president, the president had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with Mueller to limit him to "investigating election meddling for future elections."
EFFORTS TO PREVENT PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE
In summer of 2017, Trump learned that the news media planned to report on the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials and Russians offering derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. The president directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up the meeting. Before the emails became public, the president also edited a press statement for Donald Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was "with an individual who (Trump Jr.) was told might have information helpful to the campaign."
ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO HAVE SESSIONS TAKE CONTROL OF INVESTIGATION
At several points in between July 2017 and December 2017, Trump tried to get Sessions to declare that he was no longer recused from the Russia investigation and would assert control over it. The report says there's evidence that one purpose of asking Sessions to step in was so that the attorney general would restrict the investigation's scope.
TRUMP ORDERS WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO DENY THAT PRESIDENT TRIED TO FIRE MUELLER
In an Oval Office meeting in February 2018, Trump told McGahn to "correct" a New York Times story that reported Trump had earlier instructed McGahn to fire Mueller. Trump also asked why McGahn had told Mueller's investigators about the directive to remove Mueller. McGahn told Trump he had to tell the investigators the truth.
TRUMP'S ACTIONS TOWARD, FLYNN, MANAFORT AND OTHER POSSIBLE WITNESSES
Mueller looked at whether Trump's sympathetic messages to Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort and others were intended to limit their cooperation with Mueller's investigation. When Flynn began cooperating with prosecutors, Trump passed word through his lawyer that he still had warm feeling for Flynn and asked for a "heads up" if Flynn knew of information implicating Trump. Trump praised Manafort during and after his criminal convictions, and refused to rule out a pardon for his former campaign chairman.
TRUMP ACTIONS TOWARD MICHAEL COHEN
Mueller noted that Trump's conduct toward Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise to castigation after Cohen began cooperating with prosecutors. The evidence could "support an inference that the president used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter" cooperation and undermine Cohen's credibility, Mueller wrote.

Texto completo: Seeing the iconic church on fire was stunning. After firefighters extinguished the inferno, the heartbreaking scenes of the charred church, which had been a beloved home for generations of her family, were almost too much for Monica Harris.
"Seeing the church in the condition it is now," the 57-year-old Christian said for a story in The New York Times, "it’s almost like losing a family member."
That loss, and the beauty destroyed by that blaze, hadn’t even had time to register before a man of the cloth added some perspective.
"They burned down a building. They didn’t burn down our spirit," he said.
The gofundme rebuilding fund for three overwhelmingly black churches burned in Louisiana in the past month had topped out under $100,000 until Monday’s fire at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris reignited the cause. None of those structures was on par with the world-famous, centuries-old, magnificent cathedral of Notre Dame, but black churches matter. As of Wednesday, online donations for the three black churches were nearing the $1.8 million goal. Donations for Notre Dame are expected to top $1 billion.
"As we hold Paris in our thoughts today, let’s also send some love to our neighbors in Louisiana," Hillary Clinton tweeted Tuesday. Journalist Yashar Ali and CNN anchor Jake Tapper posted similar tweets asking people to remember those black churches, too.
As the world watched the flames consuming the iconic spire of the cathedral of Notre Dame, people used words such as heartbreaking and tragic to describe the damage to the centuries-old architectural wonder, which is a monument to Christianity. But one of the first online comments I read came from a suburban Catholic priest, who noted, "This is really, tragically sad. But God is NOT confined to even beautiful and ancient structures." He went on to explain how asylum-seekers and other people suffering hardships deserve that same outpouring of empathy and assistance.
Easter celebrates the belief that Jesus Christ was crucified and rose from the dead, the keystone of the Christian faith. But it also offers a more universal message that bad things can get better. Easter signals hope and a new start.
On the same day Notre Dame was burning, every Major League Baseball player, coach and umpire wore a No. 42 jersey to honor Jackie Robinson, the first black player allowed to play in the majors. It is heartbreaking and tragically sad that there was a time when black players were banned from the National Pastime, but in honoring Robinson, we celebrate how the world can change for the better.
At the same time, we can continue to find it heartbreaking and tragically sad that MLB now is investigating racist messages sent to Carl Edwards Jr., a relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs who got off to a bad start this season and happens to be black.
Clearly, today’s world gives us plenty of opportunities to right wrongs and make bad things better. Louisiana officials on Monday charged a 21-year-old white man with arson and hate crimes in connection with the fires set at the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, as well as the St. Mary Baptist Church in nearby Port Barre.
Every cowardly and hateful act can inspire a commitment to decency and good in others. Not only can we take some comfort in the fact nobody died in any of these tragic church fires, we can also find something good in the response of ordinary people.

Texto completo: Jonah Hill's directorial debut hits Amazon. And Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell star in "Bad Moms," on FX.
What's Streaming
MID90S (2018) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. A "Street Fighter II" T-shirt. CDs by the Brooklyn hip-hop duo Gang Starr. A straight-to-tape Sony camcorder. This directorial debut from Jonah Hill doubles as an exhibition of artifacts from a skateboarders' slice of 1990s California culture, bottling up the feeling of that time and place through the eyes of a young protagonist. That would be Stevie (Sunny Suljic), a 13-year-old in Los Angeles who starts hanging out with a group of older skaters. Structured loosely as, well, a day in the life of a young person skating with friends, the movie follows Stevie as he rides, smokes and roughhouses his way into teenage life, ricocheting (emotionally and physically) off his troubled older brother (Lucas Hedges) and transforming before the eyes of his mother (Katherine Waterston). In his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that, "Like its hero, 'Mid90s' struggles to figure out what it wants to be, and the struggle makes it interesting as well as occasionally frustrating."
LORDS OF DOGTOWN (2005) Stream on Amazon and Crackle; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This movie is a fictionalized account of the maturation of skateboarding, centered on the mid-70s skating boom in Los Angeles. Heath Ledger plays Skip Engblom, a figure behind a Santa Monica surfboard shop that was key to skating's popularity; Emile Hirsch plays a member of a crew that starts there. The movie was written by the pioneering skater Stacy Peralta, and directed by Catherine Hardwicke. A. O. Scott noted in his review for The Times that Hardwicke and Peralta share "an enthusiastic interest in young people that is neither condescending nor exploitative." And he wrote that their movie "from start to finish, is pretty much a blast."
OVERBOARD (2018) Stream on Amazon and Hulu; rent on Amazon. A gender-swapped take on the 1987 Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell comedy "Overboard," this movie stars Anna Faris as a single mom who convinces a wealthy, snotty and, after a yacht-related incident, amnesiac playboy (Eugenio Derbez) that he's her husband. Lighthearted by design, "this remake actually makes the innocuous original look edgy by comparison," wrote Glenn Kenny in his review for The Times. To compare, see OVERBOARD (1987), at 10 p.m. on Paramount Network.
What's on TV
BAD MOMS (2016) 8 p.m. on FX. Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell play Amy, Carla and Kiki, a group of freewheeling moms pushing back against bad husbands and P.T.A. politics, in this comedy from the "Hangover" writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. "What makes 'Bad Moms' funny (aside from its lineup of gifted performers) isn't that Amy and her friends go wild; they don't, not even close," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "It's the women's shared, near-orgiastic pleasure in their freedom and friendship."

What's Their Sign? The Dollar Sign, of Course

Texto completo: As an Aquarius, David Birnbaum is naturally skeptical of astrology. But as an investor, he has zero doubts about the business potential of the $2.1 billion "mystical services market." It's an area that he has been trying, unsuccessfully, to invest in for nearly two decades.
Mr. Birnbaum researched lots of astrology start-ups in the Web 1.0 era but concluded then that they were not good investments. "They were pretty much just marketplaces sending traffic off to random astrologers," he said. "They were definitely shady."
This year he finally backed one: Sanctuary, an app that can be described as "Uber for astrological readings." For $19.99 a month, you can receive a monthly one-on-one chat consultation with an astrologer. (The app also provides free daily horoscopes.)
Mr. Birnbaum's decision to back a horoscope company through Five Four Ventures, the incubator he runs, "gets a lot of grins" from people in the finance world, he said. But they get it. Astrology is having a cultural moment, and for investors, that translates to dollar signs.
In recent years astrology traded its psychedelic new-wave stigma for modern Instagrammy witch vibes, and those vibes are very popular with millennial women. This means there's money to be made. Start-ups -- professional, non-shady ones with interesting business models -- are bubbling up, eagerly raising funding from people like Mr. Birnbaum.
A few weeks after Sanctuary became available for download, Co-Star, an app that lets people download and compare their birth charts, raised just over $5 million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firms Maveron and Aspect Ventures, as well as 14W, based in New York. Co-Star's website promotes the fact that astrology allows "irrationality to invade our techno-rationalist ways of living." The app has been downloaded more than three million times. Its Instagram account has more than 400,000 followers.
Banu Guler, the chief executive and co-founder of Co-Star, said not every investor she pitched was enthusiastic about her company and that some dismissed its practice area as pseudoscience. "I get that you're not into astrology," she said, "but if you had access to a 20-something or teenager who is a girl, that's who you need to talk to."
A third app called Pattern is spreading among finance and Hollywood types; it is founded by Lisa Donovan, the co-founder of Maker Studios, which sold to Disney for $675 million. Ms. Donovan said she hasn't raised a formal round of outside funding yet.
Ms. Guler, a Scorpio with Cancer rising and moon in Leo, believes Co-Star can be "really big." Bigger than the dozens of horoscope blogs or online shops selling crystals and tarot cards. Maybe even bigger than meditation apps, one of which was recently valued at $1 billion by investors.
Meditation, Ms. Guler said, is an antisocial way of interacting with the world. She views astrology as a form of collective wellness, with Co-Star helping people relate to each other based on star signs. Another big difference between astrology and meditation's practitioners: Astrologers are not allergic to making money.
Co-Star is free, but users can pay $2.99 to compare their chart to that of a friend who isn't a member. This is where the relating comes in. They can answer questions like, "Why did we get into that insane fight and why did you shut down?" Ms. Guler said. "Is it because you're a Capricorn Mars? Maybe. So let's talk about it."
Anarghya Vardhana, a partner at Maveron and a Libra, said Co-Star has the potential to be as big as Spotify, the music streaming app worth $24 billion, or Tinder, the ubiquitous dating app owned by Match Group.
"It probably has this aura of being unscientific or whatever," Ms. Vardhana said. But Ms. Guler "did a really good job of understanding all of that and rooting it in as much science as possible." Co-Star promotes its use of artificial intelligence and data from NASA to track movements of the stars.
Ms. Guler emailed a university psychology program asking if they'd take M.R.I. scans of people while using the app to learn about how people are reacting to it. She got no response. "Having money will help with that," she said.
"Changing how we operate as humans in the world"
The casual observer might attribute astrology's surging popularity to the stereotype of the narcissistic millennial. Of course the selfie-loving nanoinfluencer generation is eager to hear that they're unique and special, no matter how woo-woo it seems. Horoscopes are a more personalized version of BuzzFeed-style identity content that's designed to be relatable and shareable: "17 Things That Only People Named Jennifer Will Understand" or "28 Signs You Were Raised By Persian Parents In America."
"What's better than something that is basically a story about you?" Mr. Birnbaum said.
But that explanation ignores what many in the astro-verse consider the major turning point for Big Zodiac: The election of Donald Trump. It changed everything, according to Aliza Kelly, the astrologer-in-residence at Sanctuary. (She writes its horoscopes and conducts some of its readings.) Watching The New York Times's forecast needle tip from Hillary Clinton to Mr. Trump raised people's doubts about certain scientifically proven systems, Ms. Kelly said. "People became so much more receptive to the idea of there being different ways of seeing the world," she said. They turned to astrology "in order to create some sense of structure and hope and stability in their lives."
President Trump's election inspired Ms. Guler to leave her work in fashion media and create Co-Star. "I was like, 'We gotta figure out something more meaningful than what we are doing," she said. The role social media played in the election -- and how "it is changing how we operate as humans in the world" was a part of her concern, Ms. Guler said.
Investors see other trends feeding into astrology's resurgence, Ms. Vardhana said. People are seeking smaller, specialized communities online, while participation in organized religion is declining. Millennials (and the rest of us) are lonely and want community, no matter how many followers we have on social media. Why wouldn't we turn to the stars and moons and planets and houses of the horoscope?
"This is a phenomenon and maybe astrology and the technology of Co-Star is well equipped to address it," Ms. Vardhana said. The challenge, she said, will be converting more mainstream skeptics without "alienating the astro-nerds."
Big Pisces Energy
A few minutes into my reading on Sanctuary's app, Ms. Kelly, my on-demand astrologer, asked me if her assessment of my birth chart rang true. According to her interpretation, last year was a very important year for me to redefine my values. As a Libra rising, my relationships are very important to me, she noted. And in the next few weeks, I should put myself out in the world to make connections :).
"Sure!" I typed into the app. It was just vague enough that if I did a little mental backbend, I could find examples to support her conclusions. I felt hesitant to share anything too personal about myself with a stranger until I remembered that by entering the date, city and precise time of day I was born, I had already bared my soul, astrologically speaking.
Sanctuary's in-app readings are bite-size, designed to answer a specific question or dilemma. Sometimes, Ms. Kelly said in an interview, you just want to know why someone is being a jerk, "or how you can best navigate that dynamic. You don't need to talk about ancestral trauma."
Ross Clark, Sanctuary's chief executive, co-founder and a Leo, estimates that there are 100,000 self-employed astrologers in the country. Sanctuary is starting with around 30, who Ms. Kelly and the Sanctuary team has helped vet and train on the company's reading system. He emphasized the app's live one-on-one connections. "We're not trying to be some sort of spiritual Alexa, where we're using AI to replace someone," he said. "If you think about the practice, it's really emotional."
The apps create a shortcut to intimacy. Armed with purported knowledge of your peers' personalities, conversations can skip over the polite get-to-know-you small talk and dive right into the ancestral trauma. In that way it doesn't even matter that the science is actually fake. It creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where perceived intimacy leads to real intimacy. Later, when I interviewed Ms. Kelly, she mentioned that this was a good story for me, a Pisces, to be doing.
Why? Because, she said, Pisces are spiritual healers and emotional philosophers. "The quest for spiritual awakening and enlightenment is what Pisces energy is all about," she said. "It's in your blood."
It felt like a convenient conclusion, given her company's interest in getting me to write a story. Then again, who was I to argue with the stars? With my blood? It felt absurd, but also just satisfying and amusing enough that I did not reject the suggestion. Instead, I said, "Sure!"

Anti-vaxx organization sues New York over measles vaccine mandate

Texto completo: An anti-vaccination organization filed a lawsuit against Williamsburg in Brooklyn, N.Y. this week over the local mandate that requires a round of measles shots for residents in the area.

The Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccination organization of which Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is a member, filed the lawsuit on Monday, claiming that the mandate violates the rights of individuals who do not want to be vaccinated, claiming that the mandate is “capricious, contrary to law” and exceeding “lawful authority.”

New York City declared a health emergency earlier this month, which resulted in local lawmakers approving the mandate, after a measles outbreak was reported in an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn.

"The irreparable harm caused to Petitioners by the emergency Orders is incalculable. Parents, whose religious beliefs are being disregarded, risk becoming criminals if they simply do nothing. Parents, who know their children’s health status better than anyone else are being threatened with the forced vaccination of their children against their wills," the lawsuit states.

"Children and their parents are being ostracized by neighbors. Because of the emergency Orders, the petitioners are being treated like pariahs, even though there is no evidence that any of them carry measles or have even been exposed to measles."

The organization's mission is push back against mainstream science, saying that the real science behind vaccines are inconclusive and should not be forced onto anyone.

"Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies showing vaccines contribute to the growing epidemics of autism, epilepsy, autoimmune disease are now easily accessible. Still, false narratives such as 'Vaccines save lives' and 'Vaccines don’t cause autism' continue to hijack the headlines, brainwashing trusting minds and causing division within the American public," the organization's mission statement reads.

"Meanwhile, thousands upon thousands of parents worldwide have publicly come forward with heartbreaking stories of their vaccine-injured children, and whistleblowers within institutions such as the CDC admit to hiding the harm vaccines are inflicting on our children."

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is eyeing a 2020 run for president, called the recent measles outbreak “very troubling” during a news conference Tuesday.

The city has seen 285 confirmed cases since the outbreak began in the fall, according to the New York Times. A total of 21 of those cases led to hospitalizations, including five admissions to the intensive care unit.

Texto completo: That's important to keep in mind in an era that finds America wading hip deep in a cascading tide of bovine effluvium. This nonsense is not harmless, not trivial, not abstract. And it always exacts a cost.
If some of us ever knew that, they have apparently forgotten. As a result, we have become a nation awash in public lies - conspiracy theories without basis, crackpot pronouncements from figures of authority, misleading, mendacious misstatements false as a four-dollar bill, delivered every minute of every day to our television, computer and smartphone screens.
Baloney is not free. Still, the price thus far has been borne by a relative few.
It has cost "only" the parent who paid in heartache when some wild-eyed conspiracist claimed that a beloved child killed in a mass shooting never existed and the shooting itself did not happen.
"Only" the African Americans who paid in deepening estrangement as the first black president was pressured into producing his birth certificate to answer baseless claims that he was not born in this country.
"Only" the pizza restaurant patrons who paid in terror as a man with a military-style assault rifle opened fire in hopes of rescuing child sex slaves he had been led to believe were imprisoned there.
But if only a few of us have paid for such baloney thus far, it looks as if the whole country might soon have to ante up.
It seems the United States is grappling with an outbreak of the measles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting that there have been 465 cases so far this year.
That means this is already the second worst year since the disease was reported eradicated in 2000. Measles has shown up in 19 states, including Michigan, Missouri, California, Texas, Georgia, New York and Florida. At the present rate, we will eclipse the previous record of 667 cases, set in 2014.
Officials say the resurgence of the highly contagious, sometimes-fatal disease is driven by the so-called "anti-vax" movement - parents who refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated because they believe the vaccine causes autism. Which it doesn't. The supposed link between vaccinations and autism stems from a 1998 study by a British doctor. The study was debunked, its findings retracted, the doctor defrocked.
But the baseless fear he raised lives on.
Now we - actually, our young children - stand to pay for the baloney he sold. The currency will be fevers, runny noses, coughs, watery eyes and rashes. It could be death.
Is that what it will take to finally bring some of us to their senses? There is, after all, something stark and undeniable about the link between cause and effect here, between anti-vaccination and outbreak.
Maybe that will show some of us how foolish it is to believe absurd untruths without the slightest evidence. Maybe it will remind them how dangerous it is to abandon the obligation of thinking critically. Maybe it will teach them how dumb it is to consider Facebook more authoritative than the CDC or the New York Times.
And maybe it will remind them that the truth doesn't care what you believe, doesn't care what you want or whom you voted for. The truth just is.
To reject that is to reject the connective tissue that makes nationhood possible, to reject any chance of greater good and common cause, to reject the very possibility of us. So this outbreak, troubling as it is, offers a timely chance for some of us to reconsider the choice to live in nonsense.
Because the cost of baloney is high. And it's getting higher all the time.

Gillibrand isn't raising a lot of money, and her campaign claims that's because of how brave she is

Texto completo: The only person in the United States with worse political instincts than Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

First, the self-professed defender of women’s rights waited until seven women had accused former Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., of groping and unwanted kissing before calling for his resignation in 2017. Seven accusers. Members of Congress are apparently allowed exactly six alleged acts of sexual misconduct before it is considered unacceptable behavior.

Now, Gillibrand and her campaign are blaming her paltry haul of $3 million in the first quarter on the role she played in ousting Franken from the Senate. Her campaign alleges in a memo obtained by the New York Times that Democratic donors are “punishing” the New York senator for “standing up for her values and for women.”

Because if there is one thing that will turn around abysmal polling and fundraising numbers during a primary, it is a direct attack on primary voters.

The Times reports:

"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s (D-N.Y.) presidential campaign suggested Sunday that the campaign’s low first-quarter fundraising totals could be partly attributed to backlash over Gillibrand’s decision in 2017 to call for the resignation of Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.).
In a memo obtained by The New York Times, the campaign reportedly said there’s “no question” that donors are retaliating in response to Gillibrand calling on Franken, who had been accused of sexual harassment, to step aside.
“There’s no question that the first quarter was adversely impacted by certain establishment donors — and many online — who continue to punish Kirsten for standing up for her values and for women,” the memo reads.
Here’s a thought: Perhaps donors are unenthusiastic about supporting Gillibrand in the 2020 Democratic primary not because she called for Franken’s resignation, but because they see her as exceedingly opportunistic, as evidenced by the fact that she flipped on her former colleague only after it appeared to be politically safe. There's a reason her fundraising numbers are low, compared with the $18.2 million raised by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the $12 million raised by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and it is not because she supposedly stood up "for her values and for women."

Maybe, like me, Democratic donors have kept track of Gillibrand’s history of all-too-convenient political “evolutions.” Perhaps they noticed that when she served in the House of Representatives between 2007 and 2009, she was pro-Second Amendment enough as to be characterized by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd as “an N.R.A. handmaiden in Bobby Kennedy’s old seat.” Perhaps they noticed that almost immediately after joining the Senate, Gillibrand actively fought against gun rights legislation she had championed as a member of the House. Perhaps donors have noted that the only thing that changed between Gillibrand boasting that she keeps “shotguns under her bed” and calling for a “women’s crusade” for stricter gun control laws is her donor and electoral base.

I am sure a fair number of donors also recall that, as a representative of an R+2 congressional district, Gillibrand used to oppose giving “amnesty to illegal aliens,” and that her overall position on immigration reform aligned closely with President Trump’s.

But now that she is a senator with presidential aspirations, many of her previous positions seem to have, ahem, shifted. Fancy that.

I think Democratic donors can be forgiven for investing their money elsewhere on candidates like Sanders, who, if nothing else, has been remarkably consistent throughout his career in Congress.

What separates Assange from the ranks of real journalists

Texto completo: They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador’s interior minister.
Assange’s behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he’s a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans — including many in the U.S. media — long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange’s publishing activities.
Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first?
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone’s personal emails and under what circumstances? One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn’t accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government’s decadeslong campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham’s bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts — all while risking great personal and financial loss — was epic.
Assange’s process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole — and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal — and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg’s charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
WikiLeaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that’s just me.

Texto completo: Aunque en redes sociales hay mensajes de júbilo de fanáticos y miembros del Estado Islámico ( ISIS ) sobre el incendio masivo que consumió gran parte de la catedral de Notre Dame en París , las autoridades indican que no están tratando el hecho como un “acto deliberado”, sino como un accidente.
Las investigaciones formales del siniestro comenzaron, reportó el New York Times, que indicó que los primeros reportes indican que el histórico inmueble permanece estructuralmente sano, pero la conflagración que destruyó el techo de madera y plomo y la aguja de encaje también dejó tres agujeros en el amplio techo abovedado. Insistieron en que no se indaga un atentado.
“Nada en esta etapa sugiere un acto voluntario” , dijo el fiscal de París, Rémy Heitz , quien señaló que la indagatoria será “larga y compleja”, e insistió que, por el momento, estaban considerando el desastre como un accidente.
El Times indicó que las autoridades destinaron a casi 50 investigadores, quienes se enfocarán en entrevistar a los trabajadores que habían abandonado el sitio, pero que habían participado en la restauración de la catedral poco antes de que se desatara el incendio .
Son varias la preguntas que han surgido, sobre todo si el siniestro pudo haberse evitado, pero es una respuesta difícil de dar, aunada a la incógnita de la verdadera causa.
“Los investigadores enfrentaron la difícil tarea de determinar una causa en la aparente ausencia de evidencia, destruida por las llamas que estallaron en el ‘bosque’ (como se le conocía), el marco de madera de vigas antiguas debajo del techo de plomo”, indicó el diario.

Wouldn’t We All Benefit From A Less Violent World?

Texto completo: Editor: It is my belief that the prevalence of guns in America presents a clear and present threat to the country and its citizens. In 2017, there were 39,773 gun casualties according to The New York Times. This number is still on the increase. There should not be this many easily preventable casualties. Any new regulation to lower this number would be a step in the right direction, especially considering there have been no new restrictions on gun ownership since 1994. If more and more Americans continue to die, and there is no action taken, these incidents fall on all of us.
It is a common argument that there will always be violent people, and if someone is determined to hurt others they will find a way. Although this is in some way true, reducing violent people’s access to deadly weapons would also reduce their potential to do harm. A weapon like a knife or a hammer is much less effective than a gun. In countries with gun bans in place, like China, there are rare instances of mass stabbings. However, because of the absence of high-powered guns that we allow our criminals to have, the number of victims and casualties are dramatically reduced. If we wanted to also take steps towards reasonable restriction, wouldn’t we all benefit from a less violent world?

But they can dream. Both maintain a busy writing schedule because it's their passion.
Badal, a retired commercial and mortgage banker who lives in the East Mountains, writes full time.
“This is what I've always wanted to do,” Badal said. “With my 14th book coming out, I've reached a point where I have a body of work I can be proud of.”
His new book is “Natural Causes Lassiter-Martinez Case Files No. 3.” It's the third in a series featuring Barbara Lassiter and Susan Martinez, detective-sergeants with the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office. In “No. 3” they're investigating a case of suspected murder by nicotine poisoning.
“I wanted to come up with a different way of killing somebody,” Badal said.
Most of his fiction fall in three series the Lassiter-Martinez Case Files, the CurtisChronicles and the six-volume Danforth Saga. The latter two series are thrillers. Badal has also written three stand-alone thrillers and short stories.
How does he manage to juggle writing books in different series with different characters?
“For me, it's regenerative,” he said in an interview. “I (would) get bored with one series. If I get bored, I'd be afraid the reader gets bored. That's why I jump into other series.”
Badal said he's never considered writing as a hobby. He recalled that it wasn't until he had spent about 10,000 hours into the process of writing that his books started selling, and as a result writing became a business for him. He has a literary agent and a publisher who are integral to his business.
“I make a good living out of my writing. That should continue if I maintain momentum. If you lose momentum, that's where you get into trouble,” he said.
More success may await Badal. He said he's sold a movie option to the Lassiter-Martinez Case Files series.
“There's something in the works,” Badal said.
Badal signs and discusses “Natural Causes” from 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday, April 20, at Treasure House Books & Gifts, 2012 S. Plaza NW, Old Town, and at 3 p.m. Sunday, April 21, at Bookworks, 4022 Rio Grande NW.
Meanwhile, Miller, a longtime Albuquerque resident, said someone has recently reached out to him, which could prove fruitful. He said he's in negotiations to option all 11 books of his Rattlesnake Lawyer series.
Miller's newest novel is “Rattlesnake & Son.” Dan Shepard is the name of the long-running character, aka the Rattlesnake Lawyer. In this novel, Shepard's 14-year-old son, Marley, suddenly shows up in Las Cruces, where he's in a boarding school.
“I based Marley on myself at age 14. I wanted to make it a fish out of water. His psychic powers are a metaphor for my writing, for my creative energy when I was 14,” Miller said. “Marley has adventures I would have loved at 14.”
A full-time attorney himself, Miller represents indigent clients in criminal cases around the state. He's under contract with the Law Offices of the State Public Defender.
For Miller, writing comes in his spare time, mostly working on his novels by night in motel rooms when he's on the road. By day, he's defending clients in different judicial districts.
Miller signs copies of “Rattlesnake & Son” from 12:30 to 3 p.m. Wednesday, April 17, at Barnes & Noble, Coronado mall.

Texto completo: Love for the color pink led to a highly successful children's book series called "Pinkalicious" about a girl who loves pink -using the color in everything from cupcake icing to her choice in clothes.
On April 27, members of the Latrobe Art Center hope an event called "The Art of Fashion: Pretty in Pink" at the Latrobe Country Club will use the popularity of pink to raise plenty of green for myriad art education and community programs that the center sponsors.
One of the inspirations for the event is The New York Times best-selling book series by author and illustrator Victorian Kann. "Pinkalicious," the children's musical, is in its 11th year off-Broadway.
"We wanted to make it fun for adults and children to participate by picking the color pink. Tablecloths, clothes, desserts and even drinks will all incorporate the color,'' organizer Rosanne Bodziak said.
And, although participants don't necessarily have to wear pink, "we think a lot of people will, with their own pink-inspired styles," she said.
Doors open at the country club at 11:30 a.m. A number of local boutiques will have 40 models walking the runway New York-style, showing off clothing and accessories in all hues.
Fashions will be featured from Chicoras in Latrobe; Black Bunny Boutique, My Honey Bee and the Tree House, all in Ligonier; and Crossroads Boutique & Cattiva, Lapels, A Fine Men's Clothier and Liz Krajc Jewelry Design Studio, all in Greensburg.
Lauren Buches, executive director of the Latrobe Art Center at 819 Ligonier St., said it hosts art classes for children and adults, a gallery for local artists, a space for young people to plug in, and a popular cafe called Ricolita's, which is open for breakfast and lunch.
"We have become something of a community center,'' Ms. Buches noted.
The work of artists from throughout the region is featured in the gallery display space and those works are typically for sale.
Betty Roseborough, an artist from Upper St. Clair, has several of her paintings featured and said she appreciates the opportunity.
"It is an excellent venue for displaying your art. The art center is an uplifting, classy place. The staff and other artists create a warm, friendly atmosphere. Everyone is encouraged there," she said.
The retired Pittsburgh Allderdice High School math teacher said she found a new calling in painting. She calls it a "creative monster, but one that is good for the soul."
The artists are limited in the number of pieces they can display, and the artist's work changes every two months so exhibits stay fresh, she said.
"The social events held by the center are a reason to celebrate art," she said.
And the art of fashion will be the one celebrated at the "Pretty in Pink" event.
"We think people will enjoy looking at the fashions, and the food is good, especially the raspberry dessert, " Ms. Bodziak said.
Tickets for the show start at $50 and those who wish to attend must RSVP by April 22. Proceeds support the mission of the Latrobe Art Center.
A chicken piccata lunch, or gluten-free and vegetarian options, and dessert is included in the ticket price. A cash bar will offer pink-themed cocktails.
An interesting twist to traditional fashion shows is the addition to the runway of upcycled and tie-dyed fashions created by the Greater Latrobe Senior High School students from Courtney Coss' family and consumer science classes and Lydia Mack's art classes.
Ms. Buches likes the fact that young people are being included in the program. She said she was inspired by the permanent art gallery at Greater Latrobe Senior High School, where she attended classes, to consider art as a career.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
There's one photograph from The New York Times archives that stands out to Misty Copeland. It's a black-and-white image of a group of young ballerinas, boys and girls, their dark skin accented by bright tights and tutus.
"They look so uncomfortable," Ms. Copeland said in a recent interview. "In ballet, we've never been told there was a place for us to fit in. You can see that within this image."
The "tension and awkwardness" that Ms. Copeland said she saw in the photo is familiar to her. She was the American Ballet Theater's first black female principal dancer. Last month, when she visited The Times to serve as a guest editor of a special print section featuring dance images from our archives, she saw those threads throughout dance history.
The section is the latest from Past Tense, which highlights stories and photographs from The Times's archives. Veronica Chambers, who leads the team, said that of the six million photos in the archives, at least 5,000 are dance-related. A dedicated section was a natural fit, as was the choice of Ms. Copeland as its guest editor, Ms. Chambers said.
"We really wanted to emphasize that dance is something that so many people do in their day-to-day lives, and make it feel like a celebration," Ms. Chambers said.
The images in the section range widely: formal ballet classes, 1970s school dances, impromptu street dancing and, of course, Studio 54 in New York City. At a TimesTalks event this month, Ms. Copeland discussed the section with Monica Drake, an assistant managing editor at The Times, and explained how her research of dance influences her performance today.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the past, Ms. Copeland has used images to research dance and to get ideas for her own work. That eye for detail came through in the selection process, Ms. Drake said.
"So while I saw cute children learning to dance, she saw stiff children who looked uncomfortable in their clothing," Ms. Drake said.
"Because dance is an inherently visual performing art, photography is especially successful at catching a glimpse of it," she added. "In looking at these images, we are seeing societal shifts in performance."
While sifting through the archives, Ms. Copeland said she was most drawn to the quiet moments between the striking poses, thrilling twirls and grand jetés.
"As a dancer, a lot of students are often thinking of the pose or image or results," Ms. Copeland said. "But as much as life and being a professional dancer is about the journey on the stage, it's the in-between moments that make those poses so powerful. You can see what they might have been feeling, create in your mind what you think that might be."
Ballet is often characterized as a pursuit of perfection, she said. "I think it's amazing when you don't see that."
Ms. Copeland was naturally drawn to groups of people while looking at the photos -- to communities. And it's no wonder; Ms. Copeland said the aspiration to be part of something bigger than herself is what drew her to ballet in the first place.
"I stumbled into it, but it's what made me love it and why I love it still today," she said.
The photos not only offered historical reference, but also influenced context for her own form, she said.
"It's hard these days; my generation is so used to moving from the waist down, this isolated release of our lower backs, twerking," she said, laughing. "Not that I've ever done it."
In ballet, it's more about the "subtle upper-body motions, that's not letting go of your center and holding on to that connection of ribs down to the hips," she added. "It's fascinating to see things in nightclubs or a school dance, to see the interaction and connection with different people."
There was something about the authentic, free energy of the candid photos that Ms. Copeland hopes ballet can harness in the future. She is wary of the idea that ballet is a dying art form or becoming irrelevant. For it to keep moving forward, she said, it's important for dancers and choreographers to "stay authentic to ourselves."

Texto completo: MADRID - A former Venezuelan spy chief has been arrested by Spanish authorities who acted on an extradition request from the United States, where he is wanted for drug trafficking.
Hugo Carvajal, who had also served as a lawmaker in President Nicolás Maduro's ruling party, was taken in by Spanish police in Madrid on Friday afternoon, the Spanish police said. He is expected to appear Saturday before a Spanish judge, who will review the extradition request.
Mr. Carvajal left Venezuela after making a dramatic break from Mr. Maduro's government and telling The New York Times in February that he had witnessed multiple members of Venezuela's government being involved in drug trafficking.
Mr. Carvajal is wanted for similar crimes himself, having been accused of taking money from a Colombian drug trafficker in an indictment that was unsealed in 2014. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Mr. Carvajal, who was then head of the country's military intelligence agency, for "protecting drug shipments from seizure by Venezuelan authorities" as well as providing weapons to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, then the country's main rebel organization.
Sudan's leader ousted
CAIRO - The Sudanese military on Friday swiftly replaced the country's transitional leader linked to the Darfur genocide after street rallies against him and said that it wouldn't hand over ousted President Omar al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity.
Thousands of jubilant protesters celebrated in the streets after Defense Minister Gen. Awad ibn Ouf, who was named de facto leader after overthrowing Mr. al-Bashir on Thursday, announced he was stepping down as transitional leader. He named a reputable army general as his successor.
Gen. Ibn Ouf said he would be replaced by Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, general inspector of the armed forces, as head of the transitional council, which will rule the country for two years until elections.
"I am confident he will steer the ship to safe shores," he said of Gen. Burhan, adding he was stepping aside to "preserve unity" of the armed forces.
EU weighs tariffs
The European Union is considering hitting 10.2 billion euros ($11.5 billion) of U.S. goods ranging from handbags to helicopters with retaliatory tariffs in a dispute over subsidies to Boeing, according to a draft list seen by Bloomberg News.
The plan follows a U.S. threat to target $11 billion of European goods ranging from helicopters to cheeses with import duties to counter state aid to Airbus. Both moves stem from parallel, 14-year-old, disputes at the World Trade Organization over market-distorting support for aircraft makers.
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, outlined its retaliation plan to trade experts from the bloc's national governments on Friday in Brussels, an official said on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were behind closed doors.
The WTO will ultimately determine the amounts of imports that both sides would be allowed to target in the two cases. On Tuesday, the commission dubbed the U.S. aim of hitting $11 billion of imports from the EU "greatly exaggerated."

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.
“I’m not a lawyer, I just play one in your documents”
“Document preparation assistance” offices have proliferated in California. You can usually recognize them by their neon signs and big window advertisements stating you can get a divorce, file bankruptcy, do your estate planning … and go home with several Ginsu knives all for $299. (I’m only kidding about the Ginsu knives. Those are extra.)
These offices are staffed with non-attorneys (and, not unheard of, disbarred attorneys) whose role is supposed to be solely to assist you in typing up your paperwork for a divorce, bankruptcy, estate planning or other legal matter. By law, they cannot give you legal advice. What could possibly go wrong?
Well, let me tell you. Here are just a few issues the document preparer cannot advise you on:
* What type of bankruptcy to file
* Is a will sufficient or do you need a trust
* How do your retirement plans or life insurance integrate with your estate plan
* How do federal laws dealing with retirement plans affect your divorce
* How can you tell if the spouse you are divorcing is hiding assets
* Can your soon-to-be ex waive spousal support forever? How about child support?
* Do you need a corporation or a limited liability company? How will that entity be taxed?
And filing incorrect immigration papers can result in permanently destroying a person’s immigration status or losing your place on the years-long INS waiting list.
When you skip the lawyers and head to a “document preparer,” you’re the one who is now “playing lawyer.” You might guess right. You might not. However it turns out, the document preparation assistance guy or gal isn’t responsible — they were just your typist.
Legal matters require legal advice. And yes, we know, it’s not cheap. But it’s cheaper than getting it wrong. If you still go to a non-lawyer, please at least make sure they’re bonded. And remember, they’re not covered by the attorney-client privilege, so anything you discuss with them is not private, and they can be called to testify against you.
The victim lawyer
This is just to make you feel better. Lawyers are becoming the victims of online scams now as well. Usually, it’s someone claiming they need legal assistance and want the lawyer to hold funds for them in the lawyer’s trust account. And guess what they need in order to send that? The lawyer’s banking information. You’re not feeling sorry for us though, are you? It’s OK. We’re used to that.
Q: Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt? A: Because deep down, they’re really good people.

Texto completo: Military ousts Sudan’s leader: CAIRO — Sudan’s military overthrew President Omar al-Bashir on Thursday after months of bloody protests against his repressive 30-year rule. Pro-democracy demonstrators welcomed the ouster but will continue their campaign after the military said it would suspend the constitution, impose a curfew and govern the country for the next two years. The whereabouts of al-Bashir, 75, are unknown, but the military said he was being held "in a safe place."
Deputy’s son arrested in fires: OPELOUSAS, La. — The suspect in a string of fires that destroyed three black churches in rural Louisiana is the white son of a sheriff’s deputy whose father helped arrange for his arrest, authorities said Thursday. Holden Matthews, 21, was jailed without bail on arson charges in connection with the blazes in and around Opelousas, a city of 16,000. Officials offered no motive for the fires. An FBI agent said investigators were still looking into whether the fires were "bias motivated."
Interior secretary confirmed: WASHINGTON — The Senate voted 56-41 Thursday to confirm acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to lead the department on a permanent basis. Democrats had complained that the former oil and gas lobbyist used his position to benefit former industry clients. Bernhardt succeeds Ryan Zinke, who resigned in January amid a series of ethics investigations.
Ohio enacts heartbeat bill: COLUMBUS, Ohio — A bill imposing one of the most stringent abortion restrictions in the nation was signed into law in Ohio on Thursday. It bans abortions after a detectable heartbeat, which can be five or six weeks into a pregnancy. In signing the bill, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine broke with his predecessor, Republican John Kasich, who had vetoed the measure twice on grounds that it was unconstitutional. The 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalized abortion up until viability, usually at 22 to 24 weeks.
Benedict on sex abuse crisis: ROME — Breaking years of silence on major church affairs, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has written a lengthy letter devoted to clerical sex abuse in which he attributes the crisis to a breakdown of church and societal moral teaching — including the sexual revolution of the 1960s, during which time seminaries were filled with "homosexual cliques." The 6,000-word letter, written for a small German Catholic publication and published in translation by other outlets Thursday, stands in stark contrast with the views of Pope Francis, who has often said abuse results from the corrupted power of clergy.
Trump’s sister leaves bench: NEW YORK — President Donald Trump’s sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia, ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a New York Times report in October alleged that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes. The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry, 82, was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York, where the case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry.
Black hole gets Hawaiian name: HILO, Hawaii — A language professor has given a Hawaiian name — Powehi — to the black hole depicted in an image produced in a landmark experiment. The world’s first image of a black hole revealed Wednesday was created using data from eight radio telescopes around the world, including two in Hawaii. "Powehi," meaning "the adorned fathomless dark creation" or "embellished dark source of unending creation," comes from an 18th century Hawaiian creation chant.

Journalist or criminal: Julian Assange, notorious for leaks of US secrets, faces computer hack charge

Resumen: The federal case against Julian Assange separates journalism from criminality

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As purveyor of secret U. S. government information, Julian Assange has few rivals.
The release of a stunning trove of sensitive diplomatic cables and entire Pentagon databases nearly a decade ago made Assange and his anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks a household names and an enemy of the American government.
Six years later, WikiLeaks published thousands of private emails involving members of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that investigators said were stolen and passed to Assange's organization working for the Russian government. That episode and others so infuriated U. S. authorities that then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo called Assange's organization a "hostile intelligence service. "
But none of those things prompted the government to call Assange a criminal.
When the U. S. government revealed its long-rumored criminal case against the WikiLeaks founder on Thursday, the leaks that made him either famous or infamous merited only scant mention.
Instead, federal prosecutors unveiled a single count outlining a simple criminal conspiracy alleging that Assange joined with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 to crack a password on a secret computer network within the Defense Department. It wasn't clear from the charges that they succeeded.
That case appeared to be the result of a yearslong struggle within the Justice Department over what to do about WikiLeaks and its famous founder, whose activities the government has said repeatedly jeopardized U. S. security but also were difficult to distinguish from those of journalists who frequently print information the government would rather keep secret. The question that vexed prosecutors was where to draw the line between journalism and crime.
Wherever that line is, prosecutors say Assange crossed it on March 8, 2010, when they allege that he agreed to help Manning crack a password on the Pentagon's computer network. In framing the case that way, the Justice Department cast its focus on conduct that separates Assange from journalists who receive and publish classified secrets.
“I think the top line takeaway form this: journalism is not a crime, but hacking is,” said April Doss, a former National Security Agency associate general counsel. "What we see in the indictment is the Department of Justice being very careful to draw that distinction and make clear that the indictment is not for anything that he published. The indictment really centers around the allegation that he was conspiring to hack into Department of Defense computers. ”
Doss said the nature of the government's charge is so limited in scope that it should provide "comfort" to journalists who report on national security.
"This indictment does not cause any risk to journalists who are encountering that information," Doss said. "What it does is reinforce the longstanding rule that nobody can commit crimes in order to get that kind of information. ”
Ryan Fayhee, a former federal prosecutor in the Justice Department's National Security Division that is overseeing the Assange case, said that while it is possible the government could file additional charges, the concise seven-page document unsealed Thursday appears to reflect a purposeful strategy by prosecutors.
The single hacking charge, Fayhee said, could ease the otherwise tricky process of extraditing Assange to the United States, in part because the British government also recognizes computer intrusions as crimes. And by narrowly focusing on Assange's alleged code-breaking scheme, any effort to assert a First Amendment defense will likely be more difficult to argue.
Arrested: Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder, faces US hacking conspiracy charge
Indictment: Julian Assange indictment: Read the grand jury indictment against the WikiLeaks founder
Leaks: Six big leaks from Julian Assange's WikiLeaks over the years
"It's one thing for a journalist to publish information from a source who has access to it and is willing to risk the consequences," Fayhee said. "It is quite different, though, for a journalist and a source to be willing to work together to take information from a protected computer. "
Yet within hours after Assange's London arrest, the anti-secrecy activist's lawyers and free-press advocates warned that his prosecution represented a serious threat to journalists and news organizations in the United States, suggesting that the case essentially criminalized publication.
Prosecutors said Assange, too, had solicited secrets. When Manning told him he had passed along the last batch of records he had gathered from Army computers, prosecutors said Assange replied "curious eyes never run dry. "
What is WikiLeaks
Almost from the moment Assange and WikiLeaks burst onto the public stage in 2006, a debate has ensued over whether the boyish Australian should be defined as journalist or activist.
In 2009, Assange and WikiLeaks were among those honored with Amnesty International Media Awards, along with such mainstream news organizations as CNN, the BBC and Newsweek. The lone recipient in a category reserved for "New Media," Assange was recognized for his work on a project implicating Kenyan police in mass killings.
Assange's notoriety, however, exploded in 2010 and 2011 with the mass release of classified U. S. government records, ranging from secret assessments of U. S. prisoners held at the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay to thousands of sensitive cables issued by State Department diplomats.
And in 2016, Assange drew the attention of federal investigators and the repeated praise of then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for disclosing thousands of damaging email communications from Democratic political organizations stolen from the Democratic National Committee by an arm of Russia's intelligence service.
"I love WikiLeaks," Trump declared at a 2016 rally.
Wikileaks' involvement in the dissemination of the communications became a focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with the Russian government to win the White House.
While Mueller ultimately found insufficient evidence of such a conspiracy, according to a summary of the special counsel's authored last month by Attorney General William Barr, suspicion surrounding Assange and his intervention in the 2016 campaign has not abated.
Mueller has closed his 22-month investigation and a final report of his findings are being readied for public release, but Doss, the former NSA associate counsel, said that Assange could hold information that may be valuable to federal investigators – another potential reason for the government to seek his extradition to the U. S.
"It is certainly possible that he has information that would be of interest to federal prosecutors either in the indictments that have already been filed or in potential new proceedings," Doss said. "Over time, he might be interested in pursuing a plea agreement if it looks like he’s facing a real prospect of jail time. "
Targeting leakers
Federal authorities have declined to comment on whether Assange could face additional charges. But the prospect of such an action by the Trump administration, which has repeatedly castigated the press, could mean trouble not only for Assange but for working journalists, said Mark Feldstein, a University of Maryland journalism professor.
In past leak cases, the government has largely targeted the leakers or whistle-blowers, including celebrated former military analyst Daniel Ellsberg for his role in disclosing the Pentagon Papers, rather than targeting The New York Times or The Washington Post for publishing the documents.
“The danger, if they start charging the press for publishing, is that would create an unprecedented expansion of the government’s powers,” Feldstein said. “With Trump and this administration, it wouldn’t surprise me if he would seek to widen the conflict with the news media in a way that other administrations have mostly sought to avoid confrontation with the news media. ”

Texto completo: From Netflix, Spotify and Amazon Prime to Blue Apron, Birchbox and beer of the month, your debit or credit card statements are likely littered with subscriptions that are costing you dearly.
Not that all subscriptions are bad. You might be happy to pay a monthly fee to work out at the gym or type in Microsoft Office 365. But maybe the benefits of subscribing to credit monitoring or razors by mail were, uh, more fleeting.
Recurring charges can be insidious, some eating away at your wealth when you don't value the subscription anymore. Three $30-per-month subscriptions don't sound like much until you realize they total nearly $1,100 per year.
"The situation with subscriptions could end up being death by a thousand cuts when it comes to your budget," says Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.
Here's how to spring-clean recurring charges so you can spend on things that matter to you more.
Subscription audit. Job No. 1 is to identify recurring charges. Scan recent payment statements, including credit cards, debit cards or online accounts, like PayPal. Go back 12 months to catch auto-renew annual subscriptions. Don't ignore the analog world: lawn mowing, home security monitoring, pest-control service and memberships in social and professional organizations. Some credit card issuers, like Citi, identify recurring charges in your online account.
Multiply by 12. To feel the full impact of accumulating subscriptions, multiply monthly charges by 12 to get an annualized idea of what you're spending. If you see yourself keeping the subscription five years, do that math too. Then, a seemingly insignificant $30-per-month expense becomes $1,800.
"On the surface, subscription costs may seem minimal, but when you add them up it can really pinch your monthly budget," says Paul Golden, spokesman for the National Endowment for Financial Education. "If you're putting subscriptions on your credit card, is that hindering your ability to pay off your balance each month? If so, this is a red flag."
Reassess value. Do you use and value the subscription? A gym membership is perhaps the best example of a noble subscription gone wrong - when you quit going but continue paying. Ask yourself if a subscription saves you money or time. Has it lived up to its promise? Does a delivered subscription box bring you joy or guilt?
Is it redundant? If you have cable or satellite TV, plus Netflix, YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Video, you have overlap. The same assessment goes for streaming music services, cloud storage and phone services.
Opt to share. Can you legitimately share a subscription? "Some of these subscriptions offer a buddy pass," McClary notes. YouTube TV allows family groups to share subscriptions, and certain New York Times subscriptions come with a bonus subscription to share. Some families choose to group their wireless phones on a single plan to lower costs.
Downgrade. Downgrading or subscribing seasonally can work too. Can you downgrade from the premium to free version of software or website access? Are you getting value from your credit card's annual fee? You can probably downgrade to a fee-free card with the same issuer and keep your long credit history.
Cancel. Liberally pause or cancel services. You can always restart and resubscribe later. You might even receive a discount offer to return.

Texto completo: American Media Inc. is trying to sell the National Enquirer, its most famous publication. The question remains: Who wants to buy it, and what, exactly, is AMI selling?
In a statement late Wednesday, the company's board confirmed a Washington Post report that it is "exploring strategic options" for the Enquirer and two other tabloids, "which will likely result in their sale in the near future."
On Thursday morning, the New York Times reported that representatives of the Enquirer were "deep in their negotiations" with billionaire Ron Burkle, who made his fortune as a supermarket magnate and is a longtime donor to Democratic political causes. He and former president Bill Clinton are friends, leading to inevitable questions about the Enquirer's close relationship with President Trump and Burkle's possible political motivations in buying the tabloid.
Two sources with knowledge of the discussions confirmed to The Post that Burkle and the Enquirer had been talking about a possible deal.
But soon after, Frank Quintero, a spokesman at Burkle's investment firm, Yucaipa, denied those reports. "We're not interested in pursuing the National Enquirer," Quintero told The Post.
American Media CEO David Pecker and Burkle, who were partners in the now shuttered Radar Magazine and Radar.com, have spoken once in the wake of the Enquirer's announcement, said a person close to the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak about them publicly. In that discussion, Burkle expressed his displeasure that his name is being bandied about as a possible buyer, the person added.
However, AMI spokesman Jon Hammond said Burkle and Pecker have not spoken, and he declined to comment on discussions regarding the tabloid's sale.
"Pecker and Burkle have a preexisting relationship," said another person speaking on the condition of anonymity who is familiar with the negotiations but is not authorized to speak about them openly. "Burkle isn't involved with Trump or anything like that. He's not in this for the politics. He's out to make a buck."
The Enquirer's stories during the 2016 presidential election - lauding Trump's candidacy and attacking his rivals - flew mostly under the radar of mainstream outlets and rose to prominence largely through Trump's mentions of them on the campaign trail.
But the Enquirer is also known for the information that it holds but has not printed. The Enquirer keeps a safe in its offices - where a person familiar with its content said it has held information about celebrities, including Trump, Charlie Sheen and Tiger Woods.
The "catch-and-kill" agreement between the tabloid and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, whom the Enquirer paid to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump, was also kept in the safe.
Any potential buyer of the Enquirer would presumably also acquire all the tabloid's reporting material, as well as its archive.
The tabloid's "catch and kill" tactics, in which a source is paid for exclusive rights to a story but the article is never published, landed the company, Pecker, and AMI's chief content officer, Dylan Howard, in legal jeopardy. The two men were close to being indicted when they worked out a non-prosecution agreement with federal investigators looking into their efforts to tilt the election for Trump.
But that heat appears to have been too much for AMI's board, which began discussing whether it should unload the paper in August, just as the non-prosecution agreements were being finalized. One person briefed on the board discussions told The Post that the board had those discussions because it "didn't want to deal with hassles like this anymore."

Texto completo: Washington attorney Gregory B. Craig, who served as White House counsel for President Barack Obama, was charged Thursday with lying to federal officials who were examining whether he should have registered as a foreign lobbyist for legal work he did for the Ukrainian government in 2012.
The indictment stems from work Craig did with GOP lobbyist Paul Manafort while Craig was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the law firm he joined after ending his tenure at the White House. Manafort, the former campaign chairman to President Trump, pleaded guilty last year to charges related to his Ukraine lobbying.
In a statement released on YouTube, Craig called the prosecution "unprecedented and unjustified."
"I am confident that both the judge and the jury will agree with me," he added.
The case, brought by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington and the Justice Department's National Security Division, grew out of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Craig was charged with two felony counts in connection with alleged false statements related to his Ukraine work. He allegedly made the statements to Justice Department officials who were evaluating whether he should have registered as a foreign agent and in a later interview with Mueller's prosecutors.
Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, though if convicted, Craig is likely to be sentenced to serve far less time. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Washington.
The Justice Department concluded that Craig should have registered as a foreign agent because of contacts he had with reporters on the Ukrainian government's behalf, according to the indictment. However, Craig was not indicted on a charge of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, whose five-year statute of limitations has expired.
In his statement Thursday, Craig said he "did not participate in a scheme to mislead the government or conceal material facts. I was always honest about the reason for my contacts with the media."
William W. Taylor III and William Murphy, attorneys for Craig, said he had "no interest" in misleading Justice Department officials because "he had not done anything that required his registration."
Craig, 74, is the first prominent Democratic figure to be charged as a result of a foreign lobbying investigation spun out of Mueller's probe. The investigation led to the prosecution of Manafort, who was sentenced last month to a total of 7 1/2 years in prison for lobbying violations and financial crimes, and to a plea last year by another former Skadden lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, who admitted to lying to the FBI.
Craig's indictment represents a dramatic turn for a member of the country's most elite legal circles. Craig attended Yale Law School with Bill and Hillary Clinton and later worked in the Clinton State Department and White House. An early Obama supporter, he served for a year as his first White House counsel. He is also a veteran of the Washington-based law firm Williams & Connolly.
The charges relate to work Craig did in coordination with Manafort, who admitted that he had failed to properly register as a foreign lobbyist while working as a political consultant for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.
Craig's firm was hired in 2012 by Yanukovych's Ministry of Justice to conduct a review of the prosecution of one of Yanukovych's leading political rivals, Yulia Tymoshenko. The agreement included providing advice on improving prosecutions by the ministry and was part of a strategy led by Manafort to bolster Ukraine's international image, according to court filings.
Skadden produced a 187-page white paper that offered a mixed review of the trial and imprisonment of Tymoshenko, claiming the analysis it conducted of the case was independent.
But human rights advocates claimed that the report had been engineered by Yanukovych's government and had whitewashed the jailing of the president's political opponent.
And Manafort eventually admitted that he and other lobbyists used the Skadden report as part of a broad effort in the West to improve Yanukovych's reputation, which had suffered after the widely condemned jailing of Tymoshenko. Manafort agreed that they failed to disclose their lobbying effort, which included disseminating the Skadden report to U.S. government officials.
The Ukrainian government reported that Skadden was paid just $12,000 for the report, but prosecutors have said that Manafort used an offshore account to route an additional $4 million to the law firm to pay for the work. According to the indictment, a wealthy Ukrainian citizen agreed to foot the firm's multimillion-dollar bill.
Skadden told the Justice Department in a January filing that it understood that the work "was to be largely funded" by Ukrainian steel magnate Victor Pinchuk, who has promoted closer ties between Ukraine and the European Union. Craig also said in his statement Thursday that Pinchuk helped fund the project.
Pinchuk's representatives have previously denied that he had any involvement with the report. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.
Prosecutors said Craig had sought to avoid registering as a foreign agent because he feared it would impede his future ability to reenter U.S. government service. He was also concerned that the disclosure that would be required would reveal the private payments - undermining the perceived independence of Skadden's work, according to the indictment.
In their statement Wednesday, Craig's attorneys said that he participated in the Tymoshenko prosecution as "an independent expert on the rule of law, not as an advocate for the client," and that he and Skadden took on the project "on the condition that their report would be independent."
But prosecutors allege that Craig sought to hide the payments the firm received from the wealthy Ukrainian. They said he worked with a lobbyist to create a false invoice from Skadden to the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice, making it appear that more of the firm's bills were being paid by the government.
The lobbyist is not named in the court document, but the descriptions of his activities match those of Manafort.
Craig also sought to hide his involvement in the public relations strategy around the report - activities he had been advised would require him to register as a foreign agent, prosecutors allege.
Craig recommended a public relations firm for the project and worked closely with it, and he also emailed a reporter before the release of the Skadden report, writing that he would be happy to get him the report "and even happier to talk to you about it," according to the indictment.
The reporter was David Sanger of the New York Times, Times spokeswoman Ari Isaacman Bevacqua confirmed Thursday. She said the newspaper has not received a subpoena in connection with the case and has provided no information to the government about it.
According to the indictment, Craig claimed in writing and in a meeting with staff from the Justice Department's foreign registration unit in October 2013 that his contacts with the media had been reactive only and for the purpose of correcting misinformation.
Prosecutors said Craig did not disclose that he had written the report with the understanding that it would be used by Manafort and the Ukrainian government to affect public opinion, that he had facilitated the hiring of a public relations firm and helped devise its media strategy, and that he had approached Sanger to provide him a copy of the report and an interview before its public release.
Skadden reached a settlement in January with the Justice Department, admitting that the firm should have registered for its work in 2012 and 2013, and agreeing to turn over the $4.6 million in fees it made for the report in exchange for facing no criminal charges.
In its settlement, Skadden agreed that Justice's 2014 finding that the firm did not need to register came after the agency relied on "false and misleading oral and written statements" made by Craig.
Craig said in his statement that his purpose in talking to the Times "was to prevent mischaracterization of our report by Ukraine and its public relations firm."
"I never discussed the findings of our report with any U.S. officials and certainly did not lobby any U.S. officials on behalf of Ukraine," he said. "I did not help Ukraine promote its spin when it released our report."

‘Hands across the parking lot’

Texto completo: Jordan Peele’s hit film “Us” has so many scary signifiers, it’s hard to know where to begin: The shadow people. The rabbits. The scissors. The visual references to Hands Across America.
That last one is a puzzler. Even with today’s media mania for all things ‘80s, Hands Across America is pretty obscure.
Unlike other high-wattage celebrity charity events, Hands Across America was something of a dud. The idea was that people would link hands and form a human chain in major cities across the country for 15 minutes on May 25, 1986, raising awareness and money for issues of hunger and homelessness. It was put together by USA for Africa, which had spun charity gold from the “We Are The World” song.
According to reports, the event hoped to raise up to $100 million. In the end, it was only $34 million, and after expenses were taken out, only $15 million went to the causes.
It drew a lot of star power, though, from President Reagan and then-Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to celebrities such as George Burns, Yoko Ono, Liza Minnelli, Mickey Mouse, Chewbacca, Robin Williams and, in Memphis, 54 Elvis impersonators.
In Palm Beach County? The biggest celeb was then-County Commissioner Ken Adams.
The Post reported that about 1,600 people gathered to make the human chains in West Palm Beach, Delray Beach, Boynton Beach, Lantana and Jupiter. (About 6.5 million people took part nationwide.) School
children sang the Hands Across America theme, which was broadcast simultaneously on radio stations (“So we must learn to love each other/See that man over there, he’s my brother.”)
Palm Beach County’s chain resembled a ragged, broken line. It was a few hundred people here, a hundred there. In some spots, it was just a handful of people or one person waving a sign at an intersection.
“This is more like hands across the parking lot,” said a 13-year-old wag observing the sparse attendees.
It was far less than organizers hoped for. “We would have loved to see a connection of people across the county, but it was probably unrealistic,” local organizer Henry Stevens told the Post.
More people drove by in cars than stopped and participated. And it was hard to rouse people out on a Sunday afternoon when there were other things to do. The Post headline summed it up: “Lure of Beaches Proves Too Strong.”
Still, the people who took part were happy to make a statement about helping the less fortunate. “It’s nice to see people concerned with each other,” said Cynthia Yuseco.
George Marose of Palm Beach Gardens brought his two sons to the Jupiter leg of the event, which stretched along U.S. 1 near Burt Reynolds Park. “I want them to become a little more aware of some of the problems around the country,” he told the Post.
Margaret Canas, 15, had a positive attitude. “Some of my friends said, ‘I’d rather take off for the beach.’ Well, let them. I’d rather help.”
So, what was it about this well-meaning event that gave writer-director Peele (“Get Out”) the creeps?
“Hands Across America was this idea of American optimism and hope, and Ronald Reagan-style-we-can-get-things-done-if-we-just-hold-hands,” he told Vanity Fair magazine. “It’s a great gesture — but you can’t actually cure hunger and all that.”
Some homeless organizations at the time also criticized the event, saying significant, complex issues can’t be solved with 15 minutes of touchy-feeliness. “There’s like an insistence that as long as we have each other, we can walk blindly past the ugliness and evil that we may be a part of,” Peele told the New York Times, adding that the event seemed to be “more for the people who are holding hands to cure hunger than for the people who are hungry themselves.”
Plus, for Peele, Hands Across America — and other events like the Challenger explosion - occurred when he first got hooked on horror movies.
“There are several ’80s images that conjure up a feeling of both bliss and innocence,” he told Vanity Fair, “and also the darkest of the dark.”

Texto completo: Cuando este miércoles los medios de comunicación desplazados a Texas le preguntaron al presidente Donald Trump sobre quién ocuparía la secretaría del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) -después de la dimisión de Kirstjen Nielsen – su respuesta fue contundente: “Francamente, solo hay una persona llevando la política migratoria (…) ¿Saben quién es? Yo” .
Antes de salir hacia Texas, el presidente había asegurado que Stephen Miller -su asesor y una de las personas que provocó la salida de Nielsen- un chico excelente, una hermosa persona, un hombre brillante”.
Sin embargo, también según las palabras de Trump, “podría pasar” que Kevin McAleenan , actual secretario interino de DHS, continúe en el cargo de forma permanente. En todo caso, aseguró que “en este momento él (por McAleenan) es el indicado”. McAleenan es también comisionado del servicio de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP).
Este miércoles Donald Trump estuvo en San Antonio, Texas para recaudar fondos para su campaña. El discurso ante sus seguidores volvió a estar relacionado con las cuestiones fronterizas y la inmigración indocumentada. El presidente amenazó a los inmigrantes con enviar a más militares a la frontera porque, según él, las personas que cruzan “están muriendo en los campos”, incluso -añadió- “mujeres embarazadas”.
A pesar de que Trump dijo este martes que no está pensando en retomar la política de separación de familias , algunos medios (como NBC y The New York Times ) informaron de Trump ha estado eses solicitando que vuelva dicha medida bajo la denominada “ opción binaria “, pese a estar prohibido por órdenes judiciales. Esta petición podría ser una de las causas que desembocaran en la renuncia de Nielsen.
Otro de los hechos que apuntan al empeño del presidente por controlar la política migratoria es la retirada de la candidatura de Ronald Vitiello para dirigir al Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE). Una fuente anónima dijo este martes a la agencia AP que Trump estaba haciendo ajustes en DHS para poder implementar más rápido las políticas migratorias .

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts raised more than $6 million in the first quarter of the year, her campaign said on Wednesday, trailing some Democratic rivals but exceeding the campaign's worst-case fears after some early fund-raising troubles and the departure of her finance director.
Ms. Warren received more than 213,000 contributions from more than 135,000 donors, with an average donation of $28, her campaign said. She also had a strong finish to the quarter. The campaign raised more than $1.4 million during the last week of the quarter from more than 50,000 donations, exceeding its goal of 35,000 donations.
The numbers offer the most detailed window into the financial outlook of Ms. Warren's campaign, which had, to this point, released little information about its ability to raise funds. Ms. Warren has raised eyebrows -- and won supporters -- for her decision to swear off high-dollar fund-raising events and rest her campaign's hopes on small-dollar donations.
The figures on donations came after her campaign put out urgent warnings that fund-raising was critical to perceptions of Ms. Warren's strength. And, while better than some had feared, they still left her trailing some key rivals.

"I won't sugarcoat it: We were outraised by some other candidates in the presidential primary this first quarter," Roger Lau, her campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters on Wednesday afternoon.
Based on figures released by campaigns so far, she trails far behind the fund-raising leader in the Democratic field, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who raised $18.2 million, as well as Senator Kamala Harris of California, who raised $12 million. She is also behind former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who raised $9.4 million, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who raised more than $7 million.
Ms. Warren and campaign advisers have made clear that they did not expect to match the fund-raising prowess of Mr. Sanders and Mr. O'Rourke, the two other major candidates who have eschewed high-dollar fund-raisers.
Ms. Warren's first-quarter total trails those of Mr. Sanders and Mr. O'Rourke even though Ms. Warren entered the presidential race more than a month before both candidates. However, her numbers also offer reason for optimism, considering Ms. Warren roughly matched another rival, Ms. Harris, in small-dollar donations, and raised more in the final week of the quarter than Ms. Harris did through her digital program in the final week.
Ms. Warren, who won her Senate re-election bid by a wide margin in November, is also relying on a stockpile of donations she had previously collected. Presidential candidates can make use of money they raised in federal campaigns in the past, and Ms. Warren transferred $10.4 million from her Senate account to her presidential campaign, her team said.
At the same time, she is spending money quickly to build up a large campaign operation. Her campaign said it spent $5.2 million in the first quarter, leaving it with $11.2 million in cash on hand.

Ms. Warren's fund-raising at the beginning of her campaign did not impress. On Dec. 31, the day she announced her exploratory committee for president, she raised about $300,000 through the online donation-processing platform ActBlue, according to Federal Election Commission records. By contrast, Mr. O'Rourke raised $6.1 million in his first 24 hours in the race, and Mr. Sanders raised $5.9 million in his first day, according to their campaigns.
A New York Times article detailing Ms. Warren's early fund-raising struggles, which was published online on the last day of the first quarter, helped create an outpouring for Ms. Warren, handing her one of her best fund-raising days of the quarter, according to a Democrat familiar with her fund-raising.
Supporters of Ms. Warren feared that she was being crowded out by Mr. Sanders on the party's left flank, but the campaign's surge in the final week has at least temporarily allayed some of the concern. During that time, Ms. Warren's campaign team made several dramatic pitches to its donor base, sending emails that addressed the harshest criticisms of the campaign, such as one titled "Can she really win?" in which they laid out the campaign's overarching strategy.
The emails, which track with private conversations among Ms. Warren's senior advisers, suggest that the senator believes several things will help her break out of the Democratic pack, including an ability to do more political events because she is not devoting time to private fund-raisers, her well-praised policy rollouts and her campaign team's focus on digital organizing.
"The relative numbers don't matter to me," said John Walsh, a former chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. "Who has the most money? No, that doesn't matter. It's, 'Do you have enough money to run the campaign you said you're going to run?"'
Candidates must report their fund-raising for the first quarter to the Federal Election Commission by April 15, but campaigns can announce numbers before that deadline.
Other candidates who have disclosed their first-quarter fund-raising include Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who said she raised more than $5.2 million, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who said he raised more than $5 million. (Ms. Klobuchar solicited donations for the general election as well as the primary, so a portion of her total cannot currently be used.)
Earlier Wednesday, Ms. Warren also disclosed her 2018 tax returns, showing that she earned about $325,000 from her books last year on top of her Senate salary.
Ms. Warren had previously posted 10 years of her tax returns online, and she has called on her fellow presidential candidates to do the same thing. She has proposed a wide-ranging anticorruption bill that would require the disclosure of tax returns for the president, vice president and major party nominees for those offices.
President Trump has refused to share his tax returns, defying tradition going back decades. The issue of his tax returns is back in the spotlight now that House Democrats have requested them.
"I've put out 11 years of my tax returns because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for," Ms. Warren said in a statement on Wednesday. "Doing this should be law."
Over all, Ms. Warren and her husband, Bruce H. Mann, a professor at Harvard Law School, had an adjusted gross income of $846,394. Their federal taxes came to $230,965, for an effective federal tax rate of 27.3 percent.
Ms. Warren's household income would easily place her in the top 1 percent of American households, according to census data.
A rough estimate of Ms. Warren's income from writing books had already come into public view from the financial disclosure filing that she made after entering the presidential race. That filing showed that she received a $300,000 advance for her latest book, "This Fight Is Our Fight."
In addition to $324,687 in writing income reported on her tax return, Ms. Warren earned $176,280 from her Senate position. Mr. Mann earned $402,897 from Harvard. Ms. Warren and Mr. Mann reported donating $50,128 to charity.
Ms. Warren is among several Democratic presidential candidates who have disclosed years of tax returns. Ms. Klobuchar, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington have also done so.
Mr. Sanders said on Tuesday that he would make public 10 years of tax returns by Tax Day on Monday. He, too, has supplemented his Senate salary with income from writing books.
"I wrote a best-selling book," he said. "If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."

Texto completo: Baloney is not free.
That's important to keep in mind in an era that finds America wading hip deep in a cascading tide of bovine effluvium. This nonsense is not harmless, not trivial, not abstract. And it always exacts a cost.
If some of us ever knew that, they have apparently forgotten. As a result, we have become a nation awash in public lies - conspiracy theories without basis, crackpot pronouncements from figures of authority, misleading, mendacious misstatements false as a four-dollar bill, delivered every minute of every day to our TV, computer and smartphone screens.
Baloney is not free. Still, the price thus far has been borne by a relative few.
It has cost "only" the parent who paid in heartache when some wild-eyed conspiracist claimed that a beloved child killed in a mass shooting never existed and that the shooting itself did not happen.
"Only" the African Americans who paid in deepening estrangement as the first black president was pressured into producing his birth certificate to answer baseless claims that he was not born in this country.
"Only" the pizzeria patrons who paid in terror as a man with a semi-automatic rifle opened fire in hopes of rescuing child sex slaves he had been led to believe were imprisoned there.
But if only a few of us have paid for such baloney thus far, it looks as if the whole country might soon have to ante up.
It seems the U.S. is grappling with an outbreak of the measles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting that as of last week, there have been 465 cases so far this year. That means this is already the second worst year since the disease was reported eradicated in 2000. Measles has shown up in 19 states, including Michigan, Missouri, California, Texas, Georgia, New York and Florida. At this rate, we will eclipse the previous record of 667 cases, set in 2014.
Officials say the resurgence of the highly contagious, sometimes-fatal disease is driven by parents who refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated because they believe the vaccine causes autism. Which it doesn't. The supposed link between vaccinations and autism stems from a 1998 study by a British doctor. The study was debunked, its findings retracted, the doctor discredited.
But the baseless fear he raised lives on.
Now we - actually, our young children - stand to pay for the baloney he sold. The currency will be fevers, runny noses, coughs, watery eyes and rashes. It could be death.
Is that what it will take to finally bring some of us to their senses? There is, after all, something stark and undeniable about the link between cause and effect here, between anti-vaccination and outbreak.
Maybe that will show some of us how foolish it is to believe absurd untruths without the slightest evidence. Maybe it will remind them how dangerous it is to abandon the obligation of thinking critically. Maybe it will teach them how dumb it is to consider Facebook more authoritative than the CDC or The New York Times.
And maybe it will remind them that the truth doesn't care what you believe, doesn't care what you want or whom you voted for. The truth just is.
To reject that is to reject the connective tissue that makes nationhood possible, to reject any chance of greater good and common cause, to reject the very possibility of us. So this outbreak, troubling as it is, offers a timely chance for some of us to reconsider the choice to live in nonsense.
Because the cost of baloney is high. And it's getting higher all the time.

James Comey was a 'witness' in Mueller investigation, new court documents show

Texto completo: Court documents released Monday show the Justice Department said former FBI Director James Comey was a "witness" in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, citing Comey's memos detailing his interactions with President Trump.

The revelation adds verification to speculation that Comey and his memos played a role in Mueller’s efforts. Comey himself said he leaked his notes to the media to spark the appointment of a special counsel after he was fired in May 2017.

David Archey, a high-ranking FBI official, said in newly disclosed court documents from 2017 that “the FBI and Special Counsel’s Office have determined that disclosure of the Comey Memos — or any portions of them — could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the pending Russia investigation.” He explained that Comey’s memos had been “incorporated into a pending investigation and this compiled as investigative records.” Archey said these memos were compiled by May 12, 2017.

“The Comey Memos are his contemporaneous notes about incidents that are of interest in that investigation and are considered witness statements and therefore evidence in the Russia investigation,” Archey said.

Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, and then one of the memos subsequently leaked by Comey to a friend was detailed in the New York Times on May 16, 2017. Comey later explained to Congress that he leaked the memo to prompt a special counsel investigation. The day after the New York Times report, Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 election.

Archey was an important figure in the court battle over the Comey memos. He was the deputy assistant director with the Counterintelligence Division who supervised FBI agents assigned to the 2016 investigation into Russian election interference.

Archey outlined the Justice Department’s position on the memos to the court in 2017, and the “First Archey Declaration” explained to the court why the special counsel had compiled the Comey memos in the first place. The court then “thought it helpful to seek more specifics as to the Memos’ connection with an ongoing investigation” and “asked that an attorney from the Office of Special Counsel proffer such information.” Michael Dreeben, who had been a counsel for the Special Counsel’s Office, provided the court with that “proffer” information. Archey’s answers to the court’s follow-up questions became known as the “Third Archey Declaration.”

Back on April 1, Judge James Boasberg of the District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that “the government shall file a notice indicating whether the completion of the Special Counsel's investigation permits the Government to release more material” related to Comey’s memos by April 8.

Two weeks after Mueller's investigation came to a close, the Justice Department said Monday that “in view of the conclusion of the investigation by the Special Counsel’s Office into Russian interference in the 2016 election,” the FBI had agreed to “withdraw the redactions made” to many of these documents.

The Justice Department long argued that the release of the Comey memos in full would interfere with the special counsel investigation, and the court had originally ruled in their favor. But redacted versions of the memos were eventually released to Congress and the public. Last month, the judge had ordered the Justice Department to turn over documents related to Comey’s memos.

CNN, USA Today, Judicial Watch, and the Daily Caller have been fighting for access to the Justice Department’s sealed arguments explaining to the court exactly why the department opposed the full release of the Comey memos. Those arguments from the Justice Department about why and how Mueller may have used the Comey memos have now been partially unsealed — it was information from Archey’s first and third declarations that was released this week.

Following the completion of the special counsel investigation, CNN asked the court to “unseal in full the First Archey Declaration, Third Archey Declaration, and a transcript of and any other records relating to the proffer proceeding” and to “place copies of those fully unsealed records on the public docket in this matter.” The court ruled that the Justice Department should hand that information over to the court for review and possible release.

Media and watchdog groups have tried to use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain information on Comey’s memos since May 2017, when the existence of the Comey memos became public, and that information is slowly being made available. The memos purport to detail conversations between Comey and Trump about which the two hotly disagree, and the outlets argued the public has a right to know.

Attorney General William Barr has said that Mueller did not charge anyone with criminal collusion with Russia, but that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice one way or the other. The release of the Mueller report, with Barr’s redactions, is expected within a week.

Hometown author’s latest book emerges as Batavia’s favorite

Texto completo: Did hometown girl Samira Ahmed have an unfair advantage in winning the 2019 Tournament of Books at the Batavia Public Library?
Batavia author Ahmed’s book "Love Hate & Other Filters" was recently voted Batavia’s favorite adult or young adult fiction title of 2018 in the library’s "Tournament of Books" bracket-style competition.
Sixteen of 2018’s best fiction books, chosen by Batavia readers and librarians, competed for the top spot in the playoff-style brackets.
Each weekday in March, the Batavia librarians posted a match between two of the chosen fiction titles.
Readers were encouraged to vote every day either through Facebook or by coming into the library. Each day the winner of the bracket, determined by votes, moved on.
At the end of the month, one title emerged victorious.
Batavia readers may not have realized that the author of "Love Hate & Other Filters" grew up in Batavia and spent many hours reading in front of the fireplace at the library.
But the setting of Batavia for the coming-of-age tale may have given the novel extra appeal in the voting.
Ahmed is not only The New York Times best-selling author of the young adult novel, but also the highly acclaimed teen novel "Internment," and the forthcoming "Mad, Bad & Dangerous to Know."
Laura James, a librarian at Batavia Public Library, suggests that you read "Love Hate & Other Filters" if you like intimate storytelling about a second-generation Muslim-American teen in the modern social climate or books set in Batavia written by a Batavian.
"Maya just wants to make movies and kiss a boy. But her life is complicated by culture clash, bigotry, and rising hate due to a terrorist attack elsewhere in the state," James said.
"The teen romance is sweet, there’s a nice interaction with the ‘not right’ boy, and the difficult issues are handled with sensitivity and care," James said. "It was interesting to see the Batavia elements. I liked how the conflict with her parents was handled."

Outgoing Secret Service director ridiculed as 'Dumbo' by Trump

Texto completo: President Trump had reportedly used the moniker "Dumbo" when referring to Secret Service Director Randolph Alles, who is departing from the role, because of the size of his ears.

The New York Times reports Alles was told to step aside and come up with an exit plan for his departure 10 days ago. Trump reportedly became dissatisfied by Alles, nicknamed “Tex,” and had referred to the former Marine Corps major general as the animated character in the 1941 Walt Disney Productions children’s movie “Dumbo.” The character is an elephant who is ridiculed for his intellect and large ears, which allow him to fly.

It was initially reported that Alles was abruptly fired Monday, but Alles said in a statement to the Washington Examiner the characterization was inaccurate.

“No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my 'firing.' I assure you that this is not the case, and in fact was told weeks ago by the Administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security. The President has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction," Alles said.

Alles’ departure came on the heels of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen submitting her resignation on Sunday. Trump announced her departure in a tweet after a heated meeting and before Nielsen had time to send out a resignation letter herself.

Amid the shakeup, the Times also reports two other figures are expected to leave the White House soon: L. Francis Cissna, the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and John Mitnick, a senior member of Nielsen’s team.

After his Monday departure, Trump named James Murray as Alles' replacement.

Texto completo: Santa Fe's Zine Fest is entering its third year with what is expected to be its largest event yet. The free, one-day festival began in 2017 as a way to show off local DIY publications and their makers (for those who don't know, a “zine” is a small, self-published work). The first year, organizer and local writer Bucket Siler said she organized about 10 tables in a small space in the back of CCA's Tank Garage just with advertising from homemade flyers and a Facebook page. But the event brought in an unexpected 200 people. Last year, with some funding from an Albuquerque-based arts grant program, the event moved into the main gallery space and drew about 350 guests.
For this year's Zine Fest, happening on Saturday and now sponsored by Meow Wolf, Siler is expecting at least 400 people to come and mingle with the approximately 40 New Mexico-based creators. El Sabor will park a food truck outside CCA and Siler will be offering Santa Fe Zine Fest tote bags that guests can use to hold their zine purchases.
Though the event has been gaining traction Siler said she still wants to keep the event small. She plans to continue curating a select group of creators rather than expand to an open registration policy, selecting among zine makers who have shown before and also giving newcomers a shot.
Santa Fe Zine Fest is Saturday from 12-5 p.m. in the CCA Tank Garage Gallery, 1050 Old Pecos Trail. Admission is free. All ages are welcome, though Siler noted some zines may have more adult-driven content. Siler also recommended that anyone who makes zines bring them to the festival, because some exhibitors offer both purchases and trades.
ADDING TO THE MYSTERY: Santa Fe's own New York Times bestselling author Anne Hillerman will be at the Violet Crown Cinema Tuesday discussing her latest novel, adding to the mystery series her late father started decades ago. “The Tale Teller,” which will be released next week, is another book in the Leaphorn, Chee and Manuelito series. The characters originated in novels written by her father, author Tony Hillerman. The new book follows dark twists and turns that arise as retired Navajo tribal officer Joe Leaphorn becomes involved in the search for a priceless biil, a traditional Navajo dress. At the same time, tribal officers Jim Chee and Bernadette Manuelito are working on a separate case that evolves into a murder investigation.
Hillerman's talk organized by Collected Works Bookstore is 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Violet Crown, 1606 Alcaldesa St. in the Railyard. A book-signing will be held afterward. Tickets are $30, which includes a copy of the book. If couples attending need only one copy of “Tale Teller,” Collected Works is offering free copies of one of Anne's other books in exchange for the second ticket.
A COLLECTIVE VISION: The different artistic talents of 2019's “Living Treasures” will be showcased starting this afternoon at the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture. Contemporary artists and brothers Diego and Mateo Romero, both raised in California, but who eventually returned to their father's ancestral land of Cochiti Pueblo, were honored with the award earlier this year. The Living Treasure distinction is a part of the museum's Native Treasures program.
“The Brothers Chongo: A Tragic Comedy in Two Parts” is an exhibition of lithographs made by the brothers, as well as Mateo's paintings and Diego's pottery. “Though the brothers employ separate artistic mediums, the exhibition articulates a collective vision of the future for Native people,” a state Department of Cultural Affairs news release about the exhibition states. “Both Diego's pottery and Mateo's paintings address how to heal communities through a shared experience.”
The exhibit will be up at MIAC, 710 Camino Lejo, until October. Today's opening reception is from 1-4 p.m. in its education classroom. Admission is free for New Mexico residents, members and kids under 16. General admission for out-of-state guests is $12, or $11 for students.

Texto completo: Kirstjen Nielsen, la secretaria del departamento Seguridad Nacional (DHS) y cara de la actual campaña migratoria del presidente Donald Trump en contra de la inimgración ilegal no aguantó mas la presión y renunció a su cargo tras un reunión este domingo con el presidente en la Casa Blanca.
“La secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen, abandonará su cargo y me gustaría agradecerle por su servicio”, dijo Trump en Twitter.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019
A paso seguido Trump anunció su reemplazo en Twitter. “Me complace anunciar que Kevin McAleenan, el actual Comisionado de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de los Estados Unidos, se convertirá en Secretario Interino de @DHSgov. ¡Confío en que Kevin hará un gran trabajo!”
Kirstjen Nielsen abandona el cargo luego de un dificil paso por la dirección de DHS, gestión que la convirtió en el blanco de repetidas críticas por parte del presidente Trump y de varios miembros de su gabinete.
La medida se produce días después de que Trump, quien ha expresado en repetidas ocasiones su enojo por el aumento de migrantes en la frontera sur, se arrepinitió y retiró a su candidato Ron Vitiello para dirigir ICE porque buscaba a un funcionario mas “agresivo” en contra da inmigración ilegal.
Para muchos en Washington la salida Nielsen no es una sorpresa tras las reiteradas críticas de Trump por su insatisfacción con la funcionaria debido al aumento de inmigrantes que ingresaban ilegalmente a los Estados Unidos por la frontera sur
En mayo pasado, seis meses después de asumir el cargo en el departamento, The New York Times informó que Nielsen había redactado su carta de renuncia después de haber sido reprendida públicamente por lo que el presidente llamó su fracaso para ayudar a detener la inmigración ilegal en la frontera.
Según reporta el diario neoyorquino, Stephen Miller, asesor principal de Trump en temas migratorios, se habría dado a la tarea de aumentar la presión y las quejas sobre Nielsen, acusándola de no encontrar formas creativas para detener la entrada de inmigrantes centroamericanos a suelo de EEUU.
De igual forma Jared Kushner, asesor y cuñado de Trump tampoco veía con buenos ojos la continuidad de Nielsen en la dirección de DHS, aumentando la presión para que la funcionaria diera una paso al costado, dijeron varios funcionarios de la Casa Blanca.
Todos estos factores habrían llevado a que Nielsen, después de una agitada reunión con Trump en la Casa Blanca este domingo, decidira renunciar.

Here's a presidential secret all stock investors need to know

Texto completo: There is magic in the air. With so many vying to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020, and more coming, who finally wins?
You – if you follow this simple stock market advice.
Stocks will benefit from big but little known political impacts. The S&P 500 rose in 91% of the third years of all presidents’ terms – ever since the index's 1925 inception – averaging 18% per year, way above average. There hasn’t been a negative third year since World War II began in 1939.
Year four was also positive 83% of the time going back to 1925 – averaging 11%. Both years rose much more consistently than years one and two. Coincidence? No.
Home buying: Listing your home? Here's where median asking prices are falling
Boeing:Boeing faces liabilities as CEO Dennis Muilenburg acknowledges 'apparent' 737 Max problem
Why does this work? The magic of gridlock! Almost all big, scary legislation in modern American history happens in presidents’ first two years – as Washington front-loads big, often contentious, confrontational legislation. The result? Many can benefit. Others suffer. So uncertainty spikes, which causes volatility. In those years, stock returns are hugely variable. Then midterms render relative gridlock, quieting Congress in the president’s third and fourth years. The election process itself dampens fourth-year legislation.
Big, heavy legislation is usually like some obstacle course for business and people – one with heavy, hard, fast-swinging, painful obstacles. It’s scary. Gridlock creates a course with stationary obstacles. It’s easier. So we get more optimistic.
While years three and four shine, their paths differ. In year three, stocks typically rise strongly through mid-summer, then wiggle sideways as the campaign heightens, hyping uncertainty. We’re in that early-year sweet stretch now. Those people claiming that stocks will sag after a great first quarter are arguing against nine decades of history.
Fourth years start sideways amid growing election uncertainty. But clarity comes. Primary elections shrink the field – and uncertainty. By summer, we have two known finalists. We finally get a winner – always. Uncertainty falls – boosting the back half of the fourth year.
These are just averages, of course. But the repeating pattern is basic. Election years have been negative just four times going back to 1925. Could 2020 be another? Perhaps. I don’t see the factors to cause that. Instead, I see false fears and unloved good news.
So, to win, enjoy stocks calmly through the campaign circus. That circus blares louder later as campaigning intensifies, fraying uncertainty late this year and in early 2020. That is normal.
Who is president in 2021? I haven’t a clue. It isn’t important now. Polls won’t help anytime soon. Even after 2018’s midterms shifted some statehouses back to Democratic control, Republicans control most state governments bottom-up. If America votes bottom-up, like in 2016, President Trump will win again.
How? As I wrote loudly in mid-2016, Trump would win if he lost the popular vote by 3%. It’s still true – for the same reasons. The Electoral College has a 4% Republican lean. But, as I said then, even had Hillary Clinton won, stocks would have risen because of falling uncertainty. To Trump’s benefit, I should remind you that since World War I, we have only voted out three incumbents: Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush. To his potential detriment, Trump is very unusual.
For investing, however, it’s way too early to sweat the campaign stuff. Only when the Democratic field narrows will stocks start pricing in final outcomes. Speculating now on November 2020’s president-elect is premature. Stocks likely follow normal paths: strong now through summer, then a sideways wiggly for a while – until the field finally narrows– then rising again.
So celebrate 2019’s legislative inactivity. And 2020’s eventual falling uncertainty. Own stocks.
With this coming presidential election, who do I want to win? You.

Holland, Perry discussion will kick off book festival

Texto completo: Nationally known figures are coming to Montgomery to lead discussions on literature and the humanities.
Anabranch will hold two days of events, one at the Capri Theatre on April 11, and one at Troy University in Montgomery on April 12.
On April 13, the 14th annual Alabama Book Festival will be held in Montgomery's Old Alabama Town, with a large schedule of author panels and other activities.
Perry and Holland Anabranch begins with two distinguished Alabama natives – scholar Imani Perry and André Holland, star of films, TV and stage – who will discuss their respective careers and Alabama roots on stage at the Capri Theatre.
The onstage conversation between Perry and Holland starts at 6 p.m. and will include their thoughts about 200 years of Alabama statehood and the usefulness of the humanities to the state's future.
Perry, born in Birmingham, is an interdisciplinary scholar of race, law, literature and African American culture. She is the Hughes-Rogers Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University. Author of five books, Perry has published numerous articles on law, cultural studies, and African American studies as well. One of her most recent books, "Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry," was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year and won the 2019 PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for Biography.
Holland, born in Bessemer, is an actor and producer. Recipient of accolades for his performance as Kevin in the Academy Award-winning film "Moonlight," Holland is also well known for his work as sportswriter Wendell Smith in "42" (2013), as activist Andrew Young in "Selma" (2014), as Principal Jenkins in "A Wrinkle in Time" (2018) and, most recently, as the lead actor in "High Flying Bird" (2019). Holland is also well known for television roles in "The Knick" (2014–2015) and "American Horror Story: Roanoke" (2016). On stage, Holland has starred in August Wilson's play, "Jitney" (2017) on Broadway and in London in the Globe Theatre's production of "Othello" (2018).
April 12 workshops On April 12, Anabranch will hold a full day of free workshops for teachers and the public on the Montgomery campus of Troy University from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Whitley Hall. During this event, teachers can earn professional development credits and receive stipends.
Workshops include:
The Clotilda and Africatown – 9 a.m. - noon, Room 140/41 Whitley Hall. In 1860, long after the United States outlawed importation of enslaved laborers, 110 men, women and children from Benin and Nigeria were captured and brought to Mobile aboard a ship called Clotilda. This workshop will introduce participants to the story of the Alabama-based ship and the geographic and cultural origins of the West African captives aboard it.
Writing for Young People I: Irene Latham and Charles Waters – 10 a.m. - 11 a.m., Room 318 Whitley Hall. Join collaborators Irene Latham and Charles Waters as they describe how they collaboratively created "Can I Touch Your Hair?" (2018), a dialogue for young people about the inevitable "mistakes" we make when learning about people unlike ourselves.
Writing for Young People II: Bethany Hegedus – 11 a.m. - noon, Room 318 Whitley Hall. For Alabama audiences, Bethany is best-known as the author of "Alabama Spitfire: The Story of Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird" (2018), a perfect introduction that prepares beginning readers for discovering the 1961 classic by narrating how its Monroeville author discovered the power of language at any early age.
Alabama Story / Alabama Shakespeare Festival – 1:30 - 4:30 p.m. – Gold Room (2nd Floor). Sixty years ago, a librarian named Emily Reed added "The Rabbits' Wedding," a children's picture book, to the state's collection. This workshop, offered by Alabama Shakespeare Festival, will introduce participants to the little-known true story on which a play called "Alabama Story" is based.
Young Adult Writing I: Randi Pink – 1:30 - 2:30 p.m., Room 318 Whitley Hall. Writing for adolescents is far from kids' stuff. Pink has been one of the bravest YA authors in the South when it comes to exploring sensitive concerns. Her first novel, "Into White" (2016), asks what happens when a black girl wakes up one day to discover she's suddenly white. Her forthcoming novel, "Girls Like Us" (this September), promises to spark even more conversation. It's about unplanned pregnancy and the effects it has on both young women and families.
Young Adult Writing II: S. F. Henson – 2:30 - 3:30 p.m. Room 318 Whitley Hall. Described as a "teen American History X," S. F. Henson's "Devils Within" recently won the Alabama Library Association Young Adult Award with the gripping and timely story of a teenage white supremacist desperately trying to disassociate himself from the hatred and violence that he was raised to wreak upon the world.
Alabama Book Festival On Saturday, April 13, the Alabama Book Festival gets underway with a host of authors headlining the day in Old Alabama Town. In addition to the festival's traditional concentration on fiction, nonfiction, children's literature and poetry, there will be songwriters, philosophers, scholars and filmmakers in the mix.
Among the special events for the festival, Troy University announced that the recipients of the 2019 Hall-Waters Prize for Excellence in Southern Writing are the songwriting duo of Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham. Once described by The Independent as a "two-man soul hit factory," Dan and Spooner collaborated upon several of the defining American soul-pop songs of the 1960s and 1970s. From their first collaboration, Joe Simon's "Let's Do It Over" (four months in the Top 20 in 1965) on through Janis Joplin's seminal performance of their "A Woman Left Lonely" on her posthumously released classic Pearl, the duo helped define contemporary Southern music as composers, musicians, and producers.
Spooner and Dan will spend April 12 in Troy meeting with students and talking about the craft of songwriting. On Saturday they'll appear together to discuss their careers, both as a team and individually, in the South Tent.
The festival will also include:
Free writing workshops, once again, are on the slate for Saturday, April 13! Check out the opportunities for master classes in fiction, poetry, biography, photography, and publishing.
Open mic stage: Back by popular demand, our open mic stage allows authors of all ages and genres to read from their work. This year the open mic will be on the Plantation House porch.
Whitman, Alabama: Wander into The Tavern at your leisure throughout the fest to experience this unique video journey that documents hundreds of people across Alabama bringing Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself" to life in a production by Alabama Media Group/AL.com.
Book reviews: Courtesy of the Alabama Writers' Forum, you can check out reviews of many of the books featured on the program!
After the Alabama Book Festival wraps on April 13, you'll want to join them at the Alley Bar at 166 Commerce Street from 6 to 7:30 p.m. for a special concert event, "An Evening with Dann Penn and Spooner Oldham," featuring the duo's greatest hits!

Texto completo: A smile dances across Sen. Dennis Baxley's face when asked if he is the granddaddy of model bills, the phenomenon of copy-cat legislation that has popped up in various state legislatures.
Florida lawmakers make liberal use of ghostwriters for legislation to regulate guns, abortion and proposals ranging from agriculture to school vouchers.
"We started it here in Florida with the Stand Your Ground bill," said Baxley, R-Ocala. "We passed it and shared it; there's a lot of that. You don't want to reinvent the wheel if you don't have too."
The USA TODAY NETWORK – Florida, in conjunction with a two-year investigation by USA TODAY, the Arizona Republic and the Center for Public Integrity, found since 2010 at least 368 bills introduced by Florida legislators were most likely written outside of the state of Florida.
At least two dozen laws implemented in Florida the past two years, according to the network's "Copy, Paste, Legislate" investigation, were not written by elected lawmakers but by corporate lobbyists and by other special interests. The bills cover some of the most controversial issues that come up in session including abortion, vouchers and guns.
Baxley's 2005 Stand Your Ground bill became the model for laws passed in more than two dozen states.
While some deride the practice as subverting democracy, Baxley said bill sharing unites national and local activists and arms them with the words needed to advance an agenda.
"It's a powerful tool, especially for communicating," said Baxley about how bill mills develop winning arguments.
This year, Baxley teamed up with Rep. Michael Hill, R-Pensacola, to introduce a fetal heartbeat bill that first appeared nearly a decade ago in Ohio. The measure would outlaw abortion around the sixth week of pregnancy – as soon as a heartbeat can be detected. It has been adopted by 10 states and is under consideration in 12 others.
"A heartbeat. People understand a heartbeat," said Baxley about this year's abortion bill. "We framed it that way and it moved the polls about 15 points."
The bill is Hill's number one priority, but he didn't know who actually wrote it. "I got mine from Kentucky," he said. The House version is so popular it's drawn 20 cosponsors, he said.
Patterned progressives and copycat conservatives? When it comes to copycat legislation, much of the attention is focused on conservative groups like the Koch Brothers-backed American Legislative Exchange Council, which the New York Times has referred to as a "stealth business lobbyist," and Americans United for Life, which wrote the first fetal heartbeat bill.
But in Florida, the main supplier for copycat legislation has been the American Legislative and Issue Campaign Exchange, a Wisconsin group that calls itself the progressive alternative to ALEC. ALICE bills in Florida outnumber ALEC 26 to 15 in the nine years examined.
"These groups do the hard work of how to legally draw up the language of different bills so if you want to crack down on abortion or crack down on guns you go to ALICE or ALEC and they got bills on the shelf that can be filed," said Aubrey Jewett, a University of Central Florida political science professor.
"And for legislators who are ideological it helps them to become part of a national movement to try to push the country one way or another from within their state," explained Jewett.
Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, has sponsored bills the past three sessions to ban assault weapons based on a Connecticut law approved after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
"I wasn't born knowing everything. I still don't know everything, and I don't claim to know everything," said Smith impatiently when asked where he got the idea.
These national conferences give lawmakers a chance to learn from one another's mistakes and accomplishments, Smith said.
"We learn from the private sector as well when we bring in managers from industries to share best management practices," said Smith.
In the past two sessions, Democrats have introduced 22, more than a third of all model bills filed.
St. Petersburg Republican Sen. Jeff Brandes stands out among his colleagues with seven model bills filed in the last two sessions and 12 overall since 2013. The maverick lawmaker who calls himself "a bit" of a libertarian also makes more use of special-interest bill clearinghouses than any other lawmaker.
And he shops around. He has advanced bills from a cross-section of organizations that include ALICE, ALEC, the Goldwater Institute and the National Council of State Legislators.
"We try to sift through what are the right ideas," said Brandes. "If it's a great idea, why wouldn't I consider it?"
An inevitable part of the process? Academics and lawmakers say it is inevitable that a part-time legislature would turn to outside sources. Florida spends less money on staff to do research and lawmakers spend less time in session at work on policy than states with full-time legislatures like New York, Wisconsin and California.
Charles Zelden, a history and political science professor at Nova Southeastern University, said this provides opportunities for organizations to supply the language for the bill and the talking points for debate to bring about the change they desire.
"Unless the bills are coming from a state agency, a proposal is probably being written in large part by people with the overt goals to change policy," said Zelden.
Bill mills do not operate in the dark. They are open about what they are doing. ALICE promotes itself as a one-stop shop for progressive ideas and Bloomberg News refers to ALEC as a "bill laundry for corporate interests."
Former Rep. Michelle Rehwinkle Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, said there is nothing nefarious about lawmakers reaching out to professional associations, neighborhoods and lobbyists for ideas and the nuts and bolts of proposals.
It is how government officials work, she explained.
"People need to understand we come up with very few bills from our own creative minds," said Rehwinkle Vasilinda.
In 2014, Rehwinkle Vasilinda cosponsored Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen's, R-Fort Myers, the "Keeping I.D. Safe (KIDS) Act." The model bill from the National Council Insurance Legislators increased privacy regulations for children.
"What people have a problem with is when lawmakers are handed something and file it without taking a critical eye to it. That's a fundamental problem," said Rehwinkle Vasilinda, who had also used model bills to promote hemp and solar power.
Zelden agrees.
"Words matter. I tell my students there is how the law is written and there is how it matters," said Zelden. "A lawmaker may miss a small provision that has an oversize impact and the next thing you know the law explodes in our face."
'Not good for democracy' but a track record of success It's possible the heartbeat bill will die in the Florida Legislature this session without a hearing. But numerous bills ghostwritten outside of Florida have succeeded in the past.
In the past two years, 5 percent of the bills approved by the Florida Legislature were either a model bill or a significant part of copy-and-paste legislation tucked inside a shell bill during a session's final days.
Zelden points out though that much of what makes it to the governor's desk is tied to the budget and local projects. He said it's not a question of quantity when it comes to model bills.
"It's not good for democracy," said Zelden about the potential of laws being written by special interests seeking an advantage.
Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Naples sponsored a school voucher program for bullied students in 2018 that was eventually incorporated into another measure passed and signed into law.
The language for the voucher was also found in bills introduced in Mississippi, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
"The states are laboratories of democracies," Donalds said. "If we see something is working in other states, and the elements will work in your state, yeah, you should go after it and implement it."
Even though they are on opposite sides of the political aisle, Smith and Baxley agree there's nothing wrong with taking a lead from another state or organization that has done the homework to produce a legal piece of legislation.
"A lot of times when you follow the money, follow who is backing a bill or who is opposing a bill you understand exactly what the implications are," said Smith. "Does it need to be looked at? Yes. Do people need to know where the legislation is coming from? Absolutely."
"I think the American Legislative Exchange Council is a great idea," said Baxley. "As long as it is transparent, just because you don't like the source does not mean it is not a great idea."

The opium of California

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Texto completo: Neil Armstrong called it the “onward code.”
It was a way of living that drove a person always forward toward the new challenge and the next horizon.
It was a code, historian Douglas Brinkley believes, inspired by President John Kennedy’s New Frontier, blending “adventure, curiosity, big technology, cutting-edge science, global prestige, American exceptionalism,” and a constant quest to renew the Western frontier spirit.
In his new book, “American Moonshot,” Brinkley argues that “the exploration of space continued the grand tradition that began with Christopher Columbus and flowed through America’s westward expansion, through the invention of the electric light, the telephone, the airplane and automobile and atomic power, all the way to the creation of NASA in 1958 and the launch of the Mercury missions that took the first Americans into space.”
That same pioneer spirit drove Armstrong from naval aviator in the Korean War to research pilot in California pioneering high-speed jets, rockets, helicopters and gliders, to NASA astronaut in Florida who, 50 years ago this summer, became the first man to walk the moon.
It is in the afterglow of that improbable moonshot that the Space Symposium opens this week at The Broadmoor hotel.
The relentless commitment of the country to land a man on the moon teed up the very technology-based economy that draws thousands of space-addled engineers, entrepreneurs and military experts to our city this week.
Hundreds of technological capabilities that will be on display at the symposium were unfurled during the Apollo space mission: next-generation computer innovations, virtual reality devices, advanced satellite television, medical imaging, weather forecasting gear, even cordless power tools.
In 1969, James Reston of the New York Times put it this way: “The great achievement of the men on the moon is not only that they made history, but that they expanded man’s vision of what history might be.”
Those were the days when all of us young boys wanted to be astronauts, and America led the world in public discovery. We were a spacefaring nation suddenly, putting aside our arguments about Vietnam and the cultural upheavals of the 1960s to look up at the sky.
More than any other annual national gathering, the Space Symposium keeps that “onward” spirit alive, keeps us looking up.
The moon landing will be a major theme of the symposium, punctuated by visits from Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, and retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Tom Stafford, who flew two Gemini missions and commanded Apollo 10 and the first U.S.-Soviet Union space mission, reporter Wayne Heilman writes in the Business section today.
Lockheed Martin’s full-scale lunar habitat will be one of the don’t-miss attractions.
A second space age driven by private sector space barons — Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Paul Allen — has supplanted that first space race between America and Russia. Now it’s the entrepreneurs and private innovators, many of whom will be in town this week, who are capturing the country’s imagination in their quests to put everyday citizens into space, and someday shuttle them all the way to Mars.
Why do so many people come to the symposium 50 years after that moonshot? To network and hobnob and sign contracts and shop their wares, sure. But there’s another, more romantic reason people gather in this Western outpost, and I would argue it is the same reason we once went to the moon and continue to reach for the stars. Because going to space gives us a unifying national purpose, it serves “to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, one which we intend to win” as Kennedy put it in his 1963 vow we would go to the moon by the end of the decade. We go to space not because it is easy, he said, but because it is hard.
I’ve always marveled that the average age of the engineers and technicians and test pilots who ran the Apollo mission down in Houston was 26. They were too young to realize that what they were doing was impossible.
For moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, who I hope to meet here this week, the lunar challenge did nothing less amid a year of turmoil than “reaffirm that the American dream was still possible.”
In this 50th anniversary moonshot year, let’s give the American dreamers at our symposium an especially warm welcome, and bid them lead us all in the continuing quest to live out Armstrong’s code: Onward.

House Democrat calls for Bill Barr to hand over summaries of Mueller report prepared by special counsel

Texto completo: The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday demanded that Attorney General William Barr release summaries of the Russia investigation prepared by special counsel Robert Mueller's own office.

Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., requested the documents from Barr via letter after the New York Times and Washington Post reported this week that members of Mueller's team have expressed concern Barr's four-page memo compiling the special counsel's findings did not properly reflect their work. The reporting also indicated Mueller staff had prepared their own summaries.

"I write to you regarding troubling press reports relating to your handling of Special Counsel Mueller’s report, and to urge that you immediately release to the public any 'summaries' contained in the report that may have been prepared by the Special Counsel," Nadler said.

The New York Democrat, who this week led his committee in authorizing itself to subpoena the report should Barr not turn over an unredacted version to Congress, said Thursday's demand did not "substitute" the complete conclusions being disclosed. He added that the Mueller summaries could be given to lawmakers quickly given they were drafted for the public.

"You have already provided an interpretation of the Special Counsel’s conclusions in a fashion that appears to minimize the implications of the report as to the President," he said. "Releasing the summaries—without delay—would begin to allow the American people to judge the facts for themselves.

The chairman is additionally asking for "all communications" between the Justice Department and Mueller in relation to the report.

DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told the Washington Examiner on Thursday that Barr continues to collaborate with the special counsel to ensure classified material, private grand jury testimony, or other sensitive information is removed from the final document.

The attorney general has previously told Congress a redacted report will be made available by mid-April.

Now Political Blocking of Critics Is Local

Texto completo: In recent days, President Trump has used Twitter to warn Mexico that he may close the border, to suggest that The New York Times and The Washington Post be stripped of their Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the special counsel's Russia investigation and to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates in 2018.
And if Mr. Trump had his way, Brandon Neely, among others, would be blocked from seeing any of those tweets.
Mr. Neely, a police officer in Houston, is one of an untold number of Twitter users who have been blocked by Mr. Trump. These users, if they are logged into their accounts, cannot see the president's tweets and are unable to reply to them or see others' responses.
The president's actions led Mr. Neely, along with six others blocked by Mr. Trump, to sue him, saying he had violated their First Amendment rights. A federal judge in Manhattan ruled against Mr. Trump last year, finding that the president's Twitter feed was a "public forum" and that his blockings were unconstitutional.
Mr. Trump appealed the ruling, and the case went before a three-judge panel in Manhattan last week. The judges seemed skeptical of Mr. Trump's contention that he was acting in a personal, not official, capacity when he blocked people.
Circuit Judge Barrington D. Parker asked Mr. Trump's counsel, a Justice Department lawyer, why blocking "points of view the president doesn't like" isn't "just a quintessential First Amendment violation."
How the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rules in the Trump case may have larger implications, as elected officials around the country expand the use of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Federal judges are grappling with the question of how the First Amendment may apply to those accounts.
Blocking on social media is not a partisan phenomenon. In 2017, for instance, ProPublica sent letters asking all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies whether they had blocked people on social media. Five Republican governors, four Democrats and four agencies responded with information about people they had blocked. Many agencies and more than half the governors did not respond.
In New York, the issue has arisen with Representative Peter King, a blunt and occasionally combative 14-term Republican congressman who represents parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. Recently, one of his constituents collected the names of about 70 people who said they had been blocked from commenting on Mr. King's Facebook page.
"He's like this big tough guy, but he doesn't want to hear any criticism whatsoever," said the constituent, Jacqueline Hassett, who has been blocked and has met with lawyers about the possibility of suing Mr. King.
The seven Twitter users who sued Mr. Trump have been unblocked, following the lower-court ruling. (Anybody blocked by the president can still, in theory, view Mr. Trump's tweets. In an entry on its F.A.Q. page, Twitter tells users, "If the account you've blocked isn't logged in or is accessing Twitter content via a third party, they may be able to see your public Tweets.")
Other judges have issued similar rulings: Earlier this year, the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., upheld a lower-court ruling that the Democratic chairwoman of the Loudoun County board of supervisors had violated the First Amendment rights of a constituent by blocking him on Facebook for about 12 hours.
Elsewhere, a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that three state assemblymen violated the First Amendment when they blocked a liberal advocacy group on Twitter; Jerry Brown, the former Democratic governor of California, produced records in 2017 showing that he had in the past blocked more than 1,500 people on Facebook and Twitter; and Paul Gosar, a Republican congressman of Arizona who in 2017 wrote a post on Facebook titled, "So you're upset I blocked you on Facebook. Here's why I don't care, a three-part series," said last year in a court filing that he was no longer blocking anyone.
Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which filed the Trump case and argued the Loudoun County appeal, said that social media accounts may be seen as public forums if they are used to make announcements related to government duties, engage with constituents about policy or if they use government resources -- if, for example, staffers create posts.
"Public officials all over the country are using social media often as the main means of communicating with their constituents," Mr. Jaffer said. "We want to make sure those officials aren't insulated from criticism, make sure participants in those digital spaces aren't deprived of the opportunity of hearing other citizens' divergent views and make sure these spaces retain their vitality and integrity and aren't transformed into echo chambers."
In many ways, Mr. King's Facebook page reflects his public persona. It includes pictures of him in a Long Island diner with retired firefighters, a video of him at a St. Patrick's Day parade and a description of a meeting with an Israeli diplomatic official.
The page also includes announcements that he was backing legislation to fund the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, co-sponsoring a tax deduction bill and introducing a resolution calling for the extradition of people in Cuba who have been charged with crimes in the United States.
Mr. King said during a telephone interview that he has the right to block who he wants on his Facebook page because it does not use government resources; he also contends that it is separate from his congressional work. He said that his campaign committee pays to boost his posts, which are meant to function like re-election ads.
"I wouldn't have to give any opponent an opportunity to comment on my campaign brochure," Mr. King said, adding that he only blocks some of his critics, usually those who make inappropriate remarks or comment frequently.
Mr. King has interacted with commenters, thanked supporters and sparred with critics. When a constituent from West Sayville, Chris Ann Rogers-Pellegrino, asked on Facebook in 2017 for a "special outside investigation into Trump Russia ties," and told Mr. King she hoped he was loyal to "the fabric of our democracy" his reply was: "My loyalty is to the Constitution, not the liberal zeitgeist."
Ms. Rogers-Pellegrino said she was blocked almost immediately after posting her message. Another constituent, Danielle Miller, said she was blocked last year after disagreeing with a post by Mr. King that said kneeling protests by professional football players were "rooted in the false narrative of police bias against black men."
Several constituents who had been blocked said they were concerned that limiting criticism would create a misleading impression that Mr. King's positions are more reflective of his district than they actually are.
Christine DiBiase Martorana, from Seaford, said she was blocked after posting she was disappointed in Mr. King's "continued emphasis on Islamic terrorism" and asking for his thoughts "on non-Muslim terrorists." Meg Rowe, from Brightwaters, said she was blocked after stating that she was keeping track of how many people Mr. King was blocking.
"It's infuriating, honestly," said Ms. Rowe, who in 2017 began a Facebook page called "Blocked by Peter King" to document blockings and the removal of posts. "We just want some avenue to talk with him, even if we disagree, because it's his job to listen to us."

Thanks to Byrdcall Studios for sponsoring this movie!
The next night, Saturday, April 6, our friends at Common Ground on the Hill are hosting The Nordic Fiddlers Bloc.

It’s just a little over a week until our annual celebration of marshmallow masterpieces! Join us April 12 through 23 for the Carroll County Arts Council’s 12th Annual PEEPshow.
This sweet event features more than 150 sculptures, graphic arts, oversized characters and mosaics created and inspired by PEEPs candy. In our theatre, enjoy short PEEP videos and footage of PEEPs being created at the Just Born factory.
All this marshmallow madness is a fundraiser for the Carroll County Arts Council. Your votes count toward selecting the Grand Prize Winner and Audience Favorites. Vote chips are sold at the entrance - make sure to get plenty! You can also vote online for your favorites. The top 5 entries that receive the most online votes also get a prize.
Of course, PEEPshow is about more than the art - it’s about the time-honored theatre tradition of concessions. Our concession stand offers PEEPs and other candy, PEEP popcorn and, new this year, slushies in souvenir PEEP drink cups! Join us for all the fun you have come to expect, including the PEEP-mobile and PEEPs mascots.
The 12th annual PEEPshow takes place April 12-23 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., with extended hours until 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.

Kraft wants speedy trial in prostitution case

Texto completo: Battling charges of soliciting prostitution, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is demanding a speedy trial along with efforts to block prosecutors from using videos and other evidence in his high-profile case.
This is right out of the playbook of two out-of-state lawyers whose law firm touts a "play to win" philosophy of representing clients.
"We're not waiving speedy trial," said Alex Spiro, of New York, during a hearing Tuesday. This means a trial must be held by late May, or within 90 days of Kraft's being charged in February.
He is one of 25 men charged after the bust at Orchids of Asia Day Spa, with hundreds more ensnared in an investigation across the state. Authorities told reporters they were looking into human trafficking along with prostitution at various massage parlors, though there have been no trafficking arrests.
After some last-minute paperwork corrections, Spiro and co-counsel William Burck, of Washington, D.C., will be formally cleared to join the 77-year-old Massachusetts billionaire's legal team. Such permission is required for lawyers who are not members of the Florida Bar.
Veteran West Palm Beach criminal defense attorney Jack Goldberger also works for Kraft, who has six Super Bowl rings and is accused of paying for sex acts at Orchids on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20.
Spiro told Palm Beach County Judge Leonard Hanser that the defense is asking the court to rule, even without a hearing, that a so-called "sneak-and-peek" warrant obtained by Jupiter police was illegal and all evidence obtained with it can't be used against Kraft.
"This type of warrant cannot be used in this type of case," Spiro said. The warrant gave the cops permission to install cameras inside the massage parlor rooms for their massage parlor sting.
Hanser set the next hearing in the case on April 12, with many more court dates to follow. Kraft will not have to attend any hearings before his trial.
Kraft has pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution.
There can be pros and cons to seeking a speedy trial, experts say.
Some lawyers refer to requests for a speedy trial as the "speedy game," said Mark Eiglarsh, a criminal defense attorney and legal analyst not involved in Kraft's case.
One possibility is defense lawyers try to get certain evidence excluded from trial, he said.
They might see "there's certain evidence that has not yet been turned over and the tactic is they might make an argument that certain evidence should be excluded since it hasn't been turned over by the time of trial."
But Mark Dobson, a professor with Nova Southeastern University's College of Law, said it could backfire in some cases where prosecutors are ready for trial. "It could be a case of, 'Be careful what you ask for,'" Dobson said. "It might be a case where one side is bluffing, and the other side calls their bluff."
Kraft has rejected a plea offer, called a deferred prosecution agreement, and his lawyers repeatedly have blasted the massage parlor investigation as illegal.
They have been particularly on the attack against videos taken from cameras planted in the massage parlor.
Prosecutors have not yet filed a response.
Kraft's side also wants the judge to prevent the videos from ever being released to the public, on the grounds that the evidence was obtained in violation of Kraft's Constitutional rights. Kraft's lawyers also said he can't get a fair trial unless the court minimizes "the effects of prejudicial pretrial publicity."
Last week, Kraft's lawyers wrote, "surely, the press ... has no legitimate right to possess such material."
But a coalition of media outlets, including the South Florida Sun Sentinel, has asked the court to reject Kraft, citing "the public's right to monitor this important proceeding." The media lawyers also argue that "the right of access to public records in Florida" is greater than Kraft's right to privacy.
There will be a hearing set on whether the media will be added as a party to the case, which would allow the media lawyers to fight for the videos and other evidence to be released to the public.
Kraft's lawyers said the court should address their motions on the warrant and evidence before considering the media's request.
Kraft moved to assemble his legal team within days of being charged, records show. Spiro and Burck work for the global law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, whose website advertises, "Litigation is a zero sum game. There are winners and losers. We play to win."
Burck, a former federal prosecutor and counsel in President George W. Bush's administration, lists "white collar criminal defense" among his specialties.
Burck also made headlines in The New York Times recently for his work screening documents in the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Spiro is a former New York prosecutor whose practice area "focuses largely on 'white collar' crime."
Goldberger, the local lawyer on the case, has been a highly respected criminal defense attorney for more than three decades. His clients have included billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Shutdown of Mexico border can result in less produce at stores

Texto completo: President Trump has threatened to "seal" the U.S.-Mexico border to combat illegal immigration – a move that might include shutting down trade, according to multiple news outlets.
Closing off trade would disrupt the flow of $26 billion of food imports in the U.S. from Mexico – threatening U.S. shoppers with potential shortages and higher prices for their groceries. Consumers would see the biggest impact at the produce section, which imports nearly $14 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico annually.
Top imports from Mexico: $2.3 billion worth of avocados in 2017; $1.8 billion in tomatoes; $2 billion in berries; and nearly $1 billion in peppers, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Trump renewed calls for tougher border security last week as he cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador – countries blamed for migrant caravans that travel through Mexico to enter the U.S. The president threatened to close the border with Mexico, adding closing off trade was a possibility, according to the New York Times.
Officials with Cincinnati-based Kroger, the nation's largest supermarket chain, declined comment.
Such a move would affect nearly 50 border crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border that would be closed for entry and exit, stopping the hundreds of thousands of people and an estimated $1.7 billion in goods and services that cross each day, according to the to State Department.
Americans would run out of avocados in three weeks if imports from Mexico were stopped, officials with the world's largest grower told Reuters.
"You couldn't pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U.S. right now," said Mission Produce CEO Steve Barnard.
White House officials expressed concern Monday about the potential effects if Trump follows through on his threat to shut down the US border with Mexico.
"We could be in a whole world of hurt," one White House official told CNN on Monday.
USA Today contributed.

Concord filmmaker's efforts bear fruit in Cuba

Texto completo: Years of work by a Concord filmmaker to help preserve thousands of Ernest Hemingway's papers and photographs reached a major milestone Saturday, as a $1.2 million facility was officially opened during a ceremony at the author's home in Cuba.
The joint US-Cuba effort to protect Hemingway documents, which has spanned nearly two decades, was spearheaded by Jenny Phillips, whose grandfather was Hemingway's editor.
“I don't think this project would have succeeded if Jenny weren't the force behind it, because Jenny was a woman who would never accept 'no' for an answer," said US Representative James McGovern, who has called for improved relations with Cuba.
On Saturday evening, officials from Boston's Finca Vigía Foundation and Cuba's National Cultural Heritage Council cut the ribbon on a state-of-the-art conservation center on the grounds of Hemingway's home on a hill overlooking Havana.
The center, which has been under construction since 2016, contains modern technology for cleaning and preserving a multitude of artifacts from the home where Hemingway lived in the 1940s and 1950s.
When he died in 1961, the author left approximately 5,000 photos, 10,000 letters, and perhaps thousands of margin notes in roughly 9,000 books at the property.
But access to those papers and photographs was limited.
When Phillips and her husband, Boston Globe State House bureau chief Frank Phillips, visited the house in 2001, she had asked to see letters between the author and Hemingway editor Maxwell Perkins.
Jenny Phillips, an accomplished documentary filmmaker, activist, and therapist, who died last summer, was the granddaughter of Perkins.
But she wasn't allowed access to the basement, where the materials were kept.
That encounter in Cuba touched off the yearslong international effort to preserve Hemingway's house, along with his letters, documents, and photographs, while also making digital copies available elsewhere.
A Hemingway biographer called the cache of documents a “CAT scan of Hemingway's brain," The New York Times reported in 2002.
Jenny and Frank Phillips helped found the Finca Vigía Foundation in 2002 — named after Hemingway's house in Cuba — to assist in preservation efforts.
Working with McGovern, a process was launched to gain access to thousands of Hemingway's records, including letters and photographs, and digital copies were brought to the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Dorchester.
McGovern attended Saturday's ceremony at the new facility in Cuba, during which several speakers recognized Phillips' contributions to protecting Hemingway's materials.
“This is really a tribute to her," McGovern said.
“All of us, the Americans, the Cubans . . . felt her presence there," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Monday hosted about 300 guests, including felons, at the White House for the "First Step Act Celebration," a party intended to bring attention to a rare piece of bipartisan legislation he passed last year and which he plans to highlight on the campaign trail.
The East Room celebration capped a day of events dedicated to overhauling the criminal justice system, an issue that agencies across the government have been asked to elevate.
The labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, participated in a panel on workforce development. Ben Carson, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, led a session about prisoner re-entry. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior adviser, weighed in at a session dealing with incarcerated women. Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star, was even invited to participate in the panels and the party, but could not attend.
Months after the legislation passed, and amid foreign policy blunders and a defeat on funding a wall along the southern border, Trump's administration is putting the issue front and center;
"As president, I pledged to work with both parties for the good of the whole nation," Trump said at the East Room gathering, pointing to the legislation as an example of bipartisan work that he said was "so important to me."
But some activists who helped work on the legislation - which would expand job training and early-release programs, and modify sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders - have expressed concern that Trump is more attuned to the political opportunities the law offers him, rather than with ensuring it is enacted effectively.

Texto completo: Press
WASHINGTON — A career official in the White House security office says dozens of people in President Donald Trump’s administration were granted security clearances despite “disqualifying issues” in their backgrounds, such as concerns about foreign influence, drug use and criminal conduct.
Tricia Newbold, an 18-year government employee who oversees the issuance of clearances for some senior White House aides, says she compiled a list of at least 25 officials who were initially denied security clearances last year because of their backgrounds. But she says senior Trump aides overturned those decisions, moves that she said weren’t made “in the best interest of national security.”
Newbold’s allegations were detailed in a letter and memo released on Monday by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform committee. Cummings’ panel has been investigating security clearances issued to senior officials including Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and former White House aide Rob Porter.
The documents don’t identify the officials on Newbold’s list but they note that two are “current senior White House officials.”
The release of the information comes about a month after The New York Times reported that Trump ordered officials to grant Kushner a clearance over the objections of national security officials and after Newbold spoke out to NBC News and other news outlets about her concerns. It also sets the stage for another fight between the White House and the Democratic-controlled House. Cummings said he will move this week to authorize his first subpoena in the probe.
Cummings said the subpoena will be for the deposition of Carl Kline, who served as the White House personnel security director and supervised Newbold. He has since left the White House for the Defense Department.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
Rep. Jim Jordan, the committee’s ranking Republican, said in a statement that Cummings’ probe is a “partisan attack” and an “excuse to go fishing” through personnel files. He also said that one person on Newbold’s list is a GSA custodian.
Newbold laid out her experience in the White House during a March 23 interview with bipartisan committee staff. Portions of that interview were in the memo released by Cummings.
According to the memo, Newbold’s list of overturned security clearance denials included “two current senior White House officials, as well as contractors and individuals throughout different components of the Executive Office of the President.”
“According to Ms. Newbold, these individuals had a wide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use, and criminal conduct,” the memo says.
Newbold said she raised her concerns up the chain of command in the White House to no avail. Instead, she said, the White House retaliated, suspending her in January for 14 days without pay for not following a new policy requiring that documents be scanned as separate PDF files rather than one single PDF file.
Newbold said that when she returned to work in February, she was cut out of the security clearance process and removed from a supervisory responsibility.
The committee previously has singled out Flynn, Porter and Kushner as it sought records from the White House about how their clearances were handled.
Flynn maintained his clearance even after the White House learned he lied to the FBI about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador and that he was under federal investigation by the Justice Department for his previous foreign work.
Kushner failed to initially disclose numerous foreign meetings on security clearance forms, and according to the Times, career officials recommended against granting him one before Trump personally overruled them.
Porter had high-level access with an interim security clearance even though the FBI repeatedly told the White House of past allegations of domestic violence lodged against him by two ex-wives.
Porter resigned after the allegations becoming public.

Texto completo: The Brooklyn Dodgers met an old friend on a trip to St. Louis early in the 1955 season. Preacher Roe, a sly and slender lefty who had just retired to West Plains, Mo., entertained his former teammates at the Chase Hotel. He needed their advice.
"We sat around a big table, all talking to Preacher," recalls Carl Erskine, a top Dodgers starter then. "He said, 'Fellas, I want to ask you a question: Sports Illustrated has offered me $ 2,000 to tell them how I threw the spitter. You think I should do that or not? With that $ 2,000 I can blacktop my driveway and I can fix up my house. I could really use that $ 2,000. What do you think?'
"The guys all said, 'Yeah, go ahead, Preach, sure, why not?' I did not. I admired Preacher. He was a great study to watch pitch. He was very clever and won a lot of games; he was really a pitcher's pitcher. So I didn't say yes to that. As we were leaving the dining room, Preacher said, 'I didn't hear you speak up.' I said, 'No, I didn't, Preacher. You were such an outstanding pitcher without the spitter, I'd hate to see you taint your whole career by talking about throwing it.'
"So anyway, Preacher did the article, he got the $ 2,000, and sometime later when I talked to Preach he said, 'Carl, you know what? I just ruined my chances for the Hall of Fame by admitting I threw the spitter, and you're the only one that advised me not to do it.' And I said, 'Well, Preacher, I saw you pitch, you were a pitcher's pitcher. You could have won without the spitter."'
Maybe, maybe not. While Erskine believed in Roe, the man himself didn't: In his confession, Roe said he turned to the pitch after slumping to 4--15 with the Pirates in 1947. Reviving the spitter, which he had practiced with Harry Brecheen as a Cardinals farmhand, was his last chance. He made the most of it, becoming a regular All-Star, though not quite a Cooperstown candidate, for the Dodgers. Cheating only made sense.
"Why shouldn't I have?" Roe told Dick Young in the Sports Illustrated article. "I was about through when I decided to get me the pitch. 'If I get caught,' I told myself, 'they'll kick me out. If I don't, I'm through anyway, so how can I lose?"'
He didn't lose very often. Roe won so much -- he had a .715 winning percentage over seven seasons with Brooklyn -- that he guessed the spitter had earned him $ 100,000. On the bench between innings, Roe would pop a stick of Beech-Nut gum into his mouth and announce, "I'm going to get me a new batch of curveballs." In the game, he'd spit on the meaty part of his thumb while pretending to wipe his brow. Then, while hitching his belt, he'd subtly wipe his index and middle fingers on the saliva. Two wet fingers on top, a dry thumb underneath, and Roe was ready. He compared it to squeezing a peach pit or a watermelon seed with your fingertips.
"The idea is to get part of your grip wet, and the other dry," he said. "When the ball leaves your hand, it slips off your wet fingers and clings, just tiny-like, to the dry part of your thumb. The ball jumps on account of it. If it's a good 'un, it drops like a dead duck just when it crosses the plate."
Roe's confession only confirmed his reputation. As Stan Musial wrote decades later, "I'd always be first-pitch hitting against Roe, because when he had two strikes on you, he'd usually load up, and I hated to get a shower." Anticipation of the spitter helped Roe, and he knew how to destroy evidence. He was never caught in the act.
"The umpire would call for the ball, and Preacher would stomp around and look at his hand like, 'Uh-oh, you probably got me this time,"' Erskine says, "and then instead of tossing the ball in, he'd roll it to the umpire on the ground!"
Like steroid users decades later, Roe stayed ahead of the cops and thrived. But his pang of regret to Erskine -- at least for going public and bursting his cloud of mystery -- showed that he knew what he had done. The specter of the dark arts would indeed follow Roe to his grave; when he died in 2008, the word "spitball" appeared in the headline of his New York Times obituary.
The mound was a speakeasy
After two chaotic decades or so, the spitball was banned for 1920, the same year the country went dry under Prohibition. The rule simply turned the mound into a speakeasy, with many pitchers going undercover to get the same slippery edge as their predecessors.
The physics behind the spitball is simple enough: When the ball slides off wet fingers, it loses backspin and therefore rotates less -- something like a knuckleball, which should not rotate at all, or a forkball tumbling in its final plunge.
Defacing the surface of a ball produces the same kind of effect -- added movement, to the opposite side of the scuff. This also dates to the game's early days. Imagine what the baseballs looked like in the early 20th century:
"We'd play a whole game with one ball, if it stayed in the park," Wahoo Sam Crawford, a Hall of Famer who played from 1899 to 1917, says in "The Glory of Their Times," a book by Lawrence S. Ritter.
"Lopsided, and black, and full of tobacco and licorice stains," Crawford continues. "The pitchers used to have it all their way back then."
Even the possibility of scuffing gives pitchers an edge. These words come from Chet Brewer, a star for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League in the late 1920s, and they sound timeless:
"A cut ball? I got credit for that," he told John Holway in the book "Black Diamonds." "If I picked up a rough one, I didn't throw it out of the game. I didn't exactly put the cuts on it myself, but I could pitch it."
Scuffing charges never dogged Mike Mussina, a Hall of Fame right-hander for the Orioles and the Yankees from 1991 to 2008. But like any smart pitcher, he would never reject a ball that came to him with a mark. This was Mussina's order for every catcher: If a ball scrapes the ground, never volunteer it to the umpire.
"Say a guy hits a ground ball to short and they throw it back to me from first base -- as soon as I grab the ball, I'm running my thumb over these," Mussina says. He is holding a ball and referring to the white area within the horseshoe. "Do I have a sinker out of this ball? And if I find one I think's pretty good, I flip it to the other side to see if it's scuffed up on the wrong side."
By that he means the opposite side; if both horseshoe areas are scuffed, they'll counteract each other, to no advantage. If there's a scuff where the seams narrow -- the sweet spot -- it creates a four-seam sinker, a pitch that spins like a straight fastball but veers away, in the direction opposite the scuff.
A common lament among retired pitchers is that too many balls are now thrown out of play. To them, it underscores a lack of craftsmanship on the mound.
"I've literally seen teammates, when there's a scuff on the ball they get rid of it," says Jamie Moyer, who won 269 games in a career that ended in 2012, the year he turned 50. "They'll say, 'Oh, it does funny stuff,' and you go, 'Wait a minute, that funny stuff can be a benefit to you!"'
Hitters are conditioned now to ask umpires to discard any ball that skips. Umpires and catchers know this, so catchers tend to have an almost reflexive response: They will spear a ball from the dirt, transfer it quickly to their throwing hand, and hold it up for the ump to keep or reject.
Of course, some fielders still try to create a scuff: Catchers may deliberately short-hop their throws before innings, and outfielders may do the same on routine throws to the infield. But times have changed.
"When I played, a ball hit the dirt, it was still in play," says Chili Davis, the Mets hitting coach, who played from 1981 to 1999. "Today's game, if a catcher throws a ball down to second on a short hop, or a ball gets blocked in the dirt, that ball's out of the game. It's just automatic now."
Pitchers also seek ways to look natural while applying moisture or tackiness to their fingers. One former player, now a broadcaster, reached into his team's ball bag for me and pulled out a canister of colorless Tuf-Skin, a spray that helps secure athletic tape. With one spritz of Tuf-Skin on my arm, I had an invisible island of instant tackiness for my fingers.
That's also why pitchers like putting clear BullFrog sunscreen on their arms. Grab the rosin bag, aimlessly touch the BullFrog spot, and you'll have just enough stickiness to help guide your pitches. One catcher says he has seen pitchers leave the dugout between innings and wrap their fingers around a ball coated with pine tar, leaving just enough residue on their hands to get a better grip when they return to the mound.
Next time you go to a game, notice all the surfaces a pitcher touches with his hand. Pitchers are fidgety creatures, constantly tugging and swiping and scratching their caps, their sleeves, their skin, something. Corey Kluber, the two-time Cy Young Award winner for Cleveland, grabs his tongue on the mound before every pitch -- which became legal again years ago -- then wipes his hand on the side of his pants.
"The way they rub the balls up now, they rub them up all in advance," Kluber says. "They're not rubbed up all day, and they sit in the bucket with all the dust and stuff, and they get so slippery. Just get a little bit of moisture on your hand, at least. You've still got to wipe it off, obviously, but you get a little bit of moisture on your hand so the ball's not as dry."
Kluber does this no matter the weather, but such tactics are especially handy in the cold and at high altitude, where it's harder to generate moisture.
"I tell you what," says one 10-year veteran, "if they could get a camera behind the dugout in Colorado, it would be like a mad scientist's laboratory down there, people doing anything they can to find a grip."
Most players, even hitters, tend to accept this practice. A pitch can be an instrument of destruction, after all, and a hitter would rather the pitcher know where it's going than accidentally fire a cue ball at his head. It is a fine distinction, to be sure, but this is the logic: Tackiness helps command and finish on a pitch, and that's O.K. Sandpaper or K-Y Jelly helps enhance movement, and that's not.
"In the cold weather in Minnesota, you had to have something to grip the curveball," says Jim Kaat, who starred for the Twins in the 1960s. "Pitchers for years have lobbied: If hitters can use pine tar to grip the bat better -- it doesn't help 'em hit it any farther -- we should be able to use pine tar."
Then again, it comes back to discretion: In 2014, when the Yankees' Michael Pineda brazenly smeared pine tar on his neck on a chilly night at Fenway Park, it was so overt that the Red Sox felt compelled to object. Pineda got a 10-game suspension and widespread ridicule. But generally, as long as a pitcher is discreet, the other side has no problem with pine tar.
Where are today's outlaws?
Pine tar is one thing -- cheating by the letter of the law, yes, but not by the spirit. Whatever happened to the spitball, the Hall of Fame pitch of Jack Chesbro and Ed Walsh, Stan Coveleski and Red Faber, Burleigh Grimes and Gaylord Perry? Richie Ashburn, who had the most hits of the 1950s, always thought of pitchers as shifty characters, never to be trusted.
Where have all the scoundrels gone?
When I asked Perry in 2018 why more pitchers were not as, shall we say, crafty as they were in his day, he had a short but telling answer: "Well, maybe they don't need it." Dan Plesac, who pitched in more than 1,000 games, agreed.
"You're not looking for a Don Sutton now, a guy that can sink it and cut it and make the ball move," Plesac says. "If you don't have velocity, you can't pitch anymore. How many guys, how many real power pitchers, need to scuff the ball to be successful? Not many. You don't need to, if your stuff is that good."
Plesac works for MLB Network, founded in 2009, the hub of baseball's vast and ever-expanding visual empire. Every fan can watch games on the At Bat app. Every team has a bank of video screens, usually just off the dugout, showing every conceivable angle for replays and analysis. Good luck evading the most sophisticated alarm system in baseball history.
"When there's so many TV cameras, it's so hard to get away with it," says Jason Giambi, who played 20 seasons in the majors. "You have so many sets of eyes on these guys, and especially if they see a pitch that looks really abnormal, the (team video analyst) rewinds it 5,000 times: 'O.K., what did he do different? Oh, he went to the side of his pants, he went to his belt, he went to the top of his hat.' Then they start to put together the timeline of every time he's pitched, does that ball do the same thing? What about his last start, his start before that? And before you know it, they've got it down -- all right, go tell the umpire to check his hat, or check the side of his pants, or check inside his glove. You can't hide anymore."
But what if you could? What if the next Preacher Roe or Gaylord Perry was hiding in plain sight on a diamond near you, fiendishly fooling all the viewers and video technicians at the ballpark and beyond?
He could blacktop a lot of driveways by selling those secrets -- and he'd probably keep the supplies after finishing the job. The sticky sealant just might come in handy.
The article is an excerpt from "K: A History of Baseball In Ten Pitches," by Tyler Kepner, a New York Times sportswriter. The book will be released on April 2.

Texto completo: At an awards ceremony last year for cheerleaders at Tremper High School in Kenosha, Wis., some of the students received awards called "Big Booty," "Big Boobie" and "String Bean." Similar awards had been given to students in 2017.
Now, prizes like those have been banned in the district.
Coaches described the mock awards as good-natured teasing, but some parents and students were appalled, and the event was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union, which sent a formal warning to the Kenosha Unified School District last month.
On Monday, a letter from the district superintendent, Sue Savaglio-Jarvis, said that "the district has taken prompt and remedial action in order to protect the students and to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring in the future."
"Mock awards of any such kind per the date of this memo are strictly prohibited," it added.
There was also a mandatory training session on discrimination and harassment for administrators, principals, assistant principals and supervisors on Monday. Dr. Savaglio-Jarvis said that district staff members would be disciplined or fired if they harassed students or saw harassment and did not report it.
In its warning letter, the A.C.L.U. said it might sue the district because it had "failed to take any meaningful corrective action" in the case.
That warning also pointed out that in addition to the awards ceremony at Tremper, there were concerns that another high school in the district, Bradford High School, showed a video in its health classes that seemed to blame victims for sexual assault. The district removed that video from the curriculum.
The district also updated a dress code policy last year that had barred girls from wearing yoga pants, leggings and tank tops after the A.C.L.U. challenged its enforcement.
On Monday, a spokeswoman for the Kenosha Unified School District said that two coaches involved in the cheerleading controversy were no longer with the district.
"Kenosha Unified recognizes our obligation to provide students and staff an environment free of discrimination and harassment and realizes the issues brought forth are not acceptable," the district said in a statement.
"It is our sincere hope that by outlining expectations and providing ongoing training to our staff we can avoid further issues of any kind. At this time, training has started with administration and coaches."
About 100 people, including parents, coaches and students, attended last year's ceremony in Kenosha, where students also received awards for athletic achievements. Last month, a cheerleader at Tremper High School spoke with The New York Times and described how she felt when the coaches gave the mock awards.
"When the girl went up to accept the Big Boobie award, what do you think everyone in the room was looking at?" she said. "I would've died."

Texto completo: Donald Trump won the 2016 election last weekend - again.
The professional Trump Haters in Washington, Manhattan and Hollywood are still in full denial mode, though, and they’re refusing to accept Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s determination that the president and his campaign did not collude with the Russians.
It’s sad.
The anti-Trump zealots in the Democrat Party and liberal media have been deluding themselves for two years that Mueller and his lawyers were going to nail Trump on collusion, obstruction or any number of impeachable crimes.
Journalists at the New York Times and the Washington Post swallowed every crazy story the Democrats spun about Trump - and then blared them as fact on their front pages with little or no skepticism.
Meanwhile, MSNBC/CNN’s troika of Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews and Don Lemon piled on nightly.
In addition to their own left-liberal rants, they paraded out every Trump enemy or ex-Obama team member they could find to call the president a liar, a crook, a tax cheat, a dictator, a traitor, a puppet of Putin. …
But the Trump Haters’ bubble broke with a huge pop last weekend when Attorney General William Barr reported that Mueller’s investigation had found that the president was telling the truth.
“No collusion on Russia” was crushing news for the lefties and fake journalists on MSNBC and CNN, the co-flagships of the Fake News fleet.
Maddow and Lemon almost cried on camera, and Matthews was so speechless he couldn’t interrupt anyone.
I’d cry too if I were one of those guys.
After two years of being wrong, wrong, wrong about Trump and the Russians, their credentials as pundits or commentators are shot - and apparently even many of their loyal viewers know it.
The large audience of liberals Maddow had built up with her tedious nightly “seminars” about Trump’s alleged treason dropped by about 20 percent this week - probably because so many distraught viewers are visiting grief counselors.
Maddow and her equally deranged MSNBC colleague “Morning Joe” Scarborough are in complete denial.
They are not apologizing for how they and the biased journalists in their political camp got it so wrong about Russian collusion.
Maddow and Scarborough are imitating my own embarrassing Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, who claims to know stuff about Trump that Mueller’s army of lawyers and investigators could not dig up.
They are now nitpicking Attorney General William Barr’s synopsis of the Mueller report and hinting of an even bigger conspiracy.
Meanwhile, President Trump has the last laugh - a big one - and he now has the high political ground.
He’s already embarked on a “No Collusion” victory tour in the Midwest and his chances are looking better than ever for reelection in 2020.
Without collusion and obstruction, the Democrats have no major issues left to attack President Trump.
The economy is still doing great. Unemployment among blacks, Latinos and women is at all-time lows. Incomes and wages are going up.
The Democrats’ new socialist ideas - Medicare for all, free college tuition and the silly Green New Deal - are impossible dreams that can never be paid for.
So all they really have is collusion, obstruction and impeachment, which is why we’ll be seeing Mueller and Barr dragged into the House of Representatives to be interrogated by Schiff and his fellow desperate Democrats.
Democrats, like Maddow, Morning Joe and Lemon, have always believed Robert Mueller was going to come in and give them the game-winning TD they needed to finally defeat Trump.
But thanks to the Mueller report, all they can do now is throw Hail Marys into the end zone and pray that Mueller or Bill Barr will be called for pass interference.

Getting a grip on personal data

Texto completo: "Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data." Eva Velasquez President and CEO of the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center
The headlines are constant: Millions of accounts hacked. Health and financial data stolen. Personal information shared widely with advertisers and technology companies.
New Jersey is not immune. More than 4 million New Jersey accounts were affected by security breaches in 2017, according to the most recent state estimates, and a Pew survey published that year found that a majority of Americans have personally experienced some sort of data theft or fraud.
Welcome to the new normal.
Against that backdrop, New Jersey is starting to grapple with some of the thorniest questions of the digital age. Yes, consumers can take steps to protect themselves online, as outlined by the state's cybersecurity unit. But what responsibilities do companies have in collecting your personal information? Who controls that data? And what should be done if it's compromised?
State policymakers are debating those issues right now. New Jersey law already requires companies to tell customers when information such as Social Security or credit card numbers is hacked, but a bill on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk would expand that list to include things like email addresses and passwords, which are often all that is needed to break into an online account.
Other measures working their way through the Legislature would allow online users to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties and require mobile apps to better inform users of how their location data may be used.
The reexamination of New Jersey's laws governing cybersecurity and online privacy comes in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches — affecting Marriott, Yahoo, Panera, Under Armour, Target, Equifax and Home Depot, to name just a few companies — and as incidents like the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the unauthorized use of Facebook profiles have made people more sensitive to how tech firms monetize user-generated information.
This month, The New York Times reported that Facebook is under criminal investigation for data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies that provided intrusive access to users' personal information.
Dozens of other states are looking to update their consumer protection policies, too. At least 31 states, for example, considered legislation to amend existing security breach laws last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws and any of the laws that are around identity crimes and cybersecurity and things of that nature because this is such a dynamic space," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that offers free assistance to victims of identity theft and provides educational resources about online fraud and security.
Her organization tracked 1,244 security breaches that occurred throughout the U.S. in 2018, exposing a staggering 447 million records — more than double the number of records exposed the previous year.
The proposals in New Jersey could have sweeping effects on consumers and companies alike.
The measure closest to becoming law, S-52, would force companies to disclose data breaches involving an expanded definition of "personal information." The bipartisan bill was approved unanimously in the Legislature and now awaits a signature or veto by Murphy, a Democrat.
Current state law mandates that companies tell customers when their driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers or credit or debit card numbers have been compromised. The bill would expand that list to include user names, email addresses and passwords or security questions and answers that could be used to gain access to an online account.
"You take someone's user name and password — that can already be linked to their credit card account" on many websites, said Sen. Troy Singleton, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the bill. With notification of the breach, however, consumers can potentially take defensive measures or at least monitor the compromised account more closely, he said.
Another bill that has yet to receive a hearing in committee, A-3541, gets to the heart of another big question after security breaches: When do customers have the right to know that their information was compromised?
Current law simply says disclosures must be made "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay." The bill would accelerate that timeline, requiring companies to disclose a breach to customers within five days of discovering it unless it is still under investigation by the company or law enforcement.
Other proposals would change what data companies have control of in the first place.
One measure, A-4974, would require mobile apps that collect users' GPS data to share how that data is used and require users to opt in to the disclosure of that data to third parties, such as advertisers.
Another measure, S-2834, is modeled on language from the European Union's sweeping new data protection legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. It would require commercial websites and services to tell users all the "personally identifiable information" they collect and give users a chance to opt out of having that data shared with third parties.
A similar provision was included in the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was also modeled on the GDPR and signed into law last year.
Those bills, which have been approved in one committee but must clear several more procedural hurdles before becoming law, have encountered resistance from companies whose business models depend on the collection and sale of personal information.
At a hearing in Trenton last month, Gerard Keegan, vice president for state legislative affairs with CTIA, a trade association for the wireless communications industry, argued that the proposals would have unintended consequences and could undercut many of the products and services that people enjoy.
"Many news sites, online content providers, apps provide those services and products free of charge because they are supported by advertising," Keegan said. "To force those companies to still provide those services and products to consumers who won't share identifying information with advertisers is wrong and will possibly lead to those companies' being shut down in the state."
The future of the bills remains uncertain, but their introduction reflects a growing awareness among residents and lawmakers about how information shared online can be used, abused or stolen.
Asked for her suggestions about how people can improve the security of their personal information, Velasquez, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, emphasized the need to think critically about where to share such information in the first place.
"Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data," she said. "Make that decision carefully. Give it the thought and provide it the internal weight that it deserves."

'EL ÚLTIMO MALÓN' at Maysles Cinema (April 2, 7 p.m.). The Maysles notes that this Argentine film from the late 1910s anticipates the staged documentaries of Robert Flaherty ("Nanook of the North"). The writer Alcides Greca recreated the poor living conditions and the eventual 1904 uprising of indigenous Argentines in the province of Santa Fe. The theater will screen this new restoration with live piano accompaniment.

NEW DIRECTORS/NEW FILMS at the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art (through April 7). Every spring, the movie programmers at the Film Society and MoMA venture across the battlefield that runs from West 65th Street to West 53rd Street for a brief détente, which takes the form of this celebration of up-and-coming directors from around the world. Among the peace offerings this year are "Bait" (on Friday and Saturday), filmed in black-and-white 16-millimeter on the Cornish coast, and the Sundance-award-winning documentary "Honeyland" (on Wednesday and April 5), about a Macedonian beekeeper and her inconsiderate new neighbors. Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott highlighted their favorite titles from this year's edition in Wednesday's paper.

REELABILITIES FILM FESTIVAL at various locations (April 2-9). With a mix of narrative features and documentaries, this showcase highlights the lives of people and characters living with deafness, mental illness, autism, addiction and Tourette syndrome. In the opening film, "Moonlight Sonata: Deafness in Three Movements" (on Tuesday at JCC Manhattan), the director Irene Taylor Brodsky examines how different degrees of hearing loss molded her family; she shares the experiences of her deaf parents and a son who has grown up with cochlear implants. The film follows the boy as he learns to play Beethoven's "Moonlight" Sonata.

SECOND ANNUAL DR. SAUL AND DOROTHY KIT FILM NOIR FESTIVAL at Lenfest Center for the Arts (through March 31). A new addition to the classic film buff's calendar, the Kit Film Noir Festival is this year organized around adaptations of Cornell Woolrich, whose writings provided the basis for François Truffaut's "The Bride Wore Black" and Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window" (both screening on Sunday), among the better-known titles, and who dropped out of Columbia, where this event is being hosted. But the bulk of the weekend, which intersperses movies and lectures, consists of seedier, less frequently revived work, including a double feature of B movies based on his stories on Saturday afternoon and, that night, a 35-millimeter showing of "The Chase," starring Robert Cummings, which is regarded as strange even by the standards of noir.

STRANGE DESIRE: THE FILMS OF CLAIRE DENIS at BAM Rose Cinemas (March 29-April 9). When making a list of the greatest uses of pop music in screen history, clear plenty of room for this French filmmaker, a clear lock for both the use of "The Rhythm of the Night" at the end of "Beau Travail" (on Friday) -- her poetic, elliptical spin on Herman Melville's "Billy Budd" -- and the Commodores' "Nightshift" in "35 Shots of Rum" (on Sunday and April 6), the director's tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. But soundtrack selections are only a small part of the pleasure in BAM's survey of Denis's films, in anticipation of her new sci-fi movie, "High Life," opening on April 5. The treat is a rare screening of "U.S. Go Home" (on April 6). Named for a bit of graffiti seen near the end of the film, it's actually a coming-of-age story about a teenage girl (Alice Houri) who sets out to lose her virginity one night and experiences a long evening of disillusionment, culminating in an awkward ride home from an American soldier (Vincent Gallo).

TOTAL KAURISMAKI SHOW at the Metrograph (March 29-April 11). The Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki ("The Other Side of Hope," showing on April 8 and 10) makes movies that are somehow simultaneously among the bleakest and the most uplifting in world cinema: They combine a deadpan Scandinavian sense of humor with a profound empathy for the downtrodden. The biggest gets in this retrospective are his 1980s and '90s films, which the Metrograph will screen in archival 35-millimeter prints. In the droll modern-Shakespeare riff "Hamlet Goes Business" (on Friday, Saturday and Sunday), the melancholy Dane fits right into Kaurismaki's universe, while in "Ariel" (on Friday), a miner (Turo Pajala) loses his job and stays stoic through an unceasing parade of misery before coming out on, well, the other side of hope.

Times Talks
SCREENTIMES: 'THE BEST OF ENEMIES' at Florence Gould Hall (April 3, 7 p.m.). Melena Ryzik, a New York Times culture reporter, will host an advance screening of this new drama, followed by a Q. and A. with its stars, Sam Rockwell and Taraji P. Henson, and its writer-director, Robin Bissell. Based on a true story, "The Best of Enemies" centers on the extraordinary relationship between Ann Atwater (Henson), a fearless and outspoken civil rights activist, and C. P. Ellis (Rockwell), a local Ku Klux Klan leader, and how they initiated school desegregation in Durham, N.C., in 1971. Bissell will discuss his directorial debut and Henson will share the timely relevance of this pivotal moment in civil rights history.

What every journalist should read about the Russia investigation

Texto completo: It’s easy to imagine Bret Stephens sobbing as he filed his latest column for the New York Times, but he deserves some credit for writing what is probably the most thoughtful piece yet on the news media’s ugly Russia belly flop.

Stephens, a Never Trump writer driven mad by the 2016 election, wrote Thursday that the special counsel’s finding that there was no Russia collusion and no obstruction of justice should force the media to recognize that the president isn’t a stupid monster after all.

“Whichever view one takes, Donald Trump has just won a major victory over his chosen political enemies, including this newspaper,” he wrote. “Whether he’s achieved this through genius or luck, it would behoove us not to take him for a fool. This was the week to examine our own foolishness instead.”

It’s rare that you have to actually take seriously anything any columnist in any national newspaper has to say, but Stephens hates Trump so much that this is one of those rare occasions of statement against interest. (Stephens’ hatred for Trump runs so deep that he devoted an entire column to say that he doesn’t think the president is funny.)

Not that any of Stephens’ colleagues are prepared to be as forthcoming. If journalists aren’t lying about what’s in the summary of the special counsel’s report, they’re doubting the conclusion of the two-year-long investigation, or changing the subject altogether. Charles Blow, another tortured Times columnist, wrote Monday that the special counsel report was never really the main thing, even as he wrote just three months ago that Trump “openly attempted to obstruct justice.” The main thing, according to Blow, is that Trump is a mean racist. “[I]t is the moral abomination of having a racist, sexist, child-caging, family-separating, Muslim-hating transphobe as president that must remain front and center,” wrote Blow on Monday.

He and every other journalist in the national media should read Stephens’ column. He might learn something.

Texto completo: Dick Cheney and Nancy Pelosi are hardly political bedfellows, but a recent Facebook post puts the politicians in cahoots in connection with an old law.
“Congress quietly repealed the McCarran Warner Act of 1952 forbidding ‘Muslims’ from holding office,” reads the text of the post published on March 20. “Members of that Congress were Dick Cheney, John McCain, Joe Biden, Al Gore, John Kerry, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi…... see the agenda?”
We didn’t, but the post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
First, let’s look at the law. It’s called the McCarran-Walter Act, not the McCarran Warner Act, and it’s actually the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. It’s named for Pat McCarran, then a Democratic senator from Nevada, and Francis Walter, then a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania. Both men worried about communists infiltrating the country through the immigration system, and they wanted to limit who could come to the United States.
The resulting law codified an existing quota system for immigration. It also introduced a new system that gave preferences to some immigrants based on their skill sets and whether they would be reunited with their families.
As the U.S. Department of State’s Office of the Historian notes, the new act revised the 1924 National Origins Quota System by admitting people of different nationalities to the United States at a rate of one-sixth of 1 percent of however many immigrants from a country were living in the United States in 1920.
That meant that 85 percent of about 154,000 visas available annually went to people from northern and western European lineage. President Harry Truman worried that the law was discriminatory, but Congress had enough votes to override his veto.
The law does not mention religion nor Muslims. It also doesn’t bar Muslims from holding office is incorrect.
But over the years, according to a 1990 story in the New York Times, it was used to deny entry to the United States to people like writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Ian Smith, the former prime minister of Rhodesia.
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan sponsored legislation to repeal the section of the law that excludes aliens for ideological reasons, and in February 1990 it passed the Senate 98-0 as an amendment to a State Department spending bill, the Times reported.
“The measure covers only aliens seeking to enter the United States for short visits,” the paper said. “Those seeking permanent status can still be barred because of their beliefs or memberships.”
But a State Department spokesman then said that the legislation wouldn’t noticeably change current policy, since a 1977 measure already required that people denied entry because of their beliefs be granted a waiver unless it could be shown that they posed a national security threat.
The repeal legislation still allowed the secretary of state to deny entry to someone identified as a terrorist.
Next, let’s look at who the members of Congress were in 1990. Schumer and Pelosi were in the House, and McCain, Biden, Gore, Kerry and McConnell were in the Senate. Dick Cheney, meanwhile, was secretary of defense for then-President George H.W. Bush.
Our ruling
Though Congress repealed a provision of the McCarran-Walter Act, the law never forbid Muslims from holding office as the Facebook post claims.
We rate this statement as False.

Poll says parents hinder children's life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.

Texto completo: INTERNATIONAL
An article on Tuesday about five Taliban officials who were jailed at the American detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, misidentified the source of a transcript of Mullah Mazloom's remarks to an initial tribunal hearing at Guantánamo. The transcript was obtained by The New York Times in a Freedom of Information Act request; it was not released by WikiLeaks.
SPORTS
An article on Tuesday about an N.F.L. rule change that will allow challenges on pass interference described incorrectly the way the challenges will be used. Coaches may use them for the first 28 minutes of each half, not in the first 58 minutes of the game. In the last two minutes of each half, only replay officials may challenge a call, not just in the final two minutes of the game.
ARTS
An article on Tuesday about a settlement between MoMA PS1 and a curator who accused the museum of discrimination misidentified the position that Nikki Columbus was offered. It was associate curator of performance, not curator of performance.
OPINION
An editorial on Wednesday referred imprecisely to the source of a report that found that over 80 percent of Americans addicted to opioids were not getting treatment with medications that could help. The report, from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, was funded by the federal government. It was not a federal government report.

Next to Buttigieg, Beto is a joke

Texto completo: One of them is a Rhodes scholar and former Navy lieutenant who served in Afghanistan, graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, speaks eight languages, and references Faulkner offhand with as much ease as he does Eminem.

The other is an unemployed trust fund baby whose billionaire father-in-law bankrolled his onion-thin congressional career, culminating in a public mid-life crisis.

Yet somehow the media can't stop likening the likeable and experienced South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg to the aggressively mediocre Beto (read: Robert Francis) O'Rourke in the same breath.

Sure, on paper they're both longshot candidates for the presidency. But the former possesses actual charisma, qualifications, and momentum, whereas the latter's credentials are as lacquered as the glossy magazine covers the press insists on gifting him.The media's been blowing hot air into the Beto balloon for the entirety of the past year, first during his semi-serious bid to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and now during his cathartic release masquerading as a presidential campaign.

Beto, Vanity Fair says, has a "preternatural ease," an "aura," and a "gift." The magazine asks whether he's "the left's Obama-like answer to Trump in 2020." The New York Times dresses up his nonexistent policy chops as "appear[ing] less concerned with political ideology than the pursuit of authentic experiences and a sense of community." Jonathan Chait at New York magazine deems him "highly charismatic and inspirational," and his counterparts at the Cut dedicated an entire article to debating how "totally kind of hot" he is.

But as it turns out, the public doesn't care for the media's masturbatory Beto fantasies. No matter how hard the press tries to make Beto happen, the public simply isn't buying the notion that a privileged, pompous white guy who thinks that standing on tables and talking about rock makes him relatable is the next Obama.

Buttigieg hasn't had even a hint of the media-inflation that Beto has received, yet his actual progressive credentials, combined with his tempered Midwestern demeanor, has helped a mayor from the 299th largest city in the country catapult to third place in Iowa.

He doesn't rave about Trump, but he does propose actual policy. He's openly gay yet wants to make peace with Chick-fil-A. His political experience may be limited, but as a veteran, he already has a head start over half of his competitors. It's not hard to imagine him calmly owning President Trump on a debate stage with a smile and throwaway references to Rawls and Rousseau.

Plus, the evidence seems to hint that the Buttigieg boost is more than just hype.

As I've long maintained, Obama is a person, not a formula, and Democrats would be wise to avoid the trap of trying to outright replicate his coalition in a candidate. But if they were looking for a relative neophyte bolstered by authentic charisma, intellect, and policy chops as the dark horse of the race to bet on, it's hard to see why they wouldn't rally around Buttigieg instead of Beto.

'Indiana Jones of art' recovers $28 million Picasso stolen 20 years ago

Texto completo: An art investigator dubbed the "Indiana Jones of the art world" recovered a Pablo Picasso painting stolen 20 years ago, news reports say.
Dutch art sleuth Arthur Brand told The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse that he had been tracking the rare 1938 "Buste de Femme" for years and recently turned it over to an insurance company after it arrived at his door.
The work – a portrait of Dora Maar, who was depicted in multiple Picasso paintings – is worth roughly $28 million, Brand estimates. Maar, an artist herself, photographed the progression of Picasso's masterpiece "Guernica" in 1937.
The painting was originally stolen in 1999 from a wealthy Saudi’s yacht in France, but earlier this month, Brand got word that it was in the Netherlands.
"They told me, ‘It’s in the hands of a businessman who got it as payment, and he doesn’t know what to do with it,’" Brand told the New York Times. "I talked to the two guys and we made a plan to get it out of his hands. "
'Priceless': Stolen Van Gogh paintings found 14 years later
Brand told the AFP that the art had likely changed hands at least 10 times since it was stolen and may have been used in drug and arms deals.
It ultimately landed in Brand's possession after the businessman's contacts dropped it off at his door.
“You know it’s a Picasso because there is some magic coming off it,” he told the AP. Brand also told the new agency he believes it's real because of how the back of the canvas looks.
"A forger never knows how the back looks,” Brand told the AP, but withholding what was there. "When I saw the back of the painting, I knew it was the real one. "
Brand hung the painting on his wall for a night ("The urge was too great; I couldn’t resist," he told the Times) before a Picasso expert and representative of an insurance company arrived the next day to inspect it.
Who stole the $100M masterpiece? Clues emerge in year since recovery of Willem de Kooning painting
Dick Ellis, a retired Scotland Yard investigator who founded its art and antiquities division and was representing the insurance company, says he believes the work is legitimate.
"There is no doubt that this is the stolen Picasso," Ellis told the AFP.
It's not clear what's next for the artwork or where it will go. Dutch police have not made any arrests, the AP reported.
Brand, who has already recovered bronze horses sculpted for Adolf Hitler and a 1,600-year-old mosaic in his career, can add another find to his list. He told the Times he's not looking for a reward, either.
"My reward was to have a Picasso on my wall for one night," he said. "I can tell you, it was great. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A Republican member of Congress quoted Adolf Hitler on the House floor in an attempt to blast Democrats over the results of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible conspiracy with the Trump presidential campaign.
Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks read from Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in an attempt to bash Democrats and the media, alleging they had pushed a "big lie" to smear Trump during the investigation.
"A big lie is a political propaganda technique made famous by Germany's national socialist German Worker's Party," Brooks said Monday. "For more than two years, socialist Democrats and their fake news media allies, CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, Washington Post and countless others, have perpetrated the biggest political lie, con, scam and fraud in American history.

Brooks railed against Democrats, citing from a four-page letter Attorney General William Barr sent to members of Congress on Sunday. The letter summarized the conclusions of Mueller's lengthy investigation and explained that Mueller did not find conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign. Mueller could not determine whether President Donald Trump attempted to obstruct justice by impeding the investigation, according to the letter.

After reviewing the evidence, Barr determined no criminal charges would be filed against the president.
Brooks railed against Democrats for pushing the Russian conspiracy for years and the media for helping give them a voice.
He called for Democrats and the media to apologize for the "fraud and scam committed" but said he recognized that some would be more likely to "double down and propagate even more big lies because doubling down is essential to big lie theory. "
"In that vein, I quote from another socialist who mastered big lie propaganda to a maximum and deadly effect," Brooks said before starting to read Hitler's words on the House floor.
He started, "In the big lie, there is always a certain force of credibility because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus, in the primitive simplicity of their minds, they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie.

"Who is this big lie master? That quote was in 1925 by a member of Germany's National Socialist German Workers Party," he said. "That's right. Germany's Socialist Party, more commonly known as the Nazis. The author was socialist Adolf Hitler in his book, 'Mein Kampf. '"
Brooks' emphasis on socialism in Germany appeared to be an attempt to link socialism with the Democratic Party – even though Nazis were not, in fact, socialists. They, along with Hitler, were fascists, essentially the opposite of socialists. Hitler was the leader of the Nazi Party that initiated World War II and was central in the death of millions during the Holocaust.
While on the House floor, Brooks also called on Americans to reject "America's socialists and their fake news media allies" or "succumb to the danger that lurks and horrific damage that results. "

Texto completo: ROME -- The founder and the entire editorial board have quit a Vatican women's magazine that has drawn international attention for exposing the abuse of nuns, citing a "climate of distrust and progressive delegitimization" of their work inside the Vatican's communications office.
In a letter of resignation to Pope Francis, Lucetta Scaraffia, the founder and editor of Women Church World, wrote that the editorial board members, all women, felt in the last few months, that a hierarchy dominated by men was marginalizing them and did not value their work.
"It seems to us that a vital initiative is being reduced to silence, to return to the antiquated and arid method of the top-down selection, under direct male control, of women who are perceived as being reliable," Ms. Scaraffia wrote in the letter, dated March 21, which was provided to The New York Times. Instead of promoting fruitful discussion, the Vatican preferred to return to a "clerical self-referential" mode, she wrote.
The monthly magazine, published by the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, has focused on women's issues and on the role of women inside the Roman Catholic Church. Recently it had become a forum for revealing and discussing hardships faced by some nuns around the world, including the exploitation of their labor and sexual abuse by priests.
The resignations at the magazine, which was created seven years ago under Pope Benedict XVI, were first reported by The Associated Press. Ms. Scaraffia said that until recently, it had editorial independence and papal support, first from Benedict and then from Francis.
That changed when Andrea Monda became the new director of L'Osservatore Romano in December, Ms. Scaraffia said in an interview on Tuesday. She said that Mr. Monda began participating in the magazine's editorial meetings along with journalists from his newspaper. The staff of the magazine felt controlled, she said.
"No one had ever imposed on us people from the outside," she said.
In a statement issued by the Vatican press office, Mr. Monda denied that he had tried to meddle with the magazine, which he said enjoyed "the same total autonomy and the same freedom that have characterized the monthly insert since it was born."
He said he had limited his involvement to suggesting possible themes and contributors to Ms. Scaraffia.
After the board of the magazine threatened to resign in January, "they pretended to accept our autonomy," she said. But the board felt its work was being undermined when L'Osservatore Romano began publishing its own articles about women's issues, with a different editorial slant.
"They were trying to delegitimize us in every way they could, they wanted to sabotage the magazine, so we decided to leave, before they took us out," she said.
The resignation letter was to be announced in the next edition of the magazine, which is scheduled to be published next Monday. Ms. Scaraffia said she did not know whether there would be an issue at all.
Mr. Monda said the magazine would continue to be published.
The Vatican communications office has been undergoing an overhaul. The Holy See's chief spokesman and his deputy resigned in December.
"They wanted us out because we were autonomous," Ms. Scaraffia said. "They want only people controlled by them."

Expected Nominee for Fed Seat Says He's Not 'a Sycophant for Trump'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Stephen Moore said he would not be a "sycophant" for President Trump if nominated and confirmed for a seat on the Federal Reserve. And he is sorry he called for the Fed chairman to step down after the central bank raised interest rates.
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Moore, who is expected to be nominated by Mr. Trump for an open seat at the Fed, said he hoped he would get the chance to win over its chairman, Jerome H. Powell, as well as the economists who have questioned his imminent nomination.
Mr. Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, is a relatively unconventional choice for the job. He has made his name largely by championing tax cuts, not monetary policy, and he is pushing an unorthodox theory on how the central bank should set interest rates.
His nomination has won early praise from Republican senators. But it has drawn fire from Democrats, who call Mr. Moore an ideologue and beholden to Mr. Trump. Conservative economists, like Harvard's N. Gregory Mankiw, a chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, question his fitness for the job. Others criticize his belief that the Fed should use an index of commodity price changes -- like fluctuations in oil, food and metals prices -- to drive its decisions about whether to raise or cut interest rates.
The president's plan to nominate Mr. Moore has brought new attention to his incorrect predictions that the Fed's efforts to stoke economic growth after the 2008 financial crisis would prompt rapid inflation -- and to his suggestion in December that Mr. Powell should resign after an interest-rate increase stirred turmoil in financial markets.
Mr. Moore said Tuesday that he regretted his remarks about Mr. Powell, but defended his view that the Fed was wrong to raise interest rates in September and December. He said the Fed should immediately reverse course and cut rates by half a percentage point.
"I was really angry" about the December increase, Mr. Moore said. "I was furious -- and Trump was furious, too. I just thought that the December rate increase was inexplicable. Commodity prices were already falling dramatically."
"I said these things that I do regret saying, because I think Powell's doing the best job that he can," Mr. Moore said. "Do I regret the rhetoric that I used? Yes. Was I right? Yes."
Asked about how he would govern at the Fed, Mr. Moore said he was "not a dove" -- a reference to Fed officials who favor more accommodative monetary policy. And he promised he would demonstrate independence from Mr. Trump, whose agenda Mr. Moore has helped shape and frequently praised. Mr. Moore said he had dissented from Mr. Trump on issues including the imposition of tariffs and the Justice Department's attempts to block corporate mergers on antitrust grounds.
"Do the president and I think a lot alike on a lot of things? Absolutely. That's one of the reasons he picked me to be an economic adviser and be on the Fed, because we share a lot of the same economic philosophy," Mr. Moore said. But "I don't think anybody can reasonably say I am a sycophant for Trump, because I'm not."
The Fed has abruptly halted what had been a steady campaign of interest rate increases, going back to 2017. At its most recent meeting, officials indicated they expected not to raise rates this year, and they revised down their estimates of economic growth for 2019 amid signs of global weakness. Mr. Powell told reporters that, depending on how economic data played out, the Fed's next move could just as easily be a rate cut as a rate increase.
Mr. Moore has been pushing for the Fed to go further and adopt a rule in which it adjusts interest rates in response to price swings in a wide array of commodities, like oil, metals and agricultural products. In early March, he emailed a New York Times reporter, urging an article on the idea that the Fed had driven commodity prices down with its rate increases, acting as a "wet blanket" on economic growth. He said Mr. Trump agreed with his assessment that the Fed was keeping the economy from growing as fast as 4 percent per year.
A week later, Mr. Moore laid out the commodity targeting plan on the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal, his former employer. When commodity prices rise, the Fed would raise interest rates to prevent inflation, Mr. Moore and his co-author, Louis Woodhill argued, and it would reduce rates when commodity prices fall. Mr. Trump saw the piece, and he offered Mr. Moore the Fed post, which Mr. Moore said he had never previously considered.
"I never really thought about this, but, you know, I thought that -- the more I thought about it, the more I thought this is economic policy right on the front line," Mr. Moore said. "That's what I do. I thought this would be an amazing experience, and hopefully I could work with Powell to get him shifted over to a more pro-growth" policy.
"I would use commodity prices as a guide," Mr. Moore added. "I wouldn't be doctrinaire about it."
Few economists subscribe to that theory, which is in many ways the opposite of what the Fed does today, by focusing on a measure of "core" inflation that strips out energy and food prices. They warn that targeting commodity prices could trigger interest rate increases at inopportune times. For example, commodity prices were soaring in the middle of 2008 when the recession was already underway. If the Fed had responded according to Mr. Moore's prescription and raised rates, that crisis would almost surely have been worse.
The same could be said for 2010 and 2011, when growth was lackluster and unemployment near double digits but commodity prices had rebounded from crisis-era lows. The Fed nurtured the recovery with near-zero interest rates and large-scale purchases of government-backed securities. But the commodity-focused approach would have implied higher rates and could well have stopped the expansion in its tracks.
Several economists have criticized Mr. Moore for pushing the theory. Critics also note that, like Mr. Trump, Mr. Moore favored higher interest rates and less accommodative monetary policy when President Barack Obama was in office and changed course when Mr. Trump was elected.
In the interview, Mr. Moore acknowledged that his inflation predictions were incorrect during the Obama years, but he said his critics misunderstood him.
"People are saying I'm a dove, because I want to reverse the last interest rate hike," Mr. Moore said. "The irony is, I'm not a dove. All I want is a stable price. That's all I want the Fed to do because that's what maximizes economic growth and higher wages."

Texto completo: Daniel Radcliffe sets out to save humankind in the final episode of "Miracle Workers." And the first season of the "Temptation Island" reboot comes to a close.
What's on TV
MIRACLE WORKERS 10:30 p.m. on TBS. Consider this limited comedy series a truncated, less thought out version of "The Good Place." The show is set in some bureaucratic iteration of the afterlife where very imperfect beings run things, and sparks fly between two unassuming humans. Steve Buscemi stars as a fed-up God who announces he's going to blow up the earth and end its troubles for good. Over seven episodes, two angels, Craig (Daniel Radcliffe) and Eliza (Geraldine Viswanathan), try to stop him by answering the prayers of two 20-somethings looking for love. (While in "The Good Place," the universe is constantly working against Eleanor and Chidi's inevitable romance, the humans in "Miracle Workers" are spoiled with divine intervention.) The show comes to a close with "1 Hour," in which a desperate Craig gives his all to save humankind.
TEMPTATION ISLAND 10 p.m. on USA. This dating show from the early 2000s found a second life in the reboot mania that is today's television landscape. The first season of the revival, set in Maui, Hawaii, ends with a reunion where four couples decide on the next steps of their relationships. The series has been renewed for a second season, and Mark L. Wahlberg, who created the original, will stay on as host.
What's Streaming
NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST (2008) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. At 30, Michael Cera may have outgrown some of the roles that defined him, such as the awkward slacker in "Superbad" or the sweet boyfriend in "Juno." As the sulking musician in "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," he plays a New Jersey high school student recently dumped by his girlfriend (Alex Dziena). Still hurting from the breakup, he reluctantly heads to Manhattan to play a show and meets Norah (Kat Dennings), who instantly catches his eye. They spend the night searching for their favorite indie band's concert, but their friends and former lovers keep getting in the way. The movie, A. O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review, is "like Martin Scorsese's 'After Hours' filtered through the high school sensibility of John Hughes, or Richard Linklater's 'Before Sunrise' remade for Nickelodeon." Cera also appears this month alongside Julianne Moore in "Gloria Bell" and reprises his role as George-Michael Bluth in new episodes of "Arrested Development."
NATE BARGATZE: THE TENNESSEE KID (2019) Stream on Netflix. The Nashville-based comedian Nate Bargatze made his Netflix debut in the first season of "The Standups," a set of six half-hour specials by emerging comics. Now he's flying solo. (Before reaching Netflix fame, Bargatze made several appearances on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" and performed with Fallon on the late-night host's "Clean Cut Comedy Tour.") Here, he recalls being mistaken for an elderly woman and the time he disappointed his father, who is a magician, during a trick.

Texto completo: They descended from unmarked white school buses, many of them disoriented from hourslong journeys across the country, into a barrage of screams.
"Pick your heads up!" yelled a drill instructor. "Scream, 'Aye, Ma'am!' No! Scream louder than that!"
The women had come from places like Louisville, Ky., and Columbus, Ohio, in street clothes and sneakers, which they would soon shed for military fatigues. For the next 11 weeks, they would speak only in the third person, calling themselves "this recruit" instead of "I" to absolve all individuality.
They are recruits to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, S.C. -- the only place in the country where women become enlisted Marines.
[ Read more: Separate is not equal in the Marine Corps ]
Women have been training to become Marines for decades, but only since 2016 have they been able to serve in combat roles alongside men -- a requirement, when it was announced by the Department of Defense, that the Marine Corps petitioned. (They cited a 2015 study they had conducted, in which they determined that female Marines could not perform physically demanding tasks at the same level as their male counterparts; the Pentagon rejected that request.)
Today, women make up 8 percent of the United States Marine force, the lowest percentage of any military branch. Their challenges have been well-documented.
[Read more: 40 Stories from Women About Life in the Military]
I followed a handful of these women as they went through basic training -- rappelling from a tower, learning rope climbing, martial arts, and completing courses in military history and Marine Corps values (honor, courage, and commitment).
The following are snapshots from their journey.
Their stay began with a phone call home -- in which the women were ordered to yell the following script into the phone to their family or next of kin:
1. This is recruit (Last name)
2. I have arrived safely at Parris Island
3. Please do not send any food or bulky items to me in the mail
4. I will contact you in seven to nine days by letter with my new address
5. Thank you for your support, goodbye for now
The women would not speak to their families again until the day before graduation. During their time on Parris Island, recruits are permitted one phone call in case of an emergency or an exceptional circumstance. They have no email access.
In 2018, the United States Marine Corps celebrated its centennial of women being able to serve. But it wasn't until 1949 that the Marines set up a battalion specifically tasked with training women, according to Lt. Col. Misty J. Posey, who commands the female recruits at Parris Island.
Today, platoons at Parris Island remain segregated by gender, though men and women partake in some activities together, such as classroom courses. The exception to this rule is the India Company, a recently integrated battalion. The Marine Corps has said the integration was for the purpose of "training efficiency" during a class cycle with fewer female recruits.
All recruits at Parris Island are required to take an initial physical fitness test -- and those who don't meet the requirements are placed into a special training program.
The requirements are:
Men:

At any given time on Parris Island there are approximately 750 to 1,000 women in various stages of recruit training, compared to roughly 2,850 men, according to the Marine Corps.
"We made a conscious decision to try and increase that number of young women, because in many instances it's not what they'd naturally think about doing," said Brig. Gen. James F. Glynn.
The Marine Corps remains the only military service that still separates men and women during basic training.
Most of the women at Parris Island have women as their drill instructors. They live on a female floor in the barracks. Their training, said Colonel Posey, is identical to the men's -- though they are graded differently on the physical fitness test.
"When I say identical, males get haircuts that we don't get ... Females get a pregnancy test when they get here. That's it," Colonel Posey said. " ... We hike the same miles with the same weight in our pack, we have one physical training playbook, our chow halls serve the same food."
A typical day at Parris Island consists of a 4 a.m. wake-up, physical fitness, academic classes and group meals. Teamwork is central to everything the recruits do.
All of this is in preparation for "the Crucible" -- a 54-hour marathon of physical and emotional endurance that will test what they have learned.
"The Crucible is actually seeing everything that has been taught to them come to life," said Staff Sgt. Jasmine Rodgers, a 26-year-old drill instructor from Philadelphia. "It shows the best and the worst from them, and by the end of it, they are better for it."
Their challenges during the Crucible include long hikes during the day and night, climbing ropes, deciphering how to get the very last person of a group over a plywood wall, and crawling through thick mud while pushing heavy boxes of ammunition under barbed wire as battle soundtracks are blasted into the course to simulate moving while under fire.
One of the most grueling exercises is called "Noonan's evacuation," a mock casualty rescue based on a real battle and evacuation that took place in Vietnam. During that exercise, the recruits had to tend to and evacuate their wounded and dead while receiving simulated rounds and sniper fire.
The recruits average four hours of sleep per night during the Crucible. They sleep in wooden huts.
"It's a lot of teamwork, especially working with so many other females," said Jasmine Dickson, 26, a recruit from Atlanta, who has a bachelor's degree in opera music and also sings R&B. "Everybody has different personalities coming from different places, and working together."
Eventually, on almost no sleep and with hungry stomachs, sore and exhausted limbs and blistered feet, the women receive their Eagle, Globe and Anchor insignia.
They are told they can begin using the word "I" again, as they are no longer recruits: They have officially become Marines.

Texto completo: Thirty-two years ago, Jamie Lantgen breathed in her first oxygen along Franklin Avenue. She was born at what is today Advocate BroMenn Medical Center.
In 2014, her fiancees mother fell gravely ill. She had a last wish to see her son, Nick Klem, and Jamie marry. So, the couple scuttled big wedding plans, cobbled together a quick ceremony and entered matrimonial bliss in a BroMenn conference room near Nick's mom's room.
That brings us to the present day.
Last month, Jamie gave birth to a boy, Dominic, at  you guessed it  Advocate BroMenn.
Has anyone else ever been born, gotten married and had their first child at (Advocate) BroMenn? asks Jamies sister, Katie Saxen.
We checked and it appears not  until now.
In perhaps only Jamie's case "Advocate" also might be used as a verb ... as in "Advocate BroMenn ... For Everything."
What's next? ...
They've gone nuts!
There are ways to know youve fully made it and realizing it again the other day was a B-N company that since 1937 has quietly risen from a one-room downtown confectionery to a full-fledged global icon.
Yes, Beer Nuts has made the New York Times Crossword puzzle.
On Four Down, with the single clue bar snack, crossword aficionados worldwide stared down the eight-letter space, then scrawled out: B-E-E-R-N-U-T-S.
We appreciate any mention we can get  says Andy Shirk, latest president of the family-owned-and-operated company.
Humorously opined one Beer Nuts lover, in a post on the company's Facebook page after its NYT crossword notoriety became world known: Dont let that fame go straight to your nuts!
As its legacy continues
For 30 years, at 119 E. Beaufort in downtown/uptown Normal, Brian Simpson was that bearded, renaissance man who, in an age of chain book stores, operated his own little indie bookstore that had high tin ceilings, stacks of vintage reads, a resident cat to greet customers, became a favorite reading spot for world-acclaimed new-age novelist David Foster Wallace and on certain days could smell like your great-grandmothers parlor thanks to all the aging literature.
It was Babbitt's Books, and it closed late last year.
But opening this month in the same storefront is perhaps the most appropriate venue yet to supplant Babbitt's  Anderson's Classic Barber Shop. It still has those ceilings, now refurbished, looks like a 1960s tonsorial where boys out of the Baby Boom used to sit on a Saturday mornings, reading Sports Afield or a comic book, waiting a turn at a trim, a butch or a crew. Even saved on a ledge is the original Babbitt's Books sign.
And its very first customer?
"Totally by circumstance, I was," says Brian Simpson. "He (23-year-old barber Noah Anderson) had a soft opening and I happened to walk by and went on in then for a haircut. I handed him his first $20 in his new business."
Actually educated in art and running these days an artists studio in downtown Bloomington, is Simpson, 62, who muses, the market for art is worse than the market for books, so I'm not making any money at this either.
But he adds of barber Noah Anderson, in his old place: He's a nice young guy just starting a business. That inhabits a special place in my heart.
One grand, l-o-n-g life!
Mark Fellheimer is the new chief judge of the areas 11th Judicial District based in Bloomington.
He's 46 years old.
Of Pontiac, he's been a judge since 2008 and if genetics are a key to longevity, Fellheimer might be a good bet to be on the bench for while, too.
As an example, his grandfather passed late last year.
He was 107.
Shirley Temple paid attention to ... Bloomington!
Bloomington-Normal has always been progressive yet conservative, respected yet also a not-afraid-to-express-an-opinion town.
Which brings us to this:
Corey Case of Clinton was reading one of famed child-actress Shirley Temples last works  her autobiographical book entitled, Child Star.
Thats when he came to page 212 of an occurrence way back in 1927:
Reads a paragraph written by Temple, Typical of local volunteer watchdogs, the Bloomington, Illinois, Better Movies Committee declared my pictures no longer fit for children because there are too many adults in them.'"
As Corey puts it, I guess there probably wasn't much to do with no TV back in 1927 and it seems like such an odd committee for a town to have. But it's wild Shirley Temple even got wind of their opinion in the first place.
B-N's a temple.

Booker opts for the broader view

Texto completo: How do you answer hatred? How should you respond when your political opponents assault you with insult, stereotype and contempt? That's the moral question we all have to answer during this election campaign.
Hatred has become the defining emotion of our political life. As my colleague Thomas B. Edsall reported recently, according to a recent paper, 42 percent of the people in each party regard their opposition as "downright evil." Nearly 20 percent of both Democrats and Republicans believe that their political adversaries "lack the traits to be considered fully human - they behave like animals." Roughly 20 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans say that the world would be better off if large numbers of the other party died.
Some people believe that fire can be fought only with fire. We've got to face the world as it is. If the other side is going after you with full viciousness, you've got to find a leader who can do the same to them. This is a knife fight. We need a brawler.
This is the argument white evangelicals made in deciding to back Donald Trump. We're under siege. He'll fight for us.
And this is the argument many of the Democratic campaigns are already making. Republicans are irredeemable. Racism is ubiquitous. Capitalist greed is ubiquitous. We need someone who can match Trump blow for blow - the indignation of Bernie Sanders; the confrontational, prosecutorial style of Kamala Harris.
Other people are in the as-they-go-low-we-go-high camp. People in this group argue that if you meet fire with fire all you will do is unleash an inferno that will destroy everything you care about. If you descend to hatred you'll turn yourself into a mirror image of what you detest.
People in this camp believe that we can change our laws only after we've changed our politics. Moreover, they believe that after Trump, Americans yearn for a moral cleansing. You succeed politically when you appeal to voters' basic decency.
So far, Cory Booker is the candidate who has placed the biggest bet on this latter argument. He agrees with many of his rivals on policy, but he argues that how you behave is just as important as what you propose.
Three emotions run through Booker's campaign. The first is an unabashed patriotism, and with it the conviction that despite our differences, Americans are still connected by sacred bonds.
"Patriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women," he told an Iowa audience in February. Republican or Democrat - we are brothers and sisters under the skin.
The second is the dogged but radical hopefulness that he inherited from the black church. Booker uses religious categories more naturally than any other candidate: grace, faith, sacrificial love, the command to love your neighbor as yourself, the awareness that love has a redemptive power to cast out fear. The gospels are pretty clear that the correct response to hate is love.
"Love means that I see you, I see your worth, I see your dignity," Booker said at that rally last month. "Your destiny is my destiny."
The third emotion is simple gratitude. Booker had to overcome challenges in life, and he has seen many more, but his family story is a success story. The church raised money for his grandmother to go to school. His parents worked at IBM. He was elected class president in high school before going off to Stanford and Yale Law.
Others see America's institutions as systems of oppression, but Booker calls the founders "imperfect geniuses." America needs reform, but our inheritance is a precious one.
The knife fight view is correct if you believe that war is our permanent state - if you believe that our evolutionary roots sentence us to inevitable tribal conflict and the only choice is conquer or be conquered.
But I'd say that Booker has a fuller and more realistic view of our situation. Fanaticism is not the normal human state. Fanaticism is a disease that grows out of existential anxiety. It grows when people fear that they are being delegitimized. It grows when people are isolated and insulated from one another. It grows when you have leaders, like our president, who reduce everything to us/them stereotypes and so poison the public mind.
The disease is in our context and not in our souls. And that context can be changed with better leadership.
I write this to you from Nebraska City, Neb., just over the Iowa line. I just had lunch with 15 locals, many probably Trump supporters and some probably not. But it didn't come up. The idea that any of these good people are "downright evil" because of some political affiliation is ridiculous and a sign of how deranged our discourse has become.
When you're in the midst of everyday life, the idea that you can deal with one group or another only through condemnation and attack is absurd. You don't build a better society by turning yourself into a rotten human being.

Snowplow parents

Texto completo: Almost everyone is familiar with the term "helicopter parenting." When parents take an overprotective and excessive interest in their children and what they do, the moniker fits.

But now there's a new term entering the lexicon. It's called "snowplow parenting." A recent New York Times article summed it up as, "machines chugging ahead, clearing any obstacles in their child’s path to success, so they don’t have to encounter failure, frustration or lost opportunities."

It fits the recent college bribery scandal and dovetails with parents who do whatever they can to get their offspring into top nursery schools before moving heaven and earth to get them into the best private schools.

It isn't just wealthy parents who do this. Middle-class families spend absurd amounts of money to make sure their sons and daughters succeed at whatever they attempt. That means tutors, personal coaches, extra training, expensive equipment, yelling at coaches, umpires, and referees — whatever it takes to head off failure.

One of the more astonishing aspects of this phenomenon comes from Julie Lythcott-Haims, a former dean of freshman at Stanford University and author of the book How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success . She witnessed students relying on their parents to set up play dates with people in their dorm.

Play dates for adults who attend Stanford. It's a prestigious school that's produced billionaire tech giants and Supreme Court justices, and yet our society is now at a place where some parents have to help their adult children make friends.

At some point, parents have to let the next generation experience real life, and that includes disappointment, pain, frustration, and many challenges. People face them every day.

As a parent, it's easy to understand the desire to protect children; parents find it hard not to regard their children as children. But society has raised a generation that reaches for the phone to call mom and dad instead of figuring things out independently.

It's time for parents to stop snowplowing. Give the kids a shovel and tell them to get on with it. They'll thank their progenitors in, and for, years ahead.

If you had the money, would you pay off a college admissions officer? 1 in 4 parents say they would, a new poll finds

Texto completo: If you had the money, would you bribe a college official to get your child admitted?
Fifteen percent of all American adults would answer yes, according to a new poll. And that number rises to 25 percent for adults who actually have children ages 18 and under.
It’s a hypothetical question, but certainly a revealing ethical one. There’s been a flood of outrage over the recent college admissions scandal, in which federal prosecutors charged parents with everything from paying off testing proctors to lying about their child’s athletic abilities to win a spot at elite schools. But a new poll from YouGov, a global public opinion and data company, shows that a large percentage of the U.S. population certainly doesn’t rule out the possibility of cheating and bribery when it comes to college admissions.
“It speaks to the pressure of parenting a bit,” said Larry Shannon-Missal, head of data services in the U.S. for YouGov. “Parents are aware of how increasingly competitive it is out there. They’re all reading the same articles we are about kids coming out of college and moving back in with their parents because it’s hard to find jobs that will pay enough to get a living wage.”
Even more parents — 34 percent — said they would be willing to pay someone to take an entrance exam on behalf of their child to get him or her into a good college. Of the general public, 20 percent said they would do so.
Shannon-Missal said these findings might also speak to a level of cynicism among the general population: that people see the wealthy using their resources to take advantage of the higher education system and would therefore be more likely to think that they themselves should also be able to do so, if they had the resources.
About two-thirds of adults polled said they were not surprised at the cheating scandal, and a similar number said the system is rigged in favor of wealthy students. In fact, 44 percent of adults said that, if given the money, most parents would pay to get their kids ahead.
Steering students toward specific extracurricular and academic tracks designed to catch the eye of admissions officers is not uncommon and is available at sky-high prices. A recent New York Times profile of college consultants reported that costs for these services can reach into the millions of dollars. And rigorous, expensive test prep for entrance exams remains at the center of debates around equity and inclusion.
It’s worth noting that the majority of respondents said they would not cheat: About three-quarters said they would probably or definitely not pay off a high school or college official. But if they had the money, 72 percent said they would likely pay for tutoring or test prep to get their child into college.
While the two most high-profile participants accused in the scheme — celebrities Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman — are women, the survey found that more men than women were willing to cheat in the college admissions race. When it came to paying someone to take a college entrance exam for their child, 23 percent of men said they probably or definitely would, compared with 17 percent of women. And 19 percent of men said they would probably or definitely pay a college official to secure their child a spot, versus 12 percent of women.
Some survey questions asked whether the respondent would hypothetically cheat if given the resources, but when other questions inquired as to whether they have actually cheated to get themselves or their children ahead, very few said they had. Only 2 percent said they’ve paid someone to gain an advantage for their child. Only 10 percent admitted to having personally cheated on a pop quiz, and 5 percent said they’ve cheated on a final exam.
“There are a lot of things that people could see, under the right circumstances, being willing to go to an extreme (for), but that doesn’t mean that most people have found that set of circumstances that has driven them to do so,” Shannon-Missal said.
The survey is weighted and representative of U.S. adults. It was conducted online from March 13 and 14 and included 1,259 respondents. The margin of error was 2.76 percentage points.

The Associated Press
Boeing will make standard on its troubled new airliner a safety feature that might have helped the crew of a jet that crashed shortly after takeoff last year in Indonesia, killing everyone on board.
The equipment, which had been offered as an option, alerts pilots of faulty information from key sensors. It now will be included on every 737 Max as part of changes that Boeing is rushing to complete on the jets by early next week, according to a person familiar with the changes.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because Boeing and federal regulators still are discussing details of the upgrade to the Max fleet, which was grounded worldwide after a second deadly crash this month in Ethiopia.
The cause of the accidents has not been determined, but investigators probing the crash of a Lion Air Max jet have focused on an automated system designed to use information from two sensors to help prevent a dangerous aerodynamic stall.
The sensors measure whether the plane is pointed up, down or level in relation to the direction of onrushing air. Software on the Max can push the plane's nose down if data from one of the sensors indicates the plane is tilted up so sharply that it could stall and fall from the sky.
In the Lion Air case, the sensors malfunctioned and gave wildly conflicting information, and the plane crashed minutes after takeoff. A preliminary report described a grim fight by the pilots to control the plane as it pitched downward more than two dozen times.
It is not known whether the same flight-control system played a role in the March 10 crash of the Ethiopian Airlines jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, but regulators say both planes had similar erratic flight paths, an important part of their decision to ground the roughly 370 Max planes around the world.
The CEO of Ethiopian Airlines said Thursday that the carrier's pilots went through all the extra training required by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to fly the 737 Max 8 jet that crashed, killing 157 people from 35 countries.
Tewolde Gebremariam said the training was meant to help crews shift from an older model of the 737 to the Max 8, which entered airline service in 2017. In a statement, he said pilots also were made aware of an emergency directive issued by the FAA after the Lion Air crash, which killed 189 people.
The New York Times reported that the pilots of the Ethiopian plane never trained in a simulator for the plane. Gebremariam said that the 737 Max simulator is not designed to imitate problems in the new jet's flight-control software. He declined to say whether the pilots had trained on the simulator.
The Ethiopian jetliner was on a regularly scheduled flight from Ethiopia to neighboring Kenya.
The families of Kenyan victims are asking their government for legal assistance in pursuing compensation.
In an emotional gathering Thursday in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, the victims' relatives asked for lawyers to help them pursue their case.
"If we are left alone, clearly we can't move," said Merciline Ndegwa, one of the relatives seeking compensation. "It's been a difficult time reaching out to the airline and even Ethiopia's government. So, as we move forward, it is our wish to have help from the government in that front."
Another, Erick Mwangi, spoke of what could be an "expensive and tedious" legal battle.
Macharia Kamau, principal secretary of Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, advised the families to "come together as a group" as the country's attorney general takes up the matter.
The government will assist in obtaining death certificates for the victims, he said.
Officials have delivered bags of scorched earth from the crash site to family members of the victims because of the problems identifying the remains.
Thirty-two Kenyans were among the 157 victims of the plane crash. No nation lost more people.

Texto completo: The festival-like Annapolis Oyster Roast and Sock Burning coming to the Annapolis Maritime Museum on Saturday is a far cry from the early history of the odd-duck nod to spring.
Coming out of the brutal winter of 1977, Bob Turner decided he'd had enough.
Turner was a South Carolina transplant to chillier Chesapeake country that year and looking back said the impetus for torching his winter socks was three-pronged.
"We were coming out of one of the worst winters. It was the equinox, it was a gorgeous sunny day," he said in a phone interview from his current roost in Pawleys Island, S.C. "And I was really tired of peeling off my socks to pick aluminum shavings out of them."
He was building aluminum masts and spars in a shop in Eastport. The process created shavings that would "for some reason get in your shoes and gather in the toes of your socks," he said.
So at the end of the day he grabbed an old paint rolling pan out of a pile, added some flammable naphtha and lit up his socks. There was, of course, beer involved. And a gaggle of his employees, who also peeled off their socks to add to the pyre. And had a beer - Budweiser longnecks, to be precise.
Garry Williams, proprietor of Osprey Marine Composites in Deale, was Turner's service manager and remembers the first few sock torchings.
"Bob was always a little eccentric. All of us came down," he said. "We had a small shop and most of the guys would hang around and have a beer or two at the end of the day."
And the mischievous nod to the equinox continued.
"Not only did I never have any idea it would catch on like it has, at the time I didn't think it would happen twice," Turner said.
But the next year they did it again. It continued for a few years as a small-scale excuse to have a beer, Turner noted, until about 1985, after he had become owner of the Annapolis Harbor Boat Yard, and he decided to spread the cheer.
"I went around to the marine businesses, sail lofts and boatyards and invited them to come on down, and we lit up the socks and had a few beers. I think we had about 40 people that day."
Within a few years the equinox tradition was picked up by the Eastport Yacht Club, whose clubhouse was built across the street from Turner's yard.
The club holds a sock burning to this day; members will singe their socks on the equinox on March 20.
The sock burning as a rite of the equinox continued locally then spread after the New York Times caught wind of it in 2004 and sent a writer down to Eastport. After the story ran, the stunt spread to ports far and wide.
The Oyster Roast and Sock Burning at the Annapolis Maritime Museum started in earnest in 2010 when they decided to make it an official thing after people had used its small beach to build a sock burning fire anyway.
It is held the closest Saturday to the equinox, if not on the day. Many of the hundreds who attend doff their winter socks and toss them into the fire, while others just enjoy the festivities - music by the Eastport Oyster Boys, food and oysters every which way, and yes, adult beverages.
Turner won't make it north for the party as he has not one, but three sock burning soirees to attend near home in Beaufort, N.C., Georgetown, S.C., and Myrtle Beach.
"I am running out of socks," he said.
The celebrations are all over. There's the Skidway Island Boat Club's event in Savannah, Ga.; five events around Lake Texoma on the Texas-Oklahoma border, and one in Ashtabula, Ohio.
Closer to home, there are events in Gloucester Point and Hampton, Va., and Havre de Grace.
"It has gotten out of hand," Turner said of the plethora of events. And though the occasion had grown beyond recognition - much like Eastport itself, from those sleepier days - he's OK with it.
"It was never intended to be a money maker, but in this case it is for a good cause," he said. This year's event will support he museum's work preserving the heritage of a local slice of the bay. "And if people get together and they laugh, it's all worth it."

Morally indefensible pricing schemes are leading to death; South Florida Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: "Your money or your life!" was a laugh line in a radio skit by the comedian Jack Benny, who pretended to be a skinflint. To the robber's demand, Benny replied, after a long pause, "I'm thinking. I'm thinking."
Today, your money or your life is a deadly serious dilemma that confronts Americans not so often at the point of a gun as at the pharmacy counter.
As many as one in every five Americans are trying to cope with Big Pharma's morally indefensible pricing schemes by leaving prescriptions unfilled, skipping doses or splitting pills. Such desperate economies, coupled with unwitting failure to take medications properly, are said to contribute to some 125,000 deaths every year and as much as $289 billion in additional health costs.
These staggering statistics are found in a Florida House of Representatives staff report on legislation (HB 19) that incorporates Gov. Ron DeSantis' proposal to let state agencies and private pharmacies import less expensive drugs from Canada and elsewhere.
The House Health Quality subcommittee approved it 12-2 last week, despite the usual obfuscations from Big Pharma. The bill has other House committees to clear, as well as a Senate that may be less receptive. If it doesn't get over the finish line, there will be no good excuse.
Drug pricing is a scandal that politicians of both parties are now recognizing. They are informed by stories like that of Alex Raeshawn Smith, a restaurant manager in Minnesota, who would have had to pay $1,300 a month, almost half his salary, for the insulin he needed when he aged out of his mother's health insurance coverage. He tried rationing what he could afford and was found dead of diabetic ketoacidosis, an empty insulin pen nearby. He was barely 26.
The cost of drugs is one of the reasons why Americans spend more on health care - with less to show for it - than almost anywhere else.
Though it's not the most outrageously priced lifesaving drug, insulin is one of the most common and has become Exhibit A in the national outcry. The doctors who discovered insulin sold their patent to the University of Toronto for only $1, intending it as a gift to humanity. Between 2009 and 2017, the cost of a single vial of Humalog rose from $92.70 to $274.70. It cost only $21 when marketed as the first short-acting insulin in 1996. Feeling political pressure, Eli Lilly & Co., the manufacturer, is now offering the same drug as a generic at half price. But that's still $45 more than it cost just 10 years ago.
When Nevada enacted a law to make insulin makers disclose more price increase details, the industry hired 70 lobbyists to fight the bill. In Tallahassee, at least 63 lobbyists are registered for the trade group and its constituent companies.
The DeSantis proposal, as filed by Rep. Tom Leek, R-Ormond Beach, would need approval from Washington to take effect. That's a long shot. The Department of Health and Human Services has the power to waive the federal law that essentially allows only manufacturers to import drugs, but it has turned down every state and local request.
Florida should add to the pressure. Sometimes it works. The pharmaceutical industry put a lid on price increases while President Bill Clinton's health reform was under debate in 1993.
Though the governor said he has President Donald Trump's support for Florida to import from Canada, the White House was noncommittal. DeSantis needs to keep the pressure on Trump, too.
The federal government historically has parroted Big Pharma's propaganda about foreign drugs not being safe. Such cases are infrequent. In fact, as the New York Times reported, 25 percent of drugs labeled American are made elsewhere in plants inspected by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as 80 percent of the active ingredients used in American factories.
The probability that Canadian imports would help Floridians cope raises a fundamental question. Why does the same drug cost less in Canada - and almost everywhere else - than in the United States? It's because other countries regulate the price of drugs through one mechanism or another. Some stipulate that the price of a drug decline as it ages. Here, it goes just the other way.
The medical industry is immune to the normal effects of competition. For one thing, a critical drug probably has only one, or at most three, suppliers. And when one of them raises a price, the others inevitably do. People who need the drug have no choice.
It's for similar reasons that the Legislature should not repeal Florida's certificate of need law. To allow uncontrolled expansion of hospitals and clinics would mean only more MRI machines and other expensive technology to be charged to the same number of patients, swiftly raising costs to the taxpayers as well.
The United States must face the necessity of drug price controls. Medicines on which people's lives and health depend need to be regulated no less than the prices of two other essential commodities, electricity and natural gas. Utilities account to the states for their investments and expenses, and are awarded a reasonable rate of return. Big Pharma, on the other hand, accounts to no one but its stockholders, and only in ways that don't tell whether prices fairly reflect costs.
Congress sought to help with the so-called Orphan Drugs program, which Ronald Reagan signed into law. It gives benefits - including extended patent protection for drugs that might not be otherwise profitable because fewer than 200,000 people would need them. Here's what has happened with that: Manufacturers have found so many ways to relabel them for other purposes that such best-selling drugs as Crestor, Abilify and Humira have enjoyed "orphan" protection.
In one breathtaking stunt, Allergan sold patent rights for its popular and pricey eyedrop Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. A federal judge accused it of trying to "rent the tribe's sovereign immunity" to avoid having patents repealed for having been granted in error. The case is on appeal to the Supreme Court.
No matter the reform, Big Pharma will fight it. Its allies at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have flooded the internet with propaganda against a U.S. government proposal called the International Pricing Index Model. In test markets not yet announced, Medicare would set price ceilings based loosely on those in Canada and some other nations, and allow drug vendors to compete within those limits. It would apply only to drugs dispensed to Medicare Part B patients in doctors' offices and hospital outpatient departments, which have faced price increases averaging 9.8 percent a year.
The Chamber claims that this "would import alarming policies from foreign governments with socialized health care systems ... block access to life-saving drugs for America's seniors, inhibit the research and development necessary to discover new treatments, and threaten our nation's free-market health care system, currently one of the best of the world."
That is, of course, Big Pharma's hysterical, nonsensical and shopworn mantra against anything that might eat into its profits. In this case, the fear is that what might work for Medicare would work for everyone. In that happy event, people would no longer have to die for lack of medicines they can't afford.
Caption: Gov. Ron DeSantis wants Floridians to be able to access less expensive drugs from Canada, but Washington is noncommittal. Florida should keep the pressure up. Drug prices need controls. This insulin drug cost $21 in 1996. Now it costs $274. The cost is killing people.

Texto completo: STREAMING 'Amy Schumer Growing' is now streaming on Netflix
By
Amy Schumer taped this show - her second for Netflix - at the landmark Chicago Theatre in December. Topics include her pregnancy, recent marriage, current affairs and sex. It's raw - very raw - so not for everyone.
A lot has happened to Schumer in between Netflix concerts, as their respective titles indicate. The 2017 "Leather Special" featured her in a patent leather black jumpsuit. With a little imagination - or matching mask - she could've easily morphed into Batwoman.
On "Growing," she's wearing a dark maternity swing dress - stylish, sure, but also functional, practical and (to use another word that's rarely, possibly never, associated with her) sensible. This also works as a prop when she hikes it up at one point to reveal that bump and a swollen belly button she has covered with a couple of bandages.
So add one more word: It's serviceable.
Amy does as Amy is, and what's she's done in the intervening years is get married and get pregnant. Per "Growing," both have been fulfilling and complicated. As intended, they also lend extra meaning to the title. She's grown since 2017, and that's complicated, too.
In fact, "Growing" feels a little like a show that's been engineered to manage fan expectations, or literally stage-manage them, as if to say, this is the new Amy Schumer who's a lot like the old Amy Schumer but new nonetheless. Approaching 40 (she's 37) and motherhood, some evolution is expected and probably necessary. But the transition can't be easy - especially for Schumer.
Consider all the baggage, which a recent New York Times profile did. She's heard (and how) from some disaffected fans who were confused - or felt betrayed - by an earlier iteration of her comic self that has since been deemed racially insensitive. She found herself on the wrong side of the #MeToo revolution when she supported one of her accused male writers from "Inside Amy Schumer." She's still trying to get people to believe that the "Lemonade" video from 2016 was a tribute to Beyoncé, and not a spoof, or appropriation. Even the Times piece had to run a correction that said it had "mischaracterized" the video in an earlier version of the story.
"Growing" ignores this part of her recent past, perhaps out of necessity. She's moved on, she seems to be insisting, even if the disaffected haven't.
There are almost two shows in one here, both yoked together at the halfway mark. The more familiar Schumer arrives in the second half: Raunchy, topical, political. A familial Schumer turns up in the first half.
Unsurprisingly, she's less sure-footed over this stretch. There are riffs about pregnancy and drinking, and pregnancy and sex, and pregnancy and Meghan Markle. Change the name of the princess and you could almost imagine Midge Maisel working some of the same material.
She talks about her well-documented struggle with hyperemesis - severe nausea ("I throw up an exorcist amount everyday") and about husband, Chris Fischer, who is a chef. ("I married a chef because I'm a genius!") She says he's on the autism spectrum - while carefully and accurately discarding the old Asperger's label - then explains that "once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me all the characteristics are all the reasons I fell madly in love with him."
True love finds Amy Schumer? You heard on "Growing" first.
The flamethrower arrives in the second half. She torches a couple of senators, a new Supreme Court justice, the NFL - the usual suspects - then gets right to heart of what she does best and always will.
"One in three women will be assaulted" in their lifetime, she says. "I know how scared we are as women all the time," then adds that when she takes the subway at night then gets off at her local station, "I will run home."
Picturing Schumer on the F train may require a creative leap, but the point is important and the follow-up joke is one of the better ones of the entire special.
It's also a fleeting reminder that Schumer - married or single, in Bat suit or maternity dress - was one of the most influential comics in the world not all that long ago. In moments like this, she almost still is.

Texto completo: My Sweet Art in Cape Coral is a bakery, of sorts, but it's also much more.
The first thing Yveline Mauclerc, who opened My Sweet Art in May 2017 with her husband, Eric Perez, likes to explain is why My Sweet Art is not a bakery.
"I do French pastries," she said, "but we don't do bread. In France, a pastry shop and a bakery is not really the same thing. In fact, when you learn pastries you don't learn to do bread."
At My Sweet Art, she makes classic French pastries such as eclairs, tarts and macarons each morning in small, hand-made batches. That means when she runs out, she runs out.
"I am alone," Mauclerc explained.
"I can't do like Publix or Wal-Mart. Sometimes people are surprised when I run out, but I tell them, 'Yes, sorry. It's a small business but everything is done right here.'"
For her pastries, she uses fresh fruits and no preservatives.
While Mauclerc makes the pastries, her husband is busy cooking. My Sweet Art serves lunch and dinner as well as brunch on Sundays. Its lunch menu includes classic French bistro favorites including quiches, salads, savory sandwiches made with French baguettes or croissants, tartines and even croque monsieurs — which are like grilled-cheese sandwiches but with ham, lots of butter and a few French-style twists.
At dinner, the menu features French favorites such as beef Bourguignon as well as American-inspired fusion entrees such as shrimp curry and the My Sweet Art burger. At both meals, the restaurant's French onion soup is a crowd-pleaser.
"People say, 'This is the best French onion soup we've ever had,'" Mauclerc said. Then, laughing, she added, "But we don't know."
For Sunday brunch, the restaurant continues to offer quiches, soup and other dishes from its regular lunch menu, plus tartiflette — a dish of potatoes, cheese and bacon — as well as sweet and savory crepes.
"I only do the crepes on Sundays," Mauclerc said. "To have something different."
Mauclerc and Perez have also begun offering cooking classes at the restaurant. They teach students how to make Mauclerc's famous macarons or some of Perez's classic savory fare. The classes are limited to just 10 students and fill up quickly.
The couple is originally from the city of Le Mans, in northwest France between Paris and Rennes. They'd never owned a restaurant before moving to Cape Coral. Mauclerc worked as a pharmaceutical rep and her husband was a life coach, but any time they cooked for friends or Mauclerc made pastries for her clients, people told them, "You have to open your own place."
"Yes, yes, yes, I will do that one day," Mauclerc would say to them. "But not in France."
When the couple decided to turn their dream of living in America into a reality, they knew they wanted to come to Florida.
Why else? The weather.
"At the beginning I wanted Miami," Mauclerc said, "because I love Miami downtown."
But when they looked at restaurants on the East Coast, they found that they were too expensive. And none of them had the space that Mauclerc needed for her pastries. So they made a tour of Florida, checking out Orlando, Naples and Tampa. Though they took a look at Cape Coral, at first they weren't convinced. But they found an available restaurant that was exactly what they wanted — only 24 seats, which felt like a manageable size, with a kitchen big enough to handle pastry making. When the couple explored Cape Coral more thoroughly, they discovered all it had to offer.
"We found everything — the canals, the boats, the small beach," Mauclerc said. "So we said, 'OK, it's nice.'"
They moved to Cape Coral in February 2017 and opened My Sweet Art three months later. Now their dream of owning a restaurant and pastry shop in America has come true. Just make sure not to call it a bakery.

United Methodist church speaks out against LGBTQ ban

Texto completo: Illustration Estes Park United Methodist Church Pastor Tom Towns opposes the Church's ban of same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy.

After last month's controversial vote by the United Methodist Church to not uplift the ban on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ Clergy, many churches have since made a stand against the decision.
The vote failed 449-374, a total of just 75 votes. But according to interviews and a review of the church's records by the New York Times last week, it appears that the vote was fraudulent as at least four of the ballots were cast by individuals who were not authorized to vote.
Though discussions about whether the votes should be recalled are happening on the denomination's grander stage, Estes Park United Methodist Church Pastor Tom Towns said that regardless of the outcome, he stands with the LGBTQ community and is in opposition of the ban.
"As far as I'm concerned, DNA creates sexual identity and gender orientation, so we don't control our DNA, we don't control who our parents are, and trying to get gays or lesbians to be hetero is kind of like asking the sky not to snow in Estes Park," Towns said.
For nearly 50 years, United Methodists have argued over their denomination's position that homosexuality is "incompatible with Christian teaching."
John Angermayr, a transgender member of Estes Park United Methodist Church who works on the church's reconciling ministry team, said that he's trying to be the voice of reason in a time of deep grief within the church.
"I have to recognize that this debate has been going on since the late seventies at a general conference level," Angermayr said. "This isn't a new conversation for many of us in the denomination."
Since becoming a member of the church in Estes Park, Angermayr said that he has never been approached with hostility by anybody. He said that the church's reconciling team does a good job of recognizing that everyone has a different voice and perspective. And in doing so, conversations are fostered that allow people with differing viewpoints to grow and understand each other better.
"It's really just inviting all of the voices to the table to be heard, not just my voice, but people who might disagree with me also," he said.
Even though the vote failed, Angermayr sees the church as moving in the direction of inclusion, though he's not quick to get his hopes up just yet.
"This 'issue' has come up for debate every four years at our general conference, and since the language surrounding homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching was put into the discipline, every four years the gap between the yes and no votes on whether to overturn the ban have gotten closer and closer," he said.
Two weeks ago, following the vote, Pastor Towns discussed his views on the ban in his Sunday sermon.
Though it's a highly controversial topic, he said that it was well received from both sides of the aisle.
That encourages Angermayr because regardless if the vote will hold ground or be recalled, he's comfortable knowing that his house of worship welcomes him with wide arms just as his creator does.
"Just because the institution of the Church says they don't love me for who I am, that doesn't mean that God doesn't love me for who I am," Angermayr said.

6-week abortion ban bill heads to governor

Texto completo: Mississippi is on the precipice of banning abortions within six weeks of a pregnancy.
The Senate agreed with changes made by the House Tuesday, paving the way for Gov. Phil Bryant to sign it into law.
The bill does not make exceptions for instances of rape or incest. It does make an exception for cases of medical emergencies.
Bryant tweeted Tuesday afternoon that he would sign the bill, which bans abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected.
"I look forward to signing it very soon," Bryant said.
The bill also includes criminal punishments for doctors who defy the ban.
Upon becoming law, it will almost certainly spend months or years held up in litigation.
Kentucky's governor signed a similar bill into law Friday, the New York Times reported, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it just hours later.
Mississippi Legislators already approved one of the strictest abortion laws last year, banning them after 15 weeks. That law was quickly halted and found to "unequivocally" violate women's constitutional rights by a federal judge last year. Attorney General Jim Hood has vowed to fight the decision.
After the bill's passage, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves issued a statement, saying that Mississippians "value the sanctity of life."
"A beating heart clearly means life has begun and should be protected. I appreciate the work of both senators and representatives for getting this legislation to Gov. Bryant's desk," Reeves said.
The bill provoked heated debate in both chambers.
Some opponents made a financial argument, saying Mississippi will waste taxpayer money fighting an abortion ban that will never be ruled constitutional by the courts.
Sen. Derrick Simmons claimed Mississippi spent $1.2 million litigating the 15-week abortion ban.
According to Margaret Ann Morgan, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Attorney General's Office, the 15-week abortion ban has not cost the state any additional money because staff attorneys have been working on the case.
Morgan said staff attorneys have spent 916 hours on the case so far. Morgan said that time is valued at $65 hour, meaning the attorney general's office has spent nearly $60,000 on the case.
A Democratic lawmaker accused Republicans last week of grandstanding on a bill that will surely be tied up in court. Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Raymond, said Republicans were not "brave enough" to ban abortion outright.
However, some believe Mississippi will ultimately prevail in court.
During an earlier discussion of the bill, Sen. Joey Fillingane said that with the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the U.S. Supreme Court could rule differently on abortion than it traditionally has.
"These decisions may swing in a very different decision now," Fillingane told his fellow lawmakers.
Other states also appear to be taking note of the new Supreme Court — and how it may rule on abortion.
States like Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina, Missouri and Tennessee are considering or have passed legislation similar to what could soon be law in Mississippi.
Supporters of these abortion bans foresee the possibility that the high court might either reverse Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion, or uphold specific state laws that would undermine Roe.

Would March Madness fans bet legally if they could?

Texto completo: The NCAA men’s basketball tourney starting this week will inspire 47 million Americans to wager $8.5 billion, Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, proclaims during a Monday conference call with the media.
More money will change hands during a few weeks of the tournament than the total value of goods produced and services provided in the nation of Haiti during an entire year. Nearly twice as many people bet on the tournament known as March Madness as they do on the Super Bowl.
"Americans like to bet on sports, and Americans do bet on sports," Miller says, adding that a survey shows only 4.1 million of those gamblers place bets legally with casino sportsbooks in Nevada or the seven states (Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island) that legalized sports betting since last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that makes it possible.
Anyone in Illinois or those other states without legal sports booking who plunks down 5 bucks and fills out a bracket predicting the outcomes for all 68 teams in an office pool or with friends is breaking the law, although arrests are practically nonexistent.
"Most people don’t even know the activity they are participating in is illegal," Miller says. The American Gaming Association, the gambling trade group representing casinos, pushes the idea of making gambling on sports, including contests with amateur college athletes, legal in all states. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has touted the idea as a way to help raise funds in Illinois, and bills to make that happen are brewing.
"Unlike any other sporting event in the country, March Madness attracts millions who fill out brackets, make casual bets with friends or wager at a legal sportsbook, which Americans can now do more than ever before," Miller says.
I first became emotionally invested in the March Madness tournament as a kid in 1969. Having played out a simulation of the final game on my driveway hoop a hundred times, I was confident my Purdue Boilermakers and superstar shooter Rick Mount were going to vanquish a UCLA team led by center Lew Alcinder. UCLA won 92-72, Alcinder went on to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mount went on to open a hunting and fishing store in his hometown of Lebanon, Indiana, and I learned that those of us who follow our hearts instead of our heads aren’t going to do well picking winners in NCAA tournaments.
That didn’t stop me from picking an all-Hoosier Final Four whenever possible, selecting from teams such as Indiana, Purdue, Butler, Notre Dame, Indiana State and Valparaiso. That gave me a few champions (thanks, IU) in the 1980s, and some stunning upsets (thanks, Butler and Valpo), but never a complete bracket that finished in the money. When The New York Times first gave readers a chance to fill out a bracket online, my picks after Day One had me among the top 25 people in the nation. By Day Two, I had fallen out of the top 1,500.
I haven’t even bothered to fill out a bracket in recent years, which makes me a winner (or at least a non-loser).
People want to bet on March Madness, and they do it illegally if they don’t have a legal option, Miller says.
Even if Illinois legalizes sports betting through the proper channels, people might still participate in illegal office pools because it’s more fun losing money to a co-worker than to a giant gambling institution. Miller adds that the casino industry spends $300 million on "responsible gaming" programs to recognize and help people for whom gambling is a problem.
My problem with gambling today is that I did enter a free online bracket pool and my simulation has Purdue, the only team from Indiana, winning the championship game 92-72 over Michigan State.

Texto completo: Durante la preparación del juicio a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , los fiscales federales sellaron varios temas relacionados con sus testigos, principalmente cooperantes, que pudieran afectar su credibilidad al ser cuestionados por los abogados del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa.
Los abogados del New York Times y de VICE News presentaron mociones para exigir que se diera a conocer esa información que se ocultó en la mayor parte del proceso que ocurrió entre el 5 de noviembre de 2018 y el 31 de enero de 2019.
Uno de los primeros documentos revelados fue parte del testimonio previo de Alex Cifuentes , exsocio de Guzmán Loera, quien reveló que el mexicano pagó por menores de hasta 13 años para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas en sus escondites en las montañas de Sinaloa.
Sin embargo, hay más secretos por revelar, debido a la presión jurídica de los medios mencionados. En enero, el juez Brian Cogan determinó que se diera a conocer esa información y los fiscales elaboran una lista de qué darán a conocer paulatinamente.
“Los fiscales federales revelaron parte de los documentos del juicio de ‘El Chapo'” , informó Keegan Hamilton, reportero de VICE News. “El material incluye información adicional de Alex Cifuentes y las actividades sexuales de ‘El Chapo’ con menores de edad”.
#BREAKING @vicenews: Prosecutors just unsealed a new batch of court documents from El Chapo's trial.
The material includes additional info on witness Alex Cifuentes and Chapo's "sexual activities with underage partners"https://t.co/Gk8QSKAZwU pic.twitter.com/QVRpDFNQiL
— Keegan Hamilton (@keegan_hamilton) March 15, 2019
“Un hilo sobre la secrecía en el capo del Chapo: En enero el juez Cogan, respondiendo a abogado del NYT, ordenó a la defensa y a fiscales revelar algunos de los muchos, muchos documentos en el caso”, señaló el periodista Alan Feuer , del Times.
A thread about the ongoing secrecy in the Chapo case:

— Alan Feuer (@alanfeuer) March 16, 2019
Los documentos compartidos por Hamilton establecen una lista de temáticas sobre las cuales los fiscales no querían que se hablara en la corte, ya que pudo afectar la credibilidad de sus cooperantes. Los representantes del Gobierno de Estados Unidos indicaron que los hechos no estuvieran directamente relacionados con las acusaciones contra Guzmán Loera, por lo que eran irrelevantes para el juicio.
Por ejemplo, se menciona al cooperante CW1 –identificado como Cifuentes– y la violencia doméstica contra su esposa, incluso agresiones durante su embarazo, así como sus interés sexual en menores indistintamente del sexo.
En el punto se menciona la complicidad sobre asuntos sexuales que Cifuentes mantenía con “El Chapo”, pero no se brindan mayores detalles.
“Actividades sexuales de CW1 y demandadas con socios menores de edad (miembros del Cártel de Sinaloa)”, indica el documento. “El acusado también busca interrogar a CW1 acerca de detalles altamente escabrosos concerniente a la actividad sexual que él y el acusado tuvieron con parejas menores para dos razones: (1) presenta una inconsistencia con la forma en que CW1 vio el tratamiento de otros menores, a saber, hombres jóvenes entre las edades de 16 y 17 años ; y (2) lleva en la relación de CW1 con el acusado, aunque el acusado busca limitar el testimonio acerca de su propia persona “, indica el documento en referencia a que los abogados de Guzmán Loera quería desacreditar a Cifuentes sin afectar a su cliente.
También se habla de sacar a la luz aquellos temas relacionados con esoterismo y el culto a sectas como los Illuminati, la vida extraterrestre, así como homicidios desconocidos y otros casos que pudieran afectar a cooperantes y al propio Guzmán Loera, lejos de los 10 cargos en su contra por los que fue hallado culpable.
La sentencia de “El Chapo” está programada para el 25 de junio, pero en las siguientes semanas se espera que los abogados presenten una solicitud de nuevo juicio, luego de que un jurado revelara que no se siguieron las reglas ordenadas por el juez Cogan.

Texto completo: Should you pick your nose?
Don’t laugh. Scientifically, it’s an interesting question.
Should your children pick their noses? Should your children eat dirt? Maybe: Your body needs to know what immune challenges lurk in the immediate environment.
Should you use antibacterial soap or hand sanitizers? No. Are we taking too many antibiotics? Yes.
“I tell people, when they drop food on the floor, please pick it up and eat it,” said Dr. Meg Lemon, a dermatologist in Denver who treats people with allergies and autoimmune disorders.
“Get rid of the antibacterial soap. Immunize! If a new vaccine comes out, run and get it. I immunized the living hell out of my children. And it’s OK if they eat dirt.”
Lemon’s prescription for a better immune system doesn’t end there. “You should not only pick your nose, you should eat it,” she said.
She’s referring, with a facetious touch, to the fact our immune system can become disrupted if it doesn’t have regular interactions with the natural world.
“Our immune system needs a job,” Lemon said. “We evolved over millions of years to have our immune systems under constant assault. Now they don’t have anything to do.”
She isn’t alone. Leading physicians and immunologists are reconsidering the antiseptic, at times hysterical, ways in which we interact with our environment.
Why? Let us turn to 19th-century London.
Sibling factor in allergies
The British Journal of Homeopathy, Volume 29, published in 1872, included a startlingly prescient observation: “Hay fever is said to be an aristocratic disease, and there can be no doubt that, if it is not almost wholly confined to the upper classes of society, it is rarely, if ever, met with but among the educated.”
Hay fever is a catchall term for seasonal allergies to pollen and other airborne irritants. With this idea that hay fever was an aristocratic disease, British scientists were on to something.
More than a century later, in November 1989, another highly influential paper was published on the subject of hay fever. The paper was short, less than two pages, in BMJ, titled “Hay Fever, Hygiene, and Household Size.”
The author looked at the prevalence of hay fever among 17,414 children born in March 1958. Of 16 variables the scientist explored, he described as “most striking” an association between the likelihood that a child would get hay fever allergy and the number of his or her siblings.
It was an inverse relationship, meaning the more siblings the child had, the less likely it was that he or she would get the allergy. Not just that, but the children least likely to get allergies were ones who had older siblings.
The paper hypothesized that “allergic diseases were prevented by infection in early childhood, transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings, or acquired prenatally from a mother infected by contact with her older children.
“Over the past century, declining family size, improvements in household amenities, and higher standards of personal cleanliness have reduced the opportunity for cross infection in young families,” the paper continued. “This may have resulted in more widespread clinical expression of atopic disease, emerging in wealthier people, as seems to have occurred for hay fever.”
This is the birth of the hygiene hypothesis. The ideas behind it have since evolved and expanded, but it provides profound insight into a challenge that human beings face in our relationship with the modern world.
Our ancestors evolved over millions of years to survive in their environments. For most of human existence, that environment was characterized by extreme challenges, like scarcity of food, or food that could carry disease, as well as unsanitary conditions and unclean water, withering weather and so on. It was a dangerous environment, a heck of a thing to survive.
At the center of our defenses was our immune system, our most elegant defense. The system is the product of centuries of evolution, as a river stone is shaped by water rushing over it and the tumbles it experiences on its journey downstream.
Late in the process, humans learned to take steps to bolster our defenses, developing all manner of customs and habits to support our survival. In this way, think of the brain - the organ that helps us develop habits and customs - as another facet of the immune system.
We used our collective brains to figure out effective behaviors. We started washing our hands and took care to avoid certain foods that experience showed could be dangerous or deadly. In some cultures, people came to avoid pork, which we now know is highly susceptible to trichinosis; in others, people banned meats, which we later learned may carry toxic loads of E. coli and other bacteria.
Ritual washing is mentioned in Exodus, one of the earliest books in the Bible: “So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not.”
Our ideas evolved, but for the most part, the immune system did not. This is not to say that it didn’t change. The immune system responds to our environment. When we encounter various threats, our defenses learn and then are much more able to deal with that threat in the future. In that way, we adapt to our environment.
We survived over tens of thousands of years. Eventually, we washed our hands, swept our floors, cooked our food, avoided certain foods altogether. We improved the hygiene of the animals we raised and slaughtered for food.
Particularly in the wealthier areas of the world, we purified our water, and developed plumbing and waste treatment plants; we isolated and killed bacteria and other germs.
The immune system’s enemies list was attenuated, largely for the good. Now, though, our bodies are proving that they cannot keep up with this change. We have created a mismatch between the immune system - one of the longest surviving and most refined balancing acts in the world - and our environment.
Thanks to all the powerful learning we’ve done as a species, we have minimized the regular interaction not just with germs but even with friendly bacteria and parasites that helped to teach and hone the immune system - that “trained” it. It doesn’t encounter as many bugs when we are babies. This is not just because our homes are cleaner, but also because our families are smaller (fewer older kids are bringing home the germs), our foods and water cleaner, our milk sterilized. Some refer to the lack of interaction with all kinds of microbes we used to meet in nature as the “old friends mechanism.”
What does the immune system do when it’s not properly trained?
It can overreact. It becomes aggrieved by things like dust mites or pollen. It develops what we called allergies, chronic immune system attacks - inflammation - in a way that is counterproductive, irritating, even dangerous.
The percentage of children in the United States with a food allergy rose 50 percent between 1997-99 and 2009-11, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The jump in skin allergies was 69 percent during that period, leaving 12.5 percent of American children with eczema and other irritations.
Food and respiratory allergies rose in tandem with income level. More money, which typically correlates with higher education, has meant more risk of allergy. This may reflect differences in who reports such allergies, but it also springs from differences in environment.
These trends are seen internationally, too. Skin allergies “doubled or tripled in industrialized countries during the past three decades, affecting 15-30 percent of children and 2-10 percent of adults,” according to a paper citing research from the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Asthma, the paper reads, “is becoming an ‘epidemic’ phenomenon.”
Hygiene hypothesis
By 2011, 1 in 4 children in Europe had an allergy, and the figure was on the rise, according to a report by the World Allergy Organization. Reinforcing the hygiene hypothesis, the paper noted that migration studies have shown that children born overseas have lower levels of some types of both allergy and autoimmunity than migrants whose children are born in the United States.
There are related trends in inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, rheumatic conditions and, in particular, celiac disease. The last results from the immune’s system overreacting to gluten, a protein in wheat, rye and barley. This attack, in turn, damages the walls of the small intestine.
This is not to say that all of these increases are due to better hygiene, a drop in childhood infection, and its association with wealth and education. There have been many changes to our environment, including new pollutants. There are absolutely genetic factors as well.
But the hygiene hypothesis - and when it comes to allergy, the inverse relationship between industrialized processes and health - has held up remarkably well.

Texto completo: UTRECHT, Netherlands -- Gunshots shattered the tram ride in a heavily Muslim neighborhood of this old Dutch city. The prime minister called it possible terrorism. SWAT teams rushed in, residents were ordered indoors, and all mosques closed as the police sought a killer in a country that had been spared large-scale terrorist attacks.
Suddenly the mayhem on Monday in the Netherlands seemed as if it might be another planned public slaughter in a seemingly tranquil part of the world, like the mosque massacre that had traumatized the people of Christchurch, New Zealand.
The suspect, it turned out, was a Turkish immigrant described by acquaintances as a sometimes-religious man with a criminal record who may have been entangled in a dispute with his ex-wife.
It was about 10:30 a.m. when a gunman opened fire on the tram in Utrecht's Kanaleneiland neighborhood, heavily populated by Turkish and Moroccan immigrants. Someone slammed on the emergency brakes, and other passengers screamed, clamoring to escape, according to witness accounts. At least three people were killed and five injured, some by shattering glass, and the assailant stepped off the tram and fled.
"I saw a woman lying outside the tram," said Daan Molenaar, a witness. "She was being helped by passers-by leaving their cars. Then the suspect came out of the tram with a gun in his hand, and I thought I've got to get out of here."
The suspect was later identified by the police as Gokmen Tanis, 37, an immigrant from the central Turkish town of Yozgat. Mr. Tanis had been arrested before and is facing a rape charge, according to the Dutch national broadcaster and people who know him.
The police conducted house-to-house raids in the area and arrested Mr. Tanis eight hours later, just as officials were holding a news conference on the attack.
"He's very religious," but also "a real guy of the streets, aggressive as well," Alptekin Akdogan, who said he knew Mr. Tanis, told The New York Times. He said he and Mr. Tanis had grown up in the Kanaleneiland neighborhood.
Zabit Elmaci, 39, said he used to work with Mr. Tanis, washing dishes in a restaurant called Abrikoos. He described Mr. Tanis as "always in trouble."
"I don't remember him as a religious person, but about two years ago he started acting weird, so I gradually stopped seeing him," Mr. Elmaci said.
Mr. Tanis was born in Yozgat, according to both Mr. Akdogan and Zeki Baran, director of the Netherlands Yozgat Federation.
"We don't know much about him, except for that his father told us that he had not been in touch with his family for a long time," Mr. Baran said. A relative of the suspect is a candidate for mayor of Yozgat, he added.
While the authorities had not ruled out terrorism by Monday night, the panic that convulsed Utrecht, a city of 330,000 with a diverse population, appeared to partly reflect heightened nerves from the Christchurch killings three days earlier, which left 50 people dead.
Utrecht quickly became a trending topic on Twitter as people sought to learn more. News websites, including that of The New York Times, provided live updates of what was known.
The interest was amplified by the neighborhood of the attack, partly populated by people of Turkish descent. That raised speculation that the shooting may have been somehow tied to the angry denunciations by Turkey's president of the suspect in the Christchurch slaughter, a self-proclaimed white nationalist who had visited Turkey and expressed hatred of immigrants.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said Monday night that Turkish intelligence agencies were investigating the Utrecht shooting further. "Some say that it is a family dispute, others say it is a terrorist act," Mr. Erdogan told Turkish television.
Whether others were involved in the shooting remained unclear, although the police said they had made two additional arrests by Monday evening. Some witnesses said they had seen more than one assailant on the tram.
Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, raised the possibility of terrorism soon after the tram attack. The mayor of Utrecht, Jan van Zanen, was more definitive, declaring: "We are working on the assumption of a terrorist motive."
The Netherlands' main counterterrorism agency raised its assessment of the threat in Utrecht Province, just southeast of Amsterdam, to the highest level and said it had activated a crisis team.
The authorities ordered the evacuation of all mosques in Utrecht, and security was increased at mosques elsewhere in the Netherlands.
But later in the day, the police said they were also considering that the motive might have been personal. Their warning for people to stay indoors was lifted.
According to the Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu, relatives of Mr. Tanis said that the shooting had originated from a family dispute, and that only one person had been the intended target. Similar accounts came from people who knew him in the Netherlands.
The identities of the victims remained unconfirmed Monday night, although there was some speculation one might have been his former wife. Some Turkish news accounts quoted the father of the suspect, Mehmet Tanis, as saying his son had divorced his wife, who lived in the Netherlands, more than a decade ago.
The Netherlands has one of the lowest rates of private firearms ownership in Europe, according to international studies, about 2.6 per 100 people, compared to more than one per person in the United States. Its rate of gun homicide, about 0.2 to 0.3 per 100,000 people each year, is fairly typical for Europe, and far below the United States rate of about 4 per 100,000 people.
Utrecht, about 25 miles from Amsterdam, has been a center of Dutch culture and commerce for a millennium. Utrecht University is the largest university in the Netherlands, and the city has multiple museums, a medieval old town, canals and the headquarters of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands.
More than 30 percent of the city's population is foreign-born, according to the Dutch census.

Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum: Where's the outrage over Dems delegitimizing our democracy?

Texto completo: This week, President Trump claimed Democrats tried to steal the 2016 presidential election. I’m sure it’s just an oversight that the same people screaming about this are so deathly silent about failed gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum, who have both claimed baselessly that their respective elections actually were stolen last year by the GOP.

Just an oversight, I’m sure.

On Sunday, the president tweeted the following note:

"What the Democrats have done in trying to steal a Presidential Election, first at the 'ballot box' and then, after that failed, with the 'Insurance Policy,' is the biggest Scandal in the history of our Country!"

The “insurance policy” bit is a reference to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and the former FBI agent and anti-Trump partisan who used to be connected to that effort. The president’s “ballot box” comment is a reference to his oft-repeated claim he lost the popular vote in 2016 because Democrats encouraged roughly three million “illegals” to vote. There’s nothing to back this latter assertion.

The president’s regular resistance critics were quick to push back. “Deeply corrosive to democracy to have the president suggest that the opposition party tried to steal the election,” opined political scientist and New York Times contributor Brendan Nyhan.

Self-proclaimed expert and frequent cable news commentator Tom Nichols lectured elsewhere: “The President of United States is putting ‘ballot box’ in scare quotes and attacking the legitimacy of an election he won. This is dangerous behavior, in every way, and Republicans have decided that they're going to accept it because of judges and tax cuts.”

The Washington Post’s formerly conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin theorized darkly, “Why [Trump] would put ballot box in quotes is unknown, but it’s of a piece with his efforts to discredit democratic elections, a habit that neatly dovetails with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s effort to undermine Western democracies.”

And so on and so on and so on and so on and so on.

They're not wrong to criticize the president’s tweet, though perhaps it's possible to do it with less melodrama. We should demand better from our president. We should also demand the same from other candidates, including the failed Democratic candidates Abrams and Gillum, who are still claiming to this day that they would’ve won their races last year in Georgia and Florida, respectively, were it not for the GOP’s dastardly election-stealing tricks.

“[H]ad we been able to legally count every one of those votes not just in Florida but also in Georgia, I wonder what the outcome may be,” Gillum said during an appearance this weekend on HBO’s “Real Time.”

Last Thursday, Abrams bragged she has yet to concede her race, telling an interviewer, “I did win my election. I just didn't get to have the job."

Georgia’s then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp beat Abrams last year with 50.2 percent of the vote compared to her 48.8 percent. In Florida, the race was much tighter. Gillum lost to Gov. Ron DeSantis 49.6 to 49.2 percent. Close, to be sure, but not close enough, as the simultaneous U.S. Senate race was, to leave the outcome in doubt.

Weirdly enough, many of the same people who are very upset about Trump’s efforts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2016 election have said nothing whatsoever about Abrams or Gillum doing the same for their 2018 gubernatorial races.

Neither Nyhan, nor Nichols, nor Rubin has so much as tweeted about Abrams' and Gillum's remarks. In fact, the only comment on this by any of the cited resistance critics was Rubin's tweet last week: “Abrams/Kasich 2020.”

I understand there’s a large gap between the president of the United States and two washed up gubernatorial candidates casting doubt on the integrity of our electoral mechanisms. But either we oppose public figures seeking to undermine confidence in our elections, or we don’t. Protecting democracy means defending it from all attackers, not just the ones with an “R” next to them.

Los agentes indicaron que Comello tenía interés romántico por una de las familiares del Cali , pero el jefe de la mafia le dijo al joven de 24 años de edad que se mantuviera alejado de ella. Se desconoce la identidad de la mujer.
El rechazo fue lo que, indican, desató la furia del muchacho, pero oficialmente, el jefe de detectives del Departamento de Policía, Dermot Shea , dijo que su gente estaba examinando “múltiples ángulos” del posible motivo del homicidio.
Comello fue arrestado en una casa propiedad de su familia en Brick, Nueva Jersey el sábado y está recluido en la cárcel del Condado de Ocean.
Los detectives tienen una grabación del asesinato de una cámara de seguridad afuera de la casa del Cali, y las huellas dactilares de Comello coinciden con las que se sacaron de una placa que el pistolero recogió y entregó a Cali antes de abrir fuego, según la Policía.
El hombre de 24 años de edad era graduado de Tottenville High School, vivía con sus padres en la sección de Eltingville en Staten Island, dijeron los vecinos.
“Él limpiaba la nieve por nosotros”, dijo Victor Ujeck , un vecino. “He visto a sus padres varias veces, también gente muy agradable… Nunca me hubiera imaginado que pudiera hacer esto”.
Didar Janid , de 46 años, trabaja en la bodega Campos, a pocas cuadras de la casa del sospechoso en Staten Island, dijo que había conocido al Comello desde hace casi ocho años y lo describió como alguien con personalidad “fuerte”.

Texto completo: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly approved a secret operation to quell dissent more than a year before the controversial death of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.

American officials said the group that killed Khashoggi is called the “Saudi Rapid Intervention Group” and was used a number of times before the writer was killed as part of a wider campaign to crush dissent, the New York Times reported Sunday.

Throughout the campaign, the group that allegedly murdered Khashoggi was used for surveillance missions. Their campaign also involved kidnapping, detaining, and torturing activists, clerics, and others. Members of the group that killed Khashoggi were reportedly involved in at least a dozen missions since 2017, when Mohammed bin Salman was elevated to crown prince.

Bruce Riedel, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst now with the Brookings Institution said the scale of crackdowns against dissidents has surged under Crown Prince Mohammed. “We’ve never seen it on a scale like this,” Riedel said. “A dissident like Jamal Khashoggi in the past wouldn’t have been considered worth the effort.”

The CIA has accused the crown prince of being directly involved in the death of Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Washington Post columnist who is believed to have been killed at the Saudi embassy in Turkey. The Saudi government claims that the death was an interrogation gone wrong, and that the crown prince did not order the assassination.

The issue has strained ties between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, despite the Saudis having a mutual foe in Iran and being a strategically important partner in the Middle East. President Trump’s response to the killing, which indicated he stood by the Saudi crown prince, led to condemnation from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle

'Pimply kid' who helped build Maine school now in spotlight Democratic candidate John Hickenlooper got his start volunteering in Maine back in 1970.

Texto completo: John Hickenlooper, who plans to run for president next year, is the former governor of Colorado, a past mayor of Denver and a pioneer of the craft brew trade. But in the summer of 1970 he was a lanky, ponytailed Pennsylvania teenager volunteering his time to help fix up an abandoned sardine factory on Maine's far eastern fringe.
Hickenlooper, then 18 and a member of a practicing Quaker family, had traveled here as part of an American Friends Service Committee work camp assigned to help an all-volunteer free school get off the ground in Robbinston, 15 miles up Passamaquoddy Bay from Eastport. He and a dozen other young Quakers spent the summer scraping, painting and renovating the cavernous building facing Canada across the St. Croix, which opened the following fall to 31 pupils ranging from kindergarten to eighth grade.
"One of the women who started it had been teaching in the public school, and they claimed she had Ho Chi Minh's pictures on her wall and (North) Vietnamese flags, so they forced her out," Hickenlooper recalled in a 2016 interview when he was governor. "They created their own school because the parents had said they were the only teachers they liked."
Indeed, co-founder Susan Tureen, a newly minted graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, had learned earlier that year that School Administrative District 69 would not renew her contract to teach Robbinston Elementary's kindergarten, first- and second-graders. Administrators claimed it was due to her lax "philosophy of pupil control," according to press reports at the time, though Tureen said there had never been any complaints or even oversight of her classroom conduct.
"It was just a horrible time for me, because I was young, impressionable and had fallen in love with these kids and was looking forward to going back the next year," Tureen says. "A bus driver saw a blue and red decoration a kid had drawn, freaked out and said it was a Viet Cong flag. It didn't even have a star on it."
In reality, her dismissal may have had more to do with the feathers her husband, lawyer Tom Tureen, was ruffling up representing the Passamaquoddy Tribe in a massive land claim case against the state that would eventually result in a cash settlement and federal recognition for tribes east of the Mississippi River that had previously been excluded. Tureen's predecessor, Don Gellers, had been run out of the country in the face of an orchestrated conspiracy directed by the Attorney General's Office and executed by the Maine State Police, who sought to imprison him for the "constructive possession" of a marijuana cigarette allegedly found in a closet, in the pocket of one of his jackets.
Such was the scene when Hickenlooper arrived in Robbinston to help Susan Tureen and 17 families prepare Our School, an all-volunteer, tuition-free alternative school, for its September 1970 opening. The school was featured in The New York Times in 1971 because one of his fellow volunteers was the daughter of the reporter, Thomas Laskoct, Tureen said.
"Hickenlooper was a pimply adolescent with a stringy ponytail when he worked with us," she recalled. She didn't see him again until the late 1980s, when he invited the Tureens to visit him at his family's cabin on New Hampshire's Squam Lake, 75 miles west of Portland, where he still spends part of each summer.
Hickenlooper and his spokesperson did not respond to interview requests for this story.
Maine to COLORADO governorship
After leaving Robbinston, Hickenlooper enrolled at Wesleyan College, earned a master's degree in geology and moved to Colorado to work for an energy company. Laid off during Denver's 1980s energy bust, he famously started a microbrew pub, Wynkoop, which helped turn the city's derelict LoDo neighborhood into a thriving entertainment district, a process he backed when he served as mayor from 2003 to 2011, when he was elected governor.
While governor, he learned a reporter he was speaking to was from Maine and immediately interjected: "You must know my friend David Geary!" - founder of Portland-based D.L. Geary Brewing and a pioneer of Maine's own microbrew industry.
Indeed, Geary says he met the future governor at a craft beer industry conference in Denver and the two brewers became fast friends. "Our personalities matched - he was funny, smart and articulate, and we just hit it off," Geary recalls with a laugh. "He's all about the grassroots and connecting one-on-one with people, ordinary people like me and you. I'm really excited he's running for president."
Hickenlooper joins 14 other Democrats who have announced they are seeking to take on President Trump in the 2020 election. Pragmatic, socially progressive and entrepreneurial, he won statewide office and policy allies in a purple state. Many national pundits expect he will face an uphill battle, given the energy in the party's progressive wing and his lack of name recognition outside of his home state.
"Nobody there knows who the hell I am," Hickenlooper said last year of New Hampshire, his summer retreat, in an interview with The Atlantic. "It's perfect. If I did run for president, it would be less than perfect."

Jazzing up D.C.

Texto completo: In late 2017, Giovanni Russonello and Luke Stewart met at a cafe for a serious conversation. CapitalBop, their grass-roots D.C. jazz advocacy organization, was in an alarming slowdown.
"It was an existential crisis," Russonello recalls. "A lot of things were really falling to the wayside."
Russonello and Stewart founded the nonprofit CapitalBop in 2010 as a one-stop shop for jazz in the District. Its website (capitalbop.com, of which Russonello is editor in chief) offers a calendar of gigs around town, concert and album reviews, interviews with local artists and other features. CapitalBop also presents concerts (Stewart's end of the business), bringing in artists from New York and elsewhere to perform in often D.I.Y. spaces. However, their real focus is on local musicians, offering them paying gigs and opportunities to build an audience.
The pair quickly became an integral part of the D.C. jazz community. "The fact that these cats are out here really shaking the bushes and stirring things up? It motivates me," bassist Michael Bowie told The Washington Post in 2012.
But seven years in, they seemed to be running out of steam. Both CapitalBop principals have a separate, consuming career. Russonello, 30, is a journalist; he helped cover the 2016 presidential election for the New York Times and then switched to covering jazz for the paper. Stewart, 32, is a working bassist, jazz and otherwise, increasingly in demand for out-of-town gigs and international tours.
Their board meetings stopped happening, and Union Arts - a complex of artist studios on New York Avenue NE, at which CapitalBop held its monthly "Jazz Loft" performance series - closed. (Stewart maintained quarterly "Traveling Lofts" at spaces across the District.) Washington writer Jackson Sinnenberg kept the Web content alive, but his career as a radio producer had its own demands.
"We realized we needed to make a decision," Russonello says. "If we just keep limping along as is, the future didn't look super bright. But we'd built up so much momentum, we had such a vision, and we saw the need continuing to exist, we thought we ought to try to keep it alive. So Luke and I sat down and said, 'Okay, if we're really doing this, what exactly is it that we're doing?' "
That meeting sowed the seeds for a resurgence that has borne fruit in recent months. In August, CapitalBop debuted its Spotlight Residency program, a monthly series for local artists at U Street restaurant Local 16. In December, they revived the monthly Jazz Loft, this time at the Takoma arts space Rhizome.
After the new year, CapitalBop for the first time announced a full spring season of concert presentations. The season includes regular installments of the Spotlight Residency and Jazz Loft series; two traveling lofts, featuring New York saxophonist Ben Wendel and experimental pianist Angelica Sanchez, respectively; and, in a co-presentation with the Washington Women in Jazz Festival, a rare appearance by composer, pianist and NEA Jazz Master Carla Bley at the Atlas Performing Arts Center.
"We're excited," Stewart says. "It's amazing that after almost a decade, it's finally coming together the way it is."
The website also is getting a boost. Last month, CapitalBop hired award-winning jazz journalist Patrick Jarenwattananon as its managing editor. The former NPR blogger and producer is tasked with revitalizing the site's journalistic coverage of the local scene, expanding the contributor base and ensuring that new content is published each week.
A number of recent developments enabled CapitalBop's expansion. They've had an infusion of new funding - including a three-year, $100,000 grant from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, announced in February. In addition, Stewart's growing profile in the jazz world has broadened his connections, increasing CapitalBop's visibility and the scope of its potential programming.
But both Russonello and Stewart say the most important boost to CapitalBop's renaissance was their addition last June of Jamie Sandel, a former intern and recent Amherst College graduate, as the organization's managing director.
"Jamie's a godsend," Stewart says. "He does all the critical day-to-day stuff that should require multiple people. . . . He's really been a game-changer."
Sandel, 24, is more modest, pointing out that Russonello and Stewart still devote countless hours to CapitalBop from afar. "They're very much at the heart of the decisions that have been made," he says. "I've been spearheading the projects that we have taken on, but I'm just the execution of Gio and Luke's vision."
That execution requires Sandel to wear multiple hats. He manages everything from accounting and artist relations to writing news releases and checking out late-night gigs around town. He's also developing the next component of CapitalBop's revitalization: an educational program led by puppeteer and website contributor Majeedah Johnson.
The organization's new lease on life has already brought a positive charge to the District's jazz scene. The Jazz Loft has been welcomed back by both musicians and audiences. Drummer Dana Hawkins, who held the February edition of the two-night Spotlight Residency, says the new program is just what local jazz musicians need.
"They're keeping us visible on U Street, where people are coming around and looking for that kind of music," Hawkins says. "And they do not burden you with expectations. So often you hear, 'We saw you doing this, and that got a big reaction, so why don't you do a little bit of that?' It's not even close to that with CapitalBop. It's 'That's what you want to do? Come do it with us.' "

Don't blame robots for low wages

Texto completo: The other day I found myself, as I often do, at a conference discussing lagging wages and soaring inequality. There was a lot of interesting discussion. But one thing that struck me was how many of the participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem - that machines are taking away the good jobs, or even jobs in general. For the most part this wasn't even presented as a hypothesis, just as part of what everyone knows.
And this assumption has real implications for policy discussion. For example, a lot of the agitation for a universal basic income comes from the belief that jobs will become ever scarcer as the robot apocalypse overtakes the economy.
So it seems like a good idea to point out that in this case what everyone knows isn't true. Predictions are hard, especially about the future, and maybe the robots really will come for all our jobs one of these days. But automation just isn't a big part of the story of what happened to American workers over the past 40 years.
We do have a big problem - but it has very little to do with technology, and a lot to do with politics and power.
Let's back up for a minute, and ask: What is a robot, anyway? Clearly, it doesn't have to be something that looks like C-3PO, or rolls around saying "Exterminate! Exterminate!" From an economic point of view, a robot is anything that uses technology to do work formerly done by human beings.
And robots in that sense have been transforming our economy literally for centuries. David Ricardo, one of the founding fathers of economics, wrote about the disruptive effects of machinery in 1821.
These days, when people talk about the robot apocalypse, they don't usually think of things like strip mining and mountaintop removal. Yet these technologies utterly transformed coal mining: Coal production almost doubled between 1950 and 2000 (it only began falling a few years ago), yet the number of coal miners fell from 470,000 to fewer than 80,000.
Or consider freight containerization. Longshoremen used to be a big part of the scene in major port cities. But while global trade has soared since the 1970s, the share of U.S. workers engaged in "marine cargo handling" has fallen by two-thirds.
So technological change is an old story. What's new is the failure of workers to share in the fruits of that technological change.
While there have always been some victims of technological progress, until the 1970s rising productivity translated into rising wages for a great majority of workers. Then the connection was broken. And it wasn't the robots that did it.
What did? There is a growing though incomplete consensus among economists that a key factor in wage stagnation has been workers' declining bargaining power - a decline whose roots are ultimately political.
Most obviously, the federal minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, has fallen by a third over the past half century, even as worker productivity has risen 150 percent.
The decline of unions, which covered a quarter of private-sector workers in 1973 but only 6 percent now, may not be as obviously political. But other countries haven't seen the same kind of decline. What made America exceptional was a political environment deeply hostile to labor organizing and friendly toward union-busting employers.
Consider the case of trucking, which used to be a good job but now pays a third less than it did in the 1970s, with terrible working conditions. What made the difference? De-unionization was a big part of the story.
And these easily quantifiable factors are just indicators of a sustained, across-the-board anti-worker bias in our politics. American workers can and should be getting a much better deal than they are. And to the extent that they aren't, the fault lies not in our robots, but in our political leaders.

Guest opinion: Blessed are the peacemakers

Texto completo: "Blessed" has become more of a trendy hashtag, less of a genuine appreciation for life’s boons.
Got new Twitter followers # blessed
Didn’t have to wait in line for my latte # blessed
Instagram post received 1,000 likes # blessed
It’s misuse, albeit annoying, isn’t nearly as maddening as the trending political polarization created by those demanding a more tolerant America.
“We’re going to impeach this (expletive ) ,” congressional leader Rashida Tlaib recently stated. This came only months after boasting to MSNBC that she is teaching her sons, "That we show love. That we lead with compassion and that we lead with a sense of understanding that all of us, that we are part of this humanity together.”
Equally infuriating are those who mandate acceptance of their ideology whilst refusing to show similar courtesies.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” Rep. Steve King lamented in a recent New York Times article. This came after King kicked out a political forum attendee for likening King's ideology to that of the Pittsburgh synagogue’s massacrist — a white nationalist.
Polemicists, naturally, flocked to social media.
"Steve King, like Trump, is (expletive) wrapped in skin.” — Twitter follower
“Rashida, you’re just another wicked devilish Muslim that needs to be deported. In fact, every time I see a picture of you, I am reminded of how demon possessed you are.” — Twitter follower
“…..the GOP disciplined Steve King but the Democrats reward their bigots.” — Twitter follower
“This Guy Says Impeach the MF. Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib had it exactly right!” — Twitter follower.
Acerbic snippets of America’s downward political spiral if ever there were some.
Why?
It’s trendy to be tolerant intolerant.
It’s trendy to be controversial.
It’s trendy to speak without listening.
It’s not, however, en vogue to be peacemakers.
Ironic, considering we cannot progress towards a more tolerant nation without them.
Peacemakers nearing extinction will inevitably be blamed on a myriad of things —President Trump, the Democrats, the Republicans, the media, constituents — yet all is inconsequential. America needs not more scapegoats but a rude awakening.
It begins by redefining peace itself.
We think of peace as absence of war but it’s also about achieving wholeness. The iconic Hebraic word for peace, shalom, in fact, translates to just this. For one to achieve totality, to achieve a higher good, one must not only wish for the absence of evil for their fellow man but for the abundance of good things as well.
Translation?
It is time to make America whole again. This grounded hypothetical bird act — a broken left wing, a broken right wing — is working for only a select few. Nothing is being accomplished nor will it be accomplished if we don’t abandon self-indulged agendas for the greater cause.
Peacemakers themselves also need to be redefined.
We think of peacemakers as formally trained diplomats, yet each of us holds this power if we choose to do so — emphasis on "if."
Example?
In 1983, the Soviet Union shot down a Korean 747, killing all passengers, including 61 Americans. America consequently cut diplomatic ties with the Soviets. Suzanne Massie, an American with expertise in Russian culture and history, saw the urgency of this crossroad. If a peacemaker didn’t step in soon, the two countries would be at war. She promptly began contacting people in Washington before landing a meeting with National Security Advisor Bud McFarlane.
MacFarlane ultimately asked Massie to go to Russia on America’s behalf under the condition of anonymity. Going through the proper channels would take months and no one had that luxury. Massie agreed but with a condition of her own — she needed to meet with President Ronald Reagan and get his blessing. A month later, Reagan approved her mission and the peace process began.
Before the Geneva Convention of ’85, a site where Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met for the first time, Massie gave the president a painted wooden egg that bore the Virgin Mary and an inscription that read, “Don’t Blow up the World.” She asked that he give it to Gorbachev. Its significance? In Russian culture, an egg denotes a new beginning.
One person, a fledgling peacemaker, stopped two superpowers from going to war.
Inspiring indeed.
Peacemakers, perhaps most importantly, must always believe in humanity regardless of the times.
In times of polarization we have a tendency to gauge humanity by the action of a few. This is a fatal mistake. Although there will always be troublemakers, always someone actively stirring the pot, Gandhi said it best, “You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.”
Bottom line?
Blessed are those who desire to move toward a whole country.
Blessed are those who champion the greater cause.
Blessed are those who see value in humanity

Texto completo: Facebook blamed a massive outage that stretched into Thursday morning on a server configuration change.
The world's largest social network said it has resolved the issue, which affected millions of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp users starting Wednesday.
"We made a server configuration change that triggered a cascading series of issues. As a result, many people had difficulty accessing our apps and services," Facebook said in a statement. "Our systems have been recovering over the last few hours. "
Server configuration describes how the parameters of a computer system or program are set up. These, in turn, can govern how traffic is routed and what happens to it within the system.
The sheer complexity of such massive networks can make it difficult to figure out what’s causing a problem, especially if it’s intermittent, said Sandy Bird, chief technical officer of computer security firm Sonrai Security. “I’m sure there were a lot of people up all night working on this. ”
Internet companies experience occasional outages, but this one was remarkable for its global spread and duration, lasting nearly 24 hours. The outage intermittently interrupted service on all of Facebook's apps, making it the worst outage in the company's history.
In an unrelated development, Facebook announced Thursday two key executives, including its chief product officer, were leaving the company. Chris Cox, one of Facebook's highest-ranking executives and one of its earliest employees who joined in 2005, and Chris Daniels, the head of WhatsApp, have resigned, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post.
Zuckerberg said he had no "near-term" plans to replace Cox. Daniels, who has run WhatsApp since the departures of the app's founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton over disagreements with Zuckerberg last year, is being replaced by Will Cathcart.
These are just the latest executive departures as Facebook grapples with a string of troubles, including Wednesday's marathon outage.
A Facebook outage in 2008 that lasted about a day affected many of its then 80 million users. Today, Facebook has about 2. 3 billion users who log into the service at least once a month. Facebook estimates that 2. 7 billion people use its various apps and more than 2 billion log into these services every day.
The problems began spreading Wednesday at about 11 a. m. EDT. Users reported service disruption around the globe, but the outage appeared to be most pronounced on the East Coast and in the U. K. , according to DownDetector, a service that monitors outages. Facebook said Thursday the problem was triggered by a change it made to its server settings on Wednesday.
Some Facebook users got a message that the service was down for maintenance. Others could log on but their news feeds were empty or they could not post updates. At times, updates from friends were visible but users could not comment or like them. On Instagram, profiles would not load. WhatsApp users reported not being able to send messages.
The service interruption had a substantial ripple effect, affecting access to some services where users log in with their Facebook credentials. Users of Oculus virtual reality devices also reported having problems.
Frustrated users flocked to complain on Facebook rival Twitter, where one of the trending topics on Wednesday was #FacebookDown.
This is not the first time server configuration changes have wreaked havoc and, given the complexity of these systems, it’s unlikely to be the last.
For a network as large as Facebook, resetting configurations is a delicate operation. Modern computer systems are built with “phenomenal amounts” of redundancy and self-healing embedded in them, Bird said.
That can mean that any small change can replicate across the entire network, creating a cascade of errors. “You can make one mistake and has consequences everywhere,” he said.
It’s not known what specific error occurred. It might have been something as simple as creating a rule that if a server is having performance problems, it restarts itself. But the system might interpret a server that’s in the process of restarting as experiencing poor performance, and shut it down again, creating a loop that spreads throughout the network.
“So the thing that’s supposed to self-heal things actually makes them worse,” Bird said.
Last November, some but not all users were hit with a 13-hour outage on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. At the time, Facebook said, “Earlier today, a server configuration caused intermittent problems across all apps globally creating a degraded experience for users. The issue has since been resolved, we are back to 100 percent for everyone and we’re sorry for any inconvenience. ”
Instagram announced early Thursday that service had been restored. At 12:41 a. m. EDT, Instagram alerted its users with a tweet that said, "Anddddd . . . we're back" accompanied by a jubilant gif of Oprah Winfrey.
The outage affected millions of advertisers who rely on Facebook and Instagram to connect directly with consumers. Brand marketers tweeted Wednesday that Facebook’s ad-buying system was also down. Facebook said Wednesday that it might offer refunds to some advertisers.
The downtime was likely very costly for Facebook. Facebook is projected to generate average daily revenue of about $189 million based on 2019 sales estimates, according to analyst estimates.
It was not the only bad news Facebook received Wednesday. The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that a New York grand jury has issued subpoenas as part of an investigation into Facebook’s consumer data-sharing deals with other tech companies including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Samsung.

Texto completo: BOSTON -- Two of the colleges caught up in a sweeping admissions fraud investigation said on Wednesday that they were considering disciplining students who were connected to the scheme. And the fallout from the case was just beginning.
Colleges where coaches were accused of taking bribes were reeling. Wealthy and well-known parents charged in the case were preparing to make their first appearances in court or were free on bail. And companies were distancing themselves from executives accused of paying a consultant to use bribes and deceit to raise their children's test scores or get them admitted to their chosen schools through athletic recruiting spots, despite their not being competitive athletes.
The University of California, Los Angeles, where the former men's soccer coach is accused of taking $200,000 in bribes to help two students gain admission, warned Wednesday that it might punish students whose applications contained misrepresentations, including by revoking their admission.
"If U.C.L.A. discovers that any prospective, admitted or enrolled student has misrepresented any aspect of his/her application, or that information about the applicant has been withheld, U.C.L.A. may take a number of disciplinary actions, up to and including cancellation of admission," the university said in a statement.
The University of Southern California, where three coaches and the senior associate athletic director were charged with taking bribes, said that it would reject any current applicants who are connected to the bribery scheme.
Wanda Austin, the school's interim president, also said that current students whose parents have been charged with paying the bribes would also be investigated. It is unclear how many current or prospective U.S.C. students are implicated.
These were the first indications that students themselves would face consequences in the scandal. While prosecutors have charged 33 wealthy parents, they have not charged any students. Andrew E. Lelling, the United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, described parents as "the prime movers of this fraud."
Also on Wednesday, several of the parents who were charged in the case appeared or were expected to appear in court.
The actress Lori Loughlin surrendered to F.B.I. agents in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning, a spokeswoman for the agency said. Ms. Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to get their two daughters accepted as recruits for the rowing team at the University of Southern California, even though neither took part in the sport. Mr. Giannulli was arrested on Tuesday and released on $1 million bail.
Ms. Loughlin appeared in court on Wednesday afternoon. Hours before, local TV crews were lined up on the sidewalk outside the Roybal Federal Building in Los Angeles. In the courtroom, wearing large glasses and a cream sweater, Ms. Loughlin looked calmly forward sitting behind a pane of glass. She glanced once at the reporters packed into the seats.
She agreed to post $1 million bond secured by her home. The judge allowed her to travel the continental United States and to the province of British Columbia for work projects, through December of this year with supervision. She was expected to be released Wednesday afternoon.
Other prominent parents were placed on leave from their employers or stepped down from other posts.
Gordon Caplan, a co-chairman of the global law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who is accused of paying $75,000 to have someone correct his daughter's answers on the ACT exam, was put on leave by his firm on Wednesday. Reached by phone, Mr. Caplan declined to comment.
William E. McGlashan Jr., a partner at the private equity firm TPG, was also placed on leave on Tuesday by his company. On Wednesday, he stepped down from the board of STX Entertainment, the film studio that he helped found with the film producer Robert Simonds. The news was shared in an internal memo sent to STX employees and reviewed by The New York Times.
STX is funded in large part by Mr. McGlashan's firm, TPG. STX said in the internal note that TPG remained committed to the studio, whose movies include the comedy "The Edge of Seventeen."
The central figure in the case, William Singer, a college admissions consultant based in Newport Beach, Calif., pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges in Boston on Tuesday and was released on bond.
The colleges where coaches were accused of taking bribes, a group that included the University of Southern California, Stanford, Yale, U.C.L.A. and Georgetown, have generally portrayed themselves as victims of the scheme. The coaches who were still employed at the schools when the charges were announced were all either fired or placed on leave.
Also on Wednesday, the University of Texas at Austin announced that it had fired its men's tennis coach, Michael Center, who was charged with taking a bribe of $100,000 from Mr. Singer in 2015 in exchange for recruiting a student who was not a competitive tennis player.
In a letter sent to the university community on Tuesday, Yale's president, Peter Salovey, wrote: "As the indictment makes clear, the Department of Justice believes that Yale has been the victim of a crime perpetrated by a former coach who no longer works at the university. We do not believe that any member of the Yale administration or staff other than the charged coach knew about the conspiracy. The university has cooperated fully in the investigation and will continue to cooperate as the case moves forward."
[Fifty people were charged in the widespread scheme to get undeserving students into colleges .]
The accusations against Mr. Singer, also known as Rick Singer, pose potential problems for the organizations behind the two most widely used college admissions tests, the SAT and the ACT, which most colleges weigh in evaluating prospective students.
According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer bribed test administrators and proctors to tamper with students' answer sheets, or in some cases to take the whole test in a student's place, to obtain the scores that were agreed in advance with the parents who paid him.
The conspiracy relied on the parents getting medical documentation that would entitle their children to extra time on the test, an accommodation normally made for students with disabilities. Students who need extra time generally take the test alone, supervised only by a proctor -- providing the opportunity for a bribed proctor to rig the outcome. Mr. Singer advised parents on how to get the medical documentation needed to qualify.
According to court filings, in a conversation with Mr. Caplan, Mr. Singer explained that for $4,000 or $5,000, a psychologist he worked with would write a report saying Mr. Caplan's daughter had disabilities and required special accommodations. He assured Mr. Caplan that many parents did this for their children.
"What happened is, all the wealthy families that figured out that if I get my kid tested and they get extended time, they can do better on the test," Mr. Singer said in the conversation. "So most of these kids don't even have issues, but they're getting time. The playing field is not fair."
Zachary Goldberg, a spokesman for the College Board, which administers the SAT, defended the extra-time policy. "The College Board considers all reasonable requests for accommodations -- such as large print, Braille, or extended time -- needed by students with documented disabilities," he said.
The board asks for documentation in some cases, Mr. Goldberg said, but in the "vast majority" of cases, the modifications are granted through the schools that students attend, where they are evaluated and given an individualized education program.
Mr. Goldberg said that the people who administer the SAT in schools, including test-center supervisors and proctors, are recruited and assigned by the schools.
"Deliberate misconduct by testing staff is rare and, if it does occur, can result in the staff member or even the school being barred from further testing," he said.
Mr. Goldberg said that the board had worked with law enforcement on this case, and that the arrests sent a message that "those who facilitate cheating on the SAT -- regardless of their income or status -- will be held accountable."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Commentary: Wells Fargo embarrasses itself again

Texto completo: Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan would have us believe he’s running a changed bank. How seriously we should take him is another matter entirely.
At a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday on the bank’s practices, one representative after another took their five minutes to blast Sloan and his bank’s business practices. But let’s give a hand to freshman Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., who elicited the most damning detail. She pointed out that the bank’s own lawyers say Sloan’s past statements indicating a commitment to restoring customers’ trust are mere “corporate puffery.” Sloan’s response? “I don’t know why our lawyers are arguing that.”
This is the second get for Porter in a short period of time - last week, she handed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Kathy Kraninger a calculator, and revealed to the world that the nation’s chief personal finance watchdog wouldn’t calculate or didn’t know how to calculate an APR, better known as an annual percentage rate, something vital to understanding how payday loans can negatively impact borrowers. This has not stopped Kraninger from beginning the process of rolling back protections on these dodgy, high-interest loans, making it easier for unscrupulous lenders to hide from financially desperate consumers what they are up against when they borrow such money.
Once upon a time, such answers, discoveries and failure to take responsibility by the people at the top of the decision-making food chain would have been a scandal with a capital S. But now, when Wells Fargo and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau critics are competing against what is the most corrupt presidential administration in modern history (not to mention the news that celebrities and corporate executives allegedly bribed their children’s way into elite colleges), the public barely noticed Sloan’s or Kraninger’s damning admissions. The most they got was a few moments of Twitter hate. This is, to say the least, unfortunate.
Remember, in 2016 Wells Fargo admitted that its employees, under pressure to meet absurdly unrealistic sales goals, opened up millions of fraudulent accounts on behalf of unknowing customers. Despite the fact Wells Fargo has since been fined billions of dollars by various state and federal regulators, and is operating with asset caps placed on it by the Federal Reserve, the bank, as a therapist might say, still has issues.
Within the past week alone, it has been revealed that Wells Fargo agreed to refund customers more than $17 million for selling them on high-fee mutual funds while neglecting to inform them about less costly options. (The firm was one of nearly 80 firms agreeing to repay more than $125 million to clients.) A New York Times investigation published Saturday detailed how bank employees are still challenged to meet sales quotas. This comes on top of such additional revelations as the fact that Wells Fargo improperly foreclosed on several hundred homes, and saddled unwitting customers with pet insurance.
Anything for a sale, I guess.
As for the CFPB, it was the subject of a semiannual review in the Senate on Tuesday, one taking place at the same time House members were grilling Sloan. The agency that once brought Wells Fargo to public attention is now, under the Trump administration, all but gutted. The anodyne personal advice it puts on Twitter cannot begin to compensate for the sharp reduction in its enforcement actions and fines against predatory financial actors.
One of Kraninger’s interrogators: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, who first proposed the CFPB. She told Kraninger, “If you had any decency, you’d either do your job or resign.”
It’s hard to disagree. Then again, if Kraninger had any decency, she probably wouldn’t have taken the position at all. When President Trump appointed her to the position last year, it was obvious that she lacked even a cursory knowledge of financial services — though that failing barely stands out in an administration where first son-in-law Jared Kushner is one of the top people on Middle East policy and daughter Ivanka Trump speaks out on tax policy.
The same lack of decency could be attributed to Sloan: After more than two years on the job, he either lacks control of his organization, is less than concerned about fixing its continuing problems or both. His performance Tuesday morning was so pathetic, even the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency chimed in, releasing a statement at the conclusion of the hearing saying it was “disappointed” in the company’s failure “to exercise effective corporate governance.”
But such critiques don’t seem to matter to Wells Fargo. If they did, surely the bank would have cleaned up its act by now.

Texto completo: The Mayor of Flavortown is coming to Aventura Mall, and he's bringing fried chicken with extra Donkey Sauce.
Food Network star and frosty-tipped chef Guy Fieri will open Chicken Guy! (yes, that exclamation point is real), a fast-casual fried-chicken joint inside the mall's Treats Food Hall this spring, replacing the short-lived deli Hank & Harry's.
Fieri, who's opening the chicken spot with restaurateur Robert Earl, spilled the news during a Saturday barbecue at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival.
Just how well Fieri's chicken shack will fare is anyone's guess, but the host of Food Network's "Diner's Drive-Ins and Dives" sure loves comfort food. No, really: Tune into any episode of his long-running travelogue series, and you may hear Fieri describe a greasy spoon as "off the hook" or "gangsta."
Comfort food at Chicken Guy! (Does anyone else hear a guitar riff after the exclamation point? Just us?) is handled simply, with a small menu featuring chicken tenders and 22 dipping sauces. Yes, that includes Donkey Sauce, basically a slurry of garlic, lemon, mustard and Worcestershire that Fieri has imported from previous restaurant concepts.
There are five "signature sandwiches," each stuffed with two tenders apiece, including the Bourbon Brown Sugar BBQ with pepperjack cheese, cole slaw, pickles and barbecue chips. (And yes, we checked: Nowhere on the menu are his chicken tenders described as "bomb-dot-com tasty," "funkalicious," or any other superlative.)
Despite his longrunning TV series, Fieri has over the years attracted a near-incomprehensible amount of hate on the internet, mostly for his platinum-blonde hair, flame-licked bowling shirts and catchphrases. A gut-punching 2012 New York Times review of Fieri's New York restaurant Guy's American Kitchen and Bar described the menu this way: "Why is one of the few things on your menu that can be eaten without fear or regret called a Roasted Pork Bahn Mi," the review asked, "when it resembles that item about as much as you resemble Emily Dickinson?"
Ouch. Still, there are Guy Fieri restaurants in 20 cities and four continents, and his empire is hardly slowing. The Aventura Mall location will be the first South Florida outpost of Chicken Guy!, which debuted in August at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World.

Texto completo: Award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, the first Latina to anchor a PBS “Frontline” report, will give the 50th Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture next month in Riverside.
Hinojosa is executive producer of “Latino USA,” a Peabody Award-winning program aired on National Public Radio. She has worked for CNN, PBS, CBS during a 30-year news career. Hinojosa’s 2011 “Frontline” report, called “Lost in Detention,” analyzed alleged abuse at immigrant detention centers.
Her topic will be “Latinos in the Media.” The free lecture is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday, April 9, in UC Riverside’s University Theatre. Reservations are suggested and free parking will be in Lot 6 on campus.
“This is a time of unprecedented emphasis on the Latino diaspora in the national media of the United States, and I look forward to the unique insights and rich historical knowledge that Ms. Hinojosa will be able to share with our UCR campus community,” UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox said in a UCR news release.
The lecture is named for Howard H “Tim” Hays Jr., the former longtime owner and publisher of The Press-Enterprise. His son, Tom Hays, created an endowment to ensure the lecture series continued after his father’s 2011 death.
Hinojosa will join the long list of journalists who have delivered the lecture. They include Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee and Marty Baron from the Washington Post, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, CNN President Tom Johnson, former Wall Street Journal Publisher Karen House, Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, former Los Angeles Times editor Davan Maharaj, and Ray Suarez from the PBS NewsHour and Al-Jazeera.
Hinojosa has won four Emmys; the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Reporting on the Disadvantaged; and the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club for best documentary for “Child Brides: Stolen Lives,” the release states.
She has been a syndicated columnist for King Features/Hearst and written two books: “Raising Raul: Adventures Raising Myself and My Son,” and “Crews: Gang Members Talk with Maria Hinojosa.” Hinojosa, born in Mexico City, was raised in Chicago.

Kari Ferguson, owner of Dickens Children's Books and Publishing Lab, sits in the reading area of her new bookstore in the Hough neighborhood. The stage area will also allow for puppet shows, live music performances and story time reading sessions.
Dickens includes a selection of children's stories on vinyl, as well as a publishing lab with typewriters, book binders and art supplies where kids can write and illustrate their own literary creations.
Dickens Children's Books and Publishing Lab is at 1911 Main St. in Vancouver's Uptown Village area. It is scheduled to open Friday.

Opening a new retail bookstore might seem like a risky venture in the era of Amazon, ebooks and online shopping, but Vancouver resident Kari Ferguson thinks she has a strategy to succeed: make the store a destination.
Her bookstore, Dickens Children's Books and Publishing Lab, is scheduled to open Friday on Main Street in Vancouver's Uptown neighborhood.
The shelves on the walls are lined with classic and contemporary childrens books, but visitors will also find a publishing lab where kids can create and assemble their own projects and a stage area for puppet shows, musical performances and, of course, regular book readings.
Ferguson, 34, said she's had a lifelong enthusiasm for childrens literature and was inspired to open a bookstore in Vancouver after realizing that the downtown area didn't have a kid-friendly place like Powell's Books in Portland.
She and her husband Jamund have two elementary school-aged kids and have lived in Vancouver's Hough neighborhood for about three years. They saw the vacant storefront at 1911 Main St. while out walking their dog, she said, and contacted the landlord in November to ask about renting it.
The 1,600-square-foot space is a former upholstery shop and shares a storefront design with the next-door antique shop.
“I think it'll be a good little walkable space,” she said. “It's kind of at the corner of three different family neighborhoods.”
The interior had been recently remodeled with hardwood floors and a fresh coat of paint, Ferguson said, so the biggest challenge was setting up the shelves and equipment, along with the books themselves. The books are all supplied by distributor Baker & Taylor, which buys the books wholesale from a catalog of publishers.
The windows are still covered with brown paper until the opening day, but on the inside, the windowsill is already filled with books and decorations for a St. Patrick's Day display, and most of the bookshelves have already been filled with classic titles.
“It's like Christmas, unpacking the books,” she said. “They're like old friends to me, a lot of them.”
The name Dickens is a reference to English author Charles Dickens, she says, and was chosen in order to give the business a short and memorable name that fit with a bookstore. The word can also be used in expressions to convey frustration or emphasis, which she said makes it a good fit for childrens literature.
The store's selection ranges from very early childrens illustrated books up to young adult novel book series like “The Hunger Games,” “The Hardy Boys” and “Nancy Drew,” and the collection places an emphasis on Pacific Northwest authors, Ferguson said. A table at the center also includes a collection of vintage childrens stories on vinyl.
Ferguson said she wanted to create an inviting space for kids that didn't feel cramped, so the majority of the store's shelves are located near the front window or along the southern wall, leaving a large open area in the center for childrens tables and chairs.
Nearly all of the books are set up facing outward so their cover art can be seen. Ferguson says her goal was to make the shelves more inviting to children rather than fitting in as many books as possible.
“Part of what makes childrens books so lasting is they're also artwork,” she said. “I wanted a space that kids could feel was really inspiring.”
Two tables on the northern wall form the publishing lab — a creative space with typewriters, art supplies and a booklet stapler and comb binding machine for kids to put together their own literary creations. The wall above has been turned into a mural featuring classic characters.
“It took us a good week or so to do that, working nights and Saturdays,” Ferguson said. “It would have taken way longer without support from the community and friends.”
A curtain near the back of the store hides a storage and workroom area, and the outer side serves as the backdrop for the performance stage, which includes a few rows of floor cushions for the audience. There's also a couch for parents.
A few other details hint at the store's intended purpose as an after-school hangout space. The cash register area includes a supply of snacks for sale, and Ferguson says she plans to host a story time event at 3:30 p.m. on weekdays.
There are also plans for a Kids Club program to provide regular access to the publishing lab, with an annual fee to cover the cost of restocking supplies.
Ferguson said she hopes the store can be a frequent host for workshops, holiday events and visiting authors and bands. She plans to kick things off with a St. Patrick's Day opening night party on Thursday featuring music, treats and Scottish highland dancing.
The total setup cost was about $30,000, Ferguson said, about half of which went to the books. The Fergusons have a three-year lease on the storefront and hope to pay off the startup costs in two years. Ferguson said she intends to run the store full time, with some help from volunteers.
“For now it's going to be me,” she said. “We're waiting to see how successful we are to see if we can hire people.”
Erica Thompson, communications manager at Visit Vancouver USA, said she thought Dickens would be a good fit for the area, and noted that the store has already been receiving a strong response on Instagram.
“I think they're really filling a unique niche that's not there yet,” she said. “Uptown Village kind of has an eclectic vibe on its own, so I think Dickens will only add to that feeling when you're walking up the street.”
There are a few other book retailers in Clark County, such as the Barnes & Noble near the Vancouver Mall and independent retailer Vintage Books on Mill Plain Boulevard in east Vancouver, but none in the downtown area apart from vintage comic store I Like Comics and the Christian Science Reading room near Esther Short Park. The downtown coffee shop and re-sale store Boomerang used to sell books, but scaled back to just a coffee shop last year.
Retail resurgence
Dickens is opening at a time when large brick-and-mortar bookstore chains have been in decline for years, with online shopping often blamed as a the culprit. A December 2017 New York Times story chronicled the demise of the chain Book World, and noted the Barnes & Noble had closed 10 percent of its stores since 2011 — the same year that its biggest rival, Borders, shut its doors.
But that doesn't necessarily spell doom for the Vancouver bookstore. In fact, independent bookstores are getting along surprisingly well in the internet age, and research suggests that many of them have thrived by taking the kind of personalized approach that Ferguson plans to employ for Dickens.
In 2017, the American Booksellers Association and a group of other trade associations released the results of a survey which found that the number of independent bookstores in the United States had increased by 35 percent from 2009 to 2015.
Ryan Raffaelli, an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, conducted a study to examine the resurgence. In a preliminary abstract released in November 2017, he explained that independent bookstores were initially hurt by the arrival of Amazon, and their numbers dropped by 43 percent from 1995 to 2000.
But the big box retailers suffered too, and Raffaelli's study highlighted several factors that allowed smaller stores to recover and ultimately expand again. In the mid-2000s, he found, many independent bookstores began to put a greater emphasis on unique and personalized shopping experiences, as well as frequent events that turned the stores into local convening spaces.
In a 2018 interview with NPR, Raffaelli said that independent bookstores have come to be viewed as a “mark of authenticity,” and are now sought after by developers in city center and community growth areas.
“It's clear that consumers have discovered that independent bookstores, along with our other Main Street businesses, offer incomparable value,” American Booksellers Association CEO Oren Teicher said when the 2017 survey was released. “The continued strength of independent bookselling reflects

Texto completo: Coons: Biden has more experience than "all other candidates combined."
U.S. Sen. Chris Coons said Monday morning he is "confident" Joe Biden is going to run for president and provided some insight into how the former vice president will run his 2020 campaign.
"I'm optimistic he's going to run," Coons, Delaware's junior senator, said on "CBS This Morning." "Everything is put in place but that last decision, which understandingly is a big decision."
Coons said Biden will have a "simple and positive message" during his campaign, which will starkly contrast with President Donald Trump. Coons said he believes Trump "exploits" divisions in this country.
"Joe Biden is someone who sees the divisions in our country and inspires us, reminds us in the ways we've overcome the past and will lift us up," Coons said. "I personally have witnessed him comforting and encouraging Americans who have suffered great loss.
"He knows how to get back up when knocked down."
Coons said Biden has more experience in the executive and legislative branch than "all other candidates combined."
The senator's words add to the swirling speculation that Biden will announce his campaign for president in the coming weeks. The New York Times reported last week that Biden's strategist Steve Ricchetti is telling Democrats the former vice president is 95 percent of the way toward deciding to run.
Biden is still leading in the polls. The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found that 27 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers say Biden is their first choice for president.
While this is a decrease from 32 percent in December, he's still ahead of the 19 other declared and potential candidates tested, the poll found.
News of people in Biden's inner circle leaving their jobs last week added to the speculation.
Biden's daughter Ashley announced she is leaving the Delaware Center for Justice at the end of March. She has served as the nonprofit's executive director since 2014.
The Delaware Center for Justice's director of operations, Kirstin Cornnell, said Ashley Biden told those at the center that she will focus on her business Livelihood, a charitable clothing line.
Cristobal Alex, head of the liberal Latino Victory Project, announced he was stepping down from his position and plans to join a presidential campaign. CBS reported that Alex plans to join Biden's campaign in a senior role.

For a growing number of Americans, socialism is OK

Texto completo: You wouldn’t expect democratic socialists to hit the brakes when it comes to social justice.
But in late February members of Inland Empire Democratic Socialists of America learned how to fix brake lights so they could offer that bit of auto repair service, for free, at an upcoming community event. Working tail lights, they reasoned, would mean fewer police traffic stops and, possibly, fewer fatal outcomes for people of color.
Auto repair is just one part of the chapter’s public outreach about an ideology that, increasingly, is finding a more receptive public audience. Polling shows more Americans, especially Democrats, view socialism more favorably than capitalism, even if they have sometimes wildly different ideas of what socialism is.
“It just doesn’t have the same stigma,” Kimberley Coles, a political anthropologist at the University of Redlands, said of the word “socialism.”
“It doesn’t mean there won’t be … rhetoric and seeing what sticks in terms of the insults.”
A Gallup poll from last summer found that for the first time in 10 years, Democrats had a more positive view of socialism (57 percent) than they did of capitalism (45 percent). That shift among Democrats drove down the overall view of capitalism.
“A majority of Americans have retained a positive view of capitalism over the past eight years, but this year’s 56% positive rating is by four points the lowest recorded since 2010,” Gallup reported. “Americans’ positive views of socialism have varied only between 35% and 39%, with (2018’s) reading of 37% right at the trend average.”
Gallup also found that among young people (ages 18 to 29) capitalism had slipped from 68 percent approval in 2010 to 45 percent approval last year.
Gallup isn’t the only pollster seeing that trend.
Thirty-one percent of Democrats in a YouGov poll from last August said they would be “comfortable” with a socialist presidential candidate, compared to just 8 percent for Republicans.
The same YouGov poll found 44 percent of Americans had a favorable view of capitalism, down from 52 percent in 2015. Americans age 18 through 29 are likelier to see the word “socialist” as a compliment while Americans age 65 and older are more likely to consider it an insult, although the 65-and-up group views socialism more favorably now (25 percent) than in 2015 (15 percent), according to YouGov.
Capitalism’s polling dip — and the corresponding rise in approval for the label “socialism” — coincides with ballot box gains by politicians who are connected with the political organization Democratic Socialists of America.
Running as Democrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib in 2018 became the first Democratic Socialists of America members to win congressional seats. Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected 2016 presidential campaign fueled an effort to turn the Democratic Party leftward, a trend that’s continued with Ocasio-Cortez’s celebrity status.
Nationally, Democratic Socialists of America had just 5,000 members prior to November 2016, but passed the 40,000-member mark following Ocasio-Cortez’s upset in New York’s June 2018 primary, according to published reports.
The organization’s Southern California connections include chapters in the Inland Empire, Orange County and Los Angeles. “Our chapter is continuing to grow and evolve from its humble roots,” the Inland chapter collectively wrote in response to emailed questions. “Fresh faces appear at every monthly member meeting.”
It’s not just about faces and personalities, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal for a Green New Deal, along with proposals from many candidates for universal health care, higher taxes on the rich and other socialist-favored ideas, figure to loom over the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It’s also already become a rallying cry — perhaps even the central theme — of Republican election efforts.
During last month’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump drew applause from supporters when he invoked socialism as a pejorative.
“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said before declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”
Fears of socialism “could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of (President Trump’s 2020) campaign that sounding the alarm about ‘criminal illegal aliens’ was in 2016,” The New York Times reported.
“Socialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Times.
Socialism replaced Hillary Clinton as the main villain at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which featured a “bread line” mocking Ocasio-Cortez.
“They want to take away your hamburgers,” former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka warned conference-goers. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”
What is socialism?
Americans fight not only over whether socialism is good or bad, but over what it means. Seventeen percent defined socialism as “government ownership of the means of production,” that was about half the number of Americans who used that definition of socialism in 1949, Gallup reported last October.
“Americans today are most likely to define socialism as connoting equality for everyone, while others understand the term as meaning the provision of benefits and social services, a modified form of communism, or a conception of socialism as people being social and getting along with one another About a quarter of Americans were not able to give an answer.”
The Democratic Socialists of America is “a ‘big tent’ organization,” the Inland chapter said. “Members may embrace a variety of tactics, theoretical frameworks, and emphases, but ultimately work toward a classless society undergirded by an economy in which production and the fruits of production are shared by all.”
To fight what the chapter sees as misconceptions – socialism is “inherently totalitarian” or a “mere matter of welfare state programs,” for example – members stress that socialism is organized from the bottom-up, outside of government, and that socialism emphasizes freedom, including “the ability of working people to resist the private tyranny of the firm and its owners,” the chapter said.
Socialism made Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, not the other way around, the chapter said. “Their ideas were popular because the moment was right for a socialist alternative, after a major recession, stagnant wages, and widespread discontent with the status quo.
“Our chapter as a whole is sympathetic to Bernie/AOC, but we seek also to hold them accountable to their promises, and members may find that their views do not completely overlap with theirs. This being said, among elected officials, their reform agenda is the closest in spirit to our movement …”
Besides fixing brake lights, the Inland chapter, which estimates it has 30 to 40 active members, also stumps for Medicare-for-all at events like Riverside’s monthly Public Arts Walk. It also hosts movie screenings with discussions afterward – “Sorry to Bother You” was a recent feature – and members have traveled to Mexico to help migrants at the border.
“A new idea”
Coles and Harold Clarke, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, think socialism’s surging popularity, especially among millennials, is rooted in recent history.
“Socialism’s kind of a new idea for them and it’s detached from a lot of the economics and brutal politics of the past,” Clarke said.
Millennials “aren’t shaped by Cold War politics, much less attachment to political parties,” Coles said. “They’re interested in a la carte political ideas, rather than being labeled as Republicans or socialist.”
They also grew up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when capitalism’s flaws “were highlighted in political rhetoric,” Coles added. “Socialism has historically always offered a critique of capitalism and highlighted the inequality of economic and political power.”
The Trump backlash also might be a factor. “With his hotel empire, numerous side businesses, and history of shortchanging employees and contractors, current President Donald Trump perhaps encapsulates capitalism at its worst … ,” Eillie Anzilotti wrote in an article about the Gallup poll results for Fast Company magazine.
She added that Trump alone likely doesn’t explain the drop in capitalism’s popularity, especially among young people. “Since the 1970s, wages (adjusted for inflation) have barely risen, while (the) cost of living has skyrocketed across the U.S. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners in America … has captured 85% of income growth that’s occurred since 2009.”
The uptick in socialism’s popularity could be a lasting trend, Coles said.
“I feel that these millennial voters are … more interested in learning from others (and are more) cosmopolitan in being willing to take ideas from lots of places,” she said. “It seems that people are interested in new ideas and socialism is offering one set of solutions.”

The organization’s Southern California connections include chapters in the Inland Empire, Orange County and Los Angeles. “Our chapter is continuing to grow and evolve from its humble roots,” the Inland chapter collectively wrote in response to emailed questions. “Fresh faces appear at every monthly member meeting.”
It’s not just about faces and personalities, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal for a Green New Deal, along with proposals from many candidates for universal health care, higher taxes on the rich and other socialist-favored ideas, figure to loom over the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It’s also already become a rallying cry — perhaps even the central theme — of Republican election efforts.
During last month’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump drew applause from supporters when he invoked socialism as a pejorative.
“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said before declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”
Fears of socialism “could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of (President Trump’s 2020) campaign that sounding the alarm about ‘criminal illegal aliens’ was in 2016,” The New York Times reported.
“Socialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Times.
Socialism replaced Hillary Clinton as the main villain at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which featured a “bread line” mocking Ocasio-Cortez.
“They want to take away your hamburgers,” former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka warned conference-goers. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”
What is socialism?
Americans fight not only over whether socialism is good or bad, but over what it means. Seventeen percent defined socialism as “government ownership of the means of production,” that was about half the number of Americans who used that definition of socialism in 1949, Gallup reported last October.
“Americans today are most likely to define socialism as connoting equality for everyone, while others understand the term as meaning the provision of benefits and social services, a modified form of communism, or a conception of socialism as people being social and getting along with one another About a quarter of Americans were not able to give an answer.”
The Democratic Socialists of America is “a ‘big tent’ organization,” the Inland chapter said. “Members may embrace a variety of tactics, theoretical frameworks, and emphases, but ultimately work toward a classless society undergirded by an economy in which production and the fruits of production are shared by all.”
To fight what the chapter sees as misconceptions – socialism is “inherently totalitarian” or a “mere matter of welfare state programs,” for example – members stress that socialism is organized from the bottom-up, outside of government, and that socialism emphasizes freedom, including “the ability of working people to resist the private tyranny of the firm and its owners,” the chapter said.
Socialism made Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, not the other way around, the chapter said. “Their ideas were popular because the moment was right for a socialist alternative, after a major recession, stagnant wages, and widespread discontent with the status quo.
“Our chapter as a whole is sympathetic to Bernie/AOC, but we seek also to hold them accountable to their promises, and members may find that their views do not completely overlap with theirs. This being said, among elected officials, their reform agenda is the closest in spirit to our movement …”
Besides fixing brake lights, the Inland chapter, which estimates it has 30 to 40 active members, also stumps for Medicare-for-all at events like Riverside’s monthly Public Arts Walk. It also hosts movie screenings with discussions afterward – “Sorry to Bother You” was a recent feature – and members have traveled to Mexico to help migrants at the border.
“A new idea”
Coles and Harold Clarke, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, think socialism’s surging popularity, especially among millennials, is rooted in recent history.
“Socialism’s kind of a new idea for them and it’s detached from a lot of the economics and brutal politics of the past,” Clarke said.
Millennials “aren’t shaped by Cold War politics, much less attachment to political parties,” Coles said. “They’re interested in a la carte political ideas, rather than being labeled as Republicans or socialist.”
They also grew up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when capitalism’s flaws “were highlighted in political rhetoric,” Coles added. “Socialism has historically always offered a critique of capitalism and highlighted the inequality of economic and political power.”
The Trump backlash also might be a factor. “With his hotel empire, numerous side businesses, and history of shortchanging employees and contractors, current President Donald Trump perhaps encapsulates capitalism at its worst … ,” Eillie Anzilotti wrote in an article about the Gallup poll results for Fast Company magazine.
She added that Trump alone likely doesn’t explain the drop in capitalism’s popularity, especially among young people. “Since the 1970s, wages (adjusted for inflation) have barely risen, while (the) cost of living has skyrocketed across the U.S. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners in America … has captured 85% of income growth that’s occurred since 2009.”
The uptick in socialism’s popularity could be a lasting trend, Coles said.
“I feel that these millennial voters are … more interested in learning from others (and are more) cosmopolitan in being willing to take ideas from lots of places,” she said. “It seems that people are interested in new ideas and socialism is offering one set of solutions.”

Flying tips for wheelchair users, from wheelchair users

Texto completo: People often say that traveling is all about the journey and not the destination, but for wheelchair users, navigating air travel is often more of an adventure than they would like.
Rolling through large crowded airports, hauling luggage, waiting in long lines, receiving a pat down, being strapped into a tiny aisle chair and then sitting for hours unable to move is exhausting. We've learned that the best way to circumvent some of the inevitable issues is to know what to expect, and prepare accordingly.
What to remember before you book
Before clicking the purchase button, even seasoned travelers should review the airline's policies regarding passengers with disabilities. John Morris, a triple amputee who has flown more than 850,000 miles in the past five years, writes about accessibility for his website Wheelchair-Travel. He discovered, after reading AirAsia's website, that he cannot fly with the airline because his battery-operated wheelchair weighs more than the airline allows.
When choosing a seat, Morris prefers a window to avoid being crawled over by other passengers. Other travelers, particularly those who cannot transfer from a wheelchair to their seat independently, may prefer the aisle seat. The roomier bulkhead seating might be an option for some, just be aware the armrests do not raise.
Also, keep in mind that wheelchair users exit the aircraft last. The deplaning process can easily take 25 minutes or more, so when booking a connecting flight, always allow ample time. Morris recommends a minimum of 90 minutes. Considering that quick layover might be your only opportunity to visit a restroom, those extra few minutes are precious.
After booking your flight, contact the airline at least 48 hours in advance of departure and let them know you will need special assistance. If you must change airlines, which can be common on international flights, be sure to notify them, too.
Avoid wheelchair damage
"The way the airlines treat our equipment causes some wheelchair users to not travel at all, and that breaks my heart," said Sylvia Longmire, a former U.S. Air Force officer who travels the world solo on her small power wheelchair. Longmire also writes Spin the Globe, an accessible travel website.
You can help prevent wheelchair damage by attaching written instructions explaining how to operate your chair, as well as how it folds and tilts. Before turning a wheelchair over to airport personnel, take off any removable parts such as the seat cushion, removable wheels and footrests. These items may be carried on the plane and do not count as baggage.
For your own baggage, carry as little luggage as possible. The airline's curb-side baggage check can be helpful if available, or consider purchasing a rolling suitcase designed to attach to a wheelchair.
Finally, always carefully inspect your wheelchair for damage when it's returned to you and immediately notify the airline if there is a problem. Document any damage you find with photos that you can send to the airline, as well to file a compensation claim.
How to navigate bathroom concerns
Many domestic flights are on single-aisle planes which rarely have accessible bathrooms onboard. Even though wide-body planes (those with two aisles) are required to have an accessible lavatory, the tight configuration doesn't work for many travelers with disabilities.
To avoid embarrassment, always confirm before departure that the plane has an onboard wheelchair. Flight attendants can push you to the bathroom. They do not assist with transferring to a toilet or providing personal care.
Better yet, consider that domestic airports are required to have accessible restrooms in all terminals; you will definitely be better off using the toilet before you depart. However, some small or older airports in the United States, and others abroad may not have them. Staff at the information desk in the airport can guide you to an accessible or family bathroom, or you can review the terminal layout on a nearby map or on your smartphone before you depart to find the closest accessible restroom.
Although it isn't healthy, Longmire stops eating and drinking the day before a flight. Other travelers might choose to use a catheter or wear protective undergarments.

Byron York: Yes, Trump is target of 'presidential harassment'

Autor: York, Byron. 

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 10 Mar 2019.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/byron-york-yes-trump-is-target-presidential/docview/2191434159/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: Ninguno disponible.

Texto completo: President Trump often complains that he is the victim of "presidential harassment" -- or, as he sometimes puts it, "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"

"Presidential Harassment by 'crazed' Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country," Trump tweeted on March 3. "After more than two years of Presidential Harassment, the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and others broke the law," he added later. "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again!" he tweeted February 7.

The president's adversaries of course dismiss his protests as self-interested whining. But the fact is, Trump has a point. He is the target of an extraordinary combination not just of federal law enforcement and congressional probes but a long list of less-discussed but potentially consequential investigations by state and local prosecutors and regulators.

Together, it adds up to a pile-on of unprecedented proportions -- by and large the work of blue-state Democrats who stand to gain politically if their investigations succeed in crippling the president
.
Recently the New York State Department of Financial Services, the agency that regulates the insurance business, issued what the New York Times called an "expansive subpoena" to Aon, the insurance broker for the president's companies. The agency leaped into action after former Trump fixer Michael Cohen told the House that Trump had at some point inflated his assets to an insurance company. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and faces serious questions about the truthfulness of his latest testimony, supplied no details.

None were needed. "The subpoena that was served on Aon contains no indication that the company or any of its employees engaged in misconduct," the Times reported. "Nor does it specify any possible wrongdoing that is the focus of the inquiry by state regulators." The subpoena demanded "a broad range of materials" related to Trump's dealings with Aon going back a decade, the Times said.

Also in New York, the State Department of Taxation and Finance announced last October that it is investigating Trump's taxes going back at least 20 years.

New York state officials have also filed suit against the Trump Foundation, which has agreed to dissolve as part of the investigation.

Speaking of state law enforcement, the recent New York Attorney General race was virtually a contest to see which candidate could vow to go after Trump the most aggressively. In her victory speech, new AG Letitia James said of Trump, "I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn."

Outside of New York, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia are suing Trump, accusing him of violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.

Then there is the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), based in Manhattan. Prosecutors there are said to be investigating the Trump Organization's finances; the funding of the Trump inauguration; and the funding of the Trump SuperPAC Rebuilding America Now.

The SDNY investigations hold a large place in the hopes of Trump opponents who fear Trump-Russia special counsel Robert Mueller might deliver an underwhelming report that does not make the case that Trump colluded with Russia to fix the 2016 election or that he obstructed justice in the aftermath. Indeed, a number of observers believe the SDNY probes pose a more serious threat to Trump than Mueller.

Does there seem something odd about that? In a recent email exchange, I asked Andrew Coan, a University of Arizona law professor who is the author of the book Prosecuting the President , whether there is precedent for a U.S. Attorney's office conducting a wide-ranging, open-ended investigation of a sitting president.

"The short answer is no," Coan responded. "I am aware of no comparable prior investigation."

The reason I asked was that it seems that the basis for the now-expired independent counsel law, and for special counsels that exist today, is that a president, when investigated, should be investigated in a specific way, and not in the normal course of business by federal prosecutors. Coan noted that a special counsel was appointed in Watergate on the rationale that "a U.S. Attorney could not be trusted to investigate the president who appointed him." Today, by all accounts, Coan added, SDNY prosecutors have pursued their investigation aggressively, but the appointment of another special counsel from outside the Justice Department "would provide some additional assurance that this investigation is not being influenced by political pressure."

By pressure, Coan meant pressure from the president. But in New York, there could also be the possibility of pressure created by the general atmosphere of resistance to a hated chief executive in a heavily Democratic state.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats have long viewed Trump's tax returns -- which he broke 40-year precedent by refusing to release -- as a sort of Holy Grail of Trump investigations. "We have to have the truth," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the election. Now, the House Ways & Means Committee is reportedly preparing to demand the Treasury Department turn over the returns. The demand is based primarily on suspicion that Trump must have done something wrong with his taxes or he would have long ago released the returns. If Democrats get the returns -- and that is not guaranteed given the expected legal fight -- it's likely they will start even more investigations.

Beyond that, there is the House Judiciary Committee's recent decision to demand documents from 81 people associated with Trump -- a request so wide-ranging that even some Democrats worry that their party's investigators have overreached.

"The extensive scope could bolster claims by Trump and Republicans that congressional Democrats are seeking to undermine the president and cripple his 2020 reelection effort rather than conduct a disciplined, fact-finding inquiry," the Washington Post reported. Yes, it could.

And all of that is apart from the Mueller probe and the Senate and House Trump-Russia investigations.

The point is, the scrutiny directed at the president from all sides -- not oversight of his administration or even investigations into his election -- so far exceeds anything in the past that it could well qualify as presidential harassment.

Democrats would no doubt respond that Trump is singularly corrupt, or that he brought it all on himself. He did not. What has happened is that Democrats, in Congress and in some key blue states, saw investigation as a way to weaken a president they never thought would be elected and want to ensure is not re-elected in 2020. And Trump, with the most extensive business history ever brought to the presidency, presented a lot of avenues of investigation. When he complains about harassment, he has a legitimate case to make.

Texto completo: News of a fresh threat to children exploded on social media last week. Local TV stations, police departments and school officials began warning parents about Momo, a grinning, bug-eyed monster said to appear unexpectedly in children's YouTube videos and instruct young viewers to engage in increasingly dangerous behavior - including self-harm and suicide.
There's no proof that Momo-spliced videos for children exist, or that the figure is linked to any real cases of self-harm or suicide. The photograph that warnings label as Momo actually depicts a spooky sculpture created by a Japanese artist and exhibited in a 2016 art show. (As if to sew things up even more definitively, the artist who made Momo has confirmed that the sculpture was destroyed some time ago after its rubber components began to degrade.)
But despite all signs of the phenomenon being a hoax, fear of Momo persists. In the New York Times, John Herrman observed that "screens and screen time are a source of endless guilt and frustration among parents today, and it makes sense to need to displace these feelings on a face, a character, and something, or someone, with fantastically evil motives.
That Momo is a convenient repository for the terror of contemporary parenting is almost certainly true - but I suspect there's something more timeless there, too.
Consider the context in which Momo has risen to prominence. At the moment, you can peruse a trifecta of new documentaries examining horrors committed against children: "Leaving Neverland, which explores the pedophilia allegations leveled against Michael Jackson; "Surviving R. Kelly, a deep dive into the rap star's alleged sexual abuse of young black girls; and "Abducted in Plain Sight, about an ordinary family's slow recognition of the years-long molestation of their daughter.
Meanwhile, as critics and viewers have pored over these films and what they tell us about our world, the Catholic Church has continued its very public, long-running reckoning with clergy sexual abuse.
What all of these episodes of child abuse share is parents' excruciating realization that they somehow delivered their children into danger - or failed to protect them. Onlookers tend to charge parents in these situations with stupidity, or negligence or even malice after the fact. But that all seems arrayed toward the cause of imagining that abuse could never happen to smart, vigilant, loving parents. And that simply isn't true.
One of the great anxieties of parenting - which no level of vigilance can fully allay - is that you will do everything you can to keep your child out of harm's way but ultimately fail to recognize a threat for what it is, or - worse - even invite it in. Harmful things can come in harmless guises, after all: beloved pop stars, trusted family friends, unassuming priests and perhaps cheerful YouTube videos marked for kids.
You can drive yourself crazy worrying about these hidden risks. But ultimately all you can do is what you're most likely already doing: Look closely, consider carefully, talk to your kids and be cautiously optimistic. There is, finally, quite a bit of good in the world - even in strangers, even on YouTube - and not as much bad as it often seems.

Texto completo: I went to an old friend's opera last weekend.
Plenty of guys in 1780s Vienna or 1890s Turin could probably say that, but to say that in 2019 Pittsburgh is the definition of a long shot.
Tommy Cipullo - excuse me, we're not in Mr. Mitchell's third-grade class, he's "Tom" Cipullo now - was down from New York for The Pittsburgh Opera performance of his "Glory Denied.'' That's the story of Col. Jim Thompson, held prisoner in Vietnam from 1964 to 1973. Col. Thompson came home to discover his wife, family and country had moved on and pretty much left all he had known behind.
It's powerful. It took Tom five years to write the words and music. A four-person cast of characters - the young prisoner Jim Thompson, the returned prisoner of war Jim Thompson, the young idealistic wife Alyce and the older, world-weary wife Alyce - bounce a woeful tale back and forth in times and places half a world away.
When it ended, I rose with about everyone else for a standing ovation March 1, at Pittsburgh Opera Headquarters in the Strip District, and had to bite my lip to keep from shouting, "My buddy did that!''
It was the third of four performances here, and "Glory Denied'' has had more than 20 professional productions in the past dozen years, from New York to Houston to Anchorage and points in between. There's a YouTube video of the late U.S. senator and prisoner of war John McCain plugging the opera.
Opera is surreal enough when you don't know the composer. But this was coming to me from the same guy who tipped me in eighth-grade shop class that I really ought to see the Marx Brothers on "The 4:30 Movie." I now owe him for two revelations.
Tom's libretto, based on the 2001 oral history of the same name by Tom Philpott, is nothing if not the language of 20th-century America, in all its anger, slang and charm. Baritone Benjamin Taylor delivered a catalog of all that changed in our country between 1964 and 1973, an operatic rap sheet that transfixed the small, packed theater of roughly 200 souls.
"Wasn't that brilliant?" Mr. Philpott asked, drawing applause in a post-opera question-and-answer session with the two Toms after the performance.
My friend recalled reading The New York Times book review of "Glory Denied.""Something said to me, 'This is an opera,''' and he immediately contacted Mr. Philpott.
"I didn't hear too much from him for the next three years,'' Mr. Philpott said, but my friend was hard at his task.
Mr. Cipullo and I were born in a lucky year. The Vietnam War raged when we were growing up, but the draft ended our junior year in high school as American involvement waned. That era shaped us nonetheless, and the oral histories of the Thompson family that Mr. Philpott collected and shared gave Mr. Cipullo all the words he needed.
"I'm not the librettist,'' Tom insisted. "I just use the words that [Mr. Philpott] got people to say."
My friend can wear his heart on his sleeve, and anyone could see he was moved by the production and the performances from resident artists Mr. Taylor, Terrence Chin-Loy (Younger Thompson), Ashley Fabian (Younger Alyce) and Caitlin Gotimore (Older Alyce).
"When you write an opera, you sit by yourself at a little table every night for years,'' Tom said. "For years. And you work on it. And then, sometimes if you're really lucky, you get to come see a production like tonight.''
Mr. Philpott told the crowd there is something about the choices Tom made, in the words and music, that intensifies the emotion of the stories he thought he knew fully.
"I wrote the book,'' Mr. Philpott said, "I interviewed all these people. But I learn more about them every time I see it.''
That's the power of art.
The afternoon after the show, I had lunch with Tom, his wife, Hedwig Brouckaert, and their 7-year-old daughter, Lois, in Oakland. They'd just toured the Carnegie Museum. Lois was hardly touching her green beans, but when Tom and I persuaded her to give us a Bugs Bunny "What's Up, Doc'' impression with a bean, she complied ably, and a few more beans disappeared.
That's the power of art, too.
I can't honestly remember if that first Marx Brothers movie Tommy recommended circa 1969 was "A Night at the Opera,'' but I'm not going to forget the night at the opera Tom provided a half-century later.

How to help regular people run for Congress

Texto completo: The financial burden of running for office is too crushing for anybody but the wealthy, says political scientist
Name someone in Congress who used to be a hotel housekeeper. Or a factory worker. Or a fast-food worker. Or an ironworker, receptionist or Walmart cashier.
If examples aren't coming to mind, there's a good reason. People from working-class occupations - manual labor, service industry work, clerical jobs - seldom go on to hold elected political office in the United States.
Working-class jobs make up more than half of the U.S. labor force. But according to my research, in most years since the start of the 20th century, there haven't been more than a dozen members of Congress with significant experience doing the kinds of jobs most Americans punch in for every day. (The figures are probably similar for the 19th century, but the data is less reliable.)
When the New York Times recently took stock of the career backgrounds of members of the 116th House, the newspaper identified a few "narrow but well-trodden paths through prestigious schools, lucrative jobs and local political offices." The analysis found 12 Democrats and four Republicans who had ever held working-class jobs. In short, white-collar government is an enduring, and bipartisan, feature of U.S. politics.
A new proposal on Capitol Hill could help address the problem. On Thursday, Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) introduced the first freestanding legislation designed to make running for federal office more accessible to middle- and working-class Americans: the Help America Run Act. (Porter also worked to include a similar provision in the Democrats' omnibus election-reform bill, H.R. 1.) Campaigning for federal office is a full-time job that lasts months, and most candidates have to quit their day jobs.
The bill would allow candidates to use campaign money to pay for such essentials as day care, health insurance and elder care. The proposal would provide practical help to non-wealthy candidates and signal that some members of Congress are aware that the population of political officeholders is skewed toward professionals, businesspeople and the independently wealthy - and that they are aware that this harms democracy.
The 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act usually bars using campaign funds for "personal use." Because candidates would have had to pay for pay for child care, elder care and health insurance whether or not they were running, they shouldn't be treated as campaign expenses, that law says.
The Federal Election Commission can waive this rule case by case, but the appeals process is difficult (a recent review by the House Administration Committee found only two candidates who have succeeded in the last 20 years), and candidates have to prove that they wouldn't have incurred the expenses if they hadn't campaigned. Last year, Liuba Grechen Shirley, a consultant who worked from her home on Long Island, successfully argued that she wouldn't have needed to pay for day care had she not run to represent New York's 2nd Congressional District, against Rep. Steve King (R). (She lost the election.) But had Grechen Shirley been working outside her home and paying for day care before she ran, she wouldn't have had a leg to stand on.
For the well-off, such rules are, at worst, an irritation. But they're a major hurdle for most working people. (Specifically, the Help America Run Act would allow candidates to count as campaign spending their health-care premiums - but not deductibles or other out-of-pocket costs - as well as payments for the supervision of relatives defined as qualifying dependents by the IRS.)
My research suggests the bill would help. I've spent the past decade studying the factors that discourage qualified working-class Americans from running for elected office, and one of the most common concerns they cite is the difficulty of making ends meet while campaigning.
Of course, if the legislation passed, many qualified potential candidates would still shy away from running for office because they wouldn't be able to cover other personal expenses - not least, groceries, rent and mortgages. Many would worry about not having a job to return to if they didn't win office. Others would be passed over by party and interest group leaders in favor of more-familiar white-collar candidates.
Still, the Help America Run Act, as essentially the first word on this topic, is historic. Until now, no legislation in Congress has acknowledged the economic gulf between our elected representatives and the people they are supposed to represent. When the bill notes in its opening paragraphs that "everyday Americans experience barriers to entry before they can consider running for office to serve their communities," it's breaking ground. When it warns that "everyday Americans who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable childcare, a safety net, or great public schools are less likely to get a seat at the table," it makes an important statement about what it means to create a government of and by the people.
The bill also serves as a model for state-level proposals (including in states such as Louisiana that are considering similar measures). It could even be a starting point for a larger conversation about how to give working-class Republicans and Democrats more of a voice in U.S. government. Another reform to consider might involve encouraging or requiring businesses to allow people to return to their jobs after running.
It took 230 years, but finally Congress is acknowledging that net worth is not a good indicator of someone's potential to be a strong public servant. That declaration is cause for celebration in itself. And if the Help America Run Act passes, someday soon Americans might be able to name a member of Congress who was once a hotel housekeeper.

Heedlessness contributing to deficits

Texto completo: Republicans hate deficits. Or at least that's what they claim.
Republicans in Congress spent the entire Obama administration inveighing against budget deficits, warning incessantly that we were going to have a Greek-style fiscal crisis any day now. Donald Trump, on the other hand, focused his ire mainly on trade deficits, insisting that "our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us."
But over two years of unified GOP control of government, a funny thing happened: Both deficits surged. The budget deficit has hit a level unprecedented except during wars and in the immediate aftermath of major economic crises; the trade deficit in goods has set a record.
What's the significance of this tide of red ink?
Let's be clear: Neither the budget deficit nor the trade deficit poses a clear and present danger to the U.S. economy. Advanced countries that borrow in their own currencies can and often do run up large debts without drastic consequences - which is why the debt panic of a few years ago was always nonsense.
Yet Trump's twin deficits tell us a lot about both the tweeter in chief and his party - namely, that they're both dishonest and ignorant.
About the dishonesty: Is there anyone left who believes that Republicans ever really cared about debt and deficits? 
In any case, at this point it's undeniable that their fire-and-brimstone debt rhetoric was nothing but a pose, an attempt to weaponize the deficit as a way to block and undermine President Barack Obama's agenda.
The moment they had a chance, the very politicians who grandstanded about the need for fiscal responsibility rammed through a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy - a tax cut that is the main reason for the exploding budget deficit.
What about the ignorance? As many people have pointed out to no avail, Trump is all wrong about what trade deficits do. True, at times of high unemployment deficits can cost us jobs. But in normal times they don't reduce overall employment, nor do they make us poorer.
On the contrary, other countries are sending us valuable goods and services, which we're paying for with pieces of paper - paper that pays very low interest rates. Who's winning, again?
In the Trumpian universe, trade deficits happen because we made bad deals - we let foreigners sell their stuff here, but they won't let us sell our stuff there. So the solution is to throw up barriers to foreign products. "I am a Tariff Man," he proudly proclaimed.
The reality, however, is that trade deficits have almost nothing to do with tariffs or other restrictions on trade. The overall trade deficit is always equal to the difference between domestic investment spending and domestic saving (both private and public).
The reason America runs persistent trade deficits isn't that we've given away too much in trade deals, it's that we have low savings compared with other countries.
Tariffs can, of course, reduce imports of the goods subject to the tariff, and hence reduce the trade deficit in that particular industry. But it's like pushing on a balloon: You can squeeze it in one place, but it will just inflate by the same amount somewhere else. 
Sure enough, the Trump tariffs of 2018 did, in fact, lead to a sharp fall in imports of the goods subjected to tariffs. But imports of other goods rose, while exports performed poorly. And the overall trade deficit went up substantially.
Trump also keeps insisting that foreigners are paying his tariffs. In reality, prices received by foreign exporters haven't gone down. Prices paid by U.S. consumers have gone up, instead.
Again, the swelling trade deficit doesn't pose any immediate threat to the U.S. economy. And even the Trumpian trade war has probably done only limited economic harm; the main damage is to U.S. credibility.

U.S. Women’s soccer team sues to get equal footing

Texto completo: Just over three years after the U.S. Women’s National Soccer team forced the 11th-hour cancellation of an international match at Aloha Stadium in a dispute over being required to play on artificial turf that they deemed unsafe, unequal field conditions were also cited in a class action gender discrimination lawsuit filed Friday.
On International Women’s Day, 28 members of the team filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleging field conditions as among the areas that the U.S. Soccer Federation, which also oversees the Men’s National Team, has discriminated against the women. Pay and travel were among other issues cited.
Hawaii became an early battleground in the WNT’s stand for equality in December 2015. The more this plays out the clearer it becomes that Aloha Stadium got caught in the middle of two disparate forces — an arrogant, discriminatory USSF and a WNT that began growing tired of second-class treatment and lip service.
The USSF has long been tone deaf or just plain dismissive of the WNT’s pleas for equality on so many levels, and one of them was being pushed to repeatedly play on artificial turf to an extent the MNT was spared.
The 25-page complaint Friday did not specifically refer to the December 2015 refusal of WNT to take the pitch against Trinidad and Tobago but noted, “The USSF has complete control over the surfaces i.e. grass, grass overlay or artificial surfaces such as turf, on which the national teams play their home matches. Playing on inferior surfaces, including artificial turf, can lead to significant career-threatening injuries. Such surfaces also affect fundamentals of the games, including the way the ball bounces and how the ball can be struck.”
The suit detailed, “For example, from Jan. 1, 2014 through Dec. 31, 2017, the WNT played 62 domestic matches, 13 (21 percent) of which were played on artificial surfaces. During the same period of time the MNT played 49 domestic matches, only 1 (2 percent) of which were played on an artificial surface.”
In addition, the suit also claimed, “The USSF arranged for natural grass to be installed temporarily over artificial surfaces for eight MNT domestic matches, including three venues where the USSF did not temporarily install natural grass when the WNT played in those same venues. The USSF provided a temporary natural grass overlay for the WNT only once during this same period.”
At the time of the cancellation here, a spokesman for the WNT’s Players Association told the New York Times, “I think women have made it clear, not just here, but around the world, that playing on artificial turf is just not acceptable. The women should not be subjected to playing on unsafe fields or under unsafe playing conditions. And artificial turf is unsafe.”
Let’s be clear here: The WNT, which has been more successful in recent years, deserves, at minimum, facilities, pay and travel equal to what the MNT gets. If the MNT gets its choice (grass), then the WNT’s preference should also be respected. It is basic — and overdue — fairness.
People here never misrepresented that Aloha Stadium was a built-for-football (and, at one time, baseball) facility where artificial turf has been the surface for decades. Versions of which the NFL, dozens of colleges, David Beckham and Pele have played on.
The problem in December 2015 was that the USSF callously continued to disregard the wishes and rights of the WNT and the women put their foot down. At the time, it cost fans in Hawaii a chance to see a world championship team.
Now, it may well cost the USSF much more.

Texto completo: The House on Thursday approved a resolution that was originally aimed at rebuking Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., for tweets many said were anti-Semitic.

But the final Democratic resolution passed by the House made no mention of Omar. Instead, it condemned anti-Semitism as "hateful expressions of intolerance," without saying who might have made such comments.

The final measure, offered by Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., also made a point of condemning many other forms hate speech.

But in January, when the House wanted to rebuke a Republican for reportedly asking how terms like "white nationalist" came to be seen as offensive, Democrats wrote a resolution that named King.

"Whereas, on January 10, 2019, Representative Steve King was quoted as asking, 'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization—how did that language become offensive?'" that resolution said.

King was the only House lawmaker to vote "present" on the resolution that rebuked Omar without naming her. Late Thursday, he was arguing that he never said the words about white nationalism that he was quoted saying in the New York Times.

"All evidence points to King never using the words quoted in the NY Times," he tweeted.

Texto completo: New York Times columnist David Brooks is endorsing reparations, compensation to descendants of slaves and victims of discriminatory government policies.

In a Thursday column, Brooks admitted that nearly five years ago he disagreed with Ta-Nehisi Coates’ article in The Atlantic on “The Case for Reparations.” But Brooks, who came to the Times in 2003 as a conservative columnist, wrote he sees reparations as necessary to make amends for past and ongoing discrimination.

“Slavery and the continuing pattern of discrimination aren't only an attempt to steal labor; they are an attempt to cover over a person’s soul, a whole people’s soul,” Brooks wrote.

“That injury shows up today as geographic segregation, the gigantic wealth gap, the lack of a financial safety net, but also the lack of the psychological and moral safety net that comes when society has a history of affirming: You belong. You are us. You are equal,” he continued.

The issue of reparations has already played a small part in the newly launched Democratic presidential primary contest, with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro claiming they support some version of reparations.

Brooks, who considers himself a moderate Republican, said he changed his mind on the issue after traveling the country and speaking with people, including an elderly African-American woman who said children in her neighborhood are in a worse position than she was as a child in 1953.

Healing fragmentation in American life requires “direct action, a concrete gesture of respect that makes possible the beginning of a new chapter in our common life,” he wrote.

Brooks acknowledged the difficulty in executing such compensation.

“Reparations are a drastic policy and hard to execute, but the very act of talking about and designing them heals a wound and opens a new story,” he concluded.

What should be front of mind for Minnesota lawmakers considering legalizing marijuana

Texto completo: In November 2016, California became the fifth state to legalize marijuana. Adults 21 and older were able to use, carry and grow marijuana. Legal recreational sales were added to existing medical marijuana.
A new job in California provided me an opportunity to observe the first year of legalization. The first day of legal sales of recreational use coincided with my arrival, this followed 20 years of medicinal marijuana in the state. In this essay I provide my observations of what should be front of mind for Minnesota policymakers.
These observations are provided through my own biases as a public health scientist with a background in tobacco control.
1. Any legislation should provide a net benefit for the population.
At the very top of my agenda is the inclusion of public health in the discussion of legalization. And while we can agree prohibition has created huge injustices, let us not pretend that consuming marijuana has no risks. There should be a hard distinction against any assumption that legalization is an endorsement of freedom from risk.
We know enough to be cautious. Cannabis use disorder is a harmful consequence of compulsive use; addiction is a real concern for 1 of every 10 users, with increased risk for those who start using in their teens. In addition, there are adverse side effects and the risk of psychosis, perhaps linked to high levels of THC.
What should Minnesota do? If legalization is a net benefit, then strict regulations should be created to manage the marijuana industry. Minnesota should also adapt and update policies over time.
2. A plan should be created to reduce harms and unknown consequences.
For the past year, marketing messages on billboards have promoted cannabis products as wellness for the whole family. In this case the sell was for Cannabidiol oil or CBD, the non-intoxicating industrial extract from hemp plants. This was followed by online ordering and delivery; next up will be indoor cannabis lounges similar to the Amsterdam coffee shops with pot for sampling.
What should Minnesota do? If marijuana prohibition was a disaster because minorities were the target of detention and jail for marijuana offenses, the course correction of unfettered business marketing is not the answer. A plan should imagine future needs for drug treatment, for stronger prevention programs in schools, and research needs — for example, how to test driving under the influence.
3 . Just like Big Tobacco, the marijuana industry cannot be trusted.
There will be an even bigger flood to market of products as the industry establishes the use of CBD/THC as routine and personalized with brand endorsement from celebrities. To create a level of respectability, the marijuana industry will cultivate a language of cannabis designed to ease our concerns (see Thomas Fuller’s piece in the New York Times, October 2018).
What should Minnesota do? Minnesota should carefully consider whether the market should be wide open to all possible products despite limited evidence. Descriptions like CBD-rich therapeutic products should be challenged.
4. Just like tobacco, marijuana cannot be smoked or vaped in public places.
In California you can consume marijuana on private property but smoking, eating or vaping is banned in public places. Anywhere tobacco is prohibited applies to marijuana. As I commute from Berkeley to Oakland, there are hotspots where the distinctive smell is omnipresent, much like the other big cities where marijuana use is legal.
What should Minnesota do? Public policy should be on the side of the greater public good and resist a wide open normalization of cannabis use. Trading marijuana smoking as a replacement for tobacco smoking would be a poor policy solution. Smelling secondhand marijuana smoke is a common complaint that can be prevented. All smoking should be banned in public places and there should be significant enforcement.
5. Products must be sold in marijuana-only retail stores.
If legal cannabis businesses are following state regulations and paying their taxes, then illegal operations cannot be allowed. To ensure that only legal entities can promote themselves to consumers a business state-­issued license number must be included in ads.
What should Minnesota do? Minnesota should manage the location, type, and density of retail locations. Sampling should not be permitted, and other locations — such as liquor stores and convenience stores — cannot sell marijuana.
6. P reventing sales to under 21 must be strictly enforced.
There is significant consensus in the public health community and likely in the general public that young people should avoid trying tobacco and marijuana. Age 21 has emerged as the preferred age that prevents younger age use.
What should Minnesota do? Minnesota should harmonize tobacco and marijuana laws to restrict use to those 21 and older.
7. A portion of excise taxes should be appropriated for treatment (1 percent), research (1 percent), and prevention (1 percent).
California has a marijuana excise tax of 15 percent, but additional local taxes could increase to 45 percent. A segment of California adults and tourists appear content to stay in the legal market (reported first year marijuana tax revenue was $345 million), but a large illegal market remains.
What should Minnesota do? Tax policy must consider not just revenue, but also preventing young people from starting, encouraging substitution for more dangerous drugs, and reducing the illegal market. Minnesota should be pragmatic and start with a tax similar to Oregon with a cap on excise taxes of 10 percent for the state and 10 percent for local tax. But the real need is dedicated taxation for treatment, prevention, and research. The law should allocate a modest 1 percent to each of these areas as a part of the plan to mitigate expected harms from increased use of marijuana.
8. T HC potency should be limited to reduce harm.
One of the tough decisions will be potency, which is a measurement of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC; or THC), and ultimately the concern is the rising ratio of THC/CBD. Current THC levels continue to increase as cultivators breed strains with higher levels (eg. THC/CBD ratio 18:1). New research suggests potency is a significant concern with increased admissions to drug treatment associated with increasing THC levels over 16 years of study in Europe.
What should Minnesota do? Minnesota should rely on established science to guide policy. The 2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found evidence supporting treatment of cancer patients for nausea, for example. But little evidence to support the use of CBD except for seizures (Epidiolex is the first FDA-approved cannabis-derived drug in the US).
9. Implement an equity permit program to minimize barriers to licensing for residents who are victims of the war on drugs.
Los Angeles has implemented a cannabis social equity program, which is described as “equitable ownership and employment opportunities in the cannabis industry in order to decrease disparities in life outcomes for marginalized communities and to address the disproportionate impacts of the war on drugs in those communities.”
What should Minnesota do? Minnesota should provide local control after legalization. In California, the law permits dual control where local municipalities can decide whether or not to issue a retail license.
10. R eserve the right to revisit this playbook for marijuana legalization as more evidence is available.
It is possible to move toward a correction of criminal injustices for communities that were harmed by marijuana laws, but we are charged with completing that task with eyes wide open to the known and unknown risks of marijuana use. If Minnesota legalizes marijuana then policymakers should adopt smart and strong public policy that protects the population while allowing consumption by adults.
Raymond Boyle, Ph.D., is a public health scientist living in Berkeley. Before California, Boyle was the director of research for ClearWay Minnesota, a tobacco control organization. He has spent most of his career conducting tobacco control research in Minnesota and has published more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific papers.

HICKENLOOPER'S SECRET WEAPON HE'S UPBEAT, AFFABLE, FORGIVING, A LISTENER - IN CASE DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING FOR AN ANTI-TRUMP

Texto completo: John Hickenlooper's boots weren't made for hiking.
Were they even boots? We couldn't decide. They occupied some limbo between boots and shoes and were all wrong for the trek that our group of six was taking: seven hours, about 10 miles, over a 12,500-foot-high pass in Colorado's Rocky Mountains.
Just a few hours in, he briefly took them off. Dear God. Blisters, blood: Just looking at his feet hurt. But he waved away our concerns, did some crude bandaging, switched into a pair of ordinary sneakers that he happened to have in his backpack and insisted that we press on. He walked more slowly, sure. But he smiled to the end.
That episode, from August 2015, captured Mr. Hickenlooper at his best: upbeat, affable and allergic to drama. For November 2020, could that kind of disposition be the ticket?
So much analysis of the Democratic presidential hopefuls characterizes them in ideological terms: left versus center, idealism or pragmatism, the revolutionaries and the incrementalists. So much is about gender, race and age.
But we should also look at these candidates in terms of the fierceness of their rhetoric and the sharpness of their edges. Do we want a livid warrior or a happy one? Someone eager to name and shame enemies, the way Donald Trump does, or someone with a less Manichaean outlook? Someone poised to reciprocate Mr. Trump's nastiness or someone incapable of it?
I'm not entirely sure which type is more likely to defeat him. But I know which gives us a better chance at healing America - if that's possible - and moving us past a juncture of crippling animosity. It's the type that Mr. Hickenlooper represents and maybe even exemplifies.
He jumped into the race Monday as a long shot with limited name recognition. But he has a biography and a résumé that warrant attention. He didn't enter politics until his early 50s, after a hugely successful career in beer - in brew pubs, to be exact. And he talks, persuasively, about what a customer-service business like that taught him about courting people rather than confronting them, about pacifying instead of inflaming.
As the mayor of Denver from 2003 to 2011 and then the governor of Colorado from 2011 until the start of this year, when he left office because of term limits, he was known for swearing off negative political ads, for gravitating away from divisive issues and toward whatever common ground he could find, and for a style with substantial measures of goofiness and geekiness but barely a pinch of truculence. That said, he marshaled toughness and persistence - as he did on that hike - to build a light rail system in Denver, expand Medicaid in Colorado, enact gun control and tug the state from recession to boom times that were the envy of other governors.
He has detractors who say that he can be more self-consumed and prickly in private than in public. And it's unclear whether he can project the authority and sense of purpose on the national stage that are crucial for a successful presidential campaign and presidency. It's unclear, too, whether a Democrat with a record as moderate as his has a chance in the party's primaries.
I've known him since late 2010, when I traveled to Denver to do an in-depth profile of him for The New York Times Magazine. Afterward we became friendly, which isn't surprising. In contrast to Mr. Trump's demonization of the media as the "enemy of the people," Mr. Hickenlooper usually takes the view that if he's open to and trusting of journalists, he'll be treated fairly more often than burned. There's an endearing generosity of spirit in that.
Mr. Hickenlooper and his first wife, the journalist Helen Thorpe, divorced during his first term as governor, but did so with such grace and good will that she dedicated her 2014 book, "Soldier Girls," to him. At her big Denver reading, he sat in the front row.
And I remember a dinner years later at the Denver home belonging to him and his second wife, Robin Pringle, when he happened to spike a fever shortly before we eight guests arrived. He nonetheless hung in there, bantering with us for hours as if nothing was wrong.
Optimism, warmth and joy matter. They propelled Ronald Reagan to the presidency. I think they're even a small part of the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez phenomenon - the part that leavens the stridency and purity tests. She has a wide, dazzling smile. In a video that went viral, she dances.
Some of the Democrats who are pursuing or seriously considering presidential bids are better at dancing, metaphorically speaking, than others. It doesn't come easily to Bernie Sanders, which is why he added all that poignant family history to his big speech on Saturday, or to Elizabeth Warren, which is why she sipped a beer in an Instagram video that was part of her rollout. It's effortless for Beto O'Rourke. It's present in Cory Booker. It comes and goes with Kamala Harris, who's still calibrating her temperature.
Mr. Hickenlooper sees a sunny approach - one that emphasizes aspirations over grievances - as the necessary balm for a grossly divided country and the most potent antidote to Mr. Trump. In a phone conversation Tuesday morning, he said that when the president pursues "these relentless accusations against all manner of people, he's not just attacking those individuals. He's also attacking all the people who admire those individuals and feel those individuals represent them."
"It's early in the campaign, so it's hard to assess whether it's going to be something that I have to work around or something that really attracts people - the fact that I focus on trying to create a context that's less adversarial," he told me. "I'm not trying to prove why I'm right or the other side is wrong. I'm trying to really listen to people."
I'll dance to that, whether I have the right footwear or not.

Manning May Be Jailed for Silence on Stand

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who sent archives of secret military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks in 2010, said on Thursday that she had refused to answer questions about her interactions with the antisecrecy organization before a grand jury -- and might be sent to jail as soon as Friday.
Ms. Manning had been imprisoned for about seven years before President Barack Obama commuted most of the remainder of her 35-year sentence in 2017, and she was released from a military prison in May of that year. Her defiance of the subpoena means she may be imprisoned again after a judge holds a closed hearing about her legal arguments and whether to hold her in contempt of court.
"The court may find me in contempt and order me to jail," she said in a statement, adding: "In solidarity with many activists facing the odds, I will stand by my principles. I will exhaust every legal remedy available. My legal team continues to challenge the secrecy of these proceedings, and I am prepared to face the consequences of my refusal."
Ms. Manning also confirmed that -- as widely suspected -- prosecutors wanted to ask her about WikiLeaks. Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia have been investigating the organization for years, and inadvertently revealed last year that they had charged its leader, Julian Assange, under seal.
"All of the substantive questions pertained to my disclosures of information to the public in 2010 -- answers I provided in extensive testimony, during my court-martial in 2013," Ms. Manning said.
Prosecutors had bestowed legal immunity on Ms. Manning for her testimony, she said, but she responded to each question by saying she refused to answer because it violated her constitutional rights.
It had not been clear what the charge against Mr. Assange, who has been living for years in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid arrest, pertained to: WikiLeaks' role in publishing leaked, classified documents, or its role in publishing the Democratic emails stolen by Russian government hackers during the 2016 presidential campaign.
The disclosure that prosecutors are newly refocused on Ms. Manning's early interactions with the organization indicates that the case most likely relates to the publication of classified information -- a case that would raise novel First Amendment issues. The Obama administration had weighed charging Mr. Assange in connection with Ms. Manning's disclosures, but decided against it over fears of chilling investigative journalism.
After Ms. Manning disclosed her subpoena to The New York Times last week, The Daily Beast reported that David House, an activist and member of a support network for Ms. Manning during the 2010-11 era of legal and activist wrangling over WikiLeaks' publication of her leaks, had been granted immunity and testified last year before the same grand jury about his interactions with the group.
Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, declined to comment.
Judge Claude M. Hilton, who was appointed to the Federal District Court in that district by President Ronald Reagan in 1985, will decide whether to accept Ms. Manning's arguments for why she had a right to refuse to answer the questions or to send her to jail.

Texto completo: A brash working-class bloke gets a new job in a new town, wages a calculated campaign to seduce and marry the local tycoon's daughter, entangles himself in a passionate affair with an older woman, and finally gets what he wants -- with nearly everyone living unhappily ever after.
On the 60th anniversary of "Room at the Top," it's worthwhile to recall how and why this British movie shocked and excited its original audiences. A first feature by Jack Clayton from a best-selling debut novel by John Braine, it opens for a week at Film Forum in a 4K restoration that puts a new sheen on master cinematographer Freddie Francis's grimy black-and-white images.
Joe Lampton (Laurence Harvey), the film's antihero, is a ferocious go-getter from a humble background who takes a job in a North England town controlled by the local industrialist. Single-minded and predatory, he sets his sights on the naïve heiress Susan Brown (Heather Sears), while recklessly pursuing the worldly wise but unhappily married Alice Aisgill (Simone Signoret). The heat generated by the affair fuels the movie.
Joe's bluntly articulated class resentment notwithstanding, "Room at the Top" is quite conservative in its morality -- although its sledgehammer ending still packs an emotional wallop. The movie was popular with British audiences but, as noted by the film historian Alexander Walker, many reviewers were offended by its explicit dialogue and situations. There would seem to be a political subtext as well. Given that Joe was a sergeant in the R.A.F. during World War II and supposedly in his mid-20s (making Alice a shockingly old 35), the movie appears to be set around 1950 -- a period when Britain's postwar Labour government put the nation's old boy network on the defensive.
Longing for adult fare and quick to note parallels with Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy," critics in the United States were more enthusiastic than their British counterparts. "The cynical, disenchanted and footloose postwar youths of England, who justifiably have been termed 'angry,' never have been put into sharper focus," A.H. Weiler wrote approvingly in The New York Times. Citing the movie's "maturity," the New Republic critic Stanley Kauffmann praised it as "a rare event among English-language films."
Evidently, the French thought so too. "Room at the Top" was well-received at Cannes, where Signoret (a French national) won an award for best actress; the influential critic Georges Sadoul called it "undoubtedly the most significant British film of the '50s." With its vivid Northern locations (and accents) and sexual frankness (Joe and Alice making love midafternoon in a borrowed flat), "Room at the Top" ushered in a new era of British naturalism -- the so-called kitchen sink cinema of the 1960s, characterized by provincial working-class protagonists and drab industrial settings.
"Room at the Top" was nominated for five Oscars and received two, for best adaptation and best actress. Not everyone was pleased. The gossip columnist Hedda Hopper was particularly irate that Signoret, a well-known leftist, had been so honored. "Let her decorate her mantel with Picasso doves and the like," she wrote. "I got so mad, I upped and resigned from the Academy." That, presumably, created a bit more room at the top.

New Betty Carter album arrives 27 years after original performance

Texto completo: Blue Engine Records, Jazz at Lincoln Center's exclusive record label founded in 2015, will be releasing a 1992 performance by jazz composer, singer and general force of nature Betty Carter March 29. The label releases archived recorded performances from Jazz at Lincoln Center dating back from 1987 in conjunction with R. Theodore Ammon Archives and Music Library and JLC's managing and artistic director, Wynton Marsalis. According to Wynton Marsalis.org, these recordings are being released "with a vision to build a comprehensive library of iconic and wide-ranging compositions that, taken together, make up a canon of music."
NPR Music reported that at "...61. when she took the stage at Aaron Davis Hall in New York for 'The Music Never Stops' March 29,1992... it was a concert of grand, unabashed ambition, celebrating Carter's magnificent prowess in the context of a specially assembled big band with strings, as well as three all-star rhythm sections."
The album is named after the performance, "The Music Never Stops," where Carter's orchestra included Robin Eubanks, Art Baron, Jerry Dodgion, Alex Foster and Lew Soloff, pianists John Hicks, Geri Allen and Cyrus Chestnut, bassists Lisle Atkinson and Ariel Roland, and drummers Kenny Washington, Greg Hutchinson and Clarence Penn.
In an archived live music review from The New York Times in 1992, critic Stephen Holden writes, "During the intermission-less 90minute event, the singer and her musicians attempted to keep the music continuous, right down to Ms. Carter's singing the introductions and segues to most of the selections. Athough she did pause once or twice to make remarks, the music was for the most part unbroken. The idea of musical continuity gave the evening a natural sense of thematic ebb and flow, with songs about goodbyes forming an expressive nucleus.
"One reason Ms. Carter, who is 61 years old, is probably better equipped than any other leading jazz singer of her generation to improvise with a big band is that her phrasing and intonation are so purely instrumental in sound. Nobody shapes a ncte the way she does, slowly turning it from a rich hornlike timbre into something bitingly twangy, then softening it again."
This album is an essential album to own for avid Betty Carter fans and for new listeners who want to expand their knowledge of women in jazz.

Texto completo: The following CORRECTION/CLARIFICATION appeared on March 8, 2019. The History Boys" is not part of the Pittsburgh Public Theater's 2019-20 season. It was incorrectly listed Thursday among the plays for the season.
Pittsburgh Public Theater's second season under artistic director Marya Sea Kaminski mixes popular late 20th-century fare with the new guard of the past five years.
There's also something brand-new and familiar coming in December: The O'Reilly Theater will open its doors to all-day "Yinzer Yuletide," including family fare and shopping by day and late-night events with live music. Rick Sebak and other Pittsburgh celebrities will also be on hand for the festivities.
Reaching to the not-too-distant past, the season includes the rock musical "Little Shop of Horrors," Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park," and, opening the season, Aaron Sorkin's "A Few Good Men."
For up-to-the-minute works, there's "School Girls; Or, the African Mean Girls Play," which recently finished an encore run at the off-Broadway MCC Theater in New York. The play won the 2018 Lortel Award for best play and was a New York Times critics' pick.
"American Son," which recently wrapped on Broadway and is Hollywood-bound, also is headed to Pittsburgh. The season ends with "The Cake," a sweet new play by Bekah Brunstetter, a writer on TV's "This Is Us."
"For our 45th anniversary season, we want to fill the O'Reilly with laughter, music and compelling stories that both delight and inspire us," Ms. Kaminski said in a statement. "It's going to be a dynamic year, with shows that strike a balance between muscle and heart, power and justice, the sweetness and sting of young love."
PITTSBURGH PUBLIC THEATER'S 2019-20 SEASON
* Sept.12-Oct. 13: "A Few Good Men" by Aaron Sorkin - Get ready to be told: "You can't handle the truth!" The story about military lawyers defending two U.S. Marines accused of killing a fellow Marine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba is set in 1986. It's Mr. Sorkin before he took TV by storm with the "The West Wing" and returned to Broadway this year with "To Kill a Mockingbird."
* Nov. 7-Dec. 8: "School Girls; Or, the African Mean Girls Play" by Jocelyn Bioh - The first-generation American writer, whose parents emigrated from Ghana, has created a comedy inspired by her mother's experience in an elite boarding school, circa 1986, as students prepare to enter the Miss Ghana pageant and a chance to be Miss Universe. Paulina, queen bee of the in-crowd, assumes she'll win. The award-winning play had two sold-out runs off-Broadway last season and was tagged as "a gleeful African makeover of an American genre" by The New York Times.
* Dec. 12-22: "Yinzer Yuletide," a special event to "make the Public your holiday hub" - According to the press release, "For two weeks in December, the O'Reilly Theater will become a new holiday destination for festive entertainment and unique shopping. From honoring the department store window displays of the past to decking every corner of the building for mingling and jingling, there will be something for everyone. Parents can bring their kids for daytime films and holly jolly mascots, while the cocktail crowd can stop by late-night for frosty beverages and live music."
* Jan. 23-Feb. 23, 2020: "Little Shop of Horrors" with book & lyrics by Howard Ashman, music by Alan Menke - Suddenly Seymour is growing an odd and exceedingly bloodthirsty horticultural find. The harrowing comedic musical "became a monster hit" for the writing team that went on to write "The Little Mermaid" "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast" for Disney.
* March 5-April 5, 2020: "American Son" by Christopher Demos-Brown - Kendra, a black woman and a professor of psychology, and her estranged husband, Scott, a white FBI agent, come to a Miami police station at 4 a.m. because their son, Jamal, 18, is missing. All that the rookie cop on duty will tell them is that Jamal has been "identified in an incident." The play explores the factors when a young African-American man intersects with law enforcement.
* April 23-May 24, 2020: "Barefoot in the Park" by Neil Simon - How long can the honeymoon last after a mismatched newlywed couple move into their first New York apartment? "Barefoot" was Neil Simon's first success, premiering on Broadway in 1963 and running for nearly four years. "Our revival of this bubbly romantic comedy will prove that young love never goes out of style," the Public promises.
* June 4-July 3, 2020: "The Cake" by Bekah Brunstetter - When Jen returns to her North Carolina hometown from New York and announces that she's planning her wedding, bakery owner Della can't wait to make the cake. That is, until she finds out that Jen is marrying another woman. Gay and straight, Brooklyn and the Bible Belt, sex and shame are just some of the ingredients stirred into this new comedy.

Texto completo: "For the People" returns to ABC. And prep for "Captain Marvel" with a DC competitor, "Wonder Woman," on HBO Signature.
What's on TV
FOR THE PEOPLE 10 p.m. on ABC. What does justice look like for a swatter? The swatting phenomenon, in which video game players lure SWAT teams to one another's doorsteps with false emergency calls, is partly the subject of this legal drama's Season 2 premiere. Allison Adams (Jasmin Savoy Brown), a lawyer and one of the legal whippersnappers introduced in the first season, is defending a teenager whose SWAT prank leads to the death of a senator. The series at large, created by Paul William Davies (a writer for "Scandal"), gives a multidimensional view of fictitious lawyers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. It follows their cases and sex lives with equal gusto.
WONDER WOMAN (2017) 6:35 p.m. on HBO Signature. When the Brie Larson-led superhero origin story "Captain Marvel" is released on Friday, it will be in good company thanks to this DC-Warner Bros. adventure, which broke a superhero glass ceiling last year by being the first movie in the genre in over a decade to be led by a woman. Gal Gadot stars as the Amazonian princess-turned-superwoman; how that transformation happens is the focus here. (It involves World War I, a spy played by Chris Pine and one very cool sword.) In his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film "feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like ... what's the word I'm looking for? A movie. A pretty good one, too."
What's Streaming
IRON MAN (2008) Rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The above pairing of "Captain Marvel" with the rival DC Comics-born "Wonder Woman" might be considered treason by loyalists to the Marvel Cinematic Universe -- that ever-ballooning franchise of superhero movies that includes Marvel and Disney collaborations like "Captain Marvel," "The Avengers," "Guardians of the Galaxy" and "Black Panther." To stick within the Marvel world, revisit "Iron Man," the first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie was hardly a modest beginning; "Iron Man" represented not only the explosive start of the film franchise but also the revival of Robert Downey Jr.'s acting career. He stars here as the rich playboy Tony Stark (and, soon enough, Iron Man) alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges. It begins with a kidnapping in Afghanistan, where Stark is showing off defense technology to the United States military.
W. (2008) Stream on Hulu and Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Here's an interesting double feature: pair the war-on-terror-focused "Iron Man" with this Oliver Stone George W. Bush biopic, another relic of late-Bush-era America. An origin story that vacillates between sendup and appraisal, the film follows Bush (Josh Brolin) from his Yale days through the earlier years of his presidency. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie "queasily enjoyable."

Texto completo: Crossword puzzles expect solvers to have a good grasp of general knowledge, but sometimes certain facts just aren't in our personal wheelhouses.
That's O.K. We're here to help you solve ... and to help you expand those wheelhouses.
For our latest list of terms you should know to become a better solver, we'll be attending a "crossword symphony," taking a closer look at basic musical notations that frequently show up in puzzles.
We'll also show you ways these terms might be clued, so you'll be able to recognize them the next time they come up. The clues that involve wordplay meant to trick you are bold, to make them easier to spot and so you can learn to think like the puzzle makers.
If you're a subscriber and would like to try a puzzle with the guarantee of that answer being right, click on the first clue (highlighted) under each description.
1. ADAGIO
"Slowly"
When a piece of music specifies the tempo -- or speed -- as "adagio," it should be played slowly, at approximately 65-75 beats per minute (b.p.m.) on a metronome.
"Adagio" can also be used as a noun to refer to any composition played at this tempo.
Possible clues: "Slowly, on a score," "Slowly, to a conductor," "Slowly," "Slow symphonic movement," "Faster than larghetto," "Samuel Barber's '___ for Strings"'
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
2. A DUE
"For two"
"A due" -- pronounced "ah-DOO-ay" -- is used to note that a composition consists of two voices, or that a segment of a musical duet should be performed in unison.
The four-letter term has three vowels, making it an especially valuable answer for crossword makers; its common letters allow great flexibility for filling other nearby slots with fun puzzle bonuses. Thus, A DUE has appeared in nearly 150 puzzles for The New York Times.
Possible clues: "Together, in music," "Musically together," "For two voices in unison," "Together, to Toscanini," "Literally, 'by two"'
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
3. ARCO
"With the bow"
"Arco" is the Italian word for "bow." It serves as a musical instruction to indicate that a strings player should play the passage using one's bow, as opposed to plucking the strings by hand ("pizzicato").
In crossword puzzles, ARCO may also be clued as the gasoline brand based in California.
Possible clues: "With the bow, in music," "Instruction to play with the bow," "Instruction for a violinist," "Counterpart of pizzicato, in music," "West Coast gas brand"
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
4. ASSAI
"Very"
"Assai" commonly follows the name of a faster tempo, such as "allegro," to denote that the piece should be played very quickly.
Possible clues: "Very, in music," "Very, to a conductor," "Allegro ___ (very quick, in music)," "Musical intensifier"
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
5. A TEMPO
"Resume speed"
When the speed of music changes from its original setting -- usually through the use of "accelerando" ("play faster") or "ritardando" ("play slower") -- the notation "a tempo" instructs the players to return to their original speed.
Possible clues: "Resuming the previous speed, in music," "'Resume speed,' musically," "At original speed, musically," "Undoer of 'ritardando"'
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
6. LARGO
"Slowly/broadly"
"Largo" is a musical tempo played slower than adagio (40-60 b.p.m.). Largo is similar in speed to the tempo "lento" (see No. 8 below), but it also denotes a composition that should be played more broadly and with emotion.
LARGO might also reference Key Largo, one of the Florida Keys, in puzzle clues.
Possible clues: "Slow, in symphonies," "Slowly," "Funereal tempo," "About 40-60 beats per minute," "Slow and dignified," "Florida's Key ___"
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
7. LEGATO
"Smooth and connected"
A composition whose melody flows smoothly together is said to be "legato." On a musical staff, curved lines known as slurs connect differently pitched notes to indicate this style of play.
Possible clues: "Smooth, in music," "Musically connected," "Played smoothly," "Smooth, to Solti," "Not staccato"
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
8. LENTO
"Very slowly"
Like largo, "lento" is a tempo played slower than adagio, and can also be used as a noun to refer to any lento piece.
Possible clues: "Slow, in music," "Slowly, on a score," "Slower than adagio," "Indication to bow slowly, say," "How a nocturne is often played"
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
9. POCO
"A little"
"Poco," the Italian word for "little," can be used as a modifier meaning "somewhat." The phrase "poco a poco" on musical scores indicates a gradual change, often with tempo, as a crescendo might with loudness.
Possible clues: "A little, musically," "Somewhat, in music," "Little, in La Scala," "___ adagio (score direction)"
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
10. RIT. (ritardando)
"Gradually slowing"
RIT is a classic bit of "crosswordese" useful to puzzle makers having trouble with a tough-to-fill area of the grid. The abbreviation stands for the term "ritardando," which suggests a slowing from one tempo to another in transition.
A music-inspired clue for RIT will always bear an abbreviation in the clue -- or the tag "Abbr." -- to hint that the answer must be a truncated form of the word. RIT can also be clued with respect to the Rochester Institute of Technology in upstate New York.
Possible clues: "Gradually slowing, in music: Abbr.," "Slowing, in mus.," "Decreasing in tempo: Abbr.," "Upstate N.Y. sch."
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
11. STAC. (staccato)
"Disconnected"
Another musical abbreviation common to crosswords is STAC, or "stac.," the shortened form of "staccato." Staccato is the counterpart of legato, in which musical notes are played short and disconnected, often in a faster tempo.
An alternative to the "stac." notation consists of small dots placed directly above or below individual notes.
Possible clues: "Quick and detached, in mus.," "Disconnected, in music: Abbr.," "Opposite of legato: Abbr.," "Abbr. accompanying some dotted notes"
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
12. TACET
"Be silent"
"Tacet" is an instruction to rest, or stop playing, for a significant segment of the composition.
John Cage's infamous work, "4'33"," designates "tacet" for all instruments during the entirety of its three movements.
Possible clues: "'Be silent,' in music," "'It is silent,' musically," "Music direction to stop playing," "Indicator of silence"
Sources: Dictionary.OnMusic.org, NYTimes.com, XWordInfo.com
More Difficult Clues, and How to Solve Them
While familiarity with the 12 terms above can prove helpful with straightforward solving, sometimes crossword clues require a deeper level of music knowledge.
What happens if reading music isn't your strong suit, or you aren't up on your famous symphonies?
The beauty of American-style crossword puzzles lies in their elegant interlocking of letters in both Across and Down answers. Should a music clue appear daunting at a glance, remember that each letter of the corresponding answer is found in another answer that intersects it. So, as we say, be sure to "use your crossers" to help fill things in.
There are a few other tricks for determining the gist of music clues:
1. A six-letter answer whose clue suggests a musical key usually follows the pattern ? MAJOR or ? MINOR, where "?" is the letter A, B, C, D, E, F or G.
"Key with two flats" = G MINOR
"Key of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7" = A MAJOR
2. A clue referencing a musical note, or its equivalent, can be answered by ? SHARP (if six letters) or ? FLAT (if five letters).
"Note in the E major scale" = D SHARP
"G sharp's equivalent" = A FLAT
3. A three-letter answer whose clue suggests an adjective describing a musical composition is most likely IN ?. The answer should be parsed as a two-word phrase, such as "in A" (as in, "in the key of A").
"Having four sharps" = IN E
"Like Brahms's Piano Trio No. 1" = IN B
Happy solving!

Texto completo: BY CATHERINE LUCEY
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The White House has beefed up its legal team. Its political team is ready to distract and disparage. And President Donald Trump is venting against all things Democratic.
Trump's response plan to the ever-expanding congressional probes into his campaign, White House and personal affairs is coming into focus as newly empowered Democrats intensify their efforts.
Deploying a mix of legal legwork and political posturing, the administration is trying to minimize its exposure while claiming the president is the victim of overzealous partisan investigations.
Trump said Democrats have fired the starting gun on the 2020 presidential campaign in an effort he's dubbed "presidential harassment."
"Basically, they've started the campaign," Trump said, "so the campaign begins."
Dictated more by events than long-range strategy, the administration approach comes as the White House is increasingly focused on the twin challenges of the probes and the upcoming 2020 election.
But the overarching nature of the Trump response points to his increasing frustration with Congress, and his intention to seize on the investigations as evidence that he is under siege in Washington. While Trump is far from the first president to clash with Capitol Hill oversight, his enthusiastic embrace of political victimhood is still novel - and stands to serve as a key part of his re-election argument.
Aiming to appeal to the public's sympathies, Trump said that instead of working together on legislation on issues like health care and infrastructure, Democrats "want to play games."
House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings said Tuesday that the White House is refusing to produce documents related to security clearances.
Cummings released a letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone in which he calls Cummings' request "unprecedented and extraordinarily intrusive" and offers to provide a briefing and documents "describing the security clearance process."
Cummings said that is not enough and that the White House posture defies "plain common sense." He said he will consult with committee members about next steps.
The document request from the oversight panel comes amid questions about the Trump administration's truthfulness regarding how senior adviser Jared Kushner got his high-level security clearance after career security officials recommended against it. The New York Times reported that Trump ordered officials to grant the clearance.
Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman has hired new staff with experience in the intelligence community and law enforcement as he renews an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and begins looking into President Donald Trump's financial interests.
Schiff announced Tuesday that he hired Daniel Goldman as senior adviser and director of investigations. Goldman formerly worked in the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other crimes. Goldman worked there until 2017.
Schiff also announced that he hired Kathy Suber, who served as a government intelligence officer for two decades, and Lucian Sikorskyj, who worked for the National Security Council and served as a senior analyst to NATO.

Salt Lake City’s The Grand Theatre considering how it might accept offer to stage Aaron Sorkin’s new version of ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’

Texto completo: The saga of “To Kill a Mockingbird” at Salt Lake City’s The Grand Theatre — and whether Aaron Sorkin’s now-on-Broadway script will be performed there — has reached the cliffhanger moment of the plot.
The issue is whether The Grand can stage Sorkin’s new version of the beloved story, after being forced to cancel its production of an older adaptation.
“We would need to see a copy of the script,” said Seth Miller, executive artistic director of The Grand, on Wednesday. “I don’t know what the show is.”
Miller said Wednesday that he has not yet talked to representatives of Broadway producer Scott Rudin about his offer to let a handful of regional theaters use Sorkin’s new adaptation of the Harper Lee novel.
Rudin made the offer Friday to defuse a public-relations nightmare for his Broadway production, which began over a dispute about the licensing of Lee’s beloved story. Rudin’s company claims exclusive stage rights to “To Kill a Mockingbird;” it argued that its contract with Lee’s estate precluded another theatrical licensing company, Dramatic Publishing, from allowing productions of an older adaptation in metropolitan areas.
At least eight regional theater groups, including The Grand, had signed with Dramatic Publishing to produce the older “To Kill a Mockingbird” this spring. Rudin’s lawyers sent letters to those theater groups, threatening expensive legal action if they staged “Mockingbird.” Most cancelled, though one in Massachusetts moved the production to a rural theater to avoid restrictions on performing the show too close to a big city.
The Grand’s production was 10 days into rehearsals — with costume fittings and set design underway — when Miller and the play’s director, Mark Fossen, told the cast on Feb. 16 that the show would not go on.
Word spread among theater fans about the regional cancellations, and the news ultimately landed last Friday on the front page of Broadway’s hometown paper, The New York Times. The news added to the bad publicity the production received when Lee’s estate threatened legal action over the way Sorkin, creator of TV’s “The West Wing” and screenwriter of “A Few Good Men” and “The Social Network,” depicted the story’s main character, Alabama lawyer Atticus Finch.
After the Times article ran, Rudin softened his stance. He offered the use of Sorkin’s script, without a fee, to the theater companies that received letters from Rudin’s lawyers.
One problem for The Grand, Miller said, is that it’s not known whether Rudin’s offer has an expiration date.
If the time window is wide enough, Miller said, “we could produce the show next season, and bump another show that we were hoping to do, or do it the year after. It depends on how long the offer is good for.”
If the offer is only for the time a troupe was originally going to perform “To Kill a Mockingbird,” which for The Grand was from March 21 to April 6, the logistics would be more difficult.
There wouldn’t be enough time to recast, rehearse and mount a full production on short notice — and a stripped-down version, like a staged reading, “would be difficult for us to pull together,” Miller said.
“Even a reading would be hard for us to pull together now, because we don’t have a cast,” Miller said. “Without seeing the script, we don’t even know where to begin casting.”
Miller understands the rarity of Rudin’s offer, and the pressure it puts on his theater. “The Grand probably would never get the chance to be the regional premiere of a show like this otherwise,” he said.
While a decision on “To Kill a Mockingbird” is up in the air, Miller still has a theater to run — and he must find ways to make up for the estimated $20,000 loss that the cancellation caused. The Grand’s current production, the romantic musical “First Date,” was given a two-week extension, and will now end this Saturday. The Grand’s next production, of the musical “West Side Story,” doesn’t open until May 16.

Can Michael Jackson's legacy survive 'Finding Neverland'?

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Can the memory of Michael Jackson survive "Leaving Neverland"?

After all, it has bounced back before. The superstar's image was tarnished by allegations of sexual abuse that shadowed him throughout much of his adult life and even stood trial on child-molestation charges in 2005, for which he was acquitted. His untimely death in 2009 seemed to wash that stain away in an outpouring of public love and a resurgence of sales of his always popular music.

Now, 10 years later, the HBO documentary "Leaving Neverland" has aired detailed and disturbing stories from two men who say Jackson groomed them for sex and molested them when they were just little boys.

It has cast a spotlight on Jackson's unsavory history at a #MeToo moment when old allegations against stars have been taking hold, and taking them down.

So far, there has been no evidence of major damage to Jackson's music or his estate, which has made an estimated $2 billion since his death. His music has been featured in commercials and is the subject of a Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas. A play about his life by Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage is due out on Broadway next year.

And it may not. After all, Jackson is dead now, which means he can't be charged or put on trial, keeping the story in the headlines for months or years to come.

And there is Jackson's nearly unparalleled star status -- starting out as a cherub-faced 11-year-old sensation with the Jackson 5, then catapulting into a global phenomenon with the world's best-selling album of all time, "Thriller," to his credit and hits adored by multiple generations.

"It's hard to compare someone of Michael Jackson's caliber to anyone else," said Danny Deraney, a publicist who often handles crisis management. "I don't think we've seen anything like it."

Still, Oprah Winfrey, with her vast influence, may have heralded a shift in public attitudes just by hosting the special "After Neverland," in which she interviewed the documentary's subjects, James Safechuck and Wade Robson.

"I hope we can get beyond Michael Jackson the icon, stop staring into the sun, and do what is necessary to help our children and ourselves," Winfrey said in front of an audience of sexual abuse survivors and their supporters.

She did not directly condemn Jackson. But she praised the film, treated its assertions as truth, and said that she was expecting an earful from Jackson's defenders.

"I'm gonna get it," Winfrey, who interviewed Jackson before the allegations emerged in 1993 and his family after his death, said at the end of the show that aired Sunday and Monday on HBO and OWN just after the documentary.

It could be that Jackson's fandom is so pervasive, especially in countries that don't follow his personal news closely, that the documentary and renewed allegations will just make a small dent.

"For Michael Jackson's fans, more so probably outside of America, I don't think it will have an effect, because they'll ride or die with Michael," Deraney said.

Robson and Safechuck's allegations didn't emerge until 2013, when they filed lawsuits seeking money from Jackson's estate that have since been thrown out and are under appeal. Both men had previously denied Jackson sexually abused them and had been among his fiercest defenders when Jackson was alive, but say having their own children and Jackson's death led them to confront their truth.

Because of the men's past denials, some Jackson fans have dismissed their testimonies as lies, motivated by money. Some even refused to watch the documentary. Still, after the film began airing, there were casual fans who felt gutted by the revelations, with some saying they could not listen to his music the same way -- if at all.

"People have already made the decision one way or the other," Deraney said. "I think when a lot of people think of Michael Jackson they already think 'pedophile,' whether or not there is any proof."

"I think what it comes down to," Deraney added, "is future generations."

Many millennials have only vague knowledge of the Jackson accusations, and are shocked even by facts that are acknowledged by both sides.

"I'm young enough to have not been aware of the allegations about Michael Jackson as they were happening," 31-year-old New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie tweeted while watching the documentary. "It is WILD TO ME that anyone thought his behavior around and constant contact with young boys was remotely okay."

Some of Jackson's fellow artists have indicated they will not give him and his influence up easily, and say they can separate the performer from the person.

Jason Derulo recently released the first music and videos from a planned boxed set of EPs that the singer and dancer made in tribute to Jackson. It's set to be released in its entirety on June 25, the 10th anniversary of Jackson's death.

"Michael was the sole reason I started singing and dancing, so this was a way for me to give back," Derulo, who has not seen "Leaving Neverland," told The Associated Press. "I started this project because of my love of the performer that Michael Jackson is and the influence that he had on my life as the best performer that ever lived. This has nothing to do with anyone's personal life."

India.Arie says it was right to speak out against R. Kelly, who faces new sexual abuse charges after the Lifetime documentary "Surviving R. Kelly" aired more than a decade after he was cleared of child pornography charges. But Jackson's situation is different, the singer said.

"I think it's too late for people to be saying 'mute Michael Jackson,"' Arie told the AP.

"With R. Kelly, there's video," she said, referencing a sex tape that allegedly shows the singer's abuse. "With Michael Jackson, there's a lot of speculation. I don't know if it's going to go as far. ... Not because we love him more, I just think it's a different situation."

Jackson's estate, his most ardent fans, and his family, have no such ambiguity in their views. They say the documentary repeats discredited allegations from admitted liars.

Jackson's brothers said they were already in a rough period of managing his memory and legacy with their father Joseph Jackson's death last year, when they heard that "Leaving Neverland" was coming.

"This time is difficult for us because you know Michael, coming up on the 10th anniversary of his passing and my father passed away six months ago," Marlon Jackson told the AP last week. "So those things are still there, and you never get rid of them. You learn to live with them. And now we're dealing with something that's totally different but has no truth to it. There's no facts at all."

At least one prominent and formerly devoted fan says he's been forced to reconsider.

"I've spent a lifetime loving MJ," Los Angeles Times music writer Gerrick D. Kennedy wrote after seeing the documentary's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.

"Roughly an hour into 'Leaving Neverland,' it felt like my chest had caved in .... It wasn't long before I accepted that 'Leaving Neverland' would force me -- and likely many others who also feel a deep connection to Jackson's work -- to see that none of us really knew him. And that maybe we'd been avoiding the truth."

The subjects of the documentary themselves don't have strong feelings about whether people should give up Jackson's music.

"It's a chance to reevaluate who you want to be your idols," Safechuck told the AP at Sundance. "Because you can write a song, does that mean you should be people's moral compass? ... It's less about tearing down somebody and more about an opportunity of who do we want to look up to."

"There's plenty of other amazing people to fill that role."

Texto completo: PASADENA, Calif. - Will Shortz, crossword puzzle editor at The New York Times, executive produces the new Hallmark Movies & Mysteries series "Crossword Mysteries."
In the first installment, "A Puzzle to Die For" (9 p.m. Sunday), New York Sentinel crossword puzzle editor Tess Harper (Lacey Chabert, "Party of Five") discovers art heists are being foreshadowed in clues in a weekly newspaper puzzle and aids police Lt. Logan O'Connor (Brennan Elliott) in his investigation.
Ms. Chabert, a Hallmark Channel staple, previously starred opposite Mr. Elliott in Hallmark Channel's "All of My Heart" movies (among others).
"It's definitely a different vibe than those movies. It's more serious," Ms. Chabert said in early February at a Hallmark party during the Television Critics Association winter 2019 press tour.
Programs on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries are just a touch darker than those on Hallmark Channel.
"There's crime, there's murder, it's all done very tastefully," Ms. Chabert said of "Crossword Mysteries." "And the mystery itself is something that's very interesting and will hopefully have the audience on the edge of their seat and sort of figuring out along with us."
But she promises there will still be banter, humor and chemistry between the lead characters.
"So who knows," Ms. Chabert added, "maybe they'll end up together one day."
Of course they will - it's Hallmark! - assuming the movie series continues. (Four installments will air this year with the balance slated for Oct. 6, 13 and 20.)
In Sunday's installment, Tess' crossword puzzle is found at the murder scene at the outset. But how will crossword puzzles figure into every case?
"I don't want to give away the plots, but the ideas that we have for the first few are definitely different than the first," Ms. Chabert said. "And it's not only the crossword that will bring us together, it's really our skill sets. And we like each other as people and we sort of reluctantly appreciate that we're able to help each other."
Ms. Chabert got her start in show business as a child actor on Fox's 1994-2000 drama "Party of Five," and she's game to reprise her role as Claudia Salinger in Freeform's reboot should producers invite her to return.
"That show was such a huge part of my life, and if they asked me to be a part of it again and make an appearance, of course I would," she said. "I treasure the time I had on the show."

Doctors report that second HIV patient appears cured

Texto completo: A patient in London is HIV-free, doctors announced this week in what appears to be an astounding case.
A patient who was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 has become the second patient ever known to be cured of the infection that affects close to 37 million people worldwide after receiving a bone marrow transplant intended to treat cancer, doctors say. The patient received the stem cell transplant from a donor with a rare CCR5 mutation that allows HIV resistance in May of 2016 to treat his Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The London patient, who is anonymous, also underwent chemotherapy. He took antiretroviral therapy drugs for HIV until September of 2017, doctors say. His drug regiment was much less harsh than the only other known patient who was cured of HIV.
He has been HIV-free, in remission, for 18 months, according to tests.
In a research letter set to publish Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Nature, doctors who treated him say this proves that the Berlin patient cured of HIV in 2007 wasn't an anomaly and HIV remission is possible.
"Everybody believed after the Berlin patient that you needed to nearly die basically to cure HIV, but now maybe you don't," said Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at University College London who presented the findings at a conference in Seattle, The New York Times reports.
The first patient to be cured of HIV, Berlin patient Timothy Ray Brown, underwent two bone-marrow transplants also for cancer treatments, took a cocktail of drugs and experienced serious complications that put his life in danger. He survived the ordeal. Over a decade later, he is still considered cured. Treatments that have tried to replicate Brown's result in other HIV patients have failed, until now.

Lakers’ Brandon Ingram misses Clippers game due to shoulder soreness

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — The Lakers’ sinking playoff prospects suffered another setback on Monday afternoon, when the team learned Brandon Ingram is struggling with right shoulder soreness.
The third-year forward missed Monday’s start against the Clippers – joining teammates Lance Stephenson (toe sprain) and Tyson Chandler (neck stiffness) on the sidelines – after the medical staff became aware of the issue following morning shootaround.
Coach Luke Walton said he got a call from team trainer Marco Nunez on his way home from the practice facility. Ingram took the court two hours ahead of tip-off Monday night in an effort to try to warm up, but the Lakers ultimately decided to play it safe.
“This is a game that we really could use him,” Walton said. “Knowing Brandon, if he can play, he’ll play. But at the same time, if he can’t do certain things and he’s putting himself in jeopardy of something getting much worse, we gotta have somebody else step up as opposed to him only being out there playing 50 percent.”
The Lakers, already using a tighter rotation as they battle depth issues, moved JaVale McGee back into the starting lineup in Ingram’s place. McGee came off the bench in the previous three games.
Ingram’s absence creates a considerable hole for the Lakers in the midst of the most brilliant segment of his career. Since the All-Star break, Ingram has averaged 27.8 points (to LeBron James’ 28.5 ppg) while shooting 57 percent from the field. He also averaged the second-most minutes behind James during the previous six games.
Stephenson had missed the previous two games after suffering the toe injury last week in a home win over New Orleans. Chandler’s minutes have been limited for the last month with various ailments.
WALTON SAYS HE’S IGNORING JOB SECURITY SPECULATION
With the Lakers’ stumbles out of the All-Star break and their fading playoff hopes, there has been increasing speculation that Walton won’t be back to coach the team next season.
The latest report comes from The New York Times, which reported that “prevailing assumption in league coaching circles remains that Walton will almost certainly be dismissed after the season.”
Walton said he handles such reports by ignoring them.
“I focus on what’s gonna help our team, what I can do better, where I can put our team in a better place to try to succeed,” he said. “I ask my players to do that, so if I’m asking them to do it, I gotta do the same thing. So I don’t pay attention to that or waste time thinking about it.”

¿Trump terminará con el espionaje de telefonía y mensajería en Estados Unidos?

Texto completo: Desde hace varios meses, la Agencia de Seguridad Nacional ( NSA , en inglés) ha cerrado un sistema que analiza los registros de las llamadas y mensajes de texto de los estadounidenses.
Según un alto asesor republicano del Congreso, el programa que ha provocado disputas sobre la privacidad y el estado de derecho desde los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001 ha sido detenido y el presidente Donald Trump no pedirá que sea reactivado, publicó el New York Times.
Oficialmente, el sistema no ha sido concluido, indica el Times, ya que expirará a fin de año, según el asistente, Luke Murry , asesor de seguridad nacional de la minoría en la Cámara.
La administración del presidente George W. Bush inició el programa a fin de evitar ataques terroristas, luego del 9/11 . La existencia del programa fue revelado hasta 2013 por el contratista Edward Snowden .
A través del sistema, los analistas de inteligencia han tenido acceso a registros masivos de llamadas y mensajes de texto de los estadounidenses con el objetivo de detectar posibles planes terroristas. No está claro cuántos ataques se evitaron con el programa.
Tampoco hay certeza de su continuidad, algo que el presidente Trump podría solicitar al Congreso, aunque Murry lo desconoce y afirma que el programa no ha sido utilizado desde hace seis meses, debido a que la NSA enfrenta problemas de autoridad para recopilar las llamadas y mensajes.

Texto completo: House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler escalated investigations into President Donald Trump's possible ties to Russia with demands for information from scores of people surrounding the president's businesses and his administration's activities.
With impeachment investigations, House Democrats play with fire
By Casey Given
The House Judiciary Committee launched a sweeping investigation on Monday of President Donald Trump's inner circle, demanding documents from 81 people and groups associated with his administration and business ventures. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler made the Democrats' intentions crystal clear on an interview with CNN on Sunday: "We do not now have the evidence all sorted out and everything to do an impeachment," Nadler explained. "Before you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American public that it ought to happen. "
Since Republicans currently control the Senate, the chairman is right: an effective impeachment of Trump that results in removal from office is an uphill battle, to say the least. History teaches us that Democrats must find a so-called smoking gun lest the American public perceives the investigation as a partisan witch hunt.
Contrary to popular belief, impeachment is a political process — not a criminal one. All that is needed to impeach a sitting president is a majority vote in the House. Removing an impeached president from office, however, is a more difficult task, requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote in the Senate after a public trial. So while Democrats conceivably have the votes to impeach the president along partisan lines á la GOP with Bill Clinton circa 1998, at least 18 Republicans (and all Democrats) in the Senate would have to vote in favor of Trump's removal for it to happen.

To persuade so many Republicans to vote against a sitting president from their own party, Democrats must uncover an undeniable piece of evidence that proves Trump committed a serious crime. During the 1974 Watergate scandal, this came in the form of a tape of Richard Nixon scheming to end the FBI investigation into the infamous break-in. Although Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment, his removal was imminent in any case, as political support from his own party evaporated overnight. After the tape's release, the 10 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee announced they would vote for impeachment on the floor.
Nadler's investigation into Trump must pass the same political test lest Democrats' efforts go in vain: They must uncover evidence that would force the hand of even staunch Republican defenders of the president on the committee, like Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.
The Democrats are playing with fire. Trump enjoys seemingly unwavering loyalty from his own party, with 90 percent job approval among Republicans in Gallup's latest poll. Unless Nadler and congressional Democrats can dig up indisputable proof that Trump has committed a high crime, they risk galvanizing the GOP base to glide the president into an easy re-election.
Trump is already hyping the witch-hunt narrative, tweeting a Sean Hannity quote last night describing the House investigation as "the biggest display of modern day McCarthyism. " Nadler and House Democrats must show receipts of Trump's fraud or else the American people might well agree with the president in 2020.

What others are saying
Jill Lawrence, USA TODAY: "This isn't overkill, it's playing catch-up. What we’re seeing now is the oversight and scrutiny that should have started on Day One of this administration. It's also laying the foundation for impeachment. . . . The onslaught of congressional investigations is a direct result of House Republicans having shirked their obligations for two years in the face of Trump's norm-shattering, possibly legally compromised presidency. It is overwhelming and at the same time long overdue, particularly for impatient impeachment advocates such as liberal billionaire Tom Steyer. "
Michelle Cottle, The New York Times: "Look for the next several months to be a nonstop pageant of subpoenas, hearings and court challenges. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler's panel is not alone in looking to impose accountability on a devious and dishonest president. . . And the areas on which Mr. Nadler will focus — obstruction of justice, public corruption and abuse of power — are precisely the sorts of high crimes and misdemeanors on which such cases are built. "
Joel Rubin, The Hill: "For the past two years, Congressional Republicans coddled the Trump administration and failed to use any of these democratic tools on our country's behalf. From terminating Senate minority rights to force a deeply flawed Supreme Court nominee onto the country’s highest court to blocking even minor protections for the Mueller team’s investigation into a foreign adversaries’ attack on our democracy, the Republican Congress neither did the American people any favors nor lived up to the expectations of our country’s founders. Fortunately, this has now changed. "
What our readers are saying
Hopefully, the "accountability process" has indeed begun with this new Congress. You can deny smoke all day long, but the fire is just about to start for the Trump administration.
— Michael Anthony Shea
The first mystery for House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler to solve is why Republicans are hell bent at looking the other way.
— Steve Poirier
Since probable cause no longer seems to matter and we now seem to investigate people instead of crimes, President Donald Trump should assign FBI and IRS agents to each Democratic committee chairman (for starters) to investigate every aspect of their lives to see what they can find, too.
— John Carter
Impeachment and removal from office is a political process that that requires a strong foundation for legitimacy. It may be long and tedious, but when it coalesces, it will have a majority of the public's support.

Texto completo: State alleges opioid maker disregarded safety and deceived doctors
Purdue Pharma says a lawsuit filed against the company by the Massachusetts attorney general amounts to "oversimplified scapegoating" that is not supported by the law.
In a recent motion to dismiss the case, Purdue says Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) has created a "sensationalist and distorted narrative that ignores facts" in the lawsuit she filed last year. It alleges the company disregarded safety and addiction and deceived patients and doctors to get them to prescribe and take high doses of OxyContin and looked the other way as overdose deaths linked to prescription opioids soared.
Purdue alleges that some claims made by Healey are contradicted by the Massachusetts Department of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, which approved the medication and its labeling. Purdue argues that Healey is putting forward a "misleading narrative" about OxyContin.
Healey's office said it plans to oppose Purdue's motion.
In the suit, Healey argues that Purdue encouraged sales representatives to push extremely high doses of the drug to boost OxyContin profits. Purdue counters that the FDA has approved various dosages of the medication, which allow doctors to easily tailor how much medication a patient is taking. Purdue said that the company has issued warnings about the side effects of high OxyContin doses and that it advises patients start with low doses.
Purdue is making arguments that it has used in the slew of state and federal lawsuits filed against it in recent years, including that it controls just 2 to 3 percent of the market for opioid drugs. The company also says it is not responsible for overdose deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid made overseas that has killed tens of thousands of people in recent years.
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health's statistics show a recent rise in fentanyl deaths, which Purdue said contradicts Healey's assertion that painkillers are a leading cause of overdose fatalities. However, the spike in fentanyl deaths started in 2013 and does not account for the entirety of the opioid crisis, which began in the late 1990s.
Purdue says that to prove her case, Healey must show that the company's statements "caused individual prescribers to write prescriptions they otherwise would not have written, and that those prescriptions were improper or unnecessary."
Healey's office said it plans to oppose Purdue's motion.
The attorney general paints a portrait of insatiable greed and disregard for suffering caused by painkillers in portions of the lawsuit, which made public Purdue's internal documents and emails. Healey argues that eight members of the Sackler family, which owns Purdue, made choices that "caused much of the opioid epidemic."
Purdue says in its filing that the Massachusetts suit "seeks to vilify Purdue and its employees and directors."
In one portion of the lawsuit, Healey said an email from one member of the Sackler family referred to a federal prosecutor who reported 59 deaths from OxyContin in one state. Healey's suit notes that another member of the Sackler family wrote to company executives: "That is not too bad. It could have been far worse."
Purdue says the email was referring to a New York Times story about the abuse of OxyContin and the email writer was referring to "the nature of recent press coverage," not the overdose deaths.
"Recognizing the weakness of its legal theories, the Commonwealth has resorted to the creation of a sensationalist and distorted narrative that ignores facts and mischaracterizes numerous e-mails and business documents," Purdue's lawyers wrote.
Purdue said it complies with all FDA requirements, particularly those regarding the marketing of the drug, which were put in place after a 2007 consent agreement. That year, Purdue paid $600 million in fines and its executives pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges for claiming the product was less addictive than other painkillers.
Healey says her lawsuit shows the Sacklers' misconduct since the agreement was "knowing and intentional."
One marketing opportunity Healey highlights is a Tufts University program that taught two unbranded curriculums in 2014; the Sackler family established a master's level program in pain research and policy at the university with a monetary gift 15 years earlier.
In court documents, Purdue said it presented a program called "The OxyContin Crisis" to members of Tufts Health Plan as an effort to "address prescription medication abuse awareness and prevention" with various organizations, not as a marketing opportunity.

Texto completo: Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who has been mulling a run for president, said in an emailed statement Monday evening that he will unveil a “major announcement” Tuesday morning.

For those reading tea leaves, Merkley said the announcement would be "very special," closed his statement by declaring, "Onward," and asked for money.

“Since Donald Trump was elected, I've been traveling from coast to coast helping organize our resistance and get our country back on track,” Merkley wrote. “I've gone to the border many times to call attention to Trump's prisons for children, filibustered the brazen theft of a Supreme Court seat, and helped organize the fight for a "Green New Deal."

“I've had extraordinary encounters in every corner of the country with amazing people who are giving everything they have to create an America that works for all of us,” he said. “And I've been thinking hard about what I can give, how I can make the best contribution to the vital work in front of us.”

Merkley, who told the New York Times in June 2018 that he was “exploring the possibility” of running for president in 2020, said in December he would announce his decision during the first quarter of 2019 and said that his family backs a 2020 presidential bid.

"They had a veto over the project, and they have all now given it a thumbs-up,” he told ABC News.

The announcement will be posted on Facebook and on Merkley’s website, according to an email sent to Merkley’s supporters.

Should Merkley announce he is running for president in 2020, he would join candidates including Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, among others.

Dems look beyond Mueller with investigations

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Emboldened by their new majority, Democrats are undertaking several broad new investigations into President Donald Trump and setting the stage for a post-Robert Mueller world.
Whether the special counsel's final Russia report is damning of the president or not, Democrats in charge of a half-dozen House committees are planning to flood the administration with document requests, calls for testimony and even subpoenas if necessary. The investigations reach far beyond Mueller's focus of Russian interference and collusion in the 2016 campaign.
The Democratic efforts increased this past week after Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, appeared before two House committees and a Senate committee. In his public testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cohen called the president a "con man and a "cheat and gave Democrats several new leads for inquiry.
The stepped-up oversight could eventually lead to, or even serve in place of, impeachment proceedings. While many liberal members of the Democratic caucus think impeachment is warranted, Democratic leaders have been cautious, saying they first want to investigate.
A look at the status of some of the House investigations:
House Intelligence
The committee is reopening and expanding an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election that the Republican majority closed last year. At that time, Republicans said, over Democratic objections, that there was no evidence to show that Trump's campaign colluded or conspired with Russia. The top Democrat on the committee then, California Rep. Adam Schiff, said Republicans had prematurely closed the matter without interviewing key witnesses and demanding important documents.
Schiff is now chairman, and last month he announced a broad new investigation looking not only at Russian interference but also at Trump's foreign financial interests. Schiff said the investigation will include "the scope and scale of Russian intervention in the 2016 presidential election, the "extent of any links and/or coordination between Russians and Trump's associates, whether foreign actors have sought to hold leverage over Trump or his family and associates, and whether anyone has sought to obstruct any of the relevant investigations.
The committee interviewed Cohen in private on Thursday and will finish the interview this coming Wednesday. After Cohen left, Schiff announced that the committee will hold an open hearing later this month with Felix Sater, a Russia-born executive who worked with Cohen on an ultimately unsuccessful deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.
Schiff said told CBS' "Face the Nation on Sunday that there are "any number of witnesses that can shed light on whether America's national security is compromised because the president has been pursuing financial interests with the Russians.
House Oversight and Reform
This committee was in the spotlight when Cohen testified publicly last Wednesday. The chairman, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, said afterward that he wanted to call in several people mentioned repeatedly by Cohen. That could include Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg and possibly two of Trump's children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump.
The committee's jurisdiction touches on all parts of government. On Friday, Cummings demanded that the White House turn over documents by Monday related to security clearances after The New York Times reported that the president ordered officials to grant his son-in-law Jared Kushner's clearance over the objections of security officials. Last Tuesday, the committee voted to subpoena administration officials over family separations at the southern border.
The committee is also looking into other conflict of interest issues, including at Trump's hotel in Washington, and into prescription drug prices.
House Judiciary
The House Judiciary Committee would be in charge of impeachment, but the chairman, New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, first wants to examine Mueller's report, whenever it comes out. Nadler has helped lead the charge to pressure the Justice Department to release the full report to the public.
On Sunday, Nadler announced that the committee will request documents Monday from more than 60 people from President Donald Trump's administration, family and business as it begins investigations. He said that would include officials from the Justice Department, Weisselberg of the Trump Organization and Donald Trump Jr.
Nadler said on ABC's "This Week that lawmakers would send the letters "to begin investigations to present the case to the American people about obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power.
The committee has also called in the former acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, and plans to question him again in the coming weeks. Whitaker is a close Trump ally who had criticized the Mueller report before he was appointed. William Barr has since been confirmed as attorney general.
House Ways and Means
The chairman, Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, is expected to eventually try to obtain Trump's tax returns, which the president has refused to release. But for now, Neal is taking it slow.
The law says the treasury chief "shall furnish the requested information to members of the committee for them to examine behind closed doors. But reality is more complicated, and the request could end up in a lengthy court battle between Congress and the administration.
Last month, Neal held a hearing in which experts discussed the authority under current law for Neal to make a request for any tax returns to the treasury secretary. The hearing also examined proposals to compel presidents and presidential candidates to make years of their tax returns public.
House Financial Services
The committee's head, California Rep. Maxine Waters, has focused on Deutsche Bank, the German asset management firm that has loaned Trump's real estate organization millions of dollars over the years. She said this past week that the bank is cooperating with requests for documents.
The committee is working with Schiff, who along with Waters has said he wants to investigate whether Russians used laundered money for transactions with the Trump Organization. Trump's businesses have benefited from Russian investment over the years, and Schiff has said he wants to know whether "this is the leverage that the Russians have over Trump.
Waters said she is also interested in looking at Trump's embattled charitable foundation that is shutting down after agreeing to a court-supervised process and at White House budget director Mick Mulvaney's tenure at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has said Mulvaney may be called to testify.
House Foreign Affairs
The chairman, New York Rep. Eliot Engel, is also working with Schiff and his committee to review Trump's encounters with and connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin, including a private meeting between the two in Helsinki last year. Trump would not disclose the full details of what was said in their meeting.
The two committees have worked with House lawyers to figure out the appropriate way to investigate that meeting. That could include getting information from a translator who attended.
Engel has said that the committee will hold hearings "on the mysteries swirling around Trump's bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies, and how those dark dealings affect our national security.
The committee is also looking at the administration's policy toward Saudi Arabia and response to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Texto completo: Admit it, you're housebound on this snow day and fed up with the kids, sick of the TV, or just ready for a distraction. We've compiled a big list of our favorite podcasts to help you pass the time. Put on your headphones and tune in.
Let's start with the Globe entries. We're biased, but they really are worth your while.
■ Love Letters: Season 1 covers breakups, Season 2 is about how to meet someone.
■ Last Seen: about the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum art heist.
■ Gladiator: covers the life and death of former Patriots player and convicted murderer Aaron Hernandez.
But wait, there's more. We asked our colleagues in the Globe newsroom to name other podcasts they love. They had too many to count. Here's a healthy list of a bunch that have them addicted, with a quick description of each. Some you've probably heard of, others were new even to us.
True Crime
■The Dropout: ABC's new podcast about Elizabeth Holmes and the scandal involving Theranos, the company she founded. As ABC puts it: “How did the world's youngest self-made female billionaire lose it all in the blink of an eye? How did the woman once heralded as “the next Steve Jobs" find herself facing criminal charges?"
■ Heaven's Gate: In 1997, 39 people took their own lives in an apparent mass suicide. The events captivated the media and had people across the planet asking the same question: “Why?"
■ In the Dark: Season 1 covered the abduction of Jacob Wetterling in 1989 and how it was unsolved for 27 years. Season 2 discussed the case of Curtis Flowers, who has been tried six times for the murders of four people.
■ Someone Knows Something: Now in its fourth season, this podcast from the CBC looks at unsolved disappearances and murders, and reinvestigates these cold cases.
■ Stranglers: In 19 months in the early 1960s, the Boston Strangler committed 13 murders and crimes. This podcast goes over what we know about the case, and discusses if the man who went to prison was the true perpetrator.
Entertainment/Pop culture
■ Armchair Expert: Actor Dax Shepard hosts this wide-ranging podcast, where he says he attempts “to discover human 'truths' without any laboratory work, clinical trials or data collection."
■ The Read: A podcast covering hip-hop and pop culture's “most trying stars."
■ You Must Remember This: Tells the stories of Old Hollywood, with some celebrity guest stars.
■ Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness: Van Ness is a personality from “Queer Eye," and this podcast covers (as the name suggests) anything he is just curious about, from medical marijuana to voting to astronomy and more.
■ Keep It: “A conversation at the intersection of pop culture and politics at a time when we're all obsessing over both."
■ Binge Mode: This podcast is currently binging its way through the Harry Potter books, three chapters at a time.
■ Reply All: This is “a podcast about the Internet" and goes over what you may have missed online.
■ The Rewatchables: Each episode, Bill Simmons gets together a group of folks to discuss movies that are, as the title states, rewatchable.
Food
■ Milk Street Radio: From Boston's own Christopher Kimball, the podcast says it “get[s] answers about home cooking, food, culture, wine, farming, restaurants, literature, and the lives and cultures of the people who grow, produce, and create the food we eat." Also has a call-in feature, where listeners ask their own questions directly.
■ The Splendid Table: Hosted by food writer Francis Lam, this calls itself “a culinary, culture and lifestyle program" and discusses life and food.
Storytelling
■ Family Secrets: Author Dani Shapiro dives deep into the well of family secrets with her guests. Shapiro, whose new memoir “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love" is now on the New York Times bestseller list, has a few family secrets of her own.
■ 2 Dope Queens: Hosted by Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams, this is a live comedy show in Brooklyn, where they discuss “stories about sex, romance, race, hair journeys, living in New York, and Billy Joel. Plus a whole bunch of other [expletive]."
■ The Moth: The Moth Radio Hour has been going for two decades strong, telling “true stories told live."
Life, work, and relationships
■ Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel: The podcast claims to take “you into the antechamber of intimate moments." It's couples sharing the deepest, darkest issues in their relationships with psychologist Esther Perel (and you).
■ On Being with Krista Tippett: “We pursue deep thinking and social courage, moral imagination and joy, to renew inner life, outer life, and life together."
■ The Mortified Podcast: Adults share their most embarrassing journals from childhood. Hilarity ensues.
■ Hiding in the Bathroom: A work podcast for women. In Season 3, “we'll be meeting women who are using digital organizing and social media to make serious change in the world."
Fiction
■ Homecoming: Recently made into a Amazon show of the same name — and starring Julia Roberts — the podcast “centers on a caseworker at an experimental facility, her ambitious supervisor, and a soldier eager to rejoin civilian life."
■ Limetown: In this podcast, Annie-Sage Whitehurst plays the fictional American Public Radio reporter Lia Haddock as she explores what happened to the people of Limetown, a small community where 300 residents mysteriously vanished.

Texto completo: There were ups and downs to the series of summits between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Their 1986 meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, began more positively than anyone had expected but ended in disappointment, partly because of an impasse over Reagan's"Star Wars" initiative.
The leaders kept trying, and their continued dialogue contributed to improved relations between the two superpowers. It's important to keep that kind of long-term view in mind on the heels of President Donald Trump's disappointing meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, last week with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The U.S. says the talks broke down because Mr. Kim sought the lifting of all economic sanctions in return for the dismantling of one nuclear facility; North Korea said it sought only the end of some sanctions and couldn't get the U.S. to budge. In the aftermath, each party had harsh words for the other, just as the Reagan and Gorbachev governments traded barbs when things didn't go well at their meetings.
The U.S. and North Korea agreed to keep communicating. They also agreed that North Korea would continue to honor a 16-month-long ban on ballistic and nuclear missile testing. That is a marked improvement over relations earlier in Mr. Trump's term, when North Korea conducted provocative missile tests, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Kim as"Little Rocket Man" and Mr. Kim vowed to "tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire."
South Korea is continuing its own productive dialogue with Mr. Kim, and that also is a hedge against North Korean retrenchment.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim now can return to their respective capitals and reevaluate their positions. Mr. Kim's intransigence signaled how severely U.S. sanctions are hurting him, and there is leverage to be gained from that. Mr. Trump also may be able to exert pressure through China, which long has been North Korea's lifeline but has an incentive now to avoid an escalating trade war with the U.S.
There still are dangerous waters ahead. North Korea has a large nuclear arsenal, and as a North Korean defector and former diplomat told The New York Times in a story last week, there is the risk of Mr. Kim selling his nuclear technology for much-needed cash.
The Soviet threat once seemed just as intractable.
While many factors contributed to the collapse of communism, the Reagan-Gorbachev dialogue certainly contributed. In December 1987, a little more than a year after the disappointment and hurt feelings at Reykjavik, Reagan and Gorbachev met in Washington and signed thelandmark Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. It contributed to peace for 30 years.

Texto completo: In his first novel since the acclaimed "Natchez Burning" trilogy, Mississippian Greg Iles offers readers a crime thriller with a fresh setting, new characters and a whole new set of troubles – topped off with a bundle of family secrets that lead to another shocking Iles ending.
"Cemetery Road" introduces Marshall McEwan – a successful Washington, D.C. journalist returning to his hometown of fictional Bienville, Mississippi, to run the family's newspaper in the wake of his father's illness. In a story of love, betrayal, corruption, and, of course, murder, the bonds of family and romantic interests are tested beyond a breaking point – all keeping McEwan a very busy man.
The author of 15 New York Times bestsellers, Iles has seen his novels made into films and published in more than 35 countries. He is a longtime member of the "lit-rock" group The Rock Bottom Remainders and lives in Natchez with his wife and has three children.
What was it like switching gears and sitting down to write your first novel since the Penn Cage trilogy?
I really needed a break from the travails of the Cage family, and from the worst years of the civil rights struggle. My readers probably do too. The "Natchez Burning" trilogy took me the better part of 10 years to write, and I nearly died (in a serious car accident) in 2011 while trying to finish the first volume.
"Cemetery Road" is just as intense as the trilogy in some ways, but it focuses less on race, and more on the secrets hidden in marriages and extended families. The secret at the heart of this book is pretty shocking, I think, but I don't want to say more than that.
The plot of "Cemetery Road" is filled with danger, crime and surprises – not to mention many regrettable relationships – in the fictitious river town of Bienville, with main character Marshall McEwen in the thick of it. How would you describe his personality (given his past tragedies and his relationship with his father), and the tumultuous events he faces on a daily basis?
As for Marshall McEwan, I think a lot of people can relate to him. He left the small town he grew up in, worked hard for success and fame, yet now he must return home to care for a dying father he's barely spoken to in 30 years.
That's the chief difference between Marshall and Penn Cage (in the "Natchez Burning" trilogy). Penn and Tom Cage loved and respected each other all their lives, but Marshall and his father were driven apart by a family tragedy when Marshall was only 14. Marshall's father blames him for that tragedy – unfairly. I think.
Marshall returns to Mississippi more to help his mother than to care for his father, but I think we want father and son to find a way to reconcile before the end, because Marshall got a lot of his strength and stubbornness from his dad. And he needs every bit of it to handle the SOBs he faces in "Cemetery Road."
Are there any threads of truth (from Mississippi or elsewhere) that were the basis for the goings-on of the Bienville group known as the Poker Club in "Cemetery Road"?
The Bienville Poker Club absolutely grew out of stories I heard as a boy growing up in Natchez, and from talking to Mississippians from many walks of life. The people who run small Southern towns are rarely those in the official power structure. Always been that way, and probably always will be.
As Robert Penn Warren knew, corruption is deeply ingrained in our lives, even in the human spirit. And in all politics, sadly... money talks louder than anything else.
Is it possible that we will hear from Marshall McEwan again? Perhaps a sequel or a brand new direction for McEwan. Or, can you tell us of any other ideas you may be working on for your next book?
You may well hear from Marshall again. I've been working behind the scenes in Mississippi politics for about three years, and that's given me some great ideas. I also have a very twisty noir story that's perfect for Marshall and for Nadine Sullivan, another new character in "Cemetery Road."
Another ambitious book tour has claimed your schedule for the month of March – with 27 stops in 19 days! – and once again with the kickoff in Mississippi cities. Tell me about the tour.
I'm always conflicted about my book tours. I like staying home on my country place. Racing to two or three cities a day for a month will wear you out quick. But it's the only time I get out among my readers, and I always have some wonderful experiences out there. Some people travel a long way to get to my book signings, and I try to give them a great talk, as well as visit with them a bit.
Signing
Greg Iles will sign copies of "Cemetery Road" at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday at Lemuria Books in Jackson, with a reading at 5:30 p.m.; he will also sign at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, Off Square Books, Oxford; and 5:30 p.m. Thursday, Turnrow Books, 304 Howard St., Greenwood

Kushner security records sought

Texto completo: Democrats step up
demands in probe
New questions aboutWhite House clearance House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to the security clearances of top officials by Monday, an escalation of a fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration that could lead to subpoenas in the coming days.
The move follows the revelation that President Trump interceded to give his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from intelligence and White House officials about Kushner's contacts with foreign individuals and his failure to disclose them on his clearance application. Both of those factors ordinarily would all but guarantee that an applicant not be given access to government secrets.
Overriding those concerns, the president in May 2018 directed his then-chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to approve the clearance application. Kelly, who had already stripped Kushner of an interim, temporary clearance, documented the president's intervention in a memo.
House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), in a letter to the White House on Friday, urged "full and immediate compliance" with requests the panel had made related to security clearances over the past two years. Cummings's staff in a Friday phone call with White House officials tried to confirm the existence of the Kelly memo and a second written by former White House counsel Donald McGahn. The White House refused three times to confirm or deny the documents' existence, Oversight Democrats said.
"I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation," Cummings said in the letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
While Cummings did not use the word "subpoena" in his letter, his recent correspondence with the White House suggests that he is open to one: Cummings told the White House in early February to let the committee know "whether you intend to comply voluntarily or whether the committee should consider alternative means to obtain this information."
U.S. officials who were charged with investigating Kushner's suitability to hold a security clearance grew concerned before Trump's son-in-law arrived at the White House. Law enforcement officials focused on meetings Kushner held in December 2016 with the Russian ambassador and a banker from Moscow, according to people familiar with the matter.
The meetings - with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Sergey Gorkov, the head of Vnesheconombank - were not initially reported on Kushner's security clearance forms.
Kushner held an interim clearance for much of the first year he worked in the White House. But his extensive foreign contacts, his complex business arrangements and his failure to disclose all the contacts on his form - which he amended three times - kept him from obtaining a full clearance, according to current and former officials familiar with the process, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive administration deliberations.
Adding to concerns, U.S. intelligence also intercepted conversations of foreign officials discussing how Kushner could be influenced because he was searching for financing to salvage a troubled real estate investment, according to people with knowledge of those intelligence reports. They also remarked that Kushner was naive about foreign policy, which made him pliable, these people said.
In February 2018, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein told McGahn that significant information developed in the course of Kushner's background investigation would delay his obtaining a permanent clearance, people familiar with the matter said. It's not clear that Rosenstein mentioned any specific problems.
But current and former U.S. officials said Kushner's debts were of particular concern at the time, including hundreds of millions he owed on an office building in Manhattan. When determining whether to grant a clearance, officials look for ways that foreign governments might exert leverage on a U.S. official, and financial distress is one red flag.
While he held an interim top-secret clearance, Kushner was able to get access to even more highly classified intelligence, known as sensitive compartmented information. Generally, that information comes from the government's most sensitive human or technical sources. In Kushner's case, he was able to read the president's daily intelligence briefing, sit in on meetings where classified information was discussed and issue orders, or tasking, to intelligence agencies, according to people familiar with the matter.
That all changed in late February 2018, when Kelly changed the rules for holders of interim clearances, stripping Kushner of his access. Then, in May, Trump ordered Kelly to make Kushner's clearance permanent.
Today, Kushner has a top- secret clearance, but he doesn't have the more sensitive compartmented clearances, according to U.S. officials.
The White House has argued that the president traditionally has broad authority over his executive staff and clearance matters. It has also sidestepped the House panel's request to interview employees in the White House Personnel Security Office, which oversees the clearance process.
Cummings's frustration with the lack of response was clear in his Friday letter.
"Since I sent my letter on January 23, I have been negotiating in good faith - and in private - to try to obtain the information the Committee needs to conduct its investigation," Cummings wrote. "However, over the past five weeks, the White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee."
Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump, Kushner's wife, have publicly denied that the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told the New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News last month that her father was not involved in the process.
A spokesman for Abbe Lowell, the lawyer for Kushner and Ivanka Trump, would not discuss the ABC interview or what clearances she holds.
"Whatever the accuracy or not of recent news stories, Mr. Lowell was not aware of nor told of any request for or action by the President to be involved in the security clearance process," said Peter Mirijanian, the spokesman. "Again, officials affirmed at the time that the regular process occurred without any pressure."
A person familiar with Ivanka Trump's account said she maintains that she spoke accurately to ABC.
The White House security clearance process has been a major focus for Oversight Committee Democrats over the past two years. Cummings garnered bipartisan support for his bid to investigate the matter in the wake of reports that Rob Porter, a former White House aide who had been accused of domestic violence, continued to work in a top position while holding only an interim security clearance.
At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and then-Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) joined Cummings in requesting more information about the process. When the White House ignored the requests, however, Gowdy refused Cummings's pleas to subpoena the information.
Now, with Democrats in charge of the House - and Cummings wielding expansive subpoena authority - the White House won't be able to ignore Congress's questions without the potential for an adverse response. Already, there has been an intense back-and-forth between the panel and the White House, as Cummings relaunches his own investigation and increases the pressure on the administration.
In his Jan. 23 letter to Cipollone, the lawmaker asked for a series of documents to be handed over to the panel, including the policy governing how the White House grants security clearances and any recent changes to the policy, particularly those to give classified information to people convicted of crimes or under investigation by law enforcement.
The panel also asked for all communications between Trump's transition team regarding background investigations, clearance applications and the outcomes for nearly 10 top officials it wanted to home in on. That list included Kushner as well as national security adviser John Bolton; Bolton's predecessor Michael Flynn; Flynn's son; and Sebastian Gorka, a former White House official.
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that former White House aide Rob Porter was denied a security clearance. He was granted an interim clearance.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump last year ordered officials to grant top-secret security clearance to his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, according to a report published Thursday by The New York Times.
Kushner was granted the high-level clearance last May after a lengthy background check.
The Times, citing anonymous sources, said Trump demanded Kushner's clearance despite the concerns of intelligence officials, then-Chief of Staff John Kelly and then-White House counsel Don McGahn.
The newspaper said Kelly wrote in an internal memo that he had been "ordered to give top-secret clearance to Kushner. McGahn wrote a memo in which he advised against such clearance.
Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Kushner lawyer Abbe Lowell, responded Thursday to the Times story with a statement, saying: "In 2018, White House and security clearance officials affirmed that Mr. Kushner's security clearance was handled in the regular process with no pressure from anyone. That was conveyed to the media at the time, and new stories, if accurate, do not change what was affirmed at the time.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders declined to comment on the Times story.
Rep. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, said Thursday that the Times report "indicates that President Trump may have granted access to our country's most sensitive classified information to his son-in-law against the advice of career staff - directly contradicting the President's public denials that he played any role.
Trump told Times reporters in January that he "was never involved with Kushner's security clearance.
Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and Kushner's wife, said in February that the president did not play a role in granting security clearances to her or Kushner.

Texto completo: ALBANY - Gov. Andrew Cuomo and supporters of bringing an Amazon headquarters to New York City have bolstered their efforts in recent days to try to get the online retail giant to reconsider the decision to drop its plans for the city.
Cuomo has talked with Amazon officials and even founder Jeff Bezos to try to get the Seattle-based company to come back to Long Island City in Queens after it pulled out of the deal Feb. 14 amid local opposition.
"I've had many conversations with Amazon. I hope that they reconsider. Up until now we haven't seen any change in their position," Cuomo told reporters Thursday.
Cuomo's comments were followed soon after by an open letter to Bezos from more than 70 business groups, politicians and unions imploring him to reconsider the decision to dump its plans for a headquarters in the city that promised at least 25,000 jobs.
"New York attracts the best, most diverse talent from across the globe," the letter said.
"We are a dynamic new center of the country's most inclusive tech economy. We all hope you reconsider and join us in building the exciting future of New York."
Can it work? Cuomo has been working behind the scenes with Amazon officials, including Bezos, to try to salvage the deal, the New York Times reported Thursday.
So far, though, it appears Amazon hasn't budged. The company declined comment Friday.
While some unions signed onto the letter, other unions and some local political leaders still remain opposed to the Amazon deal.
They have criticized the $3 billion that New York City and the state pledged to the company and expressed concern about the impact on local housing prices and services if Amazon were to move in.
And some state senators took exception to Cuomo's pledge to Amazon that he would make sure that if Amazon returns, he would personally shepherd the deal with the state bureaucracy.
"'The Governor will take over the process.' (shaking my head), what a tyrant," Sen. Julia Salazar, D-Queens, wrote on Twitter.
Cuomo's pledge Indeed, the letter and a statement from Cuomo's spokeswoman indicated he would be more directly involved if Amazon were to revive its plans for the city.
"Governor Cuomo will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval and Mayor de Blasio will work together with the governor to manage the community development process," the letter said.
Cuomo's spokeswoman Dani Lever put the blame on Senate Democrats for their opposition to Amazon, particularly Queens Sen. Mike Gianaris.
"The State Senate made a terrible blunder — everyone, including their members, knows it — and 70 percent of New Yorkers affirmed it," Lever said. "The governor will take over the process and can comfortably assure Amazon the approval will get done."
Senate Democratic Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, indicated Thursday night the Senate would be receptive to talking again with Amazon.
""I have always been clear that I support job creation and was disappointed with Amazon's decision and hoped they would reconsider," she said in a statement.
"I have also repeatedly indicated my willingness to work with Amazon in the best interests of our state and affected communities. It is clear that this process exposed serious flaws in our economic development programs that need to be reformed for future projects."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Top House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to its security clearances process by Monday, an escalation of the yearslong fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration that could lead to subpoenas in the coming days.
The move follows an explosive report that President Donald Trump interceded to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from top intelligence officials. The president directed his then-chief of staff, John Kelly, to approve the application - a move Kelly, who had expressed concerns about the entire process, later detailed in a memo.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., in a letter to the White House on Friday, urged "full and immediate compliance" with outstanding requests the panel had made related to security clearances for much of the past two years.
"I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation," Cummings said in the letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
While Cummings did not use the word subpoena in his letter, his recent correspondence with the White House suggested he is open to one: Cummings told the White House in early February to let the committee know "whether you intend to comply voluntarily or whether the committee should consider alternative means to obtain this information."
The White House still has not given the panel documents, arguing instead that the president traditionally has broad authority over his executive staff and clearance matters.
Cummings' frustration with the lack of response was clear in his Friday letter.
"Since I sent my letter on January 23, I have been negotiating in good faith - and in private - to try to obtain the information the Committee needs to conduct its investigation," Cummings wrote. "However, over the past five weeks, the White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee."
Cummings' letter cited reports that Kushner, a senior White House adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner a long-delayed clearance and that Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem early last year. Trump's push to get Kushner clearance - and the chief of staff's concerns about it - was first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance. The Washington Post later reported on Trump's actions.
Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump have publicly denied the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told The New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance for his son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News earlier this month that her father was not involved in the process.
In the first year of the administration, Kushner held an interim security clearance that allowed him to view both top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, which is classified intelligence related to sensitive sources. With that designation, he has been able to attend classified briefings, get access to the president's daily intelligence report and issue requests for information to the intelligence community.
But there was widespread concern in the White House about Kushner's lack of a permanent clearance. Indeed, Democrats on Capitol Hill are also now questioning why Kushner had such trouble attaining that status.
"These new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, and why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this committee," Cummings wrote Friday.
The White House security clearance process has been a major focus for Oversight Committee Democrats over the past two years. Cummings even garnered bipartisan support for his bid to investigate the matter in the wake of reports that Rob Porter, a former White House aide who had been accused of beating his ex-wife, had been denied a clearance but still worked in a top position.
At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and then-Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., joined Cummings in requesting more information about the process. When the White House ignored the requests, however, Gowdy refused Cummings' pleas to subpoena the information.

Producer Relents on 'Mockingbird' Rights, Letting Local Shows Go On

Texto completo: The Broadway producer Scott Rudin, facing a barrage of criticism over his efforts to shut down productions of "To Kill a Mockingbird" around the United States, on Friday offered an olive branch to the affected theaters, letting them put on a version of the play.
At least eight theaters from California to Massachusetts were being forced to cancel productions of "Mockingbird" that would have used a decades-old script by the playwright Christopher Sergel. Mr. Rudin, whose "Mockingbird" now playing on Broadway uses a new script by Aaron Sorkin, invoked a contractual provision that prevents theaters around many cities from putting on the play while a version is playing on Broadway.
The clause is intended to protect the financial viability of Broadway productions, but Mr. Rudin's moves, reported Thursday by The New York Times, were criticized by many as bigfooting.
Mr. Rudin called several of the theaters -- some of them tiny nonprofits with all-volunteer staffs -- to apologize, to explain what happened and to offer them the scripts to the new adaptation. Mr. Rudin said there would be no fee for use of the new script.
The offer was extended to any theater whose rights to stage the old version had been challenged by Mr. Rudin's legal team.
But as a practical matter, the offer was too late for some of the theater companies, which had already rehearsed the older script, and were days away from beginning performances. At least one, the Kavinoky Theater in Buffalo, had already torn down its set after receiving a threatening letter from Mr. Rudin's lawyer.
Some of the theaters, though, said they would accept Mr. Rudin's offer and stage the Sorkin version.
"This is wonderful," said Jill Brennan-Lincoln, chairwoman of the theater arts department at Azusa Pacific University, a Christian college outside Los Angeles that had been planning to cancel its production of the play after getting a cease-and-desist letter from Mr. Rudin's lawyers. "A.P.U. is grateful and excited about the prospect of producing Sorkin's version."
Lyn Adams, the executive director of the Oklahoma Children's Theater, which had abandoned its plan to produce the Sergel script, was also intrigued, saying that "if given the opportunity, we definitely could and most likely would take them up."
Doug DeGirolamo, president of Hill Country Theater in Buda, Tex., said he had received a copy of the Sorkin script from Mr. Rudin's office and was hoping to stage it. "For our small little theater to do a show that's on Broadway right now would be a huge boon to us," he said.
But his theater's production will have to be delayed so the cast can learn new lines and movements, and some actors have already taken other roles, he said.
Mr. Rudin defended his actions in a brief statement, saying, "As stewards of the performance rights of Aaron Sorkin's play, it is our responsibility to enforce the agreement we made with the Harper Lee estate and to make sure that we protect the extraordinary collaborators who made this production."
But he also blamed the situation on the Dramatic Publishing Company, which is run by Christopher Sergel III, Mr. Sergel's grandson, saying it had erred in issuing licenses to present the play to theaters that should not have received them. Mr. Rudin has argued that a 1969 agreement between Ms. Lee, the author of the novel, and Dramatic Publishing bars productions by theaters within 25 miles of a city that in 1960 had a population of more than 150,000 people, as well as productions using professional actors, when a "first-class" production is running on Broadway or on tour.
"We have been hard at work creating what I hope might be a solution for those theater companies that have been affected by this unfortunate set of circumstances, in which rights that were not available to them were licensed to them by a third party who did not have the right to do so," Mr. Rudin said. "In an effort to ameliorate the hurt caused here, we are offering each of these companies the right to perform our version of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' Aaron Sorkin's play currently running on Broadway."
Mr. Sergel declined to comment.
It was an unusually conciliatory gesture for Mr. Rudin, who has a reputation in the theater industry for being strong-willed and litigious. Before the Broadway adaptation opened, he was locked in a legal battle with the Lee estate, which argued that the play departed too much from the novel; the dispute was eventually settled.
It is also rare for a hit Broadway show to grant licenses to local theaters, particularly when a national tour is anticipated. Mr. Rudin's "Mockingbird" has grossed $24 million since opening in December.
When news broke that local theaters were canceling their performances after Mr. Rudin's lawyer threatened them with copyright infringement lawsuits, many supporters of community theater were outraged. Some called for a boycott of Mr. Rudin's productions, using the hashtag #boycottRudinplays.
"Unfortunately this issue has been the shot heard 'round the fine arts world over recent days," said Davis Varner, the president of the board of the Theater of Gadsden, a community theater in Alabama that is planning to stage the Sergel version this month. The theater is not near a big city, so its rights appear to be unchallenged, but Mr. Varner issued a statement referring to Mr. Rudin as "the bully from Broadway" and said, "I am saddened and disappointed for those groups who have been forced to cancel their productions through no fault of their own."
Others took to social media to vent their unhappiness.
Some community theaters are intrigued by Mr. Rudin's offer but wary of the logistical challenges involved in staging a completely different version of the play on such short notice. While Mr. Sorkin's version closely tracks Ms. Lee's novel -- the story of Atticus Finch, a small-town lawyer in Alabama who defends a black man, Tom Robinson, against false charges -- it follows a dramatically different narrative structure, and gives more prominent roles to the novel's two main African-American characters, Robinson and Calpurnia, the Finch family cook.
Seth Miller, the executive artistic director of the Grand Theater in Salt Lake City, which canceled its planned production of "Mockingbird," said it was too late for his theater to mount a different version of the play in the scheduled time slot. It would have to do it next season, but he said he was not sure how long Mr. Rudin's offer was good for.
For some, like the Dayton Playhouse in Ohio, which was scheduled to stage "Mockingbird" on March 8, there was little time for the cast to prepare.
"At best we could mount a reading," said Matthew Lindsay, the chairman of the theater's board, describing a performance in which the actor would hold scripts. "The optimal situation would be that Mr. Rudin offers us the opportunity to perform the Sergel script."

Texto completo: Jamilka Borges, who oversees kitchens at The Independent Brewing Co., Hidden Harbor and Lorelei, and Bar Marco are among seven Pittsburgh restaurants or restaurateurs named as semifinalists for the prestigious James Beard Awards.
The winners in each category will be announced May 6 at the James Beard Gala in Chicago. Here are the semifinalists from the Pittsburgh region:
Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic: Jamilka Borges, The Independent Brewing Co.; Kristin Butterworth, Lautrec at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort; Wei Zhu, Chengdu Gourmet.
Outstanding Restaurateur: Richard DeShantz and Tolga Sevdik, Richard DeShantz Restaurant Group (Poulet Bleu, Fish nor Fowl, Butcher and the Rye, Tako, and Meat and Potatoes).
Outstanding Wine Program: Bar Marco.
Outstanding Wine, Spirits or Beer Producer: Meredith Meyer Grelli, Wigle Whiskey.
Rising Star Chef of the Year: Becca Hegarty, Bitter Ends Luncheonette.
To address race and gender imbalances in the industry, the James Beard Foundation updated its rules in October and made internal changes to diversify the selection of nominees. The foundation wanted nominees to better reflect the population of the U.S. and, certainly, the restaurant industry.
"The idea is to make sure it's more indicative of who is working in the industry and that people are doing what they should be doing," Anne Quatrano, the Atlanta chef who oversees the awards, told The New York Times.
Last year, in response to #MeToo in particular, the foundation asked the judges - more than 300 previous James Beard winners, 250 panelists and the 18 restaurant and chef awards committee members - to consider the culture of restaurants and chefs' behavior in selecting nominees.
Earning a James Beard award is among the highest accolades in the restaurant industry, with a committee of regional and national judges weighing in on nominees. The judges' and committee members' votes will whittle the semifinalist list to five finalists per category, to be announced March 27. All votes count equally and are tabulated by the independent accounting firm Lutz and Carr. The five semifinalists with the highest number of votes will become the nominees.
The national list of nominees can be found on the James Beard website.

Texto completo: Former Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren has signed on with Gray Television as a national political analyst.

"After more than 20 years on cable news platforms, I am thrilled to move to broadcast news and especially excited to join Gray Television’s journalists all across the country," Van Susteren said in a statement Thursday. "It's a journalist's dream to be part of a growing media company so focused on delivering quality news in local markets big and small through trusted, local institutions like Gray's television stations."

Van Susteren suddenly left Fox News in 2016 after 14 years with the company because "Fox has not felt like home to me for a few years." According to Van Susteren's husband and agent John Coale, "someone came to our house and delivered two letters" from the network. He told the New York Times that the message was that Van Susteren was out of a job. The move came after Van Susteren said she planned to invoke her exit clause, amid discussions to negotiate a better conditions in her contract.

"There's so much chaos" at Fox, Coale said. "It's very hard to work there."

After joining MSNBC in 2017, Van Susteren separated with the network after less than six months on the job.

"I am out at MSNBC," she tweeted in June 2017.

Coale said the move came as a surprise, even though ratings for her 6 p.m. time slot were low.

"They didn't want her anymore," Coale told the New York Times after MSNBC notified his wife. "We're in kind of shock."

According to Gray Television, which recently acquired Raycom Media for $3.6 billion, Van Susteren will provide analysis on national and international politics. Gray also announced two nationally syndicated shows with Van Susteren are in the works.

"We're thrilled to have someone with Greta’s depth of experience join our team," said Hilton Howell Jr., Gray chairman and CEO. "Our stations and our viewers will benefit from Greta's no-nonsense, straightforward approach to complex political issues."

Gray Television a publicly traded company founded in 1946 and based out of Atlanta, owns or operates 145 stations in the U.S. within 91 TV markets. The company received approval in December for the $3.6 billion acquisition of Raycom Media, making Gray Television the third-largest owner of local television stations in the U.S.

D.C. Memo: From combs to Cohen

Autor: Putz, Andrew.

Texto completo: Welcome to the D.C. Memo, where all the men are cheats, all the first ladies deserve apologies and all the Don Jrs. have the worst judgment in the world. Sorry, still recovering from Michael Cohen’s testimony Wednesday in front of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Which we’ll get to, of course, but there’s a couple of other things to talk about first, like the House’s decision to remind itself it’s a co-equal branch of government and the fallout from Amy Klobuchar’s creative utensil choices. Onward:
Three big things
1. Border vote: We realize it seems like it was, like, decades ago, but it was in fact this week that the U.S. House voted to block President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to address U.S.-Mexico border crossings. And while the measure is far from a sure thing to make it through the Senate, and has even less of a chance of becoming law, the episode provided a window into just how contentious the next two years are going to get in Washington. As the New York Times reports: “The resolution of disapproval, which passed 245 to 182, must now be taken up by the Senate, where three Republicans have already declared their support, only one short of the number needed for Congress to ratify a stinging rebuke of Mr. Trump’s efforts.” More important: “The debate over the merits of Mr. Trump’s national emergency declaration has led some lawmakers to suggest that Congress should re-evaluate how much power it has shifted to the executive branch and the scope of the National Emergencies Act.” You think?
Predictably, on Thursday Trump started lobbying Republican senators, in his way: “President Trump warned Thursday that fellow Republicans who vote to nullify his national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border are putting themselves ‘at great jeopardy’ politically,” writes The Washington Post’s John Wagner. “Trump’s comments come as the Senate prepares to vote on a measure aimed at thwarting the president’s use of the declaration to direct billions of dollars more in funding to border barriers than Congress has authorized. ‘I think that really it’s a very dangerous thing for people to be voting against border security,’ Trump said in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. ‘I really think that Republicans that vote against border security and the wall, I think you know, I’ve been okay at predicting things, I think they put themselves at great jeopardy.’”
Also, in related developments that strike the Memo as just a little too on-the-nose: this happened.
2. Her time has comb. In this week’s edition of “Chasing Amy,” our kinda sorta semi-official series keeping tabs on U.S. senators from Minnesota not named Tina Smith running for president, we check in on a story that broke too late for last week’s memo: a New York Times piece devoted to investigating whether it was true that Amy Klobuchar once ate a salad with a comb. Sure, the Times piece also touched on a bunch of stuff that had already been reported by other outlets — notably HuffPost and BuzzFeed News — that said Klobuchar had a penchant for throwing office products at staffers, among other harrowing habits of inspiring bosses. (I mean, who hasn’t told underlings, “I would trade three of you for a bottle of water”?) But, really, the comb was the star.
As you might expect, some people had fun with the Times story, and some people sort of hated it, partly because the Times-i-ness of it all, and partly because the bill of particulars against Klobuchar seemed pear-shaped, with much of the most salient if less sexy information — like the notion that the Senator Next Door reacts to a misplaced comma and constitutional crisis in roughly the same manner — being somewhat buried at the end.
The story also immediately got pushback from Kloby-world, most notably from a group of 61 former Klobuchar staffers who published a letter on Medium taking issue with the reports and offering support for their old boss. “Unfortunately, the positive anecdotes and stories we experienced have not been fully reported by the Times and other media. We do not believe these reports adequately describe our thoughts on Amy Klobuchar, many of which we shared with the authors. … She was there for us in the hard times, too. And at the office, she pushed us to be better professionals and public servants. We remain grateful for our time in Senator Klobuchar’s office and still consider Amy a mentor and friend. Sadly, this was not fully conveyed in the recent news reports.”
3. Zen Cohen. Which brings us to Wednesday, when former Trump fixer/attorney Michael Cohen went before the House Oversight and Reform Committee and talked about, in no particular order: hush money payments, a Moscow Trump Tower, the Wikileaks email dump, Trump’s SAT scores, bone spurs, “shithole” countries, book deals, ripping off small business owners, and how Trump basically considered his 2016 presidential campaign to be one big marketing scheme. From Politico:
President Donald Trump’s former attorney and fixer on Wednesday laid out a series of damning accusations against the president, presenting evidence of alleged lies and criminal conduct and expressing remorse over his decade of service to a man he described as unstable and racist.
Michael Cohen testified to the House Oversight Committee that Trump directed him to lie about the president’s knowledge of hush-money payments, that Trump was informed about plans to dump Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential campaign and was kept in the loop about a Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.
The explosive comments from Cohen during a sharply partisan House hearing contradict Trump’s previous claims and expose Trump and some of his closest advisers to new legal and political trouble, potentially including impeachment, as Democrats used the hearing to draw out evidence of wrongdoing by the president.
Cohen sought redemption by revealing what he said is the true character of the commander in chief and apologizing to lawmakers for lying to them in previous testimony. In stunning daylong testimony, Cohen became the highest-profile witness to testify against a sitting president since former White House counsel John Dean took the stand against President Richard Nixon.
“I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is,” Cohen said Wednesday in his opening statement. “He is a racist, he is a conman, and he is a cheat.”
Indeed, there was so much disgorged by Cohen that it was hard to keep track of it all, let alone know what was important. Alas, this is why God and beltway journalism invented the takeaway, of which there were, oh, just a couple:
From the NYT: “Five Takeaways From Cohen’s Testimony to Congress”
From Politico: “Key moments from Michael Cohen’s House testimony”
More Politico: “Michael Cohen’s most fiery accusations against Trump”
From CNN: “6 takeaways from the Michael Cohen hearing”
From The Guardian: “Key takeaways from the former Trump lawyer’s testimony”
From Wired: “5 Key Takeaways from Michael Cohen’s Prepared Testimony to Congress”
From the Wall Street Journal: “Six Key Takeaways From the Michael Cohen Hearing”
From Breitbart: “Eight Times Michael Cohen’s Testimony Cleared Trump of All Wrongdoing”
The week in takes
* Republican Rep. Justin Amash: Republicans don’t actually care about the Constitution
* First Son Donald Trump, Jr.: The Oscars are bad (and also all about President Trump)
* First Daughter Ivanka Trump: People should have to work to earn what they have
Your weekend read
On Wednesday, the summit between Trump and Kim Jong-un collapsed over sanctions. Though the North Korean leader offered to dismantle the country’s principle nuclear facility if the United States lifted its sanctions on the DPRK, Kim wouldn’t promise to do the same for other parts of its weapons program, and Trump bolted. “Sometimes you have to walk,” said told reporters in Hanoi, where the talks were being held.
Before the summit, the Times’ Jane Perlez talked to Thae Yong-ho, one of the highest ranking diplomats to defect from North Korea in recent years — an interview that offers some rare and pretty scary insights into Kim, his motivations, and why it’s doubtful he will ever willingly give up his nukes:
Is Mr. Kim serious about dismantling his nuclear weapons, or is he meeting with President Trump out of vanity or to preserve his family dynasty?
He is just doing this for the preservation of his family. The main goal of Kim Jong-un’s meeting with Trump is first to buy time, and second, get sanctions relief. Finally, he wants the status that comes with being a nuclear power.
Who is most threatened by North Korea’s nuclear weapons?
Kim Jong-un wants his dictatorship and dynasty to go on. If you want to control North Korean society, you have to make South Korea afraid of North Korea. The existence of South Korea is itself a direct threat to the North Korean system.
He wants to make sure South Korea stays in South Korean territory, and does not extend it. That is his first goal.
Kim Jong-un wants to keep his military in balance with South Korea. But he knows the North Korean military cannot afford modern tanks and guns. He knows this balance is changing unfavorably for North Korea. Nuclear weapons are the only way to keep the balance with South Korea.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: feedback@minnpost.com.

Sex abuse in the Catholic Church demands action

Texto completo: To many Roman Catholics worldwide, the very fact of senior bishops listening to victims of clerical sexual abuse and the pope condemning the evil in vivid language no doubt came as a shock.
The main body of the church has long shifted away from the United States and Western Europe, and the faithful in Africa, Asia and Latin America have not yet confronted the blight of predatory clergymen and institutional deafness to the extent of Americans or Europeans.
That is likely to be the explanation given by the Vatican for the lack of concrete measures to combat the crisis after a meeting heralded as a mighty counterattack by hierarchy and its activist pope against the evil ravaging their church: The global flock needs to see and hear first, and the change must arise from their own episcopate, they'll say.
It doesn't wash.
And not only because activists in the West are fed up with pledges of change in the 17 years since The Boston Globe revealed systematic abuse in the Boston diocese.
The revelations have accelerated in recent years — the grand jury report from Pennsylvania of abuse by hundreds of priests over many years; a similar report from Illinois; nuns finally speaking out about what they've been subjected to.
As the revelations have escalated, so has the rhetoric. "Prepare for divine justice," Pope Francis warned abusive priests at Christmas. "Ravenous wolves," he called them in his speech to the Vatican gathering. But when it came to action, the talk was once again of changing hearts and minds, of changing a centuries-old culture.
It doesn't wash because what is happening is not a personal moral lapse, to be treated as a sin to address through penitence and prayer, but a crime in which the church has been an accomplice. Priests who are credibly shown to abuse children should be thrown out of the pulpit and identified to civil authority; bishops who cover up their actions should be laicized and exposed, and the order to do so must come from the top, from the pontiff.
The church has always been harsh on matters of sex, whether demanding celibacy of its priests, condemning birth control or prohibiting homosexual sex. Once the pope publicly acknowledges that priestly pedophilia is prevalent, the shock will not be softened by deferring action.
Of course, it is important that the church investigate what in its culture gives rise to such perversity. Pope Francis has demonstrated an admirable openness on many once-taboo issues, and his anguished remarks on the clerical abuse scandal no doubt come from the heart.
But a malignancy whose primary victims are trusting children must be treated by immediate and radical measures, not by appeals or hand-wringing. The time for that is past.

A shocking number of Jews have become willing collaborators in white supremacy

Texto completo: This week, the son of a Holocaust survivor sat before Congress and testified about how he had helped install a white supremacist “autocrat" as President of the United States.
Nothing better illustrates the liminal position in which American Jews find ourselves now.
We have witnessed a powerful resurgence of anti-Semitism that has infiltrated both places of power and the public square. We've seen it marching through the streets of Charlottesville, slaughtering 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue, and snaking from the mouths of politicians and elected officials in the current administration.
Yet even as white nationalists wish us dead, a shocking number of Jews have become willing collaborators in white supremacy — not only public bigots such as Ben Shapiro and David Horowitz, but kapos in the openly ethnonationalist Trump regime, such as Stephen Miller or Jared Kushner.
Thus we are capable of being both the target of racism and a part of its apparatus.
That could not be clearer than in the tragic figure of Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime fixer.
In his opening statement to the House Advisory Committee this week, Cohen made a point of mentioning that his father, Maurice, had survived a concentration camp before immigrating to the United States. Cohen went on to describe, with understandable irony, the decades he spent enabling the rise of a “racist" — Cohen's word — who used xenophobia to consolidate his power, and tore apart families to put children of immigrants seeking asylum into camps.
“I let you down," he said, addressing his father.
Maybe he was talking to all of us.
On the stand, Cohen wasn't the sad-sack schmendrick we expected from his perp walk photos. Instead he was uncomfortably familiar — another striver hungering for power, money, and affirmation.
And something more: survival.
Cohen grew up knowing, better than most — better than the many American Jews who experienced the Holocaust at a further remove — that white supremacy could turn on us at any moment. “Wherever we go, Jews are like guppies swimming in an ocean filled with sharks," the writer Peter Trachtenberg put it: “Or with big, unidentified fish that may turn out to be sharks, we're never sure."
In his life, Cohen chose one of the oldest minority survival tactics — assimilation into white supremacy and its agendas. The essence of this strategy is collaboration, capitulation, and cowardice. It's the hope that when they're rounding people up, they'll come for someone else first, and maybe never get around to you and yours. Maybe you can even slow that progress by rounding people up yourself.
In doing so, Cohen was following in the footsteps of Roy Cohn, Trump's old mentor. Cohn had been Joseph McCarthy's right hand in the Red Scare witch hunt of the 1950s, the lawyer who helped send Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to the electric chair, a gay Jew who sold out Jews and homosexuals without a second thought.
Like Cohn, Cohen was willing to cozy up to the racism of those he sought to serve. Growing up on Long Island, Cohen had been a Trump stan since high school. Trump's bigotry was already obvious then — it runs all the way back to the 1970s when the Department of Justice took him and his father to court for discrimination. Perhaps that very bigotry was part of Trump's allure for Cohen.
In 2001, Cohen began investing in Trump properties and convinced his own family members to do so too — literally buying his way into Trump's regard. By 2011, Cohen — who at 22 had volunteered on Mike Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign — was an executive in the Trump Organization and had become known as Trump's “pit bull." It was actually Cohen's idea, that year, to start exploring the possibility of a Trump presidential run.
Cohen continued to cover for Trump — even assembling a “diversity coalition" to give his boss's xenophobia plausible deniability — right up until the end.
But just as Trump dropped Roy Cohn when Cohn got AIDS (“Donald pisses icewater," was Cohn's judgement on his former protegé), he had no compunctions about treating his new fixer with contempt, barking at him in front of others, and playing him off against other retainers. Rather than a pit bull, the New York Times called Cohen Trump's punching bag.
Top moments from Cohen's testimony
https://d32e4p2yfip7hy.cloudfront.net/wp-bostonglobe/2019/02/27/5c77113846e0fb000b866d08/5c77113ae4b0510baa872183_1466500054195-emrowc_t_1551307070414_1280_720_2000.mp4 There were several eye-popping snippets involving Trump — some of which could open the door to more inquiries into the president.
On June 20 — six weeks after the FBI raided his office, and five days after Trump publicly disowned him, refusing to pay his legal fees — Cohen began to display something like a conscience.
He resigned as deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, reportedly citing a conversation with his father as a turning point. Maurice Cohen reportedly told his son that he hadn't survived the Holocaust just to see the family name “sullied" by Trump.
“As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor," Cohen wrote in his resignation letter, “the images and sounds of [Trump's] family separation policy is [sic] heart wrenching."
On Monday, when Cohen used the national spotlight to address the president directly, he sounded like a new man: “You don't separate families from one another or demonize those looking to America for a better life," Cohen said. “You don't vilify people based on the God they pray to."
He continued, “To those who support the president and his rhetoric as I once did, I pray the country doesn't make the same mistakes I have made, or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying."
He could easily have been addressing his fellow Jews.
Cohen's collaboration with a racist regime was simply a more extreme version of the same deal so many light-skinned Jews make with white supremacy.
Even those of us who consider ourselves liberal or progressive can be deeply ambivalent about the conditional whiteness bestowed upon us in the United States over the past 60 years. We work in the all-white office and we never point out that it's all white. We move our children to a whiter school — not because we care about race, we say, but because education is so important. We laugh at the racist joke. We hedge our bets. White supremacy is a protection racket; it offers security on one hand and a lethal threat on the other.
Other minorities make this bargain too, sometimes — look at Ben Carson and Clarence Thomas — but Jews more easily succumb because so many of us easily pass as white.
Note that this strategy has never worked for us. It didn't protect us in Spain, or England, or France, or Germany. There's no reason to think it will work now.
And it certainly did not work for Cohen.
At the heart of this moment is the question of how we survive as a minority population. As history curves in on itself, as fascism repeats itself, we have only one advantage: unlike other places where ethnonationalism has flourished, the US is fast approaching a plurality of minorities. Coalition is white supremacy's worst nightmare — that's why so many white supremacists are fighting so hard against it. Look no further than former Republican Maine governor (and proto-Trump) Paul LePage, who the day after Cohen's testimony publicly defended the electoral college on the basis that it keeps minorities from having an equal vote.
A rising tide of racism drowns us all. White supremacist fears of a majority-minority nation don't target any one group alone — they are interconnected, as we saw when anti-immigrant xenophobia fueled the killings of Jews in Pittsburgh.
If Jews are going to survive the future, we will have to stand with people of color for our mutual benefit.
In the final moments of Wednesday's hearing, Representative Elijah Cummings — the black son of sharecroppers — preached a sermon of redemption.
“I don't know why this is happening for you," he told Cohen. “But it's my hope that a small part of it is for our country to be better."
Standing before him, Cohen wept.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES -- You keep insisting that this city's artists don't need New York's approval, and then what happens? When the whole world shows up at the biggest coming-out party yet for the Los Angeles art market, it takes place against a Manhattan facade.
Over half a century, L.A. has nursed its own practice of artistic experimentation, steered by the best art education programs in the country, with its own traditions of airy minimalism, wily conceptual projects, abject installations, and politically engaged performance and public art. The galleries and collectors around it have matured to the point that London's Frieze Art Fair staged its first West Coast edition in late February on a Hollywood backlot built to resemble a New York street.
[ View some of the memorable moments from the Frieze and Felix art fairs. ]
Audiences did not need an advanced degree in semiotics to get the joke. As Travis Diehl, among the most perceptive young art critics in this rambling city, wrote in 2017, "NY thrills to style LA as a golden-hour dreamland that never quite wakes up; LA gladly concedes to NY the status of the overbearing and immutable reality it rejects." They're thoroughly codependent, New York and Los Angeles, and affirm their cultural identities by looking at the other with oscillating dismissal and envy.
So as the latest New York Times critic to go spelunking in this city's museums, galleries, studios and alternative spaces, from Brentwood to Boyle Heights, let me get my verdict out of the way fast. Is Los Angeles, in 2019, the equal of New York as a center for contemporary art? Sure, of course it is.
But the more pressing inquiry is: In what ways does Los Angeles now stand out in the global art system? Could its rise help us rethink what an art scene can be -- a place where art schools still drive the conversation more than money does, where artists have the freedom to lead their own initiatives, where Latin American art holds as much sway as the European tradition? Or does it portend a flattening of Los Angeles into just another entrepôt of a single art system -- one less and less distinct from New York?
Museum Metamorphosis
Los Angeles's museums are in fine fettle, if significant transition. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is emptying out its old Ahmanson Building and hoping for final approval of the most ambitious, even daredevil, museum project in America: a nearly 400,000-square foot concrete U.F.O. that will hover across Wilshire Boulevard, designed by the Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. But as important has been Lacma's effort to distribute the museum's wealth to satellite spaces around town. (So far the museum has presented a show of Latino art and activism at an elementary school near MacArthur Park.)
The museum has also had a recent hiring coup, bringing on the superb curator Naima J. Keith, who has brought new vitality to the California African-American Museum. The highlight of its current programming is Robert Rauschenberg's 190-panel assemblage "The 1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece" (through June 9), though perhaps I am too sour a New Yorker to appreciate the wall of stills from Alfonso Cuarón's "Roma," which looked more like an Oscar campaign than an exhibition.
[ Read more about Robert Rauschenberg's quarter-mile-long mural. ]
The Hammer Museum, currently hosting an important retrospective of the Los Angeles-trained artist Allen Ruppersberg (through May 12), is also set to expand. Downtown, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles -- a reboot of the Santa Monica Museum of Art -- has put down roots; and the Broad continues to draw lines to its ultra-blue-chip permanent collection and to traveling shows like "Soul of a Nation," arriving March 23.
The problem child of the last decade has been the Museum of Contemporary Art, across the street. Not long ago it was the most venturesome modern art museum in the country, recasting the history of postwar American art in shows like "A Minimal Future?" (2004) and "WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution" (2007). But the museum ran multimillion-dollar deficits, raided its endowment, and nearly collapsed in 2008. Neither Jeffrey Deitch nor Philippe Vergne, the last two directors, could stabilize it. Will a third New York veteran, the former MoMA PS1 director Klaus Biesenbach, be the charm?
It's far too soon to say, but MOCA today is a more hopeful place than it's been in a while. I was drawn to some surprises in its permanent collection, like a cloth work from 1977 by the South Korean conceptualist Kim Yong-ik, donated in 2017, before Mr. Biesenbach's arrival. A scalding new addition by Cameron Rowland, one of New York's smartest young artists, amends MOCA's donor recognition wall to reflect how the museum's site on Grand Avenue, formerly a melting pot of Latino and Asian families, was razed and redeveloped.
Elsewhere, MOCA has wisely closed its western satellite at the Pacific Design Center, and Mr. Biesenbach is trying to balance programming between the Grand Avenue headquarters and the more flexible Geffen Contemporary, in Little Tokyo. The museum lacks a chief curator in the mold of Paul Schimmel, its longtime figurehead, but MOCA has got a sharp, diverse college of young curators, including Lanka Tattersall, Bryan Barcena and Amanda Hunt (who is also a curator of the nimble, if perhaps too Instagram-optimized, Desert X biennial in Palm Springs, through April 21).
Artists on the Move
Mr. Biesenbach took some serious stick in his first days in the job for describing his new home in The New York Times as "turning into the new Berlin" on account of its influx of artists and supposedly cheap real estate -- a shock to those facing rent hikes far in excess of inflation and living among an intense homelessness crisis. Forbes magazine, last year, called Los Angeles the worst city in America to rent a home; studio space isn't cheap either.
Matters aren't helped by the debt load young artists take on at the city's fabled art schools; both the California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia, and ArtCenter College of Design, in Pasadena, rank among the 10 most expensive degrees in the country. (Free advice to young artists contemplating an M.F.A.: try Brussels, where tuition is a few thousand dollars a year.)
But young painters and sculptors and photographers have been chasing their dreams out here since "The Day of the Locust," and the city's scrappier galleries and artist-run nonprofits have a freer spirit than you usually find in New York or London. Some of the most intriguing work I saw came from the young local artist David Alekhuogie, whose lush, flower-festooned photographs of young black men in sagging jeans shiver with both political ire and sexual potency.
Mr. Alekhuogie, though born in Los Angeles, trained at the venerable Yale photography department -- and decided to make his career back West. Received wisdom is that the city's art schools are its initial draw and its social nuclei. But I kept noticing how many young artists, notably artists of color, came out here or returned home after finishing East Coast art educations, including fellow Yalies like the painters Njideka Akunyili Crosby and Christina Quarles and the installation artist Lauren Halsey.
Mr. Alekhuogie's photographs are on view through Saturday at Commonwealth and Council, in Koreatown, one of the standouts of the city's young gallery scene. Another is The Box, downtown, which has a startling display of erotic drawings by the French novelist Pierre Guyotat, whose libidinous excess hits even harder in the #MeToo age (through March 30).
Both galleries were at Frieze, whose young Los Angeles sector was its most impressive portion. These smaller galleries have some notable L.A. touches: taco trucks outside exhibition openings, crystals displayed on front desks, solicitous emails about parking validation, and the omnipresence of marijuana, now advertised so openly here that I was put in mind of the vice-choked Pottersville in "It's a Wonderful Life."
These new spaces offer a more accurate reflection, too, of the demographics of this city. Just under half of Angelenos are Hispanic or Latino, and the local galleries have offered key support to artists I saw at the fairs, including Rafa Esparza, whose performances and installations use arduously cast adobe bricks, and Tanya Aguiñiga, whose beguiling wall-mounted weavings draw on both pre-Columbian and American feminist traditions.
Meanwhile, The Underground Museum in Mid-City, founded in 2012 by the painter Noah Davis and the sculptor Karon Davis, his wife, has brought together black artists, filmmakers and intellectuals and established itself as one of the city's most essential alternative spaces. Various Small Fires, in Melrose, reintroduces the Korean photoconceptualist Nikki S. Lee (on view through Saturday), and the gallery is about to open a branch in Seoul -- a welcome endeavor from a city that could do more to look across the Pacific.
As much as anything, activity and leisure, artistic creation and artistic consumption bleed into one another here. One sunny afternoon I drove down Sunset Boulevard to an about-to-be-leveled Spanish Colonial Revival villa in the hills, where nearly two dozen artists had larded the walls, garage, bathrooms, and even the drained pool with childlike paintings and one-note jokey sculptures. The show, mysteriously titled "Henry Is Blue," seemed an irrelevance to me, but perhaps this anti-institutional stance has a new, ironic bite in the age of Airbnb and Instagram.
Is There Gold in These Hills?
Can you make any money out here? The Ferus Gallery, in the late 1950s and 1960s, was the first anywhere to show Andy Warhol; Larry Gagosian, whose multinational gallery now occupies a prime corner of Beverly Hills, got his start hawking posters in Venice Beach. David Kordansky Gallery, founded in 2003, has matured into one of the city's best, and its current show of Fred Eversley's translucent, cast polyester lenses refines the history of the L.A.-centered minimalist movement known as Light and Space. (Mr. Eversley's art is also in "Soul of a Nation.") Blum & Poe, the stalwarts of Culver City (who embarrassed themselves two years ago by letting Kanye West's team take over the gallery with a Madame Tussaud-style fun house), are now presenting the single best show in town: "Parergon: Japanese Art of the 1980s and 1990s," through March 23, which features a whole generation of the Tokyo neo-avant-garde.
Still, L.A. has long been a better place to make art than to sell it, and though sales at Frieze and Felix were reportedly brisk, that remains the case. Both fairs went out of their way to include smaller local galleries -- I appreciated the gnarly pottery of Jennifer Rochlin at the Frieze booth of a Glendale gallery called The Pit -- but the bigger-ticket merchandise remained on the booths of New York and London dealers. Collectors, too, at the fairs and in the galleries, remain disproportionately out-of-towners. Hollywood's talent agencies have made small inroads into the art scene, but nothing transformative.
But what does it even mean to be an L.A. collector in 2019? Is a Chinese business person holding an investment condo by the Staples Center a "local collector"? Is Ms. Akunyili Crosby, a Nigerian represented by galleries in London and New York, a "local artist"? Is Blum & Poe, with spaces in New York and Tokyo, a "local gallery"?
In the 1970s and 1980s, the old CalArts mafia used to celebrate this city's artistic autarky, where strong schools, cheap rent, a benign market and a three-hour time difference insulated L.A. from supposed excesses out East. Those days are decisively over, and in its place is a new Los Angeles art world with hazier boundaries, where local and global concerns overlap.
A place like The Underground Museum, for all its community engagement, also broadcasts its exhibitions through Instagram stories and welcomes nonprofit boards from Dallas and Toronto. The artists of Eastside Los Angeles show their art to one another in pop-up spaces, but their dealers sell it in Switzerland, or via WhatsApp, to foreign investors -- who might also be buying up former studios in their gentrifying neighborhoods. If L.A. is more artistically vibrant than ever, it may also offer less of an escape than before from the freely flowing capital and instantly shared images that are homogenizing culture from Hollywood to Hong Kong.
This is the price of making and exhibiting art in the 21st century, when images fly in from all over, and no city can ever again be the sole "art capital." Like too many New Yorkers, I also indulge idle fantasies about what my artistic life might be like on the other coast. What seemed clear this time, however, was that a New Yorker moving to Los Angeles might not be moving very far at all.
These artists of America's most exciting scene are as implicated in the global economy as the rest of us, and finding their way through an art system where the old certainties about place and rootedness no longer hold. The pioneers who built this city of soundstages knew this long ago: With enough money and with the right technology, you could turn Los Angeles into anywhere.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst convicted in 2013 of leaking archives of secret military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks, revealed in an interview on Thursday that she had been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury -- and vowed to fight it.
The subpoena does not say what prosecutors intend to ask her about. But it was issued in the Eastern District of Virginia and comes after prosecutors inadvertently disclosed in November that Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been charged under seal in that district.
Ms. Manning, who provided a copy of the subpoena to The New York Times, said that her legal team would file a motion on Friday morning to quash it, arguing that it would violate her constitutional rights to force her to appear. She declined to say whether she would cooperate if that failed.
"Given what is going on, I am opposing this," she said. "I want to be very forthright I have been subpoenaed. I don't know the parameters of the subpoena apart from that I am expected to appear. I don't know what I'm going to be asked."
Mr. Assange has been living for years in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid arrest. It has not been clear what the sealed charge or charges relate to, but prosecuting him for publishing government secrets would raise novel issues about the limits of First Amendment press freedoms.
Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the office of the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, did not respond to an inquiry late Thursday. But there were multiple reasons to believe that the subpoena is related to the investigation of Mr. Assange.
Among them, Ms. Manning said that her lawyers have been talking about the subpoena with an assistant United States attorney in the Eastern District, Gordon D. Kromberg. After an inadvertent court filing revealed that Mr. Assange has been charged under seal, it was Mr. Kromberg who successfully argued before a judge that any such charges remain a secret and should not be unsealed.
Moreover, she said, Mr. Kromberg told her lawyers in vague terms that prosecutors wanted to talk to her about her past statements. During her court-martial, Ms. Manning delivered a lengthy statement about how she came to copy archives of secret documents and send them to WikiLeaks, including her online interactions with someone who was likely Mr. Assange.
"It's disappointing but not surprising that the government is continuing to pursue criminal charges against Julian Assange, apparently for his role in uncovering and providing the public truthful information about matters of great public interest," said Barry Pollack, a lawyer for Mr. Assange.
In recent years, Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks have become notorious for their role in disseminating Democratic emails stolen by Russian hackers as part of the Russian government's covert efforts to damage the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and help Donald J. Trump win.
The antisecrecy group, however, had previously vaulted to fame by publishing archives of classified documents -- including logs of significant events in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and diplomatic cables -- that revealed many things about what was secretly happening in the world. All of those initial files, it eventually emerged, had been provided by Ms. Manning.
In 2017, WikiLeaks published documents about C.I.A. hacking tools. A software engineer, Joshua A. Schulte, has been charged with that leak.
After Ms. Manning's leaks, the Obama administration had considered trying to indict Mr. Assange. But while it has become common to prosecute officials under the Espionage Act for leaking files, using it against someone who merely received and published leaked files raised fears about chilling investigative reporting.
The Obama legal team eventually shelved the idea. But the Trump legal team moved forward with developing a sealed criminal complaint against Mr. Assange -- for something -- last summer, providing a potential basis to seek his extradition were he to emerge from the embassy.
The subpoena to Ms. Manning, dated Jan. 22, says that she was ordered to appear on Feb. 5 before a grand jury at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va. But she said that date got pushed back, and she is now supposed to testify on March 5.
During her court-martial, Ms. Manning took responsibility for her actions and said that Mr. Assange had not directed them.
"No one associated with W.L.O." -- an abbreviation she used to refer to the WikiLeaks organization -- "pressured me into sending any more information," she said at the time. "I take full responsibility."
Because that account would seemingly be helpful to the defense, she said she wondered if prosecutors wanted to try to get her to back away from it. She would not do so, she insisted, while criticizing the secrecy that surrounds grand jury proceedings.
"I am not going to contribute to a process that I feel is dangerous and could potentially place me in a position where I am forced to backtrack on the truth," she said.

Anti-Semitism Still Plagues Upstate School District

Texto completo: For years, Jewish students in the Pine Bush Central School District complained about finding swastikas scrawled on walls, desks and lockers. They said they were subjected to ethnic slurs, shoved and beaten. They said other students even led "white power" chants and made Nazi salutes.
The harassment and bullying grew so bad in the rural town about 80 miles north of New York City that five Jewish students sued for discrimination in 2012, and a news report about the incidents led to federal and state investigations.
Nearly four years ago, the district paid $4.48 million to settle the lawsuit and agreed to changes to its curriculum and training to combat bias and anti-Semitism, along with student surveys to chart its progress.
But the surveys, made public for the first time in a court filing last Friday, show that despite the district's efforts, anti-Semitism remains a stubborn problem at Pine Bush, as similar complaints about anti-Jewish bias are on the rise across New York State and elsewhere in the country.
In the court filing, Pine Bush school officials reported that 766 students, or one-third of the middle- and high-school students the district surveyed last fall, said they had seen or heard incidents of anti-Semitism in school the previous year.
Ilann M. Maazel, a lawyer for the Jewish students who had sued, called the number "shockingly high."
"Both sides agree that results matter and they're not even close to being there yet," said Mr. Maazel, of the law firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady in New York.
Still, school officials, in the court filing, said that given national trends, Pine Bush had made "great strides in improving the attitudes of its students and school community."
"At a time when reports of anti-Semitic behavior have dramatically increased throughout the United States, including on K-12 school campuses," the school district wrote, "the Pine Bush survey results, by contrast, show some positive trends."
The Anti-Defamation League reported last year that the number of anti-Semitic incidents recorded in New York State rose by about 90 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year, and the number of such incidents in K-12 schools doubled to 36, from 18.
The Pine Bush district, which is about 18 miles west of Newburgh, N.Y., serves about 5,000 children from Orange, Sullivan and Ulster counties. In the 1970s, Pine Bush was the home of a Ku Klux Klan chapter president.
About a dozen current and former Pine Bush students interviewed off school grounds this week said the climate of harassment and bullying had improved, and programs and other steps taken by the district had helped.
But the students said problems of insensitivity remained, and not all of them thought Pine Bush school officials handled bias complaints satisfactorily. The students spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of harassment from other students or reaction from teachers.
One 18-year-old said he had not seen anything like the racism and harassment described in the lawsuit. He recalled taking the survey and thought it was good because "it helps gauge" what was going on in the school.
He said that teachers' lessons on anti-Semitism had influenced his behavior. He admitted that he and his friends sometimes made bigoted statements, always in jest, he said. But since teachers have been impressing upon students that their words could cause unintended hurt, he said he had tried to avoid such talk and to police his friends. "I jump in and say, 'O.K. this isn't cool,"' he said.
Another student, who is 17, recalled a history class in which a teacher had discussed the Holocaust and tied the lesson to anti-Semitism at Pine Bush, which the student said had a big impact on his thinking. He said he felt anti-Semitism had largely disappeared from Pine Bush's schools.
But a 16-year-old sophomore said racial slurs and anti-Semitic graffiti were still widespread, and in his view had become a sort of background noise.
"It really hasn't changed -- all the students are so used to it," he said.
He recalled seeing swastikas etched on the side of a box of Kleenex, scribbled in a textbook and on a bathroom stall. He also said that he hears a common racial slur for blacks used daily.
He and two other sophomores also recalled taking the survey, but said they had not treated it seriously. "Everyone in class was taking it as a joke," he said.
A 17-year-old senior said he and his friends still occasionally made anti-Semitic jokes among themselves. But he added school assemblies promoting tolerance had helped him rethink the "potential impacts" of his words. "You might think it's funny, but someone might kill themselves," he said.
Some students said that teachers and administrators seemed to be struggling with how to respond to complaints of bias and other problems. Two girls, ages 13 and 15, said they had reported incidents of bullying to school officials but the officials never followed up on the complaints.
The state and federal investigations were opened after The New York Times published an extensive 2013 report on anti-Semitism in Pine Bush's schools.
The next year, a federal judge in White Plains denied the district's request to dismiss the suit. While not ruling on the suit's merits, the judge, Kenneth M. Karas, concluded that a jury could reasonably find that the plaintiffs had "suffered severe and discriminatory harassment, that the district had actual knowledge of the harassment and that the district was deliberately indifferent to the harassment."
To settle the lawsuit, the district agreed to mandatory training for teachers and staff members on how to recognize and report bias, and it developed an anti-bullying curriculum with the help of the Anti-Defamation League.
Pine Bush officials said about 2,300 students, or about 80 percent of those enrolled in its middle schools and high school, responded to the most recent survey last fall.
Of those, 766 students said that in the previous year they "sometimes," "often" or "frequently" saw or heard incidents of bias, including swastikas in school, anti-Semitic slurs, Holocaust "jokes," the word "Jew" used in a pejorative sense, white power chants, Hitler salutes and other such behavior.
Two-thirds of the students said they "rarely" or "never" saw or heard such conduct, the survey showed.
When the same question was asked in 2017, a slightly higher percentage of students had reported incidents of bias. "We are in fact honestly relieved to say, 'Look, we've had an improvement,"' said Tim O. Mains, the Pine Bush superintendent since 2017.
Mr. Mains maintained the district did "a very good job" of tracking and following up on reports of anti-Semitism or other forms of bias. He also noted that given the increase in bias incidents around the country, the survey showed movement in the opposite direction.
Evan R. Bernstein, the Anti-Defamation League's regional director for New York and New Jersey, said Pine Bush school officials had been "very responsive" and tried to do everything the A.D.L. had asked of them, but the survey results meant there was still work to be done.
"If I'm the Pine Bush school administration and I'm seeing that number, it means I can't take my foot off the gas, and I have to keep pushing as many anti-bias programs and initiatives in the school district as possible," Mr. Bernstein said.

Texto completo: South by Southwest has transformed over the past 30 years from a regional music festival to a national music and film festival to a national music, film and tech innovation fest to (deep breath) a cultural conclave involving discussions, screenings and performances around music, film, TV, tech, politics, environmental concerns, comedy, cryptocurrency and much more.
Here are seven speakers worth checking out as part of the Interactive and Film parts of the festivities. All of these sessions are open to SXSW badgeholders only, but you may see some of the speakers at other events around town. Some also are participating in other SXSW panels or events.
Stacey Abrams
Abrams was the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate for the state of Georgia. Abrams lost in a tightly contested, often controversial election to Brian Kemp, who was the state's chief elections officer for nearly a decade before resigning after overseeing his own race. Seen as a Democratic rising star, Abrams gave the Democratic response to the State of the Union address recently. It is also entirely possible she will run for Senate. She will discuss her book “Lead from the Outside.” Panel: 9:30 a.m. March 11 at Hilton Austin Downtown, Salon H.
John Boehner
You might remember Rep. John Boehner from such jobs as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015 and the rep from Ohio’s 8th district from 1991 to 2015, from being reasonably well-liked on both sides of the aisle even as he was a right-wing conservative, and for being a really devout (tobacco) smoker. He recently co-created an industry-funded lobbying group called the National Cannabis Roundtable. He will be joined by Kevin Murphy, of cannabis industry investment firm Acreage Holdings. Panel: 2 p.m. March 15 at Hilton Austin Downtown, Salon H.
Brené Brown
This Houston-based researcher and motivational speaker has written five No. 1 New York Times bestsellers including “The Gifts of Imperfection,” “Daring Greatly,” and “Dare to Lead.” Brown is SXSW’s opening speaker; apparently her speech will be called “The Only Unfollow that Broke My Heart” and involves the question “What defines belonging, community and connection in an age of increased polarization, online vitriol, and epidemic shaming and blaming?” Panel: 11 a.m. March 8 in ACC Ballroom D.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY14) might be the most reported-upon Democratic politician alive. She is also 29 years old, in her first term in the House and an absolute lightning rod for Republicans such as Sen. John Cornyn and President Trump. She will be in conversation with Briahna Gray of the Intercept. Panel: 5 p.m. March 9 in ACC Ballroom D.
Gwyneth Paltrow
Until 2008, Gwyneth Paltrow was best known as one of the most famous American actresses alive. A style icon (anyone remember the totally excellent, Gwyneth-worshipping show “Popular”? Anyone?), Paltrow embodied a certain kind of turn of the century film star in movies such as “Se7en” and the Oscars-juggernaut “Shakespeare in Love.” In 2008, she founded Goop, an often controversial luxury lifestyle and “spiritual wellness” brand, a brand that has recently partnered with Netflix for a Goop-branded docuseries. She will be joined by CNN journalist Poppy Harlow. Panel: 11 a.m. March 11 at ACC Ballroom D.
Jonah Peretti
Well, this will be good and weird. Jonah Peretti is founder and CEO of Buzzfeed, a digital media company that provides a mix of breaking news, entertainment and shareable content. In January, Buzzfeed laid off 15 percent of its workforce, then attempted to not pay laid-off staff for accrued paid time off, a decision they have since backed down on. Also, Buzzfeed workers are trying to unionize. The questions from the audience could be off the chain. 11 a.m. March 8 in the Fairmont Manchester CD.
Olivia Wilde
Rumor has it that this actress, perhaps best known for an 81-episode turn on the smash hit TV show “House” as Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley, is an outstanding director — her debut feature “Booksmart” world-premieres at SXSW this year. Panel: 11 a.m. March 11 at ACC Room 18ABCD.

El gran problema que enfrenta “El Chapo” en su batalla contra el jurado que lo declaró culpable

Texto completo: Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera integró al abogado Marc Fernich para dirigir su estrategia para solicitar ante la Corte Federal de Brooklyn un nuevo juicio, luego de que un jurado revelara que al menos cinco de sus compañeros incumplieron con las reglas del proceso.
Durante cada receso del juicio, el juez Brian Cogan recordó a las ocho mujeres y cuatro hombres que tenían prohibido revisar información sobre el caso en internet, en redes sociales y medios de comunicación, algo que varios de ellos hicieron, según revelaciones a VICE News.
Tras ello, los abogados del mexicano dieron un paso adelante, al pedir una extensión del periodo para solicitar un nuevo juicio. El juez Cogan autorizó ampliar el tiempo, pero es complicado que haya un nuevo juicio, según expertos.
“El estándar en los tribunales federales es muy estricto para la defensa” , dijo Josh Dubin , un abogado consultado por el New York Times que se especializa en asuntos relacionados con el jurado. “Tienen que demostrar que el jurado realmente fue perjudicado por la información externa a la que fueron expuestos. Una demostración de mala conducta del jurado no es suficiente” .
La defensa de Guzmán Loera no ha especificado cómo pudo afectar a su cliente que el jurado revisara información en internet, pero una de las historias que más desataron polémica fue la compra de menores por parte del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas , un tema que no fue presentado como prueba en su contra y, por tanto, no es posible utilizarlo.
Jessica Roth, exfiscal federal que ahora es profesora en la Facultad de Derecho de Cardozo en la Universidad Yeshiva, dijo que para proteger las deliberaciones del jurado, las reglas federales de evidencia limitan las circunstancias en las que un juez puede escuchar el testimonio en vivo de un jurado.
Si la defensa hace una moción para anular el veredicto, el juez Cogan podría cuestionar al jurado solo sobre la “cuestión limitada de lo que los jurados estuvieron expuestos en forma de tuits y otras información en la prensa”, dijo, pero agregó que “al jurado no se le permitiría testificar acerca de cómo esos materiales impactaron sus deliberaciones” .

Comedians Dennis Miller, Mark Steyn Team Up For Adorable Deplorable Tour

Texto completo: When friends Dennis Miller and Mark Steyn get together for dinner, their riffs on the news of the world make for memorable conversations punctuated by sharp, sardonic wit.
So much so that Miller, the critically acclaimed comedian, was inspired to invite Steyn - a best-selling author, singer and conservative commentator - on the road with him for a string of appearances they’ve titled the “Adorable Deplorable Tour.”
They’ll share their thoughts and insights as well as some apolitical satire when they stop at F.M. Kirby Center for the Performing Arts, Wilkes-Barre, on Saturday, March 2. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. with the show at 8.
During a recent phone interview from his home in Santa Barbara, California, Miller, a Pittsburgh native whose most recent stand-up special, “Fake News, Real Jokes,” came out in November, praised Steyn as a worthy cohort for the tour.
“I find him a great raconteur. He has a big brain, but he’s funny,” Miller said. “At 65, going out on the road alone gives me anxiety. It reminds me of breaking in as a young comedian.”
During a call from Northern New Hampshire a couple days later, Steyn likewise complimented Miller’s company and thought process.
“Dennis and I have many mutual interests, but I defer to (him) when it comes to brilliant comic timing,” Steyn said. “What I like about Dennis is he’s a comedian who strays into commentary. I talk a lot about serious things - war, pestilence and disease - but I stray into comic areas. We meet in the middle in the blurry area.”
Miller pointed to his days anchoring the “Weekend Update” desk on “Saturday Night Live” as establishing his reputation as a “current event comedian.” He estimated that while 75 percent of his material for Wilkes-Barre will be prepared, the rest will be written based on headlines of the moment.
“I think a crowd appreciates when they think you’ve got a pulse,” Miller said.
Miller developed a broad fan base - and won five Emmy awards - thanks to his HBO show, “Dennis Miller Live,” part of a career that also included a quartet of New York Times best-selling books, a radio talk show, appearances in major motion pictures and a pair of seasons doing “Monday Night Football” commentary. He has emerged in recent years as a strong conservative voice via new media such as Twitter and his twice-weekly podcast, “The Dennis Miller Option.”
Though he expects a friendly audience at the Kirby (“Once you get to a theater where someone gets up from their home, drives there, pays $50 to be there, there’s not a lot of enemies. It’s a nice vibe,” he pointed out), Miller said stand-up isn’t the same as when he first started.
“These are tricky times to do comedy,” he said. “There’s a whole new rubric out there for what you shoot out. These are easily bruisable times. (People can be) emotional hemophiliacs.”
Steyn agreed, calling it a “totalitarian thing” when society says what you can make jokes about.
“I’d like to actually expand the bounds of what you can talk about,” said Steyn, a Canadian national. “This is the land of the First Amendment, for those of us who come from countries with no First Amendment. At the same time, with respect to comedy, funny enough, the parameters are shrinking.
“That’s not a partisan thing,” he added. “Left or right, you should always be able to see the comedy on your own side. If you ask me what my big, philosophical takeaway is, I want people to leave understanding we don’t have to talk about things in the increasingly narrow way they do, especially on late-night TV shows these days.”
The night will include a question-and-answer session with the audience, which gives the conversation freedom to go wherever the people wish.
“That’s always my favorite thing,” Steyn said. “Some can be predictable things ... but other times, they throw you complete curves. For me, fun is doing it different every night.
“Dennis will ask you a question and you’ll mention something, and he brings you down a whimsical trail. You never know where it’s going to go,” he added. “You throw in the audience, and they’ve got their own concerns.”
No matter what their sociopolitical beliefs, guests should expect a night filled with good humor.
“I hope they’re just laughing, honest to God,” Miller said. “If they walk away and there’s too much (dissection), you’ve missed the point. I’m a comedian. I might make a salient point, but I hope you’ll be saying, ‘Geez, that guy killed me.’”

Sunsets, waterfront and Old Florida shine at Tarpon Lodge

Texto completo: The genteel setting of Pine Island's Tarpon Lodge calls to mind scenes of old Florida — gin and tonics on the porch, fresh fish on the menu, elegantly dressed diners looking up from their plates to catch the last rays of sunset.
Which is exactly how co-owner Robb Wells wants visitors to feel.
Tarpon Lodge was first built in 1926 by a couple who loved the water. In the 1940s it became a fishing lodge. Several owners operated the property over the years, and in the late 1990s it again came up for sale.
The Wells family, who also own the inn and restaurant at nearby Cabbage Key, saw the value in the historic space.
"There's a rich history to Tarpon Lodge," Wells said. "My dad kept looking at this property, and he had a great vision for it. He's an avid fishing guy, and what he wanted was to bring back a throwback fishing lodge, like it was historically."
The family purchased the property in 1999 and took the next year to perform updates and renovations.
"The bones were there," Wells said.
"That's the real key part of it. The house had all the character in the world, it just needed a little pick-me-up. That's what we spent the better part of a year doing, and I was really pleased with the way that it came out."
Today the lodge's restaurant is open to the public for lunch and dinner, offering a range of continental cuisine with a focus on fresh seafood, much of it caught locally.
"Obviously, when you're coastal it's important to have a really nice offering of seafood items," Wells said.
"We also know that not every customer is a seafood eater, so we have land items. And we keep in mind with our specials the growing number of vegan customers."
The restaurant strives to serve what Wells calls an "upscale and elegant" menu but without too many pretensions. Tarpon Lodge still considers itself island-casual.
"It's still Florida," Wells said. "We're not asking our customers who have been fishing all day to show up in a blazer."
The elegance, he said, comes more from the menu and the setting than the dress code.
"It's just a different type of offering than you see at other places. We don't fry anything."
Though Tarpon Lodge sits at the northwest corner of Pine Island, it attracts diners from across Lee and Collier Counties. Many will spend the day browsing the quirky shops and art galleries of nearby Matlacha before driving to Tarpon Lodge for lunch or dinner. Some come by boat from neighboring Useppa Island or Boca Grande. And still others will make the drive just for a chance to catch the famous sunsets over the barrier islands.
"Sometimes we'll have people order their dinner, and when it comes time to serve them we wonder where they are," Wells said. "Turns out, they've all gotten up to take pictures of the sunset."
And that genteel image that Tarpon Lodge evokes? It's spot-on.
"This is the kind of place where you can have a bottle of wine at your table for lunch, and if you're lucky enough to have a nice breeze that day the lawn is a really beautiful place to just sit and relax."
Just as true today as it was for visitors to the lodge in the past.

Texto completo: The 22nd annual Penguin Random House Book Fair will kick off Friday night with an author talk with Jamie Ford.
The event will celebrate the 10-year anniversary of his debut novel, “Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet,” a historical fiction tale that slices between the two children separated in the violent war years of the 1940s and protagonist Henry’s adult life in 1986.
The New York Times best-selling author will be at Carroll Community College, 1601 Washington Road, Westminster, Friday, March 1 at 7 p.m.
Tickets are $15 and some spots at the talk were still available as of Tuesday afternoon. They can be purchased online at library.carr.org/bookfair or at any branch of the Carroll County Public Library.
The event will start with the talk, followed by an interview with President of the Carroll County Public Library (CCPL) Board of Trustees and avid reader Joyce Muller. The author will then take questions from the audience.
After the talk with Ford, guests will have a chance to ask him to sign copies of his work.
The ticket price includes a special anniversary edition of the novel “Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet.” Copies of Ford’s other books will be on sale at the event for the same discount as other titles included in the Penguin Random House Book Fair’s offerings. Leading up to the Book Fair, copies of Ford’s work will be available at A Likely Story Bookstore, 7566 Main Street, Sykesville.
Director of Communications for CCPL Lisa Picker said that in the past decade, Ford’s debut has been a popular choice for book clubs around the area as CCPL has worked with book clubs to help them track down multiple copies of the same title at once.
“Knowing that he was very popular with our book clubs, it seemed like [Ford], would be a great fit for Carroll County,” Picker said.
Typically, historical fiction is popular in the area, and past CCPL authors have included Melanie Benjamin, Karen Abbott and Amy Bloom.
Picker has found the book to appeal to a wide variety of people.
“It’s a story that even though it was written 10 years ago, it has timeless appeal,” she said. “It’s something that a reader could enjoy at any time and be able to appreciate.”
This event is a partnership between Penguin Random House, Carroll Community College, A Likely Story Bookstore, and Carroll County Public Library.
The ability of these organizations to come together to provide an event for the community is “an example of how unique Carroll County is,” Picker said.
On Saturday, two more Penguin Random House authors will lead events for guests.
Suzanne Kaufman, the illustrator of picture book “All are Welcome” will give a book talk at 9:45 a.m. Saturday. The New York Times best-selling book explores diversity in schools. Kaufman is a globally recognized animator and teacher who has worked for Universal and Discovery.
Author of “The Last Fifth Grade of Emerson Elementary” and longtime poet-in-the-schools for the Maryland State Arts Council Laura Shovan will lead “En Garde!: Choreographing an Action Scene,” a workshop aimed at teaching choreography to upper elementary and middle school students. Taking place from 11 a.m. to noon, the workshop will teach them to act out an original action sequence. And there will be Nerf swords.
A full schedule of Book fair events is available at www.carrollcc.edu/bookfair.

RACIAL PROGRESS IN AMERICAN POLICING IS AT A STANDSTILL, SAYS NOBLE WRAY

Texto completo: When Noble Wray left his native Milwaukee to join the Madison police force in 1984, he may not have imagined how the topic of racial equity in policing would dominate his career.
Yet, here he is at 58 and the grandfather of two reflecting not only on his decade as Madison's police chief until 2014, but today as one of the nation's most prominent African-Americans training police on racial bias.
"I've done training in South America; I've done training in Canada," he told me in a recent interview in my office. "There are only four states, I believe, that I have not done training in: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho and Montana."
Wray and I reconnected at a Martin Luther King Day event in the state Capitol last month. He and his wife, Michelle, split time between homes in Madison and Washington, D.C.
These days, his primary focus is implicit bias the unintentional kind in policing. In moments of stress, officers who lack facts may rely on racial stereotypes, potentially leading to tragic outcomes.
In his long career, Wray has worn many hats. He was hired in Madison under former Chief David Couper, who shepherded in the modern era of community policing the notion of police partnering with residents. While on the Madison force, Wray was part of a cadre of national community policing trainers during the Clinton administration.
After leaving the Police Department here five years ago, Wray served briefly as interim head of the Urban League of Dane County. "I had never stood in front of a group of people at a meeting without a gun on," he recalled with a smile.
In the years since, Wray has often found himself on the front lines when policing intersects with issues of race. He was part of the independent police monitoring team in Cleveland, brought in as part of a settlement between that city and the U.S. Department of Justice after they identified a pattern of unconstitutional policing and excessive use of force there.
Wray left that role to join a task force created by the Obama administration in the wake of deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of white officers in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York. In that role, Wray said, he worked with former Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Loretta Lynch among others.
Wray found the sight of President Obama to be inspiring even as he felt worn down by the constant travel to trouble spots across the country.
"But I would go to the White House and he would come out, and I would be tired because of travel," he said. "But to see that guy ... at roughly my age, I was uplifted again. I was like 'OK, where do you want me to go?' " After Obama left office, Wray returned to a Florida-based consulting company, Fair & Impartial Policing. When he started a decade ago, Wray was one of two people in the company. Now there are 22, he said.
Wray spent much of last year in New York City, helping train about 3,000 police supervisors the total police force numbers some 36,000 in implicit bias awareness. The city had contracted with his firm as part of a police-reform agenda by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Wray told the New York Times last year that race remains the most powerful bias in policing.
"Yeah, there are other biases," he said. "But the 800-pound gorilla in the room is racial bias."
Wray, typically training about 40 officers per session, said he tries to overcome the suspicion that the training is only "for the white guys in the room" by sharing his own biases.
He said he explains how we all make assumptions about people when we lack knowledge about them.
"If you don't know someone, you start to fill things in with what are called ambiguous stimuli. ... It's like filling a cup," he said."The challenge with policing is that we typically are operating in a rapid environment. We're doing everything fast."
Wray added: "The goal is to slow things down when you can, and that's a culture of ours, of not slowing things down. The more you slow things down the more you reduce the ambiguous stimuli and then human beings emerge in front of your face."
New York police supervisors received eight hours of such training. Wray said it was imperative to demonstrate why it mattered.
"Critics say that if everybody's got implicit biases, it's just the way we're wired" and therefore there's not much to be done about it.
Wray said he tries to counter that argument.
"We have a mantra, and we go over it again and again, and it is that having biases is unsafe, and that's what the officers always clue in on. It's unsafe, unjust and simply not good policing," Wray said.
"We're not telling them not to make split-second decisions; we know that they will," Wray said. The training is about "when you have time for reflection, and you ask yourself: 'But for this person being a young Latino male would I be doing this?' " As with so many things that make sense and appear pragmatic that have been harmed by the election of Donald Trump, so too has any national focus on racial awareness training in policing.
When I asked Wray where things stand, he said: "So, what's happening now is that we are in a standstill. There were some (local police officials) who just didn't want to do it," referring to the work on racial issues in policing. "So when the Trump administration gets in being very frank there was a group that said: 'Thank God. We don't want to do this, and Washington is not pushing it.' " "Policing does need something like Washington every once in awhile," Wray added. "So, if you ask the question right now, the answer is it's at a standstill."
In a nationwide Pew Research Center poll from 2016, some 84 percent of black respondents said they believe police treat them less fairly than white people.
Apparently, in his promise to make America "great" again, Trump sees no urgency to address that perception. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund ; Paul Fanlund is editor and publisher of The Capital Times

Dinner, for when you don't want to cook dinner

Texto completo: This one is about real food.
Not fancified, froufrou, food-writer food. No scallops of veal or veal of scallops, no soupÃ§ons of creme anglaise or artistically arranged swirls of demiglace.
This one is about real food. This is about the food you cook when you come home after your commute was longer than your work day, after you noticed your boss hinting about job openings you might like at other companies, when you have to take one kid to hockey practice and another to Girl Scouts and another to band practice, and you're pretty sure you only have two kids.
I asked my colleagues in the Features department about their go-to foods, the food they cook when everyone is hungry and they just don't have the time or the energy or maybe even the ingredients to make their usual Tuesday night foie gras terrine.
They responded with delightful, easy-to-make ideas that tasted great. Each one, incidentally, included a starch, a source of protein and vegetables. When you're tired and hungry and pressed for time, apparently, you want the nutritional requirements for an entire meal in one dish.
Even the most exotic of the responses is simple, because it makes use of prepared items you get at the store. Tikka Masala Naan Pizzas begins with premade naan flatbreads, which you then spread with tikka masala sauce that you spoon on straight from the jar.
This dish works so well because that tikka masala sauce from a jar can be awfully good, if you like spicy food. And while the store-bought naan can't match a freshly made sample from a restaurant, it is certainly good enough for our purposes.
I added cooked chicken and sauteed mushrooms to the naan pizza (which is to say the non-pizza), topped it with shredded mozzarella cheese and added a few leaves of spinach more for visual appeal than flavor. A few minutes in a hot oven melted the cheese and browned the edges of the naan.
It was an easy-to-make Indo-Italian masterpiece.
Sticking to the Italian-ish theme, I next made Hahnilini. This is clearly the creation of a woman who has two children: It is fast, efficient and filling. It looks nice, and it tastes good, too.
Hahnilini begins with a pretty form of pasta -- bowtie, shell or fusilli (which the recipe's creator calls "scroodle noodles"). This you boil as usual, but a couple of minutes before it will be done, you add some broccoli to let it cook with the pasta.
Genius, right? You drain the pasta-'n'-broccoli and toss it with chunks of cooked chicken, garlic salt, butter and shredded Parmesan cheese.
As the recipe puts it, "serve on pasta plates, bowls or regular plates. and tell your family to be happy about it."
Next up is instant ramen with a difference. Perfect Instant Ramen takes your standard packet of ramen -- I bought one for 25 cents -- adds broccoli, poaches an egg in it and tops it with butter, scallions, sesame seeds and, um, American cheese.
The recipe is actually an adaptation of a recipe by a Los Angeles-based chef that ran in the New York Times. It's Korean comfort food, said the chef, Roy Choi; it is how he used to eat ramen when he was growing up and still loves to eat it today.
The addition made by my colleague is the broccoli. The broccoli rounds out and deepens the flavor, and provides nutrients to an environment that is otherwise as rich in sodium as it is in taste.
And finally, I made a quesadilla that is defined less by specific ingredients than whatever you happen to have left over in the fridge. That's what happens when you're pressed for time and you need a go-to dinner.
I wanted this one to be vegetarian, which is how the woman whose recipe it is often makes it. I put broccoli in mine (I had some left over from the other recipes), plus sautÃ©ed mushrooms and diced tomatoes, plus, of course, shredded cheese -- I used Colby Jack.
The woman whose recipe it is took one look and said, "you put more stuff in yours than I do."
It was good, though. That's the advantage of a What's in the Fridge Quesadilla. Pretty much anything you use is going to taste fine.

Texto completo: Michael Cohen , exabogado personal del presidente Donald Trump , planea decir todo sobre los trabajos que realizó para su jefe, especialmente aquellos relacionados con demandas e investigaciones sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
En la sesión a puerta cerrada ante el Comité de la Cámara de Representantes se espera que Cohen detalle aspectos negativos de su exjefe, como sus expresiones racistas, la forma en que acumuló su riqueza y su posible conducta delictiva, reportó New York Times.
El Times habló con una fuente familiarizada con el testimonio, quien adelantó que Cohen llevará documentos para probar sus dichos, pero también detallará experiencias personales de los alrededor de 15 años de colaboración.
Se agrega que uno de los aspectos potencialmente dañinos del testimonio de Cohen será la evidencia de una posible conducta criminal desde que Trump asumió la presidencia .
El presidente Trump y sus aliados se han estado preparando durante varios días para los impactos del testimonio de Cohen, que tendrá lugar durante varias horas mientras el presidente se encuentra en Vietnam para una cumbre con el líder de Corea del Norte, Kim Jong-un .
Se espera que los republicanos que forman parte del Comité de Supervisión y Reforma de la Cámara cuestionen agresivamente la credibilidad de Cohen, a fin de hacerlo ver como un mentiroso.
La portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Sarah Huckabee Sanders , calificó a Cohen de mentiroso y lo señaló como “un criminal”.
“El criminal deshonrado Michael Cohen irá a la cárcel por mentir al Congreso y hacer otras declaraciones falsas”, dijo. “Lamentablemente, irá al Congreso esta semana y podemos esperar más de lo mismo. Es risible que alguien le crea a un mentiroso condenado como Cohen”.

Texto completo: It's time for the dealmaker in chief to take it old school, right here in D.C.
President Trump wants to get something built. He wants to fix what so many others have called unfixable. He wants to make a promise and keep it - and bask in a cheering crowd's adoration, too.
It hasn't been really working out so far, has it?
It can still happen, and here's how:
Build. The. Rink.
Sound familiar?
Let me remind y'all of one of Trump's greatest stunts - the Wollman ice rink.
It has been argued that the rink was the pivotal event that began the transformation of a second-tier real estate developer into President Trump.
Wollman Rink had been a beloved fixture in Central Park and one of New York City's iconic settings for decades, until it needed a facelift. But its calamitous and scandal-plagued reconstruction became the symbol of the city's government dysfunction in the 1980s.
It had been a six-year horror show when Trump swaggered onto the scene with a letter to Mayor Ed Koch.
"Dear Ed," the May 28, 1986, letter began. "For many years, I have watched with amazement as New York City repeatedly failed on its promises to complete and open the Wollman Skating Rink. Building the rink, which essentially involves the pouring of a concrete slab over coolant piping, should take no more than four months' time."
Trump offered to do it himself. He'd even foot the bill. And then run the rink.
"Who Can Fix the Wollman Rink Faster? City and Trump Agree It's Trump," said a New York Times headline a week after Trump wrote that letter.
Koch accepted the offer, though with some caveats. And that's when it became a delicious Gotham-style drama.
The two sparred for the spotlight all 12 years the mayor was in office.
In his memoir, Koch called Trump a "blowhard." He worried that Trump's offer was merely a caper to turn Wollman Rink into Trump Rink.
''Remember," Koch cautioned in his responding letter, "the Bible says that those who give charity anonymously or, if not anonymously, then without requiring the use of their names, are twice blessed."
Trump at one point called the mayor a "moron" and once said: "Koch has achieved something quite miraculous. He's presided over an administration that is both pervasively corrupt and totally incompetent."
Koch, meanwhile, called Trump "greedy, greedy, greedy."
In one essay found by his family after his death, Koch wrote: "Donald Trump is one of the least likable people I have met during the 12 years that I served as mayor. It is incomprehensible to me that for some people he has become a folk hero."
Trump didn't put his name on the rink, but he did negotiate for the right to run it.
The Times headline was right.
Trump built it. And, two months ahead of schedule and $775,000 under budget, Dorothy Hamill and Scott Hamilton cut the ribbon and glided across the ice on Nov. 1. 1986.
Trump has been basking in the story ever since, pulling it out on the 2016 campaign trail, using it as his No. 1 example of dealmaking and government being run like a business. Plenty of critics have argued, however, that much of the work on the rink had already been finished by the time he got there.
Nevertheless, it's the ultimate Trump story. And his company makes millions on the rink to this day.
So why should Trump bother with this whole morally charged, ethically challenged, popularly unwanted wall business on the border with Mexico when he can return to the old glory days and get a win right here in Washington - no Air Force One trip required?
The Fort Dupont Ice Arena has been struggling for years. It is the only indoor ice rink in a city that currently holds the Stanley Cup. It's a place where more than 3,000 kids speed-skate, figure-skate, play hockey and find a safe place that won't turn them away, regardless of their wealth. And it's so neglected. I hear all the time from out-of-town hockey teams how much they hate going there for a game.
"Why are there all those holes in the ceiling?" a player asked my son at a peewee hockey game Sunday night.
Supporters have been sparring with the city over a rebuild and expansion for years. Just a couple of weeks ago, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) threatened to pull the long-promised funding for the rink.
She thawed on that threat last week, promising $21 million for the rebuild only if the nonprofit group that runs the rink, Friends of Fort Dupont Ice Arena, raises $5 million itself - $3 million by Feb. 1, 2020.
Capitals owner Ted Leonsis - who hosted a Hillary Clinton fundraiser during the campaign and never made it to the Trump White House with his Stanley Cup-winning team (and it wasn't because they don't like "hamberders") - tossed in a paltry $100,000 of his own cash.
See where this is going?
If Trump pulls a Wollman Rink here, he'll get to show up D.C.'s mayor (remember, the one who didn't want his military parade tearing up our city streets), he gets to shame the billionaire Leonsis, and he gets to build something.
I bet a lot of D.C.'s overwhelmingly Democratic voters might manage to celebrate the move.
Forget about the wall.
Build the rink!

Buttigieg: Midwest is not afraid of change

Texto completo: In his first visit to Indianapolis since announcing his 2020 bid for the White House, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg spoke candidly to hundreds at IUPUI on Sunday about being a millennial in Indiana, his stance on topics such as health care and gun violence, and his advice to LGBT youth.
The event at Hine Hall Auditorium at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis was part of Buttigieg's 10-city tour for his autobiography, "Shortest Way Home." More than 400 people filled the auditorium to hear the Hoosier presidential candidate.
The 37-year-old's book, which landed on the New York Times' best-sellers list last week, chronicles success stories from his time as mayor, his unsuccessful campaign for state treasurer, his military service in Afghanistan, his relationship with Indiana and his return home to South Bend.
"Our part of the country really holds the key to the future of U.S. politics and economics in a lot of ways, so in the course of sharing South Bend's story, I'm really trying to tell a broader story about the interior of the U.S.," Buttigieg told IndyStar. "I want people to understand that this is a part of the country that is not afraid of change."
In 2011, at age 29, Buttigieg, a Democrat, became the youngest mayor of a U.S. city with at least 100,000 residents. From 2009 to 2017, he served as an officer in the United States Navy Reserve and, in 2014, took an unpaid leave of absence from the mayor's office to serve in Afghanistan.
While mayor of his hometown, Buttigieg came out publicly as gay and married his husband last year. Buttigieg gained national attention during an unsuccessful 2017 run for Democratic National Committee chairman.
"My community really accepted and supported me through some complicated times," he said. "These are things that would help others give Indiana a little more credit than we get sometimes and an understanding of what Hoosier compassion really looks like."
Buttigieg discusses gun violence, health care During a Q&A, Buttigieg talked about his positions on gun violence, health care, economic development, as well as his advice to the LGBT community and even his pick for best actress at the Academy Awards.
Regarding gun violence, Buttigieg said he would use a similar strategy to what he implemented in South Bend. The group violence intervention strategyinvolves identifying those who are most likely to shoot someone or be killed. The effort then helps them get the help and resources they need to succeed, he said.
"Taking a stance on gun violence is not always popular in Indiana," he said. "There are some weapons that simply do not have a place in American neighborhoods and streets."
He also said he believes in a "Medicare-for-all" system.
"We would take a version of Medicare and would make it available on the exchanges for people to buy in as a public option," he said. "But there are some things we have to do about the costs of the system."
And he told the LGBT community to never stay quiet.
"Speak up and be assertive. Have a voice," he said. "We need your help to bring about change and trust me, it's possible."
His pick for the best actress at the Oscars? Lady Gaga.
"Only because when I went on 'The Late Show,' Bradley Cooper was there, too," he joked.
Buttigieg not worried about poll numbers A month after launching his presidential exploratory committee, Buttigieg is still striving to overcome low name recognition, according to recent polling.
But on Sunday, he said he's not concerned about poll numbers because the nominating contests are still a year away.
"I'm not worried about that," he told IndyStar. "I'm definitely among the least famous people entering this conversation, and I think that's one of the biggest advantages that I have."
And even low numbers have not kept him off the GOP's radar. On the day Buttigieg announced his exploratory committee, Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens challenged Buttigieg's work in South Bend.
In an email to media, Ahrens said Buttigieg should focus on filling potholes and reducing crime before he "wastes time on a presidential campaign."
"His bid isn't just bad news for residents," Aherns said, "it's more proof that Democrats are about to endure the most crowded, divisive and contentious primary in history."
Buttigieg is in his second term as mayor and broke the news in mid-December that he would not seek a third, opening the door for his presidential bid.
His book tour continues in Los Angeles and Seattle.
IndyStar reporter Kaitlin Lange contributed to this report.

Senate puts focus on drug prices

Texto completo: Kaiser Health News
Kenneth Frazier, CEO of pharmaceuticals giant Merck, is set to face senators Tuesday who say drug costs are “sky-high” and “out of control.” But Frazier doesn’t need new talking points. Sixty years ago, a different panel of senators questioned a different Merck boss about the same problem.
The subjects likely to surface Tuesday — high drug prices and profits, limited price transparency, aggressive marketing, alleged patent abuse and mediocre, “me-too” drugs — are identical to the issues senators investigated decades ago, transcripts show.
Frazier is scheduled to testify before the Senate Finance Committee with the CEOs of AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer and Sanofi, and a top executive for Johnson & Johnson.
Hearings led by Sen. Estes Kefauver, D-Tenn., in 1959 and 1960 were the first significant congressional inquiry into rising drug costs and drug-company profits. While that showdown led to new legal standards for drug safety and effectiveness, cost-control measures never made it to the final bill.
Health policy scholars say the similar hearings show just how much unfinished business remains and how well drug companies have protected profits and limited regulation over the years.
“Every decade since the Kefauver hearings has seen at least one set of congressional hearings into the increasing prices of prescription drugs,” said Dr. Jeremy Greene, a drug industry historian at Johns Hopkins University.
“Drug prices, especially at the high end, are only ever higher” since the 1960s, said Dr. Scott Podolsky, a health care historian at Harvard Medical School. “The issues of transparency and profitability certainly have been there from the very first day of Kefauver.”
Kefauver, known for investigating the Mafia, began a series of hearings on business in the late 1950s. His Senate antitrust subcommittee began taking testimony on high pharmaceutical prices in late 1959.
“While this country has the best drugs in the world, it would appear from the great number of letters which the subcommittee has received that many of our citizens are experiencing difficulty in being able to purchase them,” Kefauver said in opening remarks.
The hearings, which lasted off and on until September 1960, were “among the most sensational” hearings of that Congress, a syndicated columnist wrote at the time. Appearing were the bosses of Merck, Pfizer, Schering, Bristol-Myers, Upjohn, Smith Kline and American Home Products. Senators dug into the prices of antibiotics, corticosteroids and tranquilizers, the wonder drugs of the time. John Connor, then Merck’s president, said he had “deep sympathy” for people unable to afford medicine.
So did Schering’s boss, but he said it wasn’t the industry’s fault. “Undoubtedly some people find it difficult to pay for needed medication. They will also have difficulty in meeting their rent and food bills,” said Francis Brown, Schering’s president at the time. “It is a matter of inadequate income rather than excessive prices.”
The executives urged Congress to create government programs to help people pay for health care, which it did a few years later. Today Medicare, Medicaid and subsidies for private health coverage cost more than $1 trillion a year. But drugs are still unaffordable for many.
“I still don’t understand why druggists in London buy this drug for $7.53 and our drugstores have to pay $17.90,” Kefauver told Connor, the Merck executive.
“We meet different market conditions in different countries,” was Connor’s response. Americans were getting “a reasonable bargain,” he said. “Merck’s Head Defends Drug Prices” was the front-page headline the next day in The New York Times.
Then as now, executives defended high profits as necessary to finance research and development, even though they often spent more on ads and marketing than R&D.
“They were advised that whenever the senators mentioned high prices, just mention research and how difficult it is, how expensive it is,” said Donald Light, a health policy professor at Rowan University in New Jersey. “Since 1959, that is the repeated and successful theme of Big Pharma.”
“The few successful products have to pay for the hundreds of research failures,” Alvin Brush, president of American Home Products, told Kefauver’s committee.
Like those of today, patients of 1960 were baffled about what medicine cost until they got the bill. Such obscurity led to overpayment.
“The consumer, in this field, cannot exercise his normal, economic prerogative of shopping or pricing before a purchase,” the head of a generic-drug manufacturer told the committee. “The normal laws of supply and demand have no application here.”
Drug companies engaged in a “pharmaceutical numbers racket” by promoting different strengths of established drugs as new medicine and charging more, Louis Lasagna, a pharmacology professor from Johns Hopkins University, told the committee.
“Now this is like saying that a dime is more potent than two nickels because you can use one coin instead of two,” he said.
Companies often worked not to develop breakthrough medicine but to take existing products and “modify the original drug just enough to get a patentable alternative,” said Dr. Frederick Meyers, a pharmacology professor at what later became the University of California, San Francisco.
In contrast to the nonstop consumer TV commercials of today, ads for prescription medicines in 1960 were aimed at doctors and hospitals, appearing in medical journals. Even those were deemed aggressive. A committee staffer dumped out a huge pile of samples, ads and flyers that a Minnesota doctor said he had received in only one month.
Maybe if the companies spent less on ads, armies of salesmen and “expensive stock options” for executives, “you could lower the price of drugs, too, Kefauver said.
Kefauver’s draft bill would have withheld patents for modified drugs unless the new molecule gave a therapeutic response “significantly greater” than the original. It would have promoted competition by allowing anybody to license and sell a patented drug, in return for royalties paid to the patent holder, after three years.
One expert urged the government to publish an official list of patented drugs and their generic equivalents along with prices so everybody could see what they cost.
None of that happened. The industry fought back. Any legislation seemed doomed until the thalidomide, a pill taken for morning sickness that caused deformities in babies, prompted lawmakers to act.

Rather than ignore Trump, he creates a burning ring of fire - and satire

Texto completo: The past two years have occasioned a torrent of nonfiction titles about what may or may not be going on in the White House, with each chronicle burning up the charts. In 2018, five books about the president sold an impressive 2.7 million copies combined. Novels did not post anywhere near the same numbers, perhaps because in these times, facts exert all the morbid fascination we can handle. The truth about this administration is more gobsmacking than anything the creative mind can conceive.
Certainly, there have been Trump- inflected novels - by Jonathan Lethem, Gary Shteyngart, Barbara Kingsolver, Salman Rushdie. But in them his name goes unspoken. Perhaps it is the novelist's aspiration to universality, the fear that specificity pinions art's wings. Or just aversion to the sight of those particular five letters.
Whatever, Mark Doten says the heck with it. He launches "Trump Sky Alpha" at the bull's eye of reality with such velocity that it bursts through the other side. This is speculative fiction as burning ring of fire.
The novel opens on a scene that both crystallizes the excesses of the personality in question and provides a metaphor for current events: President Trump piloting a jewel-encrusted, pay-to-play zeppelin unmoored from Earth and its troublesome facts. It glides between the District and Mar-a-Lago with a freight of obscenely wealthy passengers (blinded by such devotion, or cravenness, that they are thrilled by endless upcharges on their already exorbitant passage). Its captain live-streams continuous lies, er, public addresses. Oh, and he's just pushed the button on World War III.
The Hindenburg's fate no doubt informed Doten's choice of symbol for a government turned personal profit-making vehicle.
The beginning is outrageous fantasy but reads like transcription. Doten channels Trump's verbal tics and rhetorical poverty so perfectly it's chilling. ("Happy to be flying back to NYC! Beautiful night! Fake News Media WRONG as usual!!!" he tweets, as horrific destruction unfolds below.) Perversely satisfying, this tour de force of vicious satire is cathartic. Single sentences go on for pages, evoking the breathless flow of ever-more-astonishing events that has been our lot since 2016.
In the apocalyptic landscape below, a survivor named Rachel is a virtual prisoner in a former W Hotel in Minneapolis. (Doten has a keen eye for cultural irony.) A journalist, she is the hero of what becomes a thriller; the book is also a post-postmodern mash-up of fable, satire and dystopian fiction. On her way to the heart of American darkness, Rachel works at recapturing the Internet, which had been mysteriously brought down a few days before nuclear armageddon: "What did the internet feel like? How to describe its loss?" Doten amplifies questions raised in his first novel, 2015's "The Infernal," about the costs of the Internet's pervasiveness, questions revealed as scarily prescient mere months after its publication. Indeed, prescience is a bit of a thing with Doten. The copy of "Trump Sky Alpha" I read was printed before December's stock market roller coaster and foreign cyberattack, yet uncannily similar events occur in its first pages.
Rachel is also desperate to locate the bodies of her wife and daughter, and when the rebooted New York Times Magazine assigns her a piece on "internet humor at the end of the world," she finds the lever that might pry this information loose. It goes without saying that in the novel, Trump's administration is no fan of a free press. After martial law is declared, officials give the paper limited opportunity to get back on its feet while working "in partnership" with it to "select" the stories it will run. "They value the fourth estate," Rachel's editor nonetheless attempts to reassure her.
Her quest to write the story takes her from a disquisition on how our addiction to stupid meme humor has driven us to the edge of our humanity, to the brink of a disturbing truth by way of a plot line about #resistance run amok. (The novel's arguments may be argued with, seeing as how the danger of the meme form is less its ability to concentrate and mainline humor than to spread propaganda.)
The revelation of what Doten is up to in this bordering-reality tale occurs in a sub-narrative about a novel that leaped across boundaries by inspiring a group opposed to the Internet's "totalizing" influence to copy its fictional crime. Prophetic? Inciting? Self-referential? Yes. As the Filipino author of the novel-inside-the-novel explains, "It's not surprising to see an authoritarian president, a demagogue stoking racial fears and other divisions, because that is where the internet has been taking us."
The stress of outperforming realism in works of speculative fiction sometimes risks a dangerous rise in the literary mercury. Both of Doten's novels suffer from an overreliance on facsimile screen images and voiceyness. The Ted Kaczynski-like character who imperils Rachel - and whose fix for the ills of society is theoretically well-founded but sinister in practice - is given ample space to terrify the reader with stream-of-consciousness lunacy. If all of eternity were mine I would never dream I'd feel thankful to hear Trump's voice again. Yet when it returns in the final pages, it's almost a relief.
Dizzy with metaphor, "Trump Sky Alpha" is a cautionary tale for a time when we have become inured to flashing yellow all around. May this fiction, for one, not leave the page.

Texto completo: Several years after Keith Tharpe was sentenced to death for murder in 1991, a juror in his case signed an affidavit stating that there are two types of black people: good ones and "niggers." The juror, who was white, put the defendant in the latter category and said that he wondered "if black people even have souls."
Mr. Tharpe sits on death row in Georgia. Although his lawyers assert that his punishment was tainted by juror racism, a state court ruled against Mr. Tharpe on that issue two decades ago.
Since then, state and federal courts have put procedural obstacles in front of his efforts to appeal that ruling. Mr. Tharpe seemed to be doomed when the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit rebuffed him. He was set to be executed in September 2017.
But the Supreme Court issued a last-minute stay, shaken by the juror's disturbing affidavit which, in the court's words, presented "a strong factual basis" that Mr. Tharpe's race affected the juror's vote for a death verdict.
When the Supreme Court returned the case to the 11th Circuit, it again refused to examine the racial bias claim, offering new procedural impediments. As soon as March 1, the Supreme Court may decide whether it will review Mr. Tharpe's case.
What is going on here?
The struggle over Mr. Tharpe's fate has to do, in part, with a continuing dispute over whether the legal system should allow jury verdicts to be impeached by the post-verdict testimony of jurors.
For a long time, federal and state courts almost always prohibited jurors from testifying about deliberations. In 2015, for example, after a sex crime conviction, the Colorado Supreme Court refused to consider testimony from two jurors who came forward to report that a fellow juror had expressed anti-Latino bias against the defendant and his alibi witnesses.
In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court reversed the Colorado court, ruling that, amid serious allegations of racial juror bias, a reviewing court must be able to consider evidence from jurors, even if doing so opens jury deliberations to more scrutiny than is otherwise allowed.
The court acknowledged the importance of supporting the finality of verdicts, protecting candor and confidentiality within the jury room and discouraging efforts to flip jurors beset by regrets. But it rightly concluded that even more imperative is eradicating racial discrimination from the criminal justice system. Racial bias, the court declared, "implicates unique historical, constitutional and institutional concerns" -- a sentiment suggesting that even among some conservative jurists there exists a newly energized desire to rectify the racism that remains all too evident in our administration of criminal justice.
More generally, the struggle over Mr. Tharpe's case has to do with the circumstances, if any, under which a government ought to be allowed to execute someone.
One camp is relatively tolerant of contaminations, like racism, that might have affected sentencing. In an unpublished memorandum to his colleagues, Justice Antonin Scalia rebuffed a challenge to capital punishment, despite acknowledging that "the unconscious operation of irrational sympathies and antipathies, including racial, upon jury decisions and (hence) prosecutorial decisions is real" and "ineradicable." The other camp is more demanding, recognizing the need for exacting scrutiny when it comes to assessing the validity of the most extreme form of governmental power: imposition of capital punishment.
Some people in this camp oppose capital punishment altogether. They believe that we cannot trust the criminal justice system to impose a penalty as irrevocable as death. The Supreme Court of Washington State recently invalidated capital punishment because the death penalty there "is imposed in an arbitrary and racially biased manner." Others in this camp tolerate the death penalty, but only if there is no substantial whiff of prejudice.
The impending execution of Keith Tharpe cannot pass that test. There is the stench of prejudice, not just a whiff. In this case, remember, one of the 12 people who voted for death voluntarily admitted that he thought of Mr. Tharpe as a "nigger" and "wondered if black people have souls." Under these circumstances an execution would certainly be a miscarriage of justice. The Supreme Court must intervene out of an elemental embrace of due process.

‘Weavers’ make stronger social fabric

Texto completo: Eventually, someone who writes on public policy comes up against the limits of words. There are only so many times you can urge, condemn, cajole, wheedle, praise, remind, prod, propose and coax before your vocabulary and patience both give out. This is not to say that public argumentation makes no difference. But for a columnist, that influence consists mainly of throwing 750 words over a high wall and hoping they land with a pleasing thud on some doer or decider.
Having mastered the arts of opinion writing, cultural criticism and human decency, David Brooks of The New York Times is now undertaking a project at the Aspen Institute called "Weave," designed to recognize and help people directly involved in social repair.
Many people are involved in the unholy work of ripping and shredding our social fabric — through dehumanizing language, racial prejudice and other evidence of tribalism. The groups Brooks highlights are the weavers, laying down the warp and weft of communities. They promote community dialogue and deal with various categories of need from youth development to suicide prevention. But they share the goal of strengthening human ties, trust and reciprocity as alternatives to isolation, loneliness and despair.
In his manifesto, Brooks argues for what he calls "relationalism" as opposed to the "hyper-individualism" of a society based on the maximization of choice and self-actualization. A critic might respond that liberal individualism has done a pretty good job as the basis for democracy, capitalism and pain-free dentistry. But Brooks is diagnosing an excess of individualism leading to "social isolation, distrust, polarization, the breakdown of family, the loss of community, tribalism, rising suicide rates, rising mental health problems, [and] a spiritual crisis caused by a loss of common purpose."
In Brooks’ relationalism, the answer is not found in a political ideology, but in an alternative way of being human. In this view, success is not measured by the goods we accumulate but in the number and quality of the relationships we form. Such relationships tend to push our attention outward, toward the welfare of others. "The central journey of modern life," Brooks argues, "is moving self to service." And a rich relational life delivers a deeper more satisfying form of happiness than consumerism. We are actually liberated by the deep commitments we make in life.
Brooks’ message is likely to resonate precisely because it is not political. The atomizing tendency of American life does deepen and complicate problems such as drug addiction and suicide, in which isolation can contribute to a downward spiral of self-destructive behavior. But many Americans can identify with the broader challenge of loneliness, which seems to be the flip side of autonomy.
Brooks is making the case that there is already a movement of human connection in this country, among people who don’t yet recognize themselves as part of one. He has served this movement by giving it a compelling, non-sectarian, non-partisan frame, allowing diverse groups to consider themselves part of each other. In this case, the frame serves the picture well.

Park recycling bins tossed to save money

Texto completo: STAUNTON - The recycling bins at Gypsy Hill Park will be gone by the end of the month, a move that city officials hope will help stabilize the ever increasing costs of its recycling program.
The decision was made Thursday evening at special meeting called specifically to address the future of Staunton's recycling program. In a packed City Hall conference room, residents observed, diligently took notes and gave up their seats for one another as officials workshopped the best solution for the budget issue.
In August 2018, Sonoco Recycling, the company which offers Staunton recycling services, began billing the city $52,000 annually for the same services it once offered for just $3,100. The price increase happened in the midst of U.S. cities grappling with market fluctuations following China's 2018 announcement that it no longer wanted to import U.S. recyclables, according to the New York Times.
The global economic decision trickled down to the decision making that took place in the City Hall meeting room.
"There are a lot of burdens on the program," said Public Works Department director Tom Sliwoski. Each option would cost the city more than its used to, he said.
He began to hand out the estimated budget impacts for three recycling scenarios. Those options included removing the Gypsy Hill Park drop off site and keeping curbside pickup, keeping the recycling program as is and eliminating the program completely.
Meeting attendees, and the city officials present, expressed a strong aversion to the last option. While none of the options excited the officials, they realized that something had to be done.
The consensus of the room was to go ahead and remove the Gypsy Hill Park drop off site.
"I think the impacts to citizens are far less for removing that than doing away with the curbside," Mayor Carolyn Dull said. She directed Sliwoski that the bins could be done away with as soon as possible with proper notice to residents.
Council members Brenda Mead and Jim Harrington supported Dull's position and followed Sliwoski's recycling program analysis as well.
During the presentation, Sliwoski identified unpredictable burdens that the Gypsy Hill Park bins produce — both physically and financially. Many times, trash placed in the bins contaminate the recyclables which make loads unusable to recycle. The financial implications are up in the air as well.
Before the price increase, Sonoco didn't charge the city a rental fee for the containers. The August price tag changed that to $75 a month. In the past six months, the company also began charging the city more to transport the recycling bins, Sliwoski said.
By removing that variable in the recycling program, they would avoid future market fluctuation impacts on the city's payment to Sonoco, Sliwoksi said.
In 2017, the city collected about 1,012 tons of recycling. One-hundred and eighty four tons were collected from the five community containers at Gypsy Hill Park.
Gypsy Hill Park recycling accounted for $28,000 of the new $52,000 annual recycling costs, according to a previous report from The News Leader.
Aside from the financial decisions, Mead advocated for a plan to education residents on how they can reduce their waste.
"If it's becoming too expensive for us to recycle, and I think that's true everywhere ... then I think we need to educate people more on how to reduce their consumption," Mead said.
She added that she wants to hear staff suggestions in the future on how they may accomplish education-centered recycling goals.

Before you crush that work idea, think 'sapling'

Texto completo: The mighty redwood grows to over 350 feet tall and can live 2,500 years. Like every tree, even the gigantic redwood begins as a sapling. In the redwood's case, that sapling may take up to 400 years before it reaches its true potential.
Imagine the impatient landowner, scoffing at a puny redwood sapling after only a few years of life. It would be easy to neglect or even remove the fragile tree, long before it had the chance to soar.
In contrast, the longer-term view is to plant plenty of seeds and protect the saplings throughout their ascent to greatness. This is how majestic forests climb to the heavens, realizing their full opportunity for growth.
Which approach do you take in your organization? Think how quickly we extinguish new ideas, far before they've had the chance to materialize. Or how we may prematurely crush the spirit of new thinking, approaches, or methodologies.
We can't compare a sapling to its fully developed big brother, so how can we hold our idea saplings to the same standards as fully tested, mature solution?
It may be easy to dismiss the saplings in our businesses, but doing so will ensure a barren future. As our existing successes are harvested, they must be replaced with the next generation or our once beautiful forests become extinct. In fact, it is a key role of leaders to plant seeds and protect the saplings.
Yes, the mature products and services and systems are the ones that may drive profits today, but a lack of investment in the future will eventually lead to grim results.
Of course we must care for our most advanced and profitable efforts, but not at the expense of our seeds and saplings. We cannot mortgage our futures only to savor the present.
Give those emerging, unperfected, early-stage concepts a little breathing room. Nurture and protect them, fertilize often, and, in turn, they'll evolve into your redwoods of tomorrow. Extinguish prematurely, and run the risk that subsequent harvests will come up short.
Plant seeds. Protect saplings. This is what sustainable business is all about.

Texto completo: Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is a "hardened" criminal who "repeatedly and brazenly violated the law," prosecutors told a Washington federal judge.
But in the filing submitted Friday and made partially public Saturday, they recommended no specific punishment for those crimes, saying that is the practice of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose office brought the case.
Prosecutors noted that federal guidelines call for a sentence of 17 to 22 years, although under Manafort's guilty plea in his D.C. case, the maximum he faces behind bars is 10 years. The special counsel team said it may ask for Judge Amy Berman Jackson to impose a sentence that runs after any prison time Manafort is given for related crimes in Virginia federal court.
"Manafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law," prosecutors said, from "garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud" to "more esoteric laws" involving foreign lobbying.
He lied, they noted, "to tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the Special Counsel's Office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government."
He committed crimes while leading a presidential campaign and while out on bail before trial, and then lied to investigators after pleading guilty, prosecutors said, revealing "a hardened adherence to committing crimes and lack of remorse."
The charges in both cases flow from Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The filing helps pave the way for Manafort's sentencings in D.C. and Virginia scheduled for next month, as Mueller begins wrapping up his probe.
But the redacted, public document gives no details about Manafort's campaign interactions with Russians. Prosecutors had previously asked the judge for permission to seal material either because it related to "ongoing law enforcement investigations" or "uncharged individuals."
As part of his plea deal in September, Manafort, 69, acknowledged he was guilty of everything he was accused of both in Washington, D.C., and in Virginia: making millions as an unregistered lobbyist for Ukrainian politicians, hiding that money to avoid paying taxes, defrauding banks to pay his debts when his oligarch patrons fell out of power, and lying to cover up his crimes while trying to persuade witnesses to do the same.
The special counsel's sentencing memo details Manafort's illegal campaign to turn high-ranking American leaders against Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko and toward the pro-Russian strongman who put her in jail, Viktor Yanukovych. Hundreds of pages of exhibits show that Manafort was aware he was breaking the law and that he laundered the profits of his overseas lobbying efforts through offshore accounts.
When he appears in front of Jackson on March 13, he will already have been sentenced March 8 for related crimes in federal court in Alexandria, Va., barring any change in the scheduling as now set for those hearings. Jackson could make the sentence she imposes run during or after his Virginia prison term. In Virginia, where Manafort was found guilty of bank and tax fraud at trial, there is no upper limit to his sentence.
In Alexandria, prosecutors have also asked only for a "serious" sentence. Federal guidelines in that case call for him to spend roughly 19 to 24 years in prison.
Mueller's prosecutors have been handing off other pending legal matters to the U.S. attorney's office for D.C., and the Department of Justice is readying for Mueller to formally conclude his work.
In New York, the Manhattan district attorney is preparing to charge Manafort with violating state tax laws and committing other financial crimes, a move designed to ensure Trump's former campaign chairman spends time in prison if the president pardons him for the convictions stemming from Mueller's probe, Bloomberg News and the New York Times reported Friday. Trump has not indicated whether he intends to pardon Manafort, though he repeatedly expressed support for him as his trial played out last year. New York's double jeopardy law, which protects defendants from being prosecuted twice for the same crimes, could pose a challenge for the district attorney's office, however.
Attorneys for Manafort are not due to file their sentencing recommendation in D.C. until Monday, having told Jackson that last week's snowstorm made it harder to meet with their client in the Alexandria jail where he has been held, and asking for a delay.
Under his plea agreement in D.C., federal prosecutors had agreed to ask Jackson to give Manafort credit at sentencing for cooperation. But because she found he lied to investigators and breached that agreement, they are no longer bound by it.
Jackson found Manafort lied about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime aide who the FBI assessed to have ties to Russian intelligence. Those contacts, prosecutors said in court, go "very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating."
Manafort gave inconsistent accounts of an August 2016 meeting in New York City at which he and Kilimnik discussed a peace plan for Ukraine, a top foreign policy priority for Russia. At the time, Manafort was still leading President Trump's campaign. He also lied about sharing polling data with Kilimnik in 2016, prosecutors said in describing how he broke his deal to cooperate truthfully.
The judge also concluded that Manafort lied about a payment that he claimed was a loan and as part of another Justice Department investigation whose focus has not been described publicly.
Defense attorneys have maintained that Manafort did not intentionally give false information and that any inconsistencies were honest mistakes.
In 2017, Kilimnik denied to The Washington Post having connections to Russian intelligence. He was indicted with Manafort on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice through witness tampering.
Kilimnik is believed to be in Moscow and therefore probably safe from arrest because Russia does not extradite its citizens.

Texto completo: On Fourth of July weekend in 2015, while Hillary Clinton campaigned in New Hampshire for the Democratic presidential nomination, theatergoers in Falmouth, Mass., got a look at a work in progress about her -- Lucas Hnath's play "Hillary and Clinton," now poised for Broadway.

Set in an alternate universe during the 2008 primaries, as she fights for survival against a charismatic upstart, it was a comic tragedy, and it couldn't have been more topical. Unfolding around a pivotal moment in the contest, it examined how the strictures of her gender and the baggage of her marriage affected her ability to navigate the men's world of politics.
Hal Brooks, the artistic director of the Cape Cod Theater Project, remembers his audiences loving the series of staged readings. But he was so sure of the real Mrs. Clinton's odds in 2016 that when he thought about the future of this play, rooted as it was in a failed White House run, he did have a concern.
"Once she's president," he said, "will anybody really be interested?"
Needless worry, that. Bad news for Mrs. Clinton seems to have been a stroke of luck for the play. So, apparently, has the uprising of feminist outrage that followed her defeat, propelling a wave of women into Congress this year and a pack of female candidates into the 2020 presidential race.
Starring Laurie Metcalf as Hillary and John Lithgow as Bill, and directed by Joe Mantello, "Hillary and Clinton" arrives at the Golden Theater in March amid a raucous cultural debate about gender politics and the double standard that women face.
Not a bad outcome, but a surprising one for a play that was written in 2008 and had to wait eight years for its world premiere -- until Mrs. Clinton was once again waging a primary campaign. Directed by Chay Yew, it opened at Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago in April 2016.
Charles Isherwood, writing about that production in The New York Times, said that "Hillary" found Mr. Hnath (pronounced nayth) in "unusually cautious" form. But Chris Jones, in The Chicago Tribune, called the play "audacious, whip-smart, highly entertaining" and "an important piece of writing."
It's a play that ponders how publicly tough Hillary has to be, how tender she can afford to be and whether it's possible to strike a balance that won't risk condemnation.
In the gap of years before he staged it, Mr. Yew said, the script "kind of bounced around to some theaters, and nobody knew what to do with it."
"Also one wondered at the time, for some theaters, whether it was relevant," he added.
Still, when he first read it in 2012, he recalls being smitten -- finding it "utterly feminist and tragic" as it confronted "the eternal question of the role of women in society."
In the summer of 2014, he directed a workshop of the play at the Ignition Festival at Victory Gardens, where he is the artistic director. In 2015, he and Mr. Hnath took "Hillary" to Cape Cod.
Then as now, it wasn't meant as biography. Guarded and battle-scarred though she is, the Hillary in the play isn't quite the Hillary Clinton from the news. The same goes for the men around her -- her husband, Bill, though he's still a thousand times more cavalier than she'll ever be; her opponent, Barack (known in earlier versions of the play as The Other Guy); and her strategist, Mark Penn.
Like Mr. Hnath's other plays about famous figures (Walt Disney, Isaac Newton), "Hillary" blends fiction with fact, aiming to subvert what audience members think they already know. But Laura Colleluori, who directed the play for Second Thought Theater in Dallas in January 2018, said the effect is to bring the audience closer to Mrs. Clinton.
"Talking about her as a fictional character is kind of the only way that we can have a fair conversation about the real woman," she said. "It gives you the option, the chance, the request even, to grant her maybe a little bit of the humanity that 40 years in the public eye can kind of take away from you."
In the version of the "Hillary" script published in 2017 by Dramatists Play Service, Mr. Hnath admonishes performers against imitating the real Clintons ("Don't do it!"), then adds for directors: "Don't even try to cast actors who look like these people."
All of the show's full productions leading up to Broadway have cast Hillary as an African-American woman, a directorial choice not required by the script. An audition notice for understudies and possible replacements in the Broadway production, three of whose stars are white, specified an ethnicity only for actors playing Barack, who must be of African descent.
The opening monologue in the published script asks the audience to consider the likelihood of "an infinite number of planet earths." And then: "It would be very helpful if -- as you watch this play -- you were to imagine that the play takes place on one of those slightly different planet earths located billions of light years away from our own."
Spectators, of course, don't always do as they're asked. Mr. Yew remembers that at Victory Gardens, "everyone brought their garbage, really, to the play"; whatever they were thinking about the election came into the theater with them. Some got upset, worried that "Hillary" would harm the real Mrs. Clinton's chances.
That same spring, right after the Chicago run, Ken Rus Schmoll directed a production at the Philadelphia Theater Company. After the election, though, few other stagings followed. (Through a spokeswoman, neither Mr. Hnath nor anyone affiliated with the Broadway production would comment for this article, but Mr. Yew said that the playwright had been revising "Hillary.")
The Hnath work that's truly taken off is "A Doll's House, Part 2," which opened on Broadway in April 2017 and, according to American Theater magazine, is the current season's most-produced play. The first Broadway show for Mr. Hnath, who until then was a downtown darling known for brainy experimentation, it won Ms. Metcalf her first Tony.
In "Doll's House," she played Nora, Mr. Hnath's reworking of Ibsen's classic character -- a strong-minded, convention-breaking woman, a figure important to the cultural imagination and much deliberated there. The same could be said of Hillary Clinton, except of course that she is also a living human being.
There is a certain logic to both of these plays, and both of these famous characters, appearing on Broadway post-pussy hat -- written by the same playwright, performed by the same actress.
In his notes for the published "Hillary," Mr. Hnath sounds almost eager to discover how the play comes across without a Clinton candidacy hanging in the balance.
He wants audiences to be able to consider "what her runs for the presidency mean." But if that's going to happen, he warns, the tone of the production has to be just right.
"Tread carefully," he writes.
Hillary -- the one in his world, like the one in ours -- knows that stage direction well.

Texto completo: "Think of a bear."
Shafia Zaloom, a health teacher in San Francisco, stood in front of her 10th grade sex ed class. It was the first day of the spring term and "bear," at least when it was spelled that way, was not what the students expected to discuss.
Once their ursine images were firmly in place, Ms. Zaloom asked for descriptions. One student had pictured a grizzly; another was thinking about a black bear cub; there were polar bears and gummy bears. Personally, I had imagined Yogi. The point, Ms. Zaloom said, is that in a sexual situation, you can't make assumptions.
I think about those bears every time yet another allegation of sexual misconduct against yet another powerful man becomes public. Nearly all of those men deny coercion or aggression or insist that the encounters were "100 percent consensual."
But rarely do they define what, precisely, they mean by that. Did they discuss, with an enthusiastic partner, which erotic acts to indulge in together? Or were they satisfied that whatever they initiated was fine as long as she didn't say no? Did they consider passionate kissing a tacit contract for something else? Was forced sex -- say, the pushing down of a partner's head -- fair game because lots of guys do it? Did they consider sex with underlings acceptable, or a fair swap for career advancement, in which case they were apparently thinking of koalas, which are not actually bears at all?
The truth is, men are not the most reliable arbiters of whether sex was consensual. Consider: When Nicole Bedera, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of Michigan, interviewed male college students in 2015, each could articulate at least a rudimentary definition of the concept: the idea that both parties wanted to be doing what they were doing. Most also endorsed the current "yes means yes" standard, which requires active, conscious, continuous and freely given agreement by all parties engaging in sexual activity. Yet when asked to describe their own most recent encounters in both a hookup and in a relationship, even men who claimed to practice affirmative consent often had not.
When they realized that their actions conflicted with that benchmark, though, they expanded their definition of consent rather than question their conduct. Their ideas of "yes" were so elastic that for some they encompassed behavior that met the legal criteria for assault -- such as the guy who had coerced his girlfriend into anal sex (she had said, "I don't want to, but I guess I'll let you"). She then made it clear that he should stop. "He did, eventually," Ms. Bedera told me, "and he seemed aware of how upset she was, but he found a way to rationalize it: He was angry with her for refusing him because he thought a real man shouldn't have had to beg for sex."
Despite all evidence to the contrary, we still want to believe that men who are accused of sexual assault are all "monsters." True, some of them may be monsters we know -- our employers, our clergymen, our favorite celebrities, our politicians, our Supreme Court justices -- but they are "monsters" nonetheless.
A "good guy" can't possibly have committed assault, regardless of the mental gymnastics he has to engage in to convince himself of that ("20 minutes of action," anyone?). Even men who admit to keeping sex slaves in conflict zones will claim they did not commit rape -- it's that other guy, that "monster" over there, that "bad guy" who did. In fact, one of the traits rapists have been found to reliably share is that they don't believe they are the problem.
In my own interviews with high school and college students conducted over the past two years, young men that I like enormously -- friendly, thoughtful, bright, engaging young men -- have "sort of" raped girls, have pushed women's heads down to get oral sex, have taken a Snapchat video of a prom date performing oral sex and sent it to the baseball team. They all described themselves as "good guys." But the fact is, a "really good guy" can do a really bad thing.
Young men's ability to understand sexual refusal has been shown to be remarkably sophisticated and subtle, regardless of whether the word "no" is actually uttered; that renders dubious the common defense that they "can't tell" or "aren't mind readers." What's more, where "yes" is concerned, guys seem downright clairvoyant: They routinely over-perceive a woman's interest in having sex with them, even more so if the men have been drinking.
In 2016, for instance, researchers at Confi, an online resource dedicated to women's health issues, asked 1,200 college students and recent graduates nationwide what they would "expect to happen next" if they went home with someone whom they'd met and danced with at a party. Forty-five percent of the men considered vaginal intercourse "likely"; only 30 percent of the women did. The figures were similarly skewed for oral sex. Additionally, one in four men believed women "usually have to be convinced" in order for sex to happen (only about a tenth of the women agreed).
Not only are those perception gaps a setup for assault, but also for men's subsequent denials of responsibility and, quite possibly, claims of false accusation. According to the same survey, men found the actions of a "tipsy" guy "much more acceptable" than a sober one, meaning they let themselves off the hook for potential sexual aggression, even as female assault victims who drink are blamed.
Sometimes, boys I talk to acknowledge having willfully crossed lines. One college sophomore had repeatedly ignored his partner's hesitation during a hookup, despite his own professed scrupulousness about consent.
"I suppose there was something in the back of my head that I wasn't fully listening to," he admitted. "I guess when you've been flirting with someone the whole evening and you feel close to what you've been wanting to happen, it's difficult to put on the brakes. And -- I don't know. I was enjoying myself. I was having what in the moment was a positive sexual experience. I think I just wanted to. Which is scary."
And that may be the crux of it. Young men still too often learn to prioritize their pleasure over women's feelings, to interpret a partner's behavior through the lens of their own wishes. Their claims of "miscommunication," Ms. Bedera concluded in her research on college men, may actually be part of "an expectation that they control both partners' narratives about desire and consent."
All of which would indicate that in these high-profile cases, women's accusations are inherently more credible than male denial, regardless of how vehement that denial may be. It also means that despite the new standards that have been put in place and despite all the editorials and news articles and calls for change, we are still not doing what needs to be done: fully educating boys not only about the importance of consensual, ethical, mutually pleasurable sexuality, but about the ways their own sense of entitlement may blind them to those values, leading them to cause harm, whether or not they choose to see it.
In other words, we have to start dealing with the bear in the room.

Texto completo: These are tough times for journalism: Falling revenue for newspapers and magazines has led to layoffs since 2005, including four major announcements already this year. But the current crisis in the news business is also haunted by misconceptions about the industry and its history. Here are five of the most common.
Myth No. 1 Newspapers collapsed after they offered stories for free. Subscriber and advertiser revenue for traditional print journalism has been in free fall, and many think it started when newspapers offered content online for free. As Dave Perry wrote in a 2015 online column for the Aurora Sentinel in Colorado, "Newspapers primarily hung themselves by giving away their content online 20 years ago, giving people a reason to go out and buy a 14K baud modem." Former media executive Alan Mutter put it more directly on his blog: "The Original Sin among most (but not all) publishers was permitting their content [to] be consumed for free on the web."
The real problem is more complicated. In the 1990s, publishing online became easy, which led to a surge of independent digital publications that produced original content while also re-reporting news from other outlets with a little bit of analysis added. Self-publishing and the Internet's ubiquity disrupted a news business model based on scarcity and lack of choice. Much of what midsize and large newspapers were producing was regional, state and national coverage that was being duplicated all over the country; that made sense when consumers' choices were limited, but it was unworkable when readers could use the Internet to find that same news from anywhere. All it took was one newspaper that made its national coverage free, or an aggregator that summed up the news without doing original reporting, and they could steal the lion's share of ad revenue by cornering the market.
Linking the problem to the cost of the product ignores the reality that loss of control of the distribution model was the real culprit.
Myth No. 2 Craigslist destroyed newspapers. When Craig Newmark announced a $20 million gift to rename the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism last year, the knives came out among those who blame Newmark's Craigslist site for stealing classified ad revenue from newspapers. Felix Salmon voiced the long-standing beef his fellow journalists have had with Craigslist, which was founded in 1995, saying, "It's utterly bizarre to name a journalism school after the man who almost single-handedly destroyed local newspapers." Years before, New York magazine dubbed Newmark "The Exploder of Journalism" and accused him of "killing your newspaper."
No doubt, the loss of classified ads has hurt newspaper advertising revenue, which dropped from $63.5 billion to $23 billion from 2000 to 2013, according to the Brookings Institution. Classifieds accounted for about 40 percent of the business's ad revenue in 2000, but that share had fallen to about 18 percent by 2012. (Advertising, both in classified and display ad forms, still typically brings in more revenue for newspapers than subscriptions.) Craigslist wasn't the only disrupter in the market, however. Revenue already was declining across the board as sites like eBay offered alternatives to a more global audience. Newer players like Amazon Seller (a division of Amazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post) and Facebook Marketplace have only broadened the competition.
Craigslist might have been one of the first, and for a while one of the best, new ways for people to sell things in a market once owned by newspapers. But the sheer volume of choices for sellers now indicates that no single company is to blame. Simply put, newspapers prepared poorly for the rise of alternatives to classified ads.
Myth No. 3 Good journalism must be objective. The American Press Institute says the public has developed a flawed conception of news objectivity by confusing it with lack of bias. The concept seems simple enough: The Online News Association's ethics code proposes, "In objective journalism, stories must be balanced in the sense of attempting to present all sides of a story." Fox News's former motto - "Fair and Balanced" - promised something along those lines, even as it elided the network's ideological biases.
Objectivity as a journalistic practice is a relatively new phenomenon, though. From the founding of an independent United States to the penny press of the 1830s and the yellow journalism of the 1890s, the press was more often than not openly biased. The objectivity standard developed as a way to professionalize newsgathering and reporting in the wake of yellow journalism's excesses. Former New York Times columnist Walter Lippmann, a key figure in the industry, noted in his seminal "Public Opinion" that objectivity was a way to account for biases, not an attempt to eliminate them. Some of his ideas were highly influential in journalism schools, which sprang up in the early 1900s and began to train journalists with common standards such as objectivity. Other notable types of journalism don't believe good journalism means withholding judgment, as we see with the storytelling style employed by many magazines.
Myth No. 4 Facebook is a threat to journalism. The Guardian's Roy Greenslade describes Facebook as "newspapers' public enemy number one," arguing that it is muddying the project of journalism by limiting the audience for news. In the Columbia Journalism Review, Mathew Ingram identifies Facebook as one of the main "threats to journalism" thanks to its "growing lock on the ad revenue that used to underpin most of the media industry."
In truth, loyalty to news brands had been fracturing even before Facebook took off. The Pew Research Center's State of the News Media report noted in 2005 - back when Facebook was just for cool college kids - that Americans were grazers who consumed news across multiple formats and platforms and thus had no specific format or brand loyalty. Even by 2018, according to Pew , only 43 percent of Americans reported getting news through Facebook, and some of that included "soft" forms of news like celebrity gossip and viral clickbait stories. The more complex truth is that Americans have been consuming "hard" forms of news less and less each year. The problem is not just a function of Facebook stealing audience: People were already transitioning away from news consumption driven by brand loyalty with products such as RSS readers and Google News. That fragmented the hold on audience that newspapers had (and advertisers craved).
Facebook has grabbed much of the digital revenue, but that's partly because it has consolidated the audience for "soft" news like birth announcements, want ads and the weather, subjects that were once the domain of newspapers . Google, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, Twitter and LinkedIn also specialize in types of community information that used to be distributed by newspapers. Thus it's more accurate to say that Facebook (and social networks in general) is stealing the audience for things that used to subsidize journalism.
Myth No. 5 Americans hate the news media, or at least don't trust it. The Columbia Journalism Review noted, after President Trump held a rally in Tampa last August, "Several journalists commented on an atmosphere of hostility in Tampa that went beyond anything they had seen before," reflecting a general trend of public animosity toward journalists that bubbled up during the 2016 presidential campaign. Ivy Kaplan of the Globe Post writes, "A climate of hatred and hostility towards journalists in the United States has become significantly worse," pointing to a sobering Reporters Without Borders report that rated the United States as the sixth-most-lethal place in the world to practice journalism in 2018.
While antipathy may be high, trust in the press has been on the rise recently, according to a Gallup poll released last fall. It shows 45 percent of Americans reporting that they trust the press a great deal or a fair amount - up from an all-time low of 32 percent in 2016, but still well off its peak of 72 percent in 1976. The picture also is more nuanced when you consider political affiliations: Seventy-six percent of Democrats say they trust the news media, compared with 42 percent of independents and 21 percent of Republicans. The numbers have roughly held steady since 1998 for independents and Democrats, but the loss of trust among Republicans is the noteworthy trend - down from 41 percent in 1998. So to say it's an overall American sentiment is wrong. Similarly, recent upticks in press trust (a 2018 American Press Institute report noted that 32 percent of Americans reported increased trust in the media in the previous year) are linked to growing trust among Republicans. Thus it would be more accurate to say that Republicans don't particularly like or trust the news media.

Texto completo: A s anticipation over what movie will win the best picture Oscar bubbles up each year, it's inevitable that many casual movie fans will complain they've never seen - and in some cases, never heard of - several nominated films.
The complaint that the movies nominated for best picture aren't well known (thus, not well liked) has dogged the Oscars for nearly two decades . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which hosts the awards show, seems to at least partially agree with this assessment. In 2009, after backlash that the superhero blockbuster "The Dark Knight" wasn't nominated, the academy expanded the number of possible nods for best picture to up to 10, in a bid to showcase "popular yet still respected films . . . and perhaps drive more viewers to the show as a result," Variety reported.
Then, last year, the academy briefly introduced a new category recognizing achievement in popular film, arguably in an attempt to attract greater viewership. It reneged on the idea after facing an onslaught of backlash from critics and fans asking why popular movies couldn't also be considered "best."
With so much attention paid to how popular the best picture nods are, we decided to dig through the numbers to see whether these complaints - and subsequent attempts to address them - have any bearing in reality. We dug through years of best picture winners and nominations and used domestic box office grosses to measure popularity. (Note: All numbers have been rounded and adjusted for inflation.)
Here's what we found.
Are popular films nominated for best picture? The short answer is, not particularly, at least not recently.
A look at the average box office gross of best picture nominees during the past 20 years shows that their popularity has, in general, been declining.
Although movies in general made $11.1 billion in 2017, the average box-office gross for the eight films nominated for best picture at the 2018 Oscars was about $80 million. That's less than the 40 most popular movies from that year.
The two most popular movies of the bunch ("Dunkirk" and "Get Out"), which each earned more than $180 million, dramatically helped raise the average earnings, which are still fairly dismal. No other nominated movie made $100 million. (For comparison, the top 10 highest-earning movies of 2017 each made at least double that amount.) Meanwhile, the least popular movie in the bunch was "Call Me by Your Name," which earned less than $18 million.
That's still better than some years. Since 1998, we've had four years in which only one best picture nod topped $100 million. These numbers are remarkable when one considers that studios routinely spend $200 million merely on the marketing of summer blockbusters.
So, yes, for the most part, the movies the Oscars celebrate are not very popular. And the few noticeable spikes - 1997, 2009 and 2018 - tend to be on the shoulders of a single movie or two with such tremendous success, it's an outlier. "Titanic," one of the all-time highest-grossing movies, was nominated (and won) in 1998, and "Avatar," which made more than $850 million, was nominated in 2010.
Was it always like this? No, not at all. In fact, for many years, the Oscars heartily rewarded blockbuster films. Movies made in the 1970s that won best picture included classics such as "Rocky" and "Kramer vs. Kramer."
In this decade, the lowest-grossing best picture winner was a close race to the bottom between "The Hurt Locker" ($20.4 million) and "Moonlight" ($28.8 million).
That's not even mentioning the many towering blockbusters that were nominated but didn't win in the '70s, such as the first "Star Wars," "Jaws," "Taxi Driver," "All the President's Men," "The Exorcist" and "M*A*S*H," to name a few.
Oscar movies were still pulling in impressive amounts of dough at the turn of the millennium, just 15 to 20 years ago. The average box office grosses for best picture noms from 2000 to 2005 ranged from $114 million to $217 million.
So, what's with the decline? It's difficult to pinpoint a specific reason for the decline, because it's probably related to several different factors, not all of them negative.
Perhaps the biggest is the sheer number of movies being made these days. There were 199 films released in the United States in 1977, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Forty years later, in 2017, that number jumped to 777.
But even though there are more movies, fewer people are actually seeing them in theaters. Movie attendance hit a 22-year low in 2017, when 1.24 billion tickets were sold (at a record-high price, which accounts for why box office revenue trends upward, even while attendance is down).
Meanwhile, many filmmakers face substantial obstacles gaining funding (and marketing) for mid- to low-budget movies. "Something happened that nobody can make a movie between $500,000 and $80 million. That can't be possible," Matthew Weiner, the creator of "Mad Men," told the New York Times in 2010.
What appears to have happened is the rise of global blockbusters. Studios now bet on movies with gargantuan budgets - such as the Avengers franchise, which routinely cost well over $200 million to make - than on mid-budget films such as "The Godfather," which cost $37 million. If these movies don't make the money domestically, they still have a chance of performing well overseas. As the Atlantic's David Sims noted, "Hollywood is increasingly shying away from making such small-budget movies, as multiyear franchises have become the financial norm for multinational conglomerates looking to move the stock-market needle with each big release."
So, sure, some lower-budget movies exist. But now they compete against those with gargantuan budgets (and are marketed accordingly). In 2017, "The Shape of Water" cost $20 million to make and went on to win best picture. That year's most popular movie, "Star Wars: The Last Jedi," cost $317 million.
Does any of this actually matter? Why does the academy seem to care so much? Whether it matters or not is difficult to discern. The academy certainly appears to think that the popularity of the best picture nods affects the award show's viewership, which is somewhat supported by the data.
Viewership of the ceremony has been declining over the past two decades, with small spikes in years with more popular movies. But it's difficult to point to any cause, especially considering the many other circumstances at play: the declining appeal of live television, the backlash against the academy for its lack of diversity and, of course, who hosts on any particular year.
Regardless, the academy is trying to include more popular films in its telecast, and this year might finally signal the sea change it's been seeking. Discounting "Roma," because it was released primarily via Netflix, the average box-office gross of this year's nominations is $187 million - a full $107 million more than last year and the highest it has been since 2010, the first year with an expanded nomination field.
Of course, this could be an anomaly. The number is primarily buoyed by the success of "Black Panther" ($695 million), "A Star Is Born" ($212 million) and "Bohemian Rhapsody" ($214 million).
Will this affect viewership? It's impossible to tell. The fact that the show is going on sans host might have even more of an impact than what's nominated. But one thing is clear: The academy achieved its goal this year of celebrating popular movies, with or without a category specifically for them.

Klobuchar changes family leave policy after critical report

Texto completo: Sen. Amy Klobuchar has changed a policy that required staffers who took up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave to remain employed in her Senate office for three times as many weeks once they returned to work, or pay back their salary.

If an employee left after returning from maternity or paternity leave, they would be required to pay back what they were paid while they were on leave, the New York Times reported Friday.

An aide in the Minnesota Democrat’s office told CNN that the policy has been updated in the staff handbook after it was brought to their attention earlier this week.

“We offer 12 weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave for our staff and have one of the strongest paid leave policies in the Senate,” Klobuchar spokeswoman Elana Ross said. “We’ve never made staff pay back any of their leave.”

The policy was noted in the latest story about Klobuchar’s alleged mistreatment of people who work for her, which recounted an anecdote about the senator eating a salad on a plane with a comb, then making the staffer who forgot a fork clean it.

Klobuchar, who announced earlier this month she is running for president in 2020, has acknowledged she can be a demanding boss. She has not, however, admitted to any of the specific incidents shared by former staffers.

Texto completo: Second of two parts:
The sailor in the famous end-of-war Times Square "kiss" photograph, George Mendonsa, died Sunday at 95.
The next day, someone painted "#METOO," the social media hashtag for the movement against sexual harassment and assault, on a statue commemorating the kiss in Sarasota, Fla.
The woman in the photo, whose married name was Greta Zimmer Friedman, said the kiss wasn't consensual.
"It wasn't my choice to be kissed," she said in a 2005 interview for the Library of Congress' Veterans History Project. "The guy just came over and kissed or grabbed."
In 2016, her son, Joshua Friedman, told The New York Times after his mother's death that, while she understood the contention that it was an unwanted sexual advance, she did not view it that way. In the 2005 interview, Zimmer said, "It was just somebody really celebrating. But it wasn't a romantic event. It was just an event of 'thank God the war is over' kind of thing."
Three months earlier, Mendonsa had been at the helm of the USS The Sullivans during the Battle of Okinawa and dragged survivors and the dead from the water.
Alfred Eisenstaedt took the "kiss" photo for Life but didn't get the subjects' names. Zimmer didn't see the picture until the 1960s. She recognized her hairdo, tapestry purse and perfectly straight stocking seams. Mendonsa saw it in 1980 when Life reprinted it in hopes of identifying the pair. The editors invited them to Times Square.
Smiling in the photo background is Rita Petry, 20, Mendonsa's date. They married in 1946, and Petry joked years later that her husband had never kissed her like that.
Zimmer, an artist and mother of two, remembered that day as happy, the kiss only a part of it.
"It was a day that everyone celebrated because everyone had somebody in the war, and they were coming home," she said in 2005. "So it was a wonderful gift finally to end this war."

Defiant King will run for re-election

Texto completo: A defiant Rep. Steve King confirmed Thursday that he will run for a 10th term as an Iowa congressman, despite controversies over his history of caustic remarks, including about race and immigration.
The Kiron Republican has been criticized by national and state leaders of his own party, has been stripped of committee assignments in Congress and has drawn three primary challengers for the 2020 race.
In a Thursday taping of Iowa Public Television's "Iowa Press" program, host David Yepsen asked him: "Are you sorry for anything that you've said?"
The congressman replied: "I have nothing to apologize for, Dave."
King confirmed that he will run for re-election in 2020, despite drawing three challengers for the Republican nomination. He offered a message to voters in his northwest Iowa district: "Don't let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who's going to represent you in the United States Congress."
The "Iowa Press" show is scheduled to air on IPTV at 7:30 p.m. Friday.
Criticism of King ramped up in January, after the New York Times quoted him as saying: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa were among the leading Republicans who criticized the remark.
U.S. House Republicans stripped him of his committee posts and the U.S. House members, including King, condemned white nationalism and supremacy.
On the IPTV show Thursday, King portrayed the New York Times passage as a "misquote." As he has before, he said he was talking about Western civilization, not white supremacy.
King blamed his troubles on media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which he accused of twisting his words and "weaponizing" the language.
"If you would just hold these publications to what is true, there is no story whatsoever," he said. "... There's no part of me that believes in anything that's advocated by folks that identify themselves as white nationalists or white supremacy."
Yepsen, a former Des Moines Register columnist, challenged King on his claim the quote attributed to him by New York Times political reporter Trip Gabriel was wrong. "He's known as a pretty good reporter," Yepsen told King. "... That's one of the reasons why this has had such momentum on it."
King replied: "He can say he's a respected reporter — and I think he's a personable fella; that's probably part of the reason why we had a 56-minute conversation." But he said Gabriel never produced a recording or transcript of the interview.
New York Times Politics Editor Patrick Healy said later Thursday that the newspaper stands behind its story. "Trip Gabriel typed detailed notes during the interview and we are absolutely confident that we quoted Mr. King accurately, fairly and in the proper context," Healy wrote in an email to the Register. "I'd point out that for more than 24 hours after the article was published, Mr. King did not dispute he had made the comment."
"Iowa Press" panelist Erin Murphy, a political reporter for Lee Enterprises, asked King Thursday about the effects of being stripped of his committee assignments in Congress after the New York Times story was published. "Is there any way for you to be an effective congressman for the 4th District?" Murphy asked.
King said he doesn't think being on a committee matters as much for a Republican now that Democrats are running the House.
"If there's ever going to be a time not to have committee assignments, this time with Nancy Pelosi as the speaker of the House is the time," he said.
"Iowa Press" panelist Kay Henderson, news director of Radio Iowa, asked King about a small Confederate flag that was spotted on his desk in 2016. Critics say the flag's presence demonstrated his racism.
King told Henderson he put it there briefly as a sign of his support for free speech amid controversies over whether the Confederate flag could be flown.
"It stayed there for a few weeks. I took it down. It's not been there since," he said.
He said his ancestors included abolitionists and a soldier who died fighting against slavery.
"I understand all of this," King said. "Abraham Lincoln — his life was all about saving the Union. I'm about the Union. I'm about the Constitution. I'm about the Bill of Rights."

Texto completo: This year's Academy Awards offers all the traditional reasons to tune in: Glimpses of the world's biggest movie stars preening in couture gowns and borrowed diamonds. Great movies receiving the film industry's highest accolade. Soaring speeches. Stunning upsets.
But for the 2019 edition, there's an equally compelling reason to watch. It's the final chapter to the year's troubled, turbulent awards season. Live.
This Oscar season has been so fraught with missteps, backpedaling, Kevin Hart host-canceling, scandal, furor and controversy right up to this moment, that seeing it all come to a head-spinning conclusion in real time on television with a global audience is going to be a must.
All of that and Lady Gaga crooning "Shallow" with Bradley Cooper and Queen playing. I'm so there. With popcorn.
Kevin Hart out as Oscars host: Backlash from past homophobic tweets
Oscars costume party!: Get up close with iconic outfits from 'Black Panther,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and more
If Oscar producers Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss can pull off this host-less, ever-changing show with moments of poignancy, emotion and intended humor, they're going to deserve an Emmy, a special Oscar and a guest appearance on "MacGyver. "
It's going to be compelling live television, no matter what.
Adweek reports that advertisers have snapped up the full allotment of commercial time, running at $2. 6 million for 30 seconds. Follow the money, because the people spending it know something.
Pulling off a host-less Oscars is the biggest hurdle and potentially most captivating scenario, bang at the show's beginning. It's like a figure skater stepping on the ice and attempting a triple axel jump.
In 2011, there was a host crisis when Eddie Murphy dropped out in November, before Billy Crystal rode in to save the day two days later. Still, many pondered if there would be enough time to pull off the show, which he did.
Hart flamed out of the host job in December following a furor over homophobic tweets revealed from his past. No one else wanted to step into the already thankless job, and the original idea of The Rock as host idea was genius, but he's busy.
The internet is so hungry for someone to fill the void that it's invented this scenario where Whoopi Goldberg, who's gone missing from "The View," is going to step in. Seriously? But wouldn't that be something?
The last time we didn't have a host for the Oscars was 1989 and the opening number featured the jaw-dropping scene of Rob Lowe dancing and singing with Snow White on a helium bender. Lowe is still banging his head against a wall about this.
Just seeing how the show's producers handle the lack of host and opening when confronted with this kind of history is going to be worth ensuring you're tuned in before the last A-lister waltzes off the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.
Queen and Adam Lambert, whose performance was announced Monday with minimal ceremony and confirmed to USA TODAY as an opening act, could make people forget their host problem in one "We Will Rock You" stomp.
Then there's the other drama that's erupted this year around the major re-tooling of the show – revealing an energized, vocal (oh, and did we mention, very famous) Academy membership ready for some argy-bargy. Remember the "popular film" Oscar? That proposal was shot down faster than Greedo in "Star Wars. "
There have been other stands and hasty retreats by Academy officials. The decision that only two of the nominated songs would be performed – "Shallow" and Kendrick Lamar's "All the Stars" – led to more umbrage. The Academy flipped to allow all nominated songs to be represented, but wasn't able to secure Lamar's participation because he's out of the country and working on an album.
In another effort to cut down on the show's run time, the Academy decreed that four awards would be handed out during commercial breaks, then replayed during the broadcast in abbreviated form. Cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short took the hit, and the outcry was sustained – from Brad Pitt and George Clooney to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.
Just two weeks before the telecast, the show's producers were told by Academy leadership that the show would be drastically changed once again by adding the awards back live.
“It would make for a good story if I had a nervous breakdown,” Gigliotti told The New York Times. “You find a new way. ”
Watching live awards shows, and live TV productions like "Grease Live," multiplies the thrills because there's no safety net. Right now, there are seasoned pros sweating through an already tricky show, one that's constantly changing in light of every new drama. They are so good that we usually only enjoy the slick product. But as Envelopegate showed us two years ago, when the wrong best-picture winner was announced, things can become regrettably, unforgettably unglued.
And who knows what other dramas will pop in the remaining time before the show finally starts. It's crunch time, and anything goes.
Awards audiences are already tough and have a chip on their shoulder after fights to preserve their show – with the wild card of President Donald Trump watching with his thumbs on Twitter as liberal Hollywood steps out.
Not to mention the surprises which will happen and unknowables which have happened before: a streaker, Neil Patrick Harris onstage in his underwear, Jennifer Lawrence tripping up the stairs to receive her award.
All of this is on top of the vivid plot lines which have emerged this awards season. Popular hits "Black Panther," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "A Star Is Born," and "Green Book" are in the running for best picture. And who the heck really knows who will win? Spike Lee could take home his first directing or best picture Oscar, Glenn Close could break her streak of being the most nominated living actress without a win. It goes on.
History of some sort will be made Sunday. The world waits.

Johnson &amp; Johnson stock price falls after federal subpoena on alleged asbestos in baby powder

Texto completo: The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Johnson & Johnson over concerns the company's baby powder may have contained asbestos.
The agencies subpoenaed the health care product maker in the wake of several jury awards to plaintiffs who claimed the company's talc products were tainted with asbestos and caused their cancers. The agencies seek documents about those matters and other suits Johnson & Johnson faces filed by shareholders and pension holders over the situation.
Johnson & Johnson shares fell 1. 4 percent in early trading Thursday to $134. 43.
About 13,000 plaintiffs seek claims in pending lawsuits involving talc-based body powders. "The Company is cooperating with these government inquiries and will be producing documents in response," Johnson & Johnson said in an SEC filing Wednesday.
Jury award: Nearly $4. 7 billion awarded in Johnson & Johnson baby powder lawsuit
Johnson & Johnson: Stock price tumbles after report of asbestos in its talcum baby powder
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. , the top Democrat on the Senate Health Committee sought information from Johnson & Johnson about the company's knowledge of potential asbestos in its talcum-based products.
Last year, courts in New Jersey and California awarded damages to plaintiffs who claimed Johnson & Johnson talc products tainted with asbestos caused their mesothelioma. In July 2018, a St. Louis jury awarded $4. 7 billion to 22 women who said asbestos in the company's talc powder contributed to their ovarian cancer.
In the SEC filing, Johnson & Johnson said, "The Company believes that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts. "
Johnson & Johnson said in a statement to USA TODAY that the agencies' and Sen. Murray's inquiries "are related to news reports that included inaccurate statements and also withheld crucial information that had already been made public in the litigation and in prior media reports about the ongoing talc litigation that adversely impacted our share price in late December 2018. "
The statement continued: "Decades of independent tests by regulators and the world’s leading labs prove Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder is safe and asbestos-free, and does not cause cancer. We intend to cooperate fully with these inquiries and will continue to defend the Company in the talc-related litigation. "
The Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment.
Details about the DOJ and SEC inquiries come two months after reports in The New York Times and Reuters revealed documents suggesting the company knew about the risk of asbestos in its powders for decades and sought to keep the issue quiet.
Johnson & Johnson stock plummeted after those reports, falling 17 percent, resulting in a decline in the company's market value of about $40 billion.
Those reports prompted Murray to seek information from Johnson & Johnson, she said. "I am troubled by recent reports of an alleged decades-long effort by Johnson & Johnson to potentially mislead regulators and consumers about the safety of one of its products, which may have resulted in long-term harm for men, women and children who used Johnson & Johnson baby powder," she wrote in a letter to Johnson & Johnson Chairman and CEO Alex Gorsky late last month.

Disney's Genie dreams are blue

Texto completo: If Walt Disney Studios and director Guy Ritchie were granted three wishes, one of them would surely be that Will Smith's Genie in the live-action "Aladdin" would find a little love.
So far, there's been overwhelming vocal consternation over the pivotal character in the remake that flies into theaters May 24.
It was always going to be a bumpy ride for anyone stepping into the curled genie shoes after Robin Williams voiced his iconic, exhilarating role in 1992's animated "Aladdin."
Fans rejoiced when the Genie-less first teaser arrived last October. "I fangirled so hard It looks so good!" one tweeted. "I'm legit over here sobbing," another wrote. But the very blue unveiling of Smith's Genie in a Grammy Awards telecast "special look" was skewered on social media.
The New York Times' Kyle Buchanan feverishly led the tweeted criticism, including, "They premiered this image at night??? We are supposed to sleep after this???"
We could go on about the chorus of social media barbs, which became such a thing that John Oliver used the blue Genie image as a punchline on "Last Week Tonight," comparing it to the looming "disaster" when Britain leaves the European Union.
"You know how Twitter is. There's a pitchfork army out there and they all join in. And right now, Will Smith's blue Genie is out in front of this army, in a negative way," says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. "The Genie just looked odd. And while it's called 'Aladdin,' all the attention since Robin Williams' role is focused on the Genie."
Disney wouldn't comment on the marketing aspects of the film, which has stoked excitement with fans who made 2016's live-action "The Jungle Book" a major hit. The studio stood behind its Genie in a statement to USA TODAY: "We have one of the most anticipated films of the year and are confident that audiences will fall in love with the Genie and all of the characters when it hits the big screen this May."
Bringing out the Will Smith Genie, and the blue, has been a slow, deliberate rollout for Disney after two teaser trailers – as if to ease fans into the full live-action blueness against the formidable history of Williams' cartoon creation.
In December, a smiling Smith was unveiled on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, minus his CGI blue coloring. After fans reacted badly, the star assured them on Instagram, "I'm gonna be BLUE! :-) This is how the Genie is in Human / Disguise Form."
They didn't know how blue.
However awkward the first look, the negative reaction shouldn't be a surprise, according to director Raja Gosnell, who unveiled his own bright blue update of beloved animated characters in 2011's live-action "The Smurfs."
"We didn't have the Twitter world back then that we have now, thank God. But that unveiling was met with levels of horror and gnashing of teeth by the online community," says Gosnell. "There is always going to be some sort of outcry by the keyboard warriors. It was going to be the same thing with the blue Genie from 'Aladdin.' "
But there are many voices who contend Disney missed the vital opportunity to make a strong first impression that Smith's Genie could hold his own against Williams' legacy.
Paul Michael Glaser conceptualized and directed 1996's "Kazaam" around 7-foot-1 superstar center Shaquille O'Neal. While the fantasy musical was disparaged by critics, visualizing Shaq as a genie was spot-on casting.
Glaser says the decision to depict Smith as blue and physically pumped up, like a live-action version of Williams' character, wasn't "a smart thing to do."
"Making him blue was a bit of cop-out. But even more than that was the big, muscular look makes this Genie more comparable to the animated version. Why does a Genie have to be all of that?" says Glaser.
He would have preferred seeing more of what the superstar leading man could bring. "They missed the boat in terms of trying to really explore what it would be like to rub a bottle and have Will Smith come out of it," says Glaser.
Smith has made clear he will make the part his own in the final film, which EW described in the first-look story as "part Fresh Prince, part Hitch." Smith, who acknowledged he was "terrified" to go up against Williams' "iconic" role, said in the piece his character was "different enough and unique enough that it would be in a different lane."
There's still time for the formidable Disney marketing machine, with the powers of charismatic PR power player Smith, to right the spilled bottle.
"Disney has its own magic lamps," says Bock. "And 'Aladdin' is fortunate to pretty much own Memorial Day weekend for family entertainment. So it's in good shape there."
Part of the marketing blitz will include a full trailer, which still hasn't been released yet. Perri Nemiroff, senior producer of movie site Collider.com, suggests "scaling back on Genie in the marketing, that might be the smartest move after what we've seen."
The emphasis could focus on other "Aladdin" aspects such as Mena Massoud as Aladdin, Naomi Scott as Jasmine and their adventure story.
Then Smith will have an entire movie to unfurl his full Genie.

'Arrested Development' Has 8 New Episodes

Texto completo: "Arrested Development," the comedy about the Bluth family that upended so many television conventions, is coming back. Again.
On Tuesday, Netflix announced that eight episodes comprising the second half of its fifth season will be released on the streaming service on March 15.
In these episodes, according to a news release, "Pressures mount on the Bluth family as Buster heads toward a murder trial. The Bluth company is on the hook to build a 'smart' border wall that puts them in debt and risks exposing a software hoax perpetrated by George-Michael. Soon the gay mafia is involved and it appears that even Michael can't save the family this time. And Tobias becomes a Golden Girl."
Last spring, the show's public image came under harsh scrutiny during the press tour for the first half of Season 5 after The New York Times published a controversial interview featuring most of the main cast. Tensions ran high when the subject turned to Jeffrey Tambor (who plays George Sr.), who had recently been fired from the Amazon series "Transparent" following accusations of sexual misconduct on set. Tambor admitted he "had a temper" and "yelled at people."
In response, Jason Bateman (Michael) suggested that Tambor's "atypical behavior" was the nature of the entertainment industry. Alia Shawkat (Maeby Fünke) interjected: "But that doesn't mean it's acceptable."
Jessica Walter (Lucille) teared up when she spoke of her own experiences with Tambor: "Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize."
Almost 60 years of working, I've never had anybody yell at me like that on a set and it's hard to deal with," Walter continued, "but I'm over it now."
Following criticism of the statements made seemingly in defense of Tambor, Netflix canceled its U.K. press tour; some of the actors, including Bateman and his co-star Tony Hale, who also participated in the interview, publicly apologized for their comments.
It's unclear whether these new episodes of "Arrested Development" will be the last. In an interview on the "Late Night with Seth Meyers Podcast," David Cross (Tobias Fünke) said, "I've learned to say 'never say never,' but I can't see it happening again, I think for a number of reasons."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: A Salt Lake City community theater company has canceled its production of the classic “To Kill a Mockingbird” scheduled for next month, over a legal dispute even Atticus Finch couldn’t argue his way around.
Seth Miller, artistic/executive director of The Grand Theatre at Salt Lake Community College, announced Tuesday that the theater’s cancellation of its production of the Harper Lee classic — set to be performed from March 21 to April 6 — was “due to circumstances beyond our control.”
In a statement posted on the Grand’s website, Miller said the theater company was caught in a legal dispute between Lee’s estate, Rudinplay in New York — the producer of a new adaptation now playing on Broadway — and Dramatic Publishing.
Dramatic Publishing has for years licensed the long-existing stage adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” written by Christopher Sergel. The Grand had licensed the rights to the Sergel version, and announced last March that the show was part of its 2018-19 season.
The Grand’s production began rehearsals on Feb. 6, after a few days of delays because of the legal wrangling, said Utah actor Anne Cullimore Decker, who was cast to play the narrator, the adult version of Atticus Finch’s daughter, Scout.
After 10 days of rehearsals, costume fittings and other preparations, Decker said, Miller and the play’s director, Mark Fossen, broke the news to the cast that the production would be canceled.
“It was a blow,” Decker said. “Everyone was just in shock.”
On Dec. 13, the new adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird” premiered at Broadway’s Schubert Theater, produced by Rudinplay, the company run by mogul Scott Rudin. It was written by Aaron Sorkin, the creator of TV’s “The West Wing” and the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of “The Social Network.” Jeff Daniels, who starred in Sorkin’s HBO series “The Newsroom,” plays Atticus Finch, the Alabama lawyer who defends a black man from a false charge of raping a white woman.
Sorkin’s adaptation has received positive reviews. The New York Times’ critic Jesse Green led the way, calling it “beautiful, elegiac” and noting the expanded role of the Finches’ black housekeeper, Calpurnia (played by LaTanya Richardson).
According to Miller’s statement, Rudinplay claims it now holds all licensing rights to Lee’s novel — and contests Dramatic Publishing’s rights to license the older, Sergel version to regional theater companies.
“We have exhausted every effort to overcome these obstacles and present our production, but under the threat of substantial legal action from Rudinplay we have had to cancel the show,” Miller said, adding that the Grand Theatre Foundation “is not in any kind of position to fight such an exhausting legal battle.”
Regional theater companies in Clarksville, Tenn., and Buffalo, N.Y., are listing their productions of the Sergel version to perform in March.
The Kavinoky Theatre in Buffalo will proceed with a production of the Sergel version to run March 8-31. “We’re totally legal,” said Loraine O’Donnell, executive artistic director at the Kavinoky. “The royalty company took our money, cashed our check.”
A call to the Roxy Regional Theatre in Tennessee, where the Sergel adaptation is scheduled to be performed March 8-23, was not returned.
In January, a production of the Sergel version that was set to tour the United Kingdom and Ireland was canceled, also during rehearsals. The UK producers said in a statement that lawyers representing a Rudin-formed company, Atticus LLC, claimed exclusive worldwide stage rights to Lee’s story.
“We’re becoming such a litigious nation,” Decker said. “When it hits nonprofit arts groups, it just breaks my heart.”
It’s common practice for a Broadway production, even a revival like “To Kill a Mockingbird,” to limit the title’s licensing rights outside of the Great White Way, said Chris Lino, managing director of Pioneer Theatre Company.
Broadway producers will hold “first-class rights” to a title, meaning they have veto over anyone else trying to put on a production, Lino said — and almost always the answer is “no.”
“If the show is running on Broadway, we’re generally not going to ask for it, because we know we’re not going to get it,” Lino said.
It is unusual for rights to be pulled after they have been granted, Lino said, adding that at Pioneer, “we never announce a title, let alone go into rehearsal with it, if we don’t have a fully executed contract.”
The Grand box office will refund all tickets sold for “To Kill a Mockingbird.”

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha sido cuestionado sobre sus intentos de intervenir o detener de algún modo la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
Esta semana, el New York Times hizo algunas revelaciones al respecto, aunado a declaraciones del exdirector interino del FBI, Andrew McCabe , sobre lo que motivó el inicio de las indagatorias: el despido de James Comey , exdirector del FBI.
1. Sospechas de injerencia.- A finales de 2018, el presidente Trump le preguntó al entonces fiscal general en funciones, Matthew Whitaker , si un abogado que él nombró podría supervisar una investigación relacionada con él mismo, luego de que el fiscal ya se había retirado de la investigación, informó el Times, que citó a varios funcionarios estadounidenses con conocimiento directo de la llamada. Esto es considerado como una forma de injerencia en la investigación.
2. Ataque a investigaciones.- Un conteo de ese diario reveló que el presidente Trump ha atacado al menos 1,2000 veces la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016. El reporte, hecho en un sistema de visualización, incluyen declaraciones hechas en Twitter, en discursos oficiales, en mítines y durante entrevistas con medios de comunicación y otros eventos de prensa. Esto significa que el mandatario ha cuestionado las indagatorias al menos una vez durante 330 días.
3. ¿Un activo ruso?.- El exdirector interino del FBI, McCabe, dijo que es posible que el presidente Trump sea un activo ruso. “¿Todavía cree que el presidente podría ser un activo ruso?” , preguntó a Anderson Cooper de CNN. “Creo que es posible. Creo que es por eso que comenzamos nuestra investigación, y estoy realmente ansioso por ver dónde (el fiscal especial Robert) Mueller concluye eso”, dijo McCabe. Es otro comentario explosivo de McCabe, que se produce días después de que describió las razones por las que los principales funcionarios de Estados Unidos decidieron abrir una investigación de contrainteligencia y una investigación por obstrucción de la justicia en el presidente Trump.
El recién ratificado fiscal federal, William Barr , indicó que es posible que la siguiente semana Mueller entregue algún reporte de las indagatorias que inició en 2017 y que han derivado en acusaciones a excolaboradores cercanos del presidente Trump, como su exabogado personal, Michael Cohen .

Smudges from the presidential pen

Texto completo: In Barack Obama's second term, with his legislative agenda dead in a Republican-controlled Congress, the president turned to executive unilateralism on an innovative scale. On climate regulation and health care he used the presidential pen to pursue policies denied him by Congress, and on immigration he made a more dramatic leap - claiming a power he himself had previously abjured, and offering a provisional legal status to about half the illegal-immigrant population.
At the time I called this "caesarism" - an attempt to arrogate to the imperial presidency the kind of power over domestic policy that it already claims over foreign and military affairs. And because the decay of republics is an iterative process, where each faction builds on the norm-breaking of its rivals, it was fairly obvious - well, to me, if not to his supporters - that Obama's caesarism helped stoke the caudillo appeal of Donald Trump, who promised a cruder version of the same impatient executive ambition.
Now, that caudillo spirit is taking legal form in Trump's most serious power grab to date: the attempt to use a "national emergency" declaration - a power whose chronic abuse by presidents Congress has never bestirred itself to check - to build the border fencing that the Democratic Party and his own political impotence have denied him.
On the merits, anyone who opposed Obama's moves should oppose this one as well. The scale of the policy change is smaller, but the defiance of Congress is more overt; the legal foundation might be slightly firmer (as Jell-O is slightly firmer than a pudding) but the bad faith involved in the "emergency" claim is more extreme.
And in general, serious conservatives are opposing Trump. Vox co-founder Matthew Yglesias recently snarked about right-wing pundits who got "overheated about Caesarism' and caudillos'" in the Obama era, mentioning myself and National Review editor Rich Lowry as examples. But Lowry has written sharply against the emergency declaration, and I'll happily endorse his point: If Obama was abusing his powers, then clearly so is Trump.
But in terms of the general lure of presidential rule, the general declension of republican norms into imperial habits, I also think Trump's caudillo act is substantially less dangerous than what his predecessors did.
Here I differ not only from liberals who misremember Obama as a punctilious norm-respecter, but also from those conservatives fretting that Trump is establishing a precedent for a future liberal president to impose a Green New Deal by fiat. Not that they won't be so tempted - but I just can't imagine anyone looking at the political train wreck of Trump's unilateralism and seeing a precedent worth invoking.
For presidential power to meaningfully expand, it is not enough for a president to simply make a power grab. That grab needs to unite his party (ideally it would also divide the opposition), it needs to be cloaked in enough piety and deniability to find support from would-be referees, it needs to appear to be politically successful, and finally it needs to be ratified by the other branches of government, if only by their inaction.
This mostly happened with post-9/11 war powers claimed by George W. Bush's administration: There was pushback and resistance, but many Democrats went along, Bush won re-election, and much of his war-on-terror architecture was adopted and expanded by the Obama administration.
Obama's attempt to play Caesar in domestic policy had more mixed results, since the immigration power grab was tied up by the courts until Trump's election rendered some of it a dead letter. But Obama at least persuaded Democrats and the media to go along with his caesarism, and he established precedents that a President Hillary Clinton would have undoubtedly embraced.
With Trump, though, the only clear precedent being set is one of deplorable incompetence. He's taking unpopular action that divides his party and unites the opposition, he's doing so with a combination of brazen hypocrisy and nonsense rhetoric that makes the power grab impossible to cloak, he's guaranteeing himself an extended legal battle - and he isn't even accomplishing any obvious goal (there's a reason real immigration restrictionists are against this plan) except the personal one of saving a tiny bit of face.
This spectacle will not prevent some future president from abusing an emergency declaration more effectively. But the idea that Trump's grab enables future abuses more  than the moves that Bush and Obama made is extremely dubious. If anything, precisely because his contempt for constitutional limits is so naked and his incompetence so stark, Trump has (modestly, modestly) weakened the imperial presidency by generating somewhat more pushback than his predecessors.
So the emergency declaration is not itself a constitutional emergency. Rather, as often in the Trump presidency, it's a moment that illuminates how a more dangerous would-be autocrat might someday act. It's a weird foretaste, not the main event. A warning, not a crisis. A clownish interlude in the republic's decline, not the Rubicon itself.

Texto completo: Miles Maiden, inventor of the SteriPEN and other ground-breaking, solar-based water purification technologies, has died.
The College of the Atlantic graduate died of cancer on Feb. 5 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Maiden was 60.
[Subscribe to our free weekly Hancock County newsletter]
His wife of 33 years, Meg Maiden, described Maiden as a restlessly intellectual entrepreneur. His SteriPEN, a hand-held ultraviolet water purifier used by outdoorsmen and international travelers, was called an "Invention of the Year" by Time magazine in 2001.
The device "revolutionized water purification," said Aaron Cox, a 49-year-old Ellsworth resident who started working with Maiden in 2004 while an engineering student at the University of Maine.
"Before he invented the SteriPEN, the only way they could purify water was through filters, which had been around for thousands of years," said Cox, who works as the SteriPEN brand manager for the company that makes the device today. "It's just a little lightbulb. You stick it in the water and in seconds, it kills all the microbes in the water without any manual effort at all."
Time later named it one of "the 100 greatest and most influential gadgets from 1923 to the present." The SteriPen, Maiden noted in 2011, was "listed right there with the Apple iPod and Velcro and the Jarvik artificial heart." Online reviewers rated SteriPEN the No. 1 gadget on the list.

"He was a very insightful person as far as technology goes. He was quick to understand everything," Cox said. "No one could see things around the corners like he could."
Meg Maiden described her husband as "funny and warm, and he was the kind of person who was always getting excited about new ideas. He was a real problem solver. He loved a challenge. He would just pursue them. If he didn't have the information, he would find the people who did."
An inveterate tinkerer and entrepreneur since childhood, Miles Maiden graduated from the College of the Atlantic in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in human ecology, and he studied philosophy as an undergraduate. He installed saunas and developed solar panel technology that tracked the sun and concentrated its heat into a thin line for greater efficiency. He traveled the country installing the devices at government buildings, Meg Maiden said.
The panels and pen "came from the germ of the same idea: the sun is a natural disinfectant," she said.
In the late 1990s, Maiden started working on a solar-powered water decontamination system for use in third-world countries. When that proved too ambitious, Maiden changed gears and worked to miniaturize the technology. He founded Hydro-Photon Inc. in 1997 in Blue Hill to develop the SteriPEN. The device emits UV-C rays, which prevent bacteria from reproducing by altering their DNA.
"It's not the microbes that make you sick,'' Maiden told The New York Times in 2002. ''It's when they reproduce and start having a party in your stomach.''
Today, SteriPEN products are sold worldwide by retailers including L.L. Bean, Dick's Sporting Goods, Cabela's, Amazon and Costco. The Swiss company Katadyn acquired Hydro-Photon in July 2017.
[Blue Hill outdoorsman-inventor paves the way to safe water, any time, anywhere]
Maiden demonstrated what his wife described as the world's first use of ultraviolet LEDs in a germ-killing application in April 2004. He also contracted with the Office of Naval Research and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense that develops military technologies, to help develop ultraviolet and LED-based water purification systems.
"His thought processes were always deliberate, step-by-step," Cox said.
Maiden holds 11 U.S. patents and many foreign patents, yet his intellectual side complemented a deep love of physical activity and the outdoors. He built his home in Blue Hill himself, loved to fish Blue Hill Harbor aboard his wooden boat, Malachi Mudge, and backpacked through India and Nepal where he became interested in Eastern religion, philosophy and oriental rugs. One of his most rewarding years was spent in Jamaica with his wife teaching at a local high school, Meg Maiden said.
Miles Maiden could be gallant, too. He brought his mother-in-law flowers almost any time he could, much to the chagrin of his brothers-in-law, who started bringing their mother flowers, too, his wife said.
"He had a great artistic sense and loved working with his hands, whether it was decorating his daughters' birthday cakes, working on watercolor paintings or building backyard patios and trellises," Meg Maiden said.
Miles Maiden is survived by his wife; their daughters Haley and Hannah; sister Elizabeth Lynne Maiden of Indio, California; and many cousins in England and Cape Cod. His brother Marcus predeceased him in 2005.
A celebration of Maiden's life will take place at 3 p.m. Saturday, March 2, at the Farmhouse Inn in Blue Hill.

Texto completo: COMING UP
Tonight: CC Spokane at North Idaho, 7:30
Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak boarded a private jet Monday, a flight that landed on a chilly airstrip at Walla Walla Regional Airport.
His latest recruiting trip - about 48 hours before facing Pac-12 leader Washington in Seattle - was inside a small, dome-shaped arena at Walla Walla Community College, the scene of North Idaho College's 100-69 throttling of the Warriors.
Krystkowiak wasn't there to visit NIC guard Nate Pryor, the former West Seattle High star who said he's still committed to Washington.
He also wasn't there to steal away NIC big man and Utah State commit Alphonso Anderson, a product of Seattle's Garfield High.
Krystkowiak apparently wanted more face time with gifted 6-foot-4 guard RayQuan Evans, the reigning Northwest Athletic Conference Most Valuable Player.
Evans, one of three Native American guards helping boost the top-ranked Cardinals (24-2, 13-0 East Region), recently decommitted from Utah State.
Utah and Colorado are among the biggest schools pursuing him, Evans said.
"Utah State is a good program with a great coaching staff," said Evans, who led NIC to an NWAC title last year. "But I've come this far, so why not try and go farther?"
If NIC coach Corey Symons didn't make a late push for Evans two years ago, Evans said he'd likely be living at home in Billings and playing at Rocky Mountain College.
He's now one of the most coveted junior college players in the country, according to JucoRecruiting.com - a distinction often reserved for metropolitan and overseas talent.
Evans, a member of the Crow Tribe, is neither.
The son of ex-Montana guard Israel Evans, RayQuan spent a portion of his childhood on the Crow Indian Reservation near Hardin, about an hour east of Billings.
Years later at Skyview High in Billings, Evans was among the most electrifying players in Montana, but he was still relatively unknown outside the state.
"There was a recruiting trip in Montana where a coach comes up to our staff and says, 'You guys are idiots for being in this gym. You need to be in Billings' " Symons said.
"We didn't see him in any big AAU tournaments, so we didn't know who he was."
Montana was also interested, Evans said, but he was an academic nonqualifier who wasn't interested in sitting out a year in Missoula.
He would have likely made an immediate impact at Rocky, but Symons offered what the NAIA member couldn't - the ability to showcase his talent to bigger schools as he got acclimated to a college curriculum.
"Now a lot of schools have been after him," Symons said. "He's big, strong and athletic. He can defend and do a lot of things."
NIC point guard Phillip Malatare (9 ppg, 3 apg) and sharpshooter Emmitt Taylor III (14.5 ppg) are two other under-the-radar gems with Native American heritage.
Both grew up in tiny, hoops-rich reservation towns - Malatare in Arlee, Montana, and Taylor in Lapwai, Idaho, - and helped lead their respective schools to state championships.
Malatare, a crafty 6-foot-1 freshman, was also an academic nonqualifier who, like Evans, was offered to sit out a year at Montana. He was also coveted by about every small college in the state.
He wanted an opportunity to play immediately but also wasn't ready to give up on his dream of Division I basketball.
"You see a lot of kids on the reservation and that's as far as many of them make it," said Malatare, who was featured in a lengthy New York Times article last year about the tragedy and triumphs of his Flathead Indian Reservation's high school basketball team.
NIC also has a pair of Arlee alums in reserve guard Tyler Tanner and assistant coach Zach Camel, who played at Montana.
"Some may go on, but not usually," Malatare said. "I wanted to go on, develop and have a chance to do better academically."
Taylor echoed Malatare.
"A lot of people want to go back (to the reservation) or don't want to leave," said Taylor, who has hit 95 3-pointers this season. "But (Evans and Malatare) have helped give me a home-like feeling."
Taylor, the cousin of Idaho guard Trevon Allen, is one the purest shooters in NIC's history, according to Symons, and is on Cal State Bakersfield and Texas-Martin's recruiting radar.
"It's cool for us coaches to see these guys live their heritage here," Symons said. "These guys are proud of where they're from."

Texto completo: Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday called for reconsideration of the Supreme Court's landmark decision making it more difficult for public officials to claim defamation as the court turned down a request from an accuser of Bill Cosby.
The court declined to take the case of Kathrine McKee, who accused Cosby of raping her more than 40 years ago. She sued after Cosby's attorney leaked a letter that she said distorted her background to "damage her reputation for truthfulness and honesty" and to shame her.
Thomas said he agreed with his colleagues not to accept McKee's "factbound" appeal.
But he launched a detailed critique of the landmark libel ruling, which he said was a "policy-driven" decision "masquerading as constitutional law." No other justice joined his concurrence.
But President Donald Trump has also expressed support for making it easier to sue for defamation, and during the campaign -- and afterward -- he complained about "hit pieces" in The Washington Post and The New York Times.
"I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money," Trump said during the campaign. Over the weekend, he complained about a "Saturday Night Live" skit and wondered about "retribution."
Some media law experts expressed concern over Thomas' declaration.
Jonathan Peters, a professor of media law at the University of Georgia, said New York Times v. Sullivan "is essential to our modern understanding of press freedom."
Peters said the ruling "had the immediate impact of emboldening news organizations to cover the civil rights movement more forcefully -- and later the Vietnam War and Watergate."
But Thomas and Justice Antonin Scalia have said the court may have intruded into a space in which it was not needed.
"We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy driven approach to the Constitution," Thomas wrote. "Instead, we should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we."
The media for decades has depended on New York Times v. Sullivan as a shield for reporting on public figures. But Thomas said Justice Byron White had also expressed concern after he was in the majority in the case.

Resumen: The proposal gained traction in the early days of the administration because of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn and presidential confidant Tom Barrack, who had potential financial stakes in the plan, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform said in initial findings released on Tuesday. Back in January 2017, a group of retired American generals, national security officials and energy industry executives wrote MbS a letter, released by the House committee, that proposed sharing nuclear power with Saudi Arabia. According to a February 2017 memo obtained by ProPublica and WNYC, Barrack’s company aimed to take advantage of its access to the White House to get a head start on infrastructure investment opportunities.

Texto completo: The Trump administration has continued pursuing a proposed nuclear power deal with Saudi Arabia despite warnings from ethics lawyers and security experts, according to a congressional oversight committee.
The proposal gained traction in the early days of the administration because of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn and presidential confidant Tom Barrack, who had potential financial stakes in the plan, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform said in initial findings released on Tuesday.
“Further investigation is needed to determine whether the actions being pursued by the Trump Administration are in the national security interest of the United States or, rather, serve those who stand to gain financially as a result of this potential change in U.S. foreign policy,” the oversight committee said in its report on Tuesday.
The committee’s report confirms details in a ProPublica article from November 2017 and cites another article from earlier this month.
The White House premised its Middle East policy on bolstering ties with Saudi Arabia. But Trump’s unwavering support for Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman has faced mounting bipartisan criticism amid the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the humanitarian crisis spawned by the Saudi-led war in Yemen.
The administration’s early efforts threatened to make an end-run around U.S. laws governing the transfer of nuclear power technology, the oversight committee said. The U.S. tightly controls the technology because it can be diverted to build atomic bombs.
The administration has since taken steps to follow the legal process for sharing nuclear power with the Saudis. Just last week, Trump had a meeting with nuclear industry executives convened by one of the organizers of the Saudi proposal.
Should the U.S. and Saudi Arabia reach a deal, Congress would have 90 days to block it through a joint resolution.
The White House didn’t immediately answer a request for comment. Neither did the company that organized the Saudi proposal, IP3.
While Saudi Arabia has a legitimate goal of diversifying its economy away from oil, its leaders have also shown interest in keeping pace with Iran’s nuclear development. “Without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,” the crown prince, who is known in Washington by his initials MbS, told “60 Minutes” last year.
Back in January 2017, a group of retired American generals, national security officials and energy industry executives wrote MbS a letter, released by the House committee, that proposed sharing nuclear power with Saudi Arabia. They called the project a “21st Century Marshall Plan for the Middle East,” in homage to the American aid program in Europe after World War II.

When the project’s organizers began lobbying the Trump administration, an unnamed senior administration official offered a different description of the plan, according to the committee’s report: “a scheme for these generals to make some money.”
The plan had two key allies: Flynn and Barrack.
Flynn was an adviser to the project from June 2016 to December 2016, according to his financial disclosure form. Once in the White House, Flynn directed an aide to lead the plan, according to whistleblower testimony summarized by the House committee. The aide, Derek Harvey, told staff that Flynn wanted them to include the plan in briefing materials for a call between President Trump and the Saudi king, according to the report. Officials responded that Harvey could not circumvent the legal requirements surrounding the transfer of nuclear technology, but Harvey insisted the decision had already been made during the transition, the report said.
The staff notified the National Security Council’s lawyers, who agreed that Flynn had a conflict of interest and told the staff to cease work on the project, according to the committee’s report. But Harvey continued to work on the project, and after Flynn was fired, the two spoke daily, the report said.
In December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and hiding his Turkish lobbying and agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
A lawyer for Flynn did not immediately respond a request on Tuesday for comment; Harvey did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
Barrack, a wealthy investor of Lebanese descent, became a backer of the Saudi nuclear plan because he was encouraging Trump to make a bold economic initiative in the Middle East. “They found an advocate in me in saying I was keen on trying to establish a realignment of U.S. business interests with the Gulf’s business interests,” he told ProPublica in November 2017. Barrack said he discussed joining the administration to lead this initiative but never committed to an official role.
Documents dated January 2017 and released by the House oversight committee on Tuesday suggest that Barrack had agreed to become a “special representative” leading the project across government agencies. The committee also released a memo, written by Barrack and dated March 2017, that proposed, “the president will appoint a special representative for the Trump Middle East Marshall Plan with the diplomatic rank of ambassador or special advisor the President.”
At the same time that Barrack was discussing taking charge of Trump’s Middle East outreach, he was looking for ways to make money off it. According to a February 2017 memo obtained by ProPublica and WNYC, Barrack’s company aimed to take advantage of its access to the White House to get a head start on infrastructure investment opportunities. The memo said the company had “a pipeline of potential projects” and contacts with “several of the key agencies that will direct those efforts.” No rivals, it said, “can currently match the relationships or resources that we possess.”
Almost a quarter of the $7 billion raised by Barrack’s company since Trump won the Republican nomination came from Saudi Arabia or its close ally the United Arab Emirates, The New York Times reported in June 2018, citing an unnamed executive.

White House May Share Nuclear Power Technology With Saudi Arabia
The overture follows an intense and secretive lobbying push involving Michael Flynn, Tom Barrack, Rick Gates and even Iran-Contra figure Robert McFarlane.
Confidential Memo: Company of Trump Inaugural Chair Sought to Profit From Connections to Administration, Foreigners
The memo outlines how Colony, the company founded by Tom Barrack, an investor who chaired the inaugural, aimed to exploit its connections to Donald Trump. Federal prosecutors are conducting a wide-ranging probe into the nonprofit that ran the inaugural.
One idea that Barrack considered, as he acknowledged in his interview with ProPublica, was investing in Westinghouse, the sole U.S. manufacturer of large-scale nuclear reactors, which filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2017. A March 2017 letter, released by the House oversight committee, from the organizers of the Saudi nuclear power plan to MbS referenced a “partnership to acquire Westinghouse.”
A Westinghouse spokeswoman declined to comment.
That same month, then-Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland told White House staff that Trump had told Barrack he could lead the Middle East Marshall Plan, the committee report said. McFarland noted Barrack’s leadership of the inauguration and longstanding business ties across the Middle East, according to the report, telling staff, “You should all be meeting with Tom.”
A few days later, Barrack had a conference call about the Saudi nuclear plan with Harvey while Rick Gates was in Harvey’s office, according to the report.
Gates was Trump’s deputy campaign manager and worked with Paul Manafort in Ukraine. He worked for Barrack on the inauguration and then joined his company. In February 2018, Gates pleaded guilty to financial fraud and lying to investigators and began cooperating with Mueller.
Federal prosecutors have also begun a wide-ranging investigation of Trump’s inaugural committee.
A spokesman for Barrack said he will cooperate with the congressional investigation.
The House oversight committee, chaired by Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said it will seek additional documents from multiple agencies and private companies involved in the episode.
At last week’s White House meeting with nuclear executives, Saudi Arabia was discussed as a potential new market for reactors, according to Seth Grae, the CEO of nuclear fuel developer Lightbridge, who was present but said he is not involved in the Saudi proposal. Trump seemed supportive of the industry, Grae said, and the group will follow up with suggestions for how the government can help them. Energy Secretary Rick Perry and economic adviser Larry Kudlow were also present, Grae said.

City on hair bias: Just cut it out

Texto completo: New York City doesn't want people to have their hairstyles held against them, and it unveiled novel guidelines Monday against hairdo discrimination.
The new legal guidance says the city's existing human rights law protects New Yorkers' right to "maintain natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic or cultural identities."
"Hair is a part of you. Race discrimination based on hair is illegal in NYC," Human Rights Commission Chairwoman Carmelyn Malalis tweeted Monday after releasing the guidelines, first reported by The New York Times.
In effect, the guidance enables people to seek fines and other remedies if they've been harassed or punished in workplaces, schools or public spaces because of their hair texture or style. Hairnets, ties and the like can still be required for health and safety reasons.
The protections apply to everyone but were prompted largely by what the commission calls "racist stereotypes that black hairstyles are unprofessional."
The guidance specifically warns employers they could face legal trouble for banning styles associated with black people, such as Afros, dreadlocks or cornrows, or for instructing black workers to straighten their hair.
Around the country, some schools have drawn attention for banning dreadlocks, do-rags, Afros and other ways of wearing hair.
In December, there was an outcry after a white referee told a black New Jersey high school wrestler to cut his dreadlocks right before a match or forfeit it. The teen had the haircut, but many criticized the demand, including the state's governor and an Olympic wrestler.

Texto completo: LONDON -- The Japanese architect Junya Ishigami will design this year's Serpentine Pavilion, a temporary structure erected each summer in Hyde Park, London, the Serpentine Gallery announced on Thursday.
The pavilions are a major tourist attraction and have also become one of the world's most prestigious architectural commissions.
Mr. Ishigami, 44, said in a statement that his design featured slates arranged into a canopy that appeared to grow out of the ground, "resembling a hill made out of rocks."
The structure would have the weighty presence of slate, he said, while "simultaneously appearing so light it could blow away in the breeze." It would look "like a billowing piece of fabric," he added.
The pavilion will be open from June 20 to Oct. 6.
Mr. Ishigami started his architectural practice in Tokyo in 2004 and has drawn praise for his dreamlike structures. In 2010, he won the main prize at the Venice Biennale of Architecture for an installation called "Architecture as Air." Felix Burrichter wrote in The New York Times that the work "serves as a reminder that one has to be able to dream in order to find solutions for the very real architectural concerns of today."
Oliver Wainwright, writing in The Guardian after the Serpentine commission was announced, said Mr. Ishigami was "a magician of materials, an architectural alchemist who seems able to bend the laws of physics with his surreal, poetic work."
Mr. Ishigami's selection is the fourth time that Japanese architects have been involved with the pavilion commission since Zaha Hadid's inaugural effort in 2000.
Others to have designed the pavilion include Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas and, last year, the Mexican architect Frida Escobedo.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In the fall of 2015, Dr. Herbert Dardik, chief of vascular surgery at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in New Jersey, nodded off in the operating room.
Note that Dardik, then 80, was not performing the operation. He’d undergone a minor medical procedure himself a few days earlier, so he’d told his patient that another surgeon would handle her carotid endarterectomy, in which plaque is removed from the carotid artery to improve blood flow.
But when she begged Dardik at least to be present during the operation, he agreed to sit in. “I was really an accessory,” he recalled. “It was so boring, I kind of dozed off” - whereupon an alarmed nurse anesthetist reported the incident to administrators.
Within days, the hospital’s chief of anesthesiology and chief medical officer were in Dardik’s office, praising his surgical skill while urging him to reduce his workload.
“I got so annoyed, I stood up and opened the door and said, ‘Get out,’ ” Dardik said. “Who knows better what I can do but I myself?”
He also resisted the suggestion that he undergo testing at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, which had established a two-day program to evaluate whether older surgeons could safely continue practicing.
Not long afterward, Dardik was on a plane when its older-looking captain came aboard. (Federal regulations mandate a retirement age of 65 for commercial pilots.)
“I hope this guy’s still OK,” Dardik remembered thinking. At which point, “it hit me like a hammer - this is what other people think when they look at me.”
A few weeks later, he became the first doctor evaluated by Sinai Hospital’s aging surgeon program.
Aging profession
The physician workforce, like the rest of the population, has grown substantially grayer in recent years. Almost a quarter of practicing physicians were 65 or older in 2015, according to the American Medical Association. In 2017, more than 122,000 physicians in that age group were engaged in patient care.
Health care researchers and analysts are debating what, if anything, to do about this tide of aging practitioners. “We know that human faculties decrease with age,” said Dr. Mark Katlic, the thoracic surgeon who founded Sinai Hospital’s program.
Declining vision, hearing and cognition can affect any health professional (or any human). But Katlic has expressed particular concern about surgeons, who need to retain exceptional vision, manual dexterity, reaction speed and stamina.
Past age 70, “can you grab a tiny little blood vessel with a forceps and not grab something else?” he asked. “Or use very small instruments for sutures?” Some operations, he pointed out, go on for six or seven hours, even longer.
Studies haven’t produced clear-cut answers to such questions. Cognition and other abilities decrease with age - but the variability between individuals increases.
At 75, “there are sharp, wonderful doctors, and those who need to stop,” said Dr. E. Patchen Dellinger, lead author of a review on aging physicians published in JAMA Surgery.
Whether older surgeons have poorer outcomes than younger ones also remains debatable, because decades of experience and judgment can compensate for modest physical or cognitive declines.
One large study of Medicare patients found surgeons over age 60 had higher mortality rates for several kinds of operations, including coronary bypasses, but not for other procedures. And the differences were small, occurring mostly among doctors who performed few operations.
Last year, conversely, researchers reviewing records for nearly 900,000 Medicare patients reported that operations by older surgeons resulted in lower mortality than those by younger physicians.
“It’s probably a small percentage of surgeons in their 70s who have trouble, maybe 5 or 10 percent,” Katlic said. “But they’re the ones we want to identify.”
That has proved daunting. “The public believes we police ourselves as a profession,” he added. “We don’t, at least not very well.”
A 2016 statement from the American College of Surgeons, for instance, recommended physical, visual and neurocognitive testing for older surgeons - but on an entirely voluntary basis, with no requirement that they disclose the results.
Becoming a surgeon is difficult, a grueling marathon. But remaining one isn’t very demanding, experts say. Regular hospital recertification tends to be perfunctory. Peers often fail to report troubling behavior, especially since senior physicians can be powerful, respected figures.
Not good at self-judgment
Research also indicates that older surgeons do a poor job of judging their own competence. “We’re sort of a fraternity of highly regarded professionals,” Dellinger said. “And we highly regard ourselves.”
Doctors resist suggestions that they slow down or walk away, added Dr. Glen Gabbard, a psychiatrist at Baylor College of Medicine who has specialized in psychological evaluations of doctors.
“Being a physician is at the core of their identity,” he said. “It becomes something they can’t let go of. They can’t imagine retiring. ‘Who’s going to take care of my patients?’ ”
A mandatory retirement age could solve such problems. But it also could violate discrimination laws, sideline perfectly competent doctors and leave rural communities even more underserved.
Advocates argue that mandatory screening at older ages represents a better approach, a way to distinguish able senior professionals from those who should retire, reduce their responsibilities, or transition to teaching and other roles.
A handful of hospitals have already adopted that tactic, including the University of Virginia Health System, Temple University Hospital and UPMC in Pittsburgh.
Late-career practitioner policies, as they’re often called, kick in at age 70 or older and typically cover not only physicians but nurse-practitioners, physician assistants and other professionals.
The Society of Surgical Chairs, representing leaders at academic medical centers, may boost such efforts in the next few months when it publishes a new white paper, “Transitioning the Senior Surgeon.” Dr. Todd Rosengart, the society’s president, expects the report to spur wider discussions.
But for now, the number of institutions that have taken any formal action related to age remains tiny. In its fifth year, Sinai Hospital’s assessment program has screened a grand total of eight surgeons, ages 55 to 81.
As the first, Dardik found the testing arduous but did well. The program’s report indicated that he could capably continue operating.
When the assessment team discussed his performance, “most people said, ‘If I needed a short vascular surgery, like a carotid endarterectomy, I’d have him do it,’ ” Katlic recalled, though for extended operations, they might opt for someone younger.
Back at Englewood, however, Dardik began experiencing intensifying back pain. Worried about distractions in the OR, he voluntarily stopped performing surgery in 2016.
Now 83, he still comes to the hospital every weekday but has shifted to research, teaching and mentoring.
“You think you’re invincible,” he reflected. “But the clock ticks, and I’ve become an advocate for evaluation.”
He couldn’t persuade his colleagues to adopt a late-career program, however. “We were looking at it,” he said. “I thought we were getting there. Then it quietly fell apart.”

Texto completo: Singer-songwriter Kristen Graves will appear in concert at 7 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 24, at Elizabethtown Church of the Brethren, 777 S. Mount Joy St., Elizabethtown. Graves is a humanitarian from Fairfield, Connecticut, who has been listed as part of the “new generation of folk music” by The New York Times and mentioned in Rolling Stone for her music’s environmental activism. Proceeds from the event go to Church World Service refugee settlement.
Flute choir kicks off concert series at Zion Lutheran
Zion Lutheran Church, 75 E. Brandt Blvd., Landisville, will feature the Pennsylvania Flute Choir when it debuts the Zion Musik concert series at 4 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 24.
The Pennsylvania Flute Choir is an auditioned, community group formed in 2002 by flutist Georgia Dimaano. Former musical directors include Debra Torok, professional recording artist, pianist, composer, conductor and teacher, and Marc Adler, professional musician and educator. The choir has grown from a one-time recital group to an active, professional ensemble.
This is the first of four concerts to be presented as part of the Zion Musik concert series.
James C. Alfieri, the newly appointed director of music and worship arts at the church, believes the concert series is a perfect way to complement the church’s music program and provide community outreach.
All concerts, which are free and open to the public, are held in Zion’s sanctuary. Zion Musik is supported by freewill offerings and sponsorships.
Celtic Evensong service part of church's 300th anniversary
Donegal Presbyterian Church, 1891 Donegal Springs Road, Mount Joy, will hold its second Celtic Evensong service at 7 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 24, in the church sanctuary.
This service is part of the continuing celebration of the church’s 300th anniversary that will be held in 2021. The service is faithful to the tradition of “prayer of the hours,” as well as Scots-Irish worship forms. The theme of the service is “Peace in the Midst of Chaos,” and will focus on the gift of peace, with quiet and silence as important elements of communal worship. All are invited to attend. An offering will be taken.

Texto completo: You can learn a tremendous amount about our country's history and its present state by reading whose death didn't merit an obituary in The New York Times.

The newspaper launched "Overlooked" last March, in time for International Women's Day, with a series of obits for 15 remarkable women whose deaths went unremarked upon at the time of their death. (Author Sylvia Plath, journalist Ida B. Wells, Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells led to a medical revolution, Margaret Abbott, the first American woman to win an Olympics championship.)

During Black History Month, the paper is adding a series of prominent black men and women who didn't receive obituaries.

Scott Joplin, for instance, the pianist and composer behind "The Entertainer" and "Maple Leaf Rag," who died in 1917. From the "Overlooked" obit: "In the post-Civil War era, the cruel breath of slavery and the aborted plan of Reconstruction still hung over the American South. But in the Joplin home, banjo and fiddle music filled the family's evenings, giving the children -- Scott in particular -- a sense of music's power to move."

Joplin died penniless and was buried in an unmarked grave. His music wove its way throughout the 1973 movie "The Sting," which renewed the public's interest in him. "It was as if the nation had suddenly discovered a new and dazzling composer," the obit reads. "Joplin's grave was given a suitable marker. And in 1976, he was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his contributions to American music."

Also: Major Taylor, the first African-American world champion in cycling and the second black athlete to win a world championship in any sport. He was living in Chicago when he died, broke, in 1932. The Chicago Defender published a short obituary at the time.

Also: Civil rights pioneer Elizabeth Jennings, who refused to leave a whites-only trolley on her way to her organist gig at the First Colored American Congregational Church in Lower Manhattan. She was kicked off, sued the trolley company for damages and won -- 100 years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat for a white passenger.

Also: Moses Fleetwood Walker, the first black baseball player to play in the major leagues -- as catcher for the American Association's Toledo Blue Stockings in 1884 -- long before Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.

Also: Margaret Garner, whose "Overlooked" obit reads, "Motherhood, across race, language, country and culture, is understood to be complicated and powerful: a tsunami of gut and joy and fear and heartache. Garner found herself in that fleeting, lightless instant of a mother's incongruous love on a frigid night, when slave catchers surrounded her cousins' home and when she made the decision, in one soul-chilling moment, to slit the throat of her 2-year-old daughter rather than return her to slavery."

Garner's life story inspired Toni Morrison's 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "Beloved." Her death went unremarked upon in newspapers. Until now.

The new series of obituaries, online and in print, adds a dozen lives to the "Overlooked" project.

"Many of them were a generation removed from slavery," obituary editor Amisha Padnani writes in a note to readers. "To carve a name for themselves, they sometimes had to make myth out of a painful history, misrepresenting their past to gain a better footing in their future. They were ambitious and creative, becoming painters and composers, filmmakers and actors. Others used their imaginations to invent and innovate. Often they felt an unspoken greater mission to break the constraints society placed on their race.

"Some managed to achieve success in their lifetimes, only to die penniless, buried in paupers' graves," Padnani continues. "Almost all of them reached deep within themselves to push back against harsh circumstances, the likes of which are unimaginable for many of us today."

Unimaginable, but essential to read and digest and remember, if you want to understand our nation's painful, often shameful, past.

Depression in pregnant women and new moms is preventable, experts say. Here's how

Texto completo: The number of women who suffer from depression during or after pregnancy is staggeringly high.
Perinatal depression affects as many as 1 in 7 women, according to the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. It's one of the most common complications of pregnancy and after childbirth.
And it can be prevented, according to new research.
A report published in JAMA by the U. S Preventive Services Task Force found that care such as mental-health screening and counseling effectively prevents perinatal depression.
"We really need to find these women before they get depressed,” Karina Davidson, a task force member and senior vice president for research at Northwell Health told the New York Times.
What is perinatal depression?
Perinatal depression refers to depressive disorders during pregnancy or the postpartum period.
Symptoms include, according to the JAMA report:
Loss of interest and energy.
Depressed mood.
Fluctuations in sleep or eating patterns.
Reduced ability to think or concentrate.
Feelings of worthlessness.
Recurring thoughts of suicide.
Depression is different than the common “baby blues. ” While both refer to mood disturbances that can manifest as crying, irritability, fatigue and anxiety, depression lasts for more than two weeks while "baby blues" are usually gone within 10 days of delivery.
The mother's disease can also affect her child. It can result in premature birth and low birth weight. Children of mothers who had perinatal depression demonstrate more behavior problems, lower cognitive functioning and increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders, the report said.
How can perinatal depression be prevented?
The panel of clinicians and researchers looked at various methods for depression prevention. Among them:
Physical activity.
Antidepressants.
Omega-3 fatty acids.
Expressive writing.
Infant sleep training.
Counseling.
Education.
Yoga.
Counseling was the clear winner, the panel found. It reduced the risk of depression by 39 percent.
In particular, the panel favored cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy.
Cognitive behavioral therapy addresses an individual's patterns of thought and behavior while interpersonal therapy focuses on a person's relationships and actions with others.
MORE: Let's all resolve to stop saying these things to pregnant women and new moms
Health providers should refer at-risk women to counseling, the panel recommended
The good news?
Screening for depression is covered at no cost for moms under the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The bad news?
Since there is no standard screening tool for medical professionals to check for perinatal depression, it is "more complex to perform a risk assessment" and accurately determine if a woman is at-risk, Harvard Medical School psychiatrist Marlene P. Freeman wrote in an editorial accompanying the recommendations.

--
In "Breaking Bad," Walter White went from ineffectual nonentity to super-competent tough guy and moral monster, and millions of us couldn't look away. The true-life story of Paul Le Roux offers the same binge-caliber morbid fascination. Two new books seek to give Le Roux his full, grisly measure. Evan Ratliff's "The Mastermind" and "Hunting LeRoux" by Elaine Shannon drop with TV and movie adaptations -- from all-A-list Noah Hawley and the Russo brothers, and Michael Mann, respectively -- already in the works. There's a boomlet on in scandal and skullduggery: Blood-testing scam Theranos is the subject of upcoming HBO and ABC documentaries plus a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence, while Netflix and Hulu documentaries spotlight faux music festival Fyre. But Le Roux makes Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and Fyre impresario Billy McFarland look like milquetoasts.
"The Mastermind" chronicles Le Roux's metamorphosis from garden-variety misanthropic nerd with mad coding skills (born in Zimbabwe, raised in South Africa, beguiled as a teen by programming's power "to create worlds in code") to sociopathic kingpin. It's unclear why a doted-on kid from a well-off home broke bad, but Ratliff surmises that discovering at 30 he was adopted flicked a switch. Whatever the catalyst, his arc thereafter is one of exhilarating human agency, moral vacuity and abject depravity that intersects with the storylines of our time -- failed states, war in Iraq and Afghanistan that washed up footloose vets and ex-military contractors in the fleshpots of Manila as bagmen and muscle for Le Roux's ventures, and the opioid epidemic.
Principally though he was the master criminal of the "move fast and break things" age of internet capitalism. Like other tech founders of the 2000s, Le Roux saw an opportunity for web-based disruption and went big, fast. His internet pharmacy shipped pain meds by the pallet to U.S. consumers, grossing $250 million a year at its peak. Shunning controlled painkillers and recruiting real doctors to issue prescriptions -- based on "patient" responses to online quizzes -- plus accredited chemists to fulfill orders, Le Roux could have been acclaimed a visionary in telemedicine, had he stopped there, Ratliff remarks. But he went fully black hat with his next move, parlaying the proceeds into a globe-girdling agglomeration of criminal enterprises that dealt drugs and weapons to and from rogue regimes, warlords, terrorists and street gangs.
"The Mastermind" is a tour de force of shoe-leather reporting -- undertaken, amid threats and menacing, at considerable personal risk. Ratliff's reportage unfolds in crisp, atmospheric prose, and he brings a dispassionate eye to a milieu lousy with unreliable narrators, triangulating where possible to separate fact from legend.
Ratliff anatomizes an operation -- traversing shell corporations, safe houses, precious metal stashes and an in-house skunkworks staffed by Romanian engineers functioning as a pop-up military contractor -- that trafficked coveted North Korean methamphetamine (the real Heisenberg "blue"), peddled an explosives recipe to Iran, sought to produce a guidance system for Iranian missiles and mocked up a mini-submarine for stealthy transit of contraband. Le Roux's "throw money or people at the wall and see what sticks" strategy suggests a warped, demented venture capitalist. Opportunities he staked out in lawless locales -- for instance, partnering with Somali pirates on a fishing venture (also an ahead-of-its-time exercise in capacity building, suggests Ratliff) -- gave new meaning to subprime investing. He presided over his fiefdom from an aerie atop a luxury Manila high-rise using an encrypted laptop, a shifting cast of hatchet men and a scheming mind that never slept.
But business convention wasn't the only thing he broke. Underlings suspected of being on the take were terrorized (tossed in the ocean, raked over with machine gunfire; their homes firebombed) or murdered (he admitted to ordering seven killings), and he didn't shrink from lending his hit men a hand. He took a baseball bat to a date who declined to gratify him and delegated employees to procure women from Filipino villages and install them at his properties -- for pleasure but also so he could sire "a trusted brigade of his own offspring."
Le Roux's undoing was his zeal for the deal. Flagging the volume of his online pill slinging, drug enforcement officials in Minneapolis were on his trail from 2007. But by 2012 the breadth of his dealings had landed him in the crosshairs of the DEA's special ops "960 group." Agents cooked up a blockbuster coke-for-meth-and-meth-labs deal with a Colombian cartel to lure him to Liberia, where he was collared. In custody, he went undercover to reel in criminal associates. Which explains why this may be the first you're hearing of Le Roux: His capture six-plus years ago went unannounced, and details of his crimes seeped out -- reported in the New York Times and other outlets -- only through his testimony at the trials of confederates he helped nab.
But this endgame is no mere coda, and it's worth shifting here to "Hunting LeRoux," which advertises its inside track on the DEA sting.
This yields precious insight. Shannon's description of the ruthlessly transactional Le Roux recalibrating his new reality -- "eyes twinkling like a computer rebooting" -- to turn informer aboard the plane from Liberia, is priceless. In detention, agents equip him with a laptop, setting up the pretense he's still at large to choreograph the roundup of his confreres (like a latter-day Howard Hughes, he managed much of his operation remotely though proxies, so, even incarcerated, he barely skipped a beat). "Faced with a keyboard and monitor, he entered a trancelike state geeks call zombie mode."
But "Hunting LeRoux's" F-bombs-flying smell-the-funk "proximity" to the action comes wreathed in fumes from its high-octane prose: "With his imposing 350-pound physique, anvil-shaped forehead, and blue-black eyes that gleam like lit cigarettes, [Le Roux] strides into a room and takes command, projecting the menacing gravitas of an absolutely powerful medieval monarch, a Gilded Age robber baron, or a Wagnerian antihero." Or, "He loved the Iranian missile guidance project, and nothing and no-one else." A story scarcely in need of it is sensationalized.
Shannon valorizes the DEA takedown and plays up the villainy of the lowlives Le Roux helped bust. But the deal he cut opened the door to a more lenient sentence for himself. Were officials played?
Le Roux dangled the prospect of helping agents infiltrate Iran and North Korea's arms and meth-dealing networks. Instead, after determining that -- short of running him as an asset in the field -- they didn't have enough to go on, they moved to roll up "the LeRoux criminal network."
But, as Shannon notes, Le Roux ran a bare-bones shop, analogous to a "lean startup" and used "the gig economy to procure contract mercenaries and temp workers." Three of the scalps he brought in had no prior dealings with him.
"Most of the people ... LeRoux ... helped the DEA catch had become criminals entirely at his behest," adds Ratliff. "[B]alanced against what the DEA knew about Le Roux it was hard not to think that he had manipulated them into overlooking the gravity of his own crimes."
A 960 group source tells Ratliff he expects Le Roux to draw 15 years. With time served, this would give him back his liberty -- with, by agents' own reckoning, much of his fortune still intact -- in his 50s.
As of this writing, Le Roux may have saved his best deal for last.

learning from our elders

Texto completo: Like many baby boomers, John Leland is a front-row observer of aging as the son of a 90-year-old mother. Unlike most boomers, he felt driven to expand his understanding of getting old in America; the blessings and insults, the joys and literal pains. So, Leland, a reporter at the New York Times, spent a year with six New Yorkers ages 85 and up, then turned his research into a yearlong series and the book, "Happiness Is A Choice You Make: Lessons from a Year Among the Oldest Old." Last fall, Leland spoke at Temple of Aaron in St. Paul, sponsored by the Under the Radar Foundation. I caught up with him recently to ask why he felt "changed" by this experience and what we might learn, now, to live richer lives.
Q: You were surprised by much of what the elders taught you. What bubbles up to the top?
A: I went into this to follow these people for a year and write about the hardships of old age. We're bombarded with messages about how hard it is to grow old, with pitches for products to "fix" the problem of aging, but none of them defined themselves that way. Only their doctors, kids and journalists did.
Q: Still, you don't sugarcoat growing old. For many, it's hell. They can't walk up stairs. Most of their friends are dead. And yet, they are in many ways happier than the rest of us. I think you used the term "happy in spite of, instead of happy if only."
A: I love that distinction. It's from Karl Pillemer at Cornell University, who was a big influence on the book. If you think, "I could be happy if all my problems are solved," you'll never be happy. You'll just have new reasons to be unsatisfied. But as I spent time with the elders, I found their contentment was less an absence of hardship than a presence of meaning. If they found their life had value, however they defined it, then even suffering could be part of their happiness, because in suffering we learn who we are. So I felt I owed it to them to be as clear-eyed as I could about their hardships.
Q: Yet, there's so much loss. How do they face that over and over?
A: I think that, as we get on in life, we're forced to accept that loss is a part of life, like a brutal patch of weather in Minneapolis. You might not choose it, but it's something you share with everyone around you, not something sinister that you've been singled out for. So we focus more deeply on the people and things that really mean something to us. I was struck that none of the elders I followed spoke of their professional accomplishments, which I imagine had meant a lot to them at the time. None talked about her new kitchen or his connections to someone famous. What a relief to give that up.
Q: You note that the elders are skilled at "selective optimization with compensation," a fancy way to say they don't sweat what they don't have physically, emotionally, financially, etc. Why do we wait until we're 85 to adopt this strategy?
A: We spend way too much of our lives stewing about the things that we can't do, rather than enjoying the things we can. Laura Carstensen of Stanford University says that when we're younger, we put our energy into things that haven't happened yet. So we focus on what isn't, not on what is, and this leads to a lot of dissatisfaction. It can be motivating, but also corrosive.
Q: How long did it take for the elders to grow so comfortable with you that they'd say and do anything?
A: About six months before the first story came out in the New York Times. I was worried after that they'd become self-conscious. But I found people kind of welcoming of somebody asking them about their lives. A lot of people feel like, "Now I'm invisible." Then someone comes along and says that the things you think about are important. Besides, at that point you have so many doctors, your life's an open book.
Q: A strong theme of your book is living with purpose. What does that mean to you?
A: It's an awareness of relationships with other people, in which doing something that's beneficial to you also benefits them, and doing something that benefits them also benefits you. Living with purpose means living in this awareness.
Q: Your mother makes several appearances in your book. Hard to remain objective?
A: Absolutely terrifying. I'm pretty good at being able to separate from the people I write about. This time, I couldn't do that and I wouldn't do it. And it changed my relationship with my mother, greatly improved it. Instead of me trying to help my mother, do things for her, it made it more of a two-way relationship.
Q: To that point, a lot of your subjects shared how hard it was to ask for help, even if they clearly needed it. How do we walk that delicate line with our own parents?
A: If we are always doing for our elders, we're incurring a debt on them they have no way to pay off. Instead, we might think about ways to enable them to help themselves. It's more interdependence and accepting help with gratitude.
Q: You refer to a study that found a "striking correlation" between people's attitudes toward old age and how they fare in later years. Positive views led to lower blood pressure, less stress and so forth. Also the opposite is true. So, how do we wisely use that information?
A: Spend time with older people and listen to them, really listen, because they've lived long enough to know something about life. They're the experts about old age. If they can find joy and gratitude and resilience in this moment right now, then so can we.

Texto completo: Subway stabbing
We now know that the Feb. 3 murder of a young man in New York City Subway was allegedly committed by a MS-13 gang member who is an undocumented alien.
The New York Times reported that the MS-13 gang member had recently been charged by the "Queens district attorney with conspiracy and attempted murder, as well as drug and weapons charges and was free on $2,500 bail awaiting trial."
Had the Queens district attorney turned him into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the 287(g) program requires when arrested the first time, the illegal alien would have been detained and likely deported due to his MS-13 affiliation and the murdered young man would still be alive and with his family today.
So, I ask you, County Executive Steuart Pittman and those who support his ending of Anne Arundel County's participation in the 287 (g) program, when a person is murdered or maimed in Anne Arundel County or elsewhere by an illegal alien who would otherwise been incarcerated and/or deported had the county participated in the 287(g) program, will you personally apologize to the murdered one's family?
Will you and your supporters go to the family's home and explain the benefits of ending participation in the program?
Will you at least admit that the person would be alive if Anne Arundel County participated?
More importantly, will The Capital, report that the crime was committed by same?
Be prepared Mr. Pittman and those of you who supported his political stunt, it is only a matter of time.

Quality of life
Allow me to offer another perspective than the one presented by Columnist Jimmy DeButts regarding investments that the county has made into the quality of life for the citizens of Anne Arundel County (The Maryalnd Gazette, Feb. 13).
Yes, the county has invested significant monies into golf courses in recent years, just as it has into a variety of recreational facilities and activities for the improvement in the quality of life for the citizens of Anne Arundel County. The operations at Compass Pointe and the acquisition and renovation of Eisenhower Golf Course contribute significantly to that quality of life.
The question I must ask is why the recreational activity of golf is measured by a different metric than any other recreational investment. Golf pays for its operational costs. No other recreational activity does. Not swimming, not tennis, not the provision and maintenance of fields for youth and adult athletics, not regional parks such as Kinder Farm Park or Quiet Waters Park, not environmental or conservation preservation.
Only golf charges user fees sufficient to cover operating costs. And yet, despite this ability to cover the operating costs, golf is singled out for criticism for not paying for debt service as well. No other recreational pursuit comes close and yet all contribute significantly to the quality of life here in Anne Arundel County, a great place to live, work and play.
Mr. DeButts, I'd like to suggest that your vision is through too narrow a prism. Broaden your perspective to consider the contribution of the property taxes collected annually on the upscale development surrounding Compass Pointe.
Development that could not have occurred without the county persevering in the development of the golf course and aggregating the adjoining properties in an administrative plat to make it all possible.
Administrative malfeasance or a vision of providing recreational opportunity in return for, and as a benefit of economic development? A 'money pit' or an investment in the quality of life for the citizens of the county?
Continued investment in recreation and leisure opportunities, agricultural conservation and resource protection in the county, either generally through my tax dollars our through user fees for specific activities is an investment I am more than willing to pay. It makes living here worth the investment.

McCabe clarifies role in 25th Amendment talk in '60 Minutes' interview

Texto completo: He did not take part in 'extended discussions' on using it with Trump, spokeswoman says
Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, in a "60 Minutes" interview set to air Sunday night, said that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein broached using the 25th Amendment to oust President Trump in a wide-ranging discussion that suggested he was concerned about Trump's "capacity," according to a transcript released Friday.
McCabe said Rosenstein "raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort," adding that Rosenstein was "definitely very concerned about the president, about his capacity and about his intent at that point in time," according to the transcript.
"Rosenstein was actually openly talking about whether there was a majority of the cabinet who would vote to remove the president?" CBS News journalist Scott Pelley asked, according to the transcript.
"That's correct. Counting votes or possible votes," McCabe responded.
The 25th Amendment spells out a process for the president's Cabinet to force his removal from office if he is unable to perform his duties.
CBS released the transcript after a spokeswoman for McCabe sought to downplay the idea that McCabe knew of a substantive effort to oust Trump using the 25th Amendment, saying in a statement that he never participated in "any extended discussions" about the matter, nor was he aware of such talks.
According to the transcript, McCabe told Pelley he did not remember how Rosenstein brought up the idea.
Melissa Schwartz, McCabe's spokeswoman, said in the statement that McCabe only "was present and participated in a discussion that included a comment by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein regarding the 25th Amendment."
"To clarify, at no time did Mr. McCabe participate in any extended discussions about the use of the 25th Amendment, nor is he aware of any such discussions," Schwartz said.
Schwartz's statement came after CBS on Thursday offered a preview of Pelley's interview with McCabe. The preview did not show any of McCabe's own words, but Pelley said the former acting FBI director told him using the 25th Amendment was discussed.
"I just want to put a finer point on that, because there has been reporting, but I don't believe there has been a source that went on the record to confirm that the 25th Amendment was discussed about removing the president. So McCabe is saying that that was discussed?" CBS's Norah O'Donnell asked Pelley.
"Absolutely," Pelley responded. "McCabe, Norah, as you point out, is the very first person involved in these meetings who has come out and spoken publicly."
"But there was a discussion, underway, about removing the president of the United States?" O'Donnell followed up.
"They were counting noses," Pelley said. "They were not asking Cabinet members whether they would vote for or against removing the president, but they were speculating, 'This person would be with us. That person would not be.' "
The New York Times first reported last year that McCabe alleged in memos that Rosenstein had talked about using the 25th Amendment to oust Trump - or wearing a wire to surreptitiously monitor the president - in the hectic days in May 2017 after Trump fired James B. Comey as FBI director.
The issue nearly led to Rosenstein leaving his job. When CBS previewed its interview Thursday, old tensions reignited. The Justice Department again disputed McCabe's allegations, saying, "As the Deputy Attorney General previously has stated, based on his personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment, nor was the DAG in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment."
The president and his defenders seized on the notion that there was a sinister plot afoot.
" 'Trying to use the 25th Amendment to try and circumvent the Election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing . . . which happens in third world countries. You have to obey the law. This is an attack on our system & Constitution,' " the president wrote on Twitter on Thursday , apparently quoting lawyer Alan Dershowitz from an appearance on Fox News.

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – Like a terrifying demon that returns during the final scene of a horror movie, campaign-finance reform is the “thing” that never goes away. The United States Supreme Court sometimes saves the day, as it did with the First Amendment-related Citizens United case in 2010. Yet reformers always have a new scheme to take “the money out of politics,” even though their last schemes always resulted in more cash influencing political campaigns.
The campaign-finance scaremongers are back with a symbolic bill that is a political poke-in-the-eye to the sleazy-seeming Trump administration. It could never pass the Senate or gain a presidential signature, but it makes a point. Now that they have a majority in the House, Democrats are pushing HR1, which Vox describes as a “sweeping anti-corruption measures aimed at stamping out the influence of money in politics and expanding voting rights.”
The voting-rights goal is doable because Congress has the power to loosen federal standards for voting. But only a delusional person would believe that lawmakers have the power to “stamp out” money in politics any more than they have the power to “stamp out” sexually transmitted diseases. Desire often outstrips good sense, which is why STDs and political spending are at record highs. People will work around any new hurdles placed in their way.
The problem — at least with political spending — is government, not rich people. Both political sides rail about the role of billionaires in our political system. The left fulminates about the Koch Brothers and right-wing “dark money” groups, whereas the right pounds the table about George Soros and left-leaning tech firms. However, a close look at lobbying spending in California offers some much-needed lessons on this hot-button topic.
The Sacramento Bee recently published an analysis of spending on government lobbying and found that it rose again last year. The total was $361 million, up 5 percent since 2017. It is far above the approximately $200 million spent on lobbying in 2002. One can easily conclude from these numbers — and from watching lobbyists swarm the Capitol — that something untoward is going on.
Nevertheless, those numbers need a little more perspective. The total 2017-2018 California state budget was $183.3 billion. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new budget proposal would spend $209.1 billion. In 2002-2003, the total state budget was $97.9 billion. Lobbying spending has gone up, but only in tandem with growth in state government spending. Lobbying dollars are small potatoes when you consider the total, well, potato pie.
Sure, stories are legion about legislators who won’t consider any proposal until they run it by the requisite lobbyist. Union leaders strut around the Capitol as if they own the place, because they pretty much do own the place. Lobbyists and trade groups of all type — unions, industry and activist groups — routinely write the language that becomes state law. Welcome to the real world. No finance reform can ever take the politics out of the political system.
Again, the problem is the size of government. Writing in National Review, Bradley Smith notes that Democratic lawmakers have proposed a Green New Deal “that would essentially abolish the aviation, auto, energy and mining industries, among others. Why is it illegitimate for shareholders and employees in those industries to voice their opinions on regulatory schemes that would leave them bankrupt and unemployed?” Good question.
Take a closer look at that California lobbying report. The top spender was Pacific Gas & Electric, which is a regulated monopoly utility whose continued existence could be dependent on how the Legislature decides to handle wildfire-related liabilities. The Western States Petroleum Association, a trade group that represents the highly regulated oil and gas businesses, is next on the list. Then there’s another regulated utility, Edison International, and the California State Council of Service Employees, which is a powerful labor union.
Reality check: Those groups whose existence is most dependent on the government are going to spend oodles on lobbying that government. Look at the lobbying categories, per the Bee. The biggest spender is government — mainly local governments influencing state government. Next is healthcare, which is a government-dependent industry. Then come utilities, which are government-granted monopolies. Also high on the list are insurance companies, where government has power to set rates, as well as manufacturers, education and labor unions.
Finance reformers are frustrated by the courts, but there’s that thing called the First Amendment. Spending is not speech per se. However, columnist George Will asked if The New York Times would be OK if it were free to write what it wanted, but if the government controlled “the amount it can spend on journalists, paper, ink, printing presses, delivery trucks, advertisements and so on.” You get the point.
Maybe we can all embrace a reform idea that would actually work: reducing the size and power of government. Sadly, that is the one idea that will frighten the kind of politicians and activists who support campaign-finance reform.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump said Friday that he has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe.
Trump claimed the nomination was for his work opening a dialogue with North Korea. Less than a year ago, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a historic meeting. Since then, Trump has claimed North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat, although independent analysts have questioned that assessment.
Trump said Friday that Abe "gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize. . . . He said, 'I have nominated you, respectfully, on behalf of Japan. I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize. '"
Nominations for the 2019 prize were due to be submitted to the Norwegian Nobel Committee before Feb. 1.
The comments came after a question about Trump's planned summit in Vietnam with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
This is not the first time there has been talk of Trump being nominated for the prize.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in has endorsed Trump for the prize, crediting him for starting negotiations with the reclusive North.
And in June, 2018, two Norwegian lawmakers nominated Trump for the peace prize. A group of U. S. lawmakers have also backed Trump’s nomination for the 2019 prize.
Feb. 15: Trump: Obama was on brink of 'a big war' with North Korea. Not true, ex-Obama aides say
However, some of Trump's previous nominations have come under scrutiny. In February 2018, two Nobel Peace Prize nominations for Trump were deemed forgeries by Norwegian Nobel Committee, the New York Times reported.
Trump has complained about President Barack Obama's 2009 Nobel Peace Prize and expressed doubt that he would be similarly honored. On Friday, Trump asserted that Obama was on the brink of starting "a big war" with North Korea, a claim disputed by ex-Obama aides.

Mayor suggests Rochester, again

Texto completo: An optimistic Mayor Lovely Warren sees "opportunity" in Amazon's decision to drop plans for a new headquarters in Long Island City in Queens.
"We are going to try our best to make a second pitch," the mayor said Thursday.
What that might look like has yet to be determined. And Amazon, in a statement, appeared to close the door on further discussions. But local officials were searching for a silver lining on what Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Robert Duffy called "terrible news for New York state."
Amazon dumped the Empire State in a news release, saying it would stick with current expansion plans for Virginia and Nashville, and would not be looking for an alternative to the Queens campus. The company blamed pushback from state and local politicians. Gov. Andrew Cuomo blamed the New York state Senate.
"To have this political squabble and public squabble take place and Amazon move out, I think it's going to have severe reverberations for a long time," Duffy said.
Those reverberations are economic, in jobs, investments, and tax revenues for schools and other services downstate and upstate, he said. But there is also the blow to the state's reputation. New York already is known for taxes and regulation. Now companies considering locating here might pass, he said, figuring it's not worth a fight.
"The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all the major publications are carrying this. It's a major story. What does it say to other companies that may want to locate here?"
For places like Rochester, which can struggle to make the first cut, such a rebuke of the home state on the world stage is damaging, he said. This after the area saw some benefit, despite a failed application, with Moddy's ranking the Rochester-Buffalo region in the Top 5 of potential locations for Amazon's HQ2.
In the immediate aftermath, however, there was little cohesiveness in how to proceed.
Duffy and Warren spoke during separate news conferences. Said the mayor: "We're pitching Rochester," though still open to collaboration. Duffy also spoke of reaching out, with the hope that one day the city might again find an opening — if not for 25,000 jobs then 5,000. Rep. Joseph Morelle, D-Irondequoit, sent Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos a letter touting the Finger Lakes region.
Other communities such as Broome County had sensed the deal was collapsing and reached out days ago.
Duffy said he did not expect Amazon's decision would impact its plan for a distribution station in Henrietta.

GREEN FANTASY WHY ENDORSE THE GREEN NEW DEAL?

Texto completo: There's an old joke about an egotistical politician whose disgruntled speechwriter, just before quitting, prepares a draft that promises the moon, and specifics for how to pay for it, on the first two pages. The third page is left blank, except for the words "you're on your own now."
That's the position in which the "Green New Deal" package of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's, D-N.Y., co-introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., has left several Democratic presidential candidates who had rushed to endorse it. AOC (as she's often called) herself has tried to repudiate some of it as an early draft. Strangely, reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post have indulged this false alibi.
Someone wrote the document, someone whose goal is to "achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and" - incidentally - "create economic prosperity for all" in just 10 years.
One representative plank: "Build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary." Another: "Create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle." A third: "Work with farmers and ranchers to create a sustainable, pollution and greenhouse gas free, system that ensures universal access to healthy food."
Sounds kind of drastic. Especially if you sometimes fly several hours to vacation or visit relatives or if you drive an SUV or a pickup truck. Or if you eat meat from methane-emitting cattle or hogs.
But AOC's folks, in the FAQ which they maintain was sent out by mistake, assure voters that their goal is "net-zero, rather than zero emissions in 10 years, because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."
So, these same people who say they couldn't put out the right press release assure us that they "can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture" in 10 years.
By this point, it should be apparent that the "Green New Deal" is never going to happen. If you had any doubts, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced this week that he was ditching his predecessor Jerry Brown's controversial high-speed rail line which, as Mr. Newsom said, "would cost too much and take too long." The latest estimates were it will take $77 billion until completion in 2033.
But it's worth reflecting on what the "Green New Deal" tells us about American leftists. Far from encouraging 21st-century technology, they want to abandon 20th-century technology (planes, non-electric autos) and go back to the 19th (trains). And far from accommodating individual choices, they want to boss everyone around.
Those family farmers they extol will have to wait to bring their products to town if their electric vehicles are out of juice because the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining and if they're still waiting for the "affordable public transit" to reach their farm. (Maybe they can use bike lanes?)
It's not at all clear that coastal sophisticates will be content to be stuck on slow-moving trains and stuck off on sidings for 20 or so hours out in what they like to call Flyover Country, until someone cleverer than Gavin Newsom can gin up the federal printing press to pay for high-speed rail tracks between Manhattan and Hollywood.
Those on the political left share a withering contempt and thinly veiled hostility toward ordinary middle-income people: the ones raising families and shopping at malls and navigating enormous SUVs (needed for the kids' car seats) into the fast-food carryout lanes.
Leftists love to confine vulgar people to rail lines - high-speed rail or urban subways - and force them into high-rise apartments which they design. They hate single-family-home suburbs and the automobile which lets ordinary people go where they want to go, when they want to, with as many stops as they like.
Voters feel differently. In France, where most people live beyond walking distance of the Paris Metro, the Yellow Vests have led a successful rebellion against a carbon tax, i.e., a tax on driving. In Washington state, voters last fall, even in the county that includes Seattle, soundly rejected a carbon tax last November.
Now, Mr. Markey says it's unfair for Republicans to bring his own "Green New Deal" to the Senate floor. That's probably because even if the label polls well, he suspects that the substance won't.
So, why have presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren endorsed this foolishness? Good question.

AMAZON WON'T REOPEN HQ2 SEARCH, BUT PITTSBURGH STILL STANDS TO BENEFIT

Texto completo: Battered by local opposition, Amazon dumped plans Thursday to build its second headquarters in New York City. While the Seattle company does not plan to reopen its HQ2 search, Pittsburgh may still benefit.
In a statement, the e-commerce giant described the decision to ditch the project - which would have brought an estimated 25,000 jobs to the Long Island City neighborhood - as disappointing.
"For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term," the company stated.
"While polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City."
At the same time, Amazon stated that it does not intend to reopen the HQ2 search "at this time." Pittsburgh was one of the 20 finalists for the coveted economic development prize, with its initial promise of 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment.
The online retailer ended up splitting the headquarters - with northern Virginia and Long Island City each getting half of the jobs.
Amazon, in its statement Thursday, reported that it will proceed with the northern Virginia headquarters and a smaller operations center in Nashville that involves 5,000 jobs and $230 million in investment.
The company also stated that it "will continue to hire and grow across our corporate offices and tech hubs in the U.S. and Canada."
That could be good news for Pittsburgh, since Amazon has a tech hub at SouthSide Works on the South Side that employs more than 80 engineers who work on the company's Alexa voice technology and machine learning.
Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said he expects Amazon to continue to expand that facility and grow in the region.
"They're going to grow here. We're excited about that. It's not like we're going to see 25,000 jobs. I don't think it's going to go to one city. I think it's going to go to a lot of cities," he said.
Mr. Fitzgerald said the region's strong tech ecosystem, its quality of life, affordability, tech talent, and the presence of Carnegie Mellon University and other major colleges make expansion a strong possibility.
"I think obviously we will be in the mix," he said.
Stefani Pashman, CEO of Allegheny Conference on Community Development, was also happy to hear that Pittsburgh might see its Amazon presence increase.
"We value the fact that Amazon is already a part of the Pittsburgh region's business landscape, and we look forward to the company continuing to grow organically here," she said in an emailed statement.
Should Amazon reopen the HQ2 search, Mr. Fitzgerald would not be hesitant to join the chase.
"If there's an opportunity that benefits the region, yes, I would go after it," he said.
In its losing bid for Amazon, the region offered $9.7 billion in incentives, including $4.6 billion in state subsidies. The bid also involved $4.2 billion in local subsidies generated mainly through taxes on Amazon employees; as much as $716 million in tax increment and similar transit-oriented financing; and up to $222 million in parking tax diversions.
Mr. Fitzgerald and other officials have said the money would not have gone directly to Amazon but to address needs to support the influx of employees. That would have included affordable housing; transportation, including a possible light rail extension; workforce development; and infrastructure.
Local leaders also offered to build a business-class, high-speed transit connection linking HQ2, Downtown and Pittsburgh International Airport using the West Busway and "shoulder-running transit options" as well as possible dedicated space at the airport.

THE FUTURE OF FILM IS FEMALE, PART 2 at the Museum of Modern Art (through Feb. 21). This sequel survey of female filmmakers -- a follow-up to one in the summer -- brings together recent work by women working behind the camera, including Nia DaCosta's "Little Woods" (screening on Friday), shown at last year's Tribeca Film Festival and starring Tessa Thompson and Lily James as desperate sisters in a North Dakota fracking town, and Josephine Decker's "Madeline's Madeline" (on Sunday and Tuesday), an experimental and aggressively subjective portrait of adolescence. If the film "is sometimes unconvincing and frequently unnerving," A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, "it is never uninteresting."

'I AM CUBA' at Film Forum (Feb. 15-21). First shown in 1964, this Soviet-Cuban agitprop spectacle, directed by Mikhail Kalatozov ("The Cranes Are Flying"), celebrates the ostensible glories of Castro's revolution. Employing a collective protagonist, the film mirrors its ideas about the masses in its structure: It moves from one character to another to illustrate life in Cuba under Fulgencio Batista, capturing the political awakenings of men who become full-throated soldiers for the rebel forces. As with many Soviet films of the 1920s, a central influence for Kalatozov, "I Am Cuba" requires viewers to swallow a deluge of ham-handed and frequently troubling propaganda as the price for its formal brilliance. But the director's impossible camera moves look especially impressive in this restoration.

JONAS MEKAS'S 'WALDEN: DIARIES, NOTES AND SKETCHES' at Light Industry (Feb. 16, 7 p.m.). The microcinema Light Industry honors the writer, filmmaker and experimental-cinema godfather Jonas Mekas, who died last month at 96, with this 16-millimeter screening of an extraordinary diary film. Compiling footage that Mekas shot with a Bolex camera from 1965 to 1969, "Walden" is at once a time capsule, a poetic treatise on the changing seasons in New York and a candid chronicle of major figures in that decade's avant-garde scene. Mekas seems as delighted with the wedding of P. Adams Sitney and a visit to the filmmaker Stan Brakhage's family as he is with the fantastic color swirl of a circus show or a performance by the Velvet Underground. Doors open for this free screening at 6:30 p.m. Be warned that getting a seat at Light Industry can be a cutthroat affair, and B.Y.O. lumbar support.

PROGRAMMERS' NOTEBOOK: ON LOVE at BAM Rose Cinemas (Feb. 14-21) and VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE 2019 at Anthology Film Archives (Feb. 14-21). Two straggler series in the Valentine's Day repertory cinema sweepstakes both construe love more broadly than simple romance. At BAM, Yasujiro Ozu and John Cassavetes explore the difficulties of parental and sibling relationships, while Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1974 "Ali: Fear Eats the Soul" (showing on Tuesday) reworks Douglas Sirk's "All That Heaven Allows," imagining a forbidden bond between a Moroccan man (El Hedi ben Salem) and a much older West German widow (Brigitte Mira). Anthology adds two Paul Thomas Anderson movies, "Punch-Drunk Love" (on Saturday, Sunday and Thursday) and "Phantom Thread" (on Saturday and Sunday, and separately at BAM on Thursday), to its annual "massacre" docket, which once again features films by Albert Brooks, Elaine May, Maurice Pialat and Andrzej Zulawski.

'WAR AND PEACE' at the Film Society of Lincoln Center (Feb. 15-21). The space and arms races between the United States and the Soviet Union get most of the attention, but the Russian filmmaker Sergei Bondarchuk's 1968 Tolstoy adaptation represents a landmark in the Cold War film race. To say the movie pulls out all the stops is severely understating the matter. Designed to beat the cinematic epics of the 1960s at their own game, the film contains enough battlefield extras to populate a Baltic city, a duel to rival "Barry Lyndon" (before "Barry Lyndon"), snowfall that upstages "Doctor Zhivago," a ballroom sequence that makes "The Leopard" look cheap -- and that's just in the first three hours. Given that the film runs longer than seven, the stun factor is relentless. The Film Society will screen the movie in four parts; a ticket package is available.

Andrew McCabe says he ordered obstruction of justice investigation into Trump

Texto completo: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said he ordered an obstruction of justice investigation into President Trump after he fired FBI Director James Comey in the spring of 2017.

"I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground, in an indelible fashion," McCabe said in his first interview since getting fired from the bureau last year. "That were I removed quickly, or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace."

"I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground and if somebody came in behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they made that decision," McCabe told CBS News' "60 Minutes.".

Up until now it has only been reported that an obstruction of justice probe was opened as part of the Russia investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. The Washington Post first reported in June 2017 that special counsel Robert Mueller had begun looking into it and CNN later reported McCabe had initiated it and that it also included a look at Trump's conversation with Comey, described in memos he wrote, in which the president asked his then-FBI director to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The White House has called the inquiry a "completely baseless investigation." Last year, the New York Times reported that Trump's legal team argued in a memo making the case that the president could not be compelled to testify for the probe that a sitting president cannot legally obstruct an investigation because the Constitution empowers him to "terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired."

The first clip of the interview with McCabe, set to air in full on Sunday, was shown Thursday on "CBS This Morning." The correspondent who interview McCabe, Scott Pelley, said Rosenstein also told him Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein really did tell officials that he wanted to secretly record Trump and that this talk was taken serious.

"McCabe in [the 60 Minutes] interview says no, it came up more than once and it was so serious that he took it to the lawyers at the FBI to discuss it," Pelley said.

Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to take over the Russia investigation after Comey was fired, has long been the subject of criticism of Trump-allied Republican lawmakers who have accused the Justice Department of being biased at the top levels due to document request disputes and reports in September that said he discussed wearing a “wire” to record conversations with Trump and that he was recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office.

Rosenstein denied the reporting, while sources told NBC News that he was only joking about secretly recording the president.

McCabe, a 21-year veteran of the FBI who briefly served as acting FBI director after Comey was fired, has a book due out next week titled "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump."

In his memoir, he writes Rosenstein spiraled into rage and paranoia after Trump ordered him to write the memo he cited as justification to fire Comey. In a private meeting at the Justice Department days after Comey was pushed out on May 12, McCabe writes Rosenstein was "glassy-eyed" and said he was sleep deprived after he came to the conclusion that the White House had used him. “He said it wasn’t his idea. The president had ordered him to write the memo justifying the firing,” McCabe writes. Rosenstein also said, “There’s no one here that I can trust."

McCabe was fired on March 16, 2018, two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined that he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

He “lacked candor” on four occasions when interviewing with internal investigators, the IG report said.

In April, it was revealed that the Justice Department IG had referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Federal prosecutors used a grand jury to investigate McCabe.

Trump quotes Alan Dershowitz saying consideration of 25th Amendment ‘despicable’

Texto completo: President Trump quoted Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz Thursday night to defend himself amid renewed talk that Justice Department officials weighed asking Cabinet members to consider invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office.

“Any Justice Department official who even mentioned the 25th Amendment in the context of President Trump has committed a grievous offense against the Constitution,” Dershowitz told Fox New’s Tucker Carlson on Thursday.

“The framers of the 25th Amendment had in mind something very specific and trying to use the 25th Amendment to circumvent the impeachment provisions or to circumvent an election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing,” Dershowitz continued.

Trump tweeted a version of those comments Thursday night.


The New York Times reported in September that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had discussed using the amendment and wearing a wire to record his conversations with the president. Rosenstein denied the report.

Whether Justice Department officials had such conversations was pushed back into the headlines Thursday when “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley said former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told him there were meetings “in which it was discussed whether the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet could be brought together to remove the president of the United States under the 25th Amendment."

Pelley said the matter was discussed in the days after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey.

Rosenstein again rejected that the 25th Amendment had been discussed in a statement released by the Justice Department on Thursday.

“As the Deputy Attorney General previously has stated, based on his personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment, nor was the DAG in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment,” the statement said.

Republicans press for hearing with Andrew McCabe, Rod Rosenstein

Texto completo: The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday urged his Democratic colleagues to haul former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein before Congress.

Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., called on Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., to convene a hearing to take the testimony of the law enforcement officials or subpoena them for interviews after McCabe admitted he considered secretly taping President Trump.

"The American people have a right to know whether the unelected FBI and DOJ leadership substituted their judgment for the judgment of the American people regarding newly elected President Donald Trump," Collins wrote. "The Members of our Committee have a responsibility to conduct oversight of the FBI and DOJ, particularly when former high-level officials make such explosive allegations."

Nadler's representative did not respond to the Washington Examiner 's request for comment.

House GOP lawmakers on Thursday clamored for McCabe and Rosenstein to face congressional investigators after McCabe told CBS that Rosenstein suggested he wanted to secretly record Trump. He also said he was recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office.

McCabe, who was pushed out of the FBI in March 2018 after an internal watchdog probe into an “unauthorized leak" to the media, is currently promoting his new book.

"Rosenstein should be compelled to testify immediately," House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted.

A representative for House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told the Washington Examiner the congressman "strongly believes" Rosenstein should clarify before Congress what he said and did about wearing a wire and trying to oust Trump from the White House.

A staffer for Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., supplemented a tweet from the House Freedom Caucus Chairman and Trump ally, the aide saying "all options" at the minority's disposal were on the table as they seek answers to their questions. Meadows said earlier that Rosenstein had "no business working at the Department of Justice."

Rosenstein was slated to speak with House Republicans last October, but negotiations fell through. Discussions then petered out after the GOP lost control of the lower chamber.

The comments from Rosenstein, DOJ's No. 2, were first reported in 2018 by the New York Times. Sources told the Washington Post and NBC News that his remarks were made in jest.

Michael Jackson estate cancels test-run of musical in musical amid HBO documentary

Resumen: A Michael Jackson musical will premiere on stage in NY instead of Chicago. Jackson estate says change unrelated to HBO film "Leaving Neverland."

Texto completo: The Michael Jackson estate canceled a planned Chicago tryout of a new jukebox musical about the late King of Pop, citing a labor dispute and not an HBO film airing next month that revives old allegations that he was a pedophile.
In a statement Thursday, the estate said it plans to bring the musical, "Don't Stop 'Til You've Had Enough," straight to Broadway in the summer of 2020.
"Its previously announced pre-Broadway engagement in Chicago has been cancelled due to scheduling difficulties brought about by the recent Actors Equity strike," said the statement from the estate and its producing partner, Columbia Live Stage.
Although the job action was resolved last week, it delayed a planned developmental lab for the show, and the producers wanted more time before staging the full show, according to The New York Times.
The musical will feature a book by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage and a score made up of Jackson songs, the estate statement said. Tony Award winner Christopher Wheeldon will direct and choreograph the musical. The producers announced a developmental work session will take place in New York this fall.
The Jackson estate has been embroiled in a bitter war of words with HBO and the British producers of "Leaving Neverland," the four-hour film that HBO plans to air March 3 and 4.
The film asserts that Jackson sexually abused little boys for years at his Santa Barbara County ranch-turned-amusement park, based on the testimony of two boys, now adults, Wade Robson, 36, and James Safechuck, 40.
The two are former fervent fans of Jackson who turned against him after he died in 2009. One even testified in Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial in Santa Barbara County on child sex-abuse charges, telling a jury that Jackson never sexually abused him. The trial ended with Jackson's acquittal.
So far, "Leaving Neverland" has been seen only by media and film critics at the Sundance Film Festival, where it premiered this month. Critics mostly swooned over it, calling it gut-wrenching, powerful and persuasive.
But Jackson's extensive and intense fan base is enraged, lashing out on social media against the film. The Jackson family and its lawyers have been fighting back with denunciations of the film as a mendacious "smear" of Jackson, who can no longer defend himself.
HBO has said it will air the film nevertheless. "People should reserve judgment until they see the film,” the cable network said in a statement last week.

Texto completo: One school in Florida has taken the safety of its students and staff to the extreme in the wake of last year's Valentine's Day mass school shooting. State legislation passed as a result of this senseless act that took the lives of 14 students and three educators requires every Florida public school to have at least one "safe-school officer."

The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act gave schools the option of selecting a school resource officer employed by a law-enforcement agency; a school safety officer employed by either a law enforcement agency or district school board; or a school guardian, a school employee trained to stop lethal attacks. An Associated Press survey found that nine of the state's 67 countywide school districts opted for full-time guardians, presumably armed with the standard handgun carried by municipal police officers.

However, by the end of this month, students at Manatee School for the Arts in Palmetto, Fla., will see two former combat veterans in body armor, each carrying a 9mm Glock handgun and a semiautomatic rifle. Bill Jones, principal of this charter school for 2,100 middle and high school students, told The New York Times: If an armed intruder were to enter the campus, "we're not looking for a fair fight. We're looking at an overwhelming advantage."

And in an oblique reference to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School resource officer's failure to engage that shooter, Jones said the school hired combat veterans because he wanted guards who wouldn't hesitate to go after an active shooter. "I don't want this to be the first time they've had someone shooting at them."

Though spared anything remotely resembling that Florida high school tragedy, Massachusetts also has made school safety a top priority. A far more modest plan, authored by Jim Arciero, a Westford Democrat, would enhance school security statewide. Retirees may only work 960 hours per year, or 120 eight-hour days. Arciero's bill would help districts hire retired state and local police as school-resource officers, increasing their total hours to 180 days.

These retirees' pensions already would offset a significant portion of the expense; their supplementary salaries could be split between the school and municipal budgets.

This bill makes perfect sense. Active-duty officers would not be needed. Plus, aside from orientation on school policies and procedures, retirees won't need on-the-job training. It would especially help districts in rural communities, which might not have the money or police personnel to staff every school.

Unfortunately, Arciero's bill remains stuck in the Joint Committee on Education. Given that panel's Senate makeup, we're not sure it will ever the light of legislative debate.

We urge local lawmakers to give this legislation another look, and then press this committee to let the full Legislature make a decision on its merits.

Texto completo: As I reflect on the area where I grew up, I'm convinced that it was a lesson in resilience. This long and arduous lesson were sometimes brutal and unforgiving, only the strong ultimately survive. Our community had its share of violence, abuses, and drama much of which could be attributed to the environment. According to Bettmann Archive/Getty Images, "The history of African-Americans begins with slavery, as white European settlers first brought Africans to the continent to serve as slaves. The fate of slaves in the United States would divide the nation during the Civil War. And after the war, the racist legacy of slavery would persist, spurring movements of resistance, including the Underground Railroad, the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Selma to Montgomery March."
It was this kind of abuse, mistreatment, and hatred that has superimposed a lasting scar on the African family and community. Some say that African Americans should "get over it" and live productive lives because slavery ended in 1862 over 150 years ago.
But getting over it is much easier said than done.
Judith Shulevitz, an American journalist and New York Times contributor wrote, "Traditionally, psychiatrists have cited family dynamics to explain the vicarious traumatization of the second generation. Children may absorb parents' psychic burdens as much by osmosis as from stories."
Shulevitz appear to argue that some forms of social trauma may be transferred trans-generationally.
"Over the past six decades psychologist and psychiatrist have attempted to explicate the impact of systematic social, political, and economic marginalization on African Americans. Recently a number of mental health professional have proclaimed that as a result of slavery and its sequelae, African Americans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)," said an article titled "A Critical Approach to Stress-related Disorders in African Americans" by J. S. Mattis, C. C. Bell, R. J. Jagers, and E. Jenkins in the Journal of The National Medical Association.
It is highly likely that some African Americans still suffer from the disorder in silence.
Understanding all the facts this community must do all it can to produce a turn-around and submit to healing.
Gospel and popular music artist Kelly Price said, "I need healing for my soul." I recommend healing for the country and the African American community.

Texto completo: Here's the perfect example of so much theater, so little time. Among the choices this weekend in Pittsburgh are three opening nights, including regional premieres by barebones productions in Braddock and Kinetic Theatre on the North Side.
Wednesday's Magazine section featured Aaliyah Sanders, the 10th-grader making her debut in Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre's premiere of "Savior Samuel," opening Thursday. Here's more of what's new in Pittsburgh theater this weekend:
'The Legend of Georgia McBride'
By Matthew Lopez, directed by Patrick Jordan
A comedy with music for barebones productions? That's a first, and here's why. Patrick Jordan was attracted to the play because it is such a change of pace from the grittiness that is barebones' bread and butter. His intimate Braddock space will rock with some original music and the lip-sync extravaganzas of a real-time drag show.
"I felt it's a play with a lot of heart, and the headlines lately have been so dark and gloomy," Mr. Jordan said. "This one is funny and has a strong simple message about acceptance."
The story revolves around Casey, an Elvis impersonator who loses his job as his wife announces that a baby is on the way. To make ends meet, he joins a drag queen show.
Mr. Jordan had one person in mind to play Casey and left a 1:30 a.m. message for musical theater actor Andrew Swackhamer. The Pittsburgh native grew up in Erie and went to Point Park University before finally settling down in New York City, where he has been concentrating on his first love - the ukulele, with his band, Starbird and the Phoenix (including fellow Point Park grad Courtney Bassett), and helping to open the Uke Hut, a store dedicated to the ukulele in Astoria, Queens.
Mr. Swackhamer got the message at his other job, in a coffee shop, and quickly got to work. He had about two weeks to prep before coming back to a local stage for the first time since 2015, when he was in the ensemble of "My Fair Lady" for Pittsburgh Public Theater.
"I realized this was a definitive tour de force of a character, and I love doing theater work that has multiple personalities, and this guy has to go through a lot of changes," he said during a break in rehearsal, which gave him a brief respite from the aches and pains of doing "cartwheels in heels."
In his Pittsburgh days, he did a one-man "Toy Story" show for No Name Players at Arcade Comedy Theater - 52 voices.
"It was 70 minutes with five props and my body and a ukulele . just blood, sweat and tears, and no doubt this is going to be the same thing," he said.
"He's ridiculously talented," Mr. Jordan said. Besides singing, dancing and morphing - Mr. Swackhamer figures he will have a dozen costume changes, with his first drag makeup applied on stage - "he has to be a great guitar player, and he is," the director said.
The company includes David Conrad as a bartender whose club is failing. He is forced to take on the drag show, although he takes some time to warm up to the idea.
The company has had to come together over a tragedy that struck cast member Shua Porter, an actor, singer and the drag queen Shwa de Vivre. He lost his partner of six years, Landen Manning Jones, the good Samaritan who was killed in a car crash on Jan. 26 while helping people in a disabled car.
"It makes theater a different thing this time around," Mr. Swackhamer said. "Your job goes beyond your responsibility to the show. It's a wonderful but tragic reminder of the importance of what theater can do for a person. It's incredibly sad that the reminder had to come that way but a treasure to have this be the show."
Mr. Jordan noted that he is a big fan of writer Lopez's work, which may be coming to Broadway soon: He is writing the book to a musical version of "Some Like It Hot," with songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Whitman, to be directed by Casey Nicholaw.
Also featuring Justin Lonesome and Sara Williams. Through March 9 at barebones black box, 1211 Braddock Ave., Braddock. Tickets ($35) and times: www.showclix.com or 1-888-718-4253.
'An Octoroon'
By Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (adapted from Dion Boucicault's "The Octoroon"), directed by Andrew Paul.
Octoroon was a term used in America's slave society to enforce restrictions on anyone with African roots. It is defined as "a person having one-eighth black ancestry, with one black great-grandparent." The play "An Octoroon" is based on an 1858 drama with "The" instead of "An," but is very much of today in its provocative, darkly comedic exploration of racial identity, American slavery and what is possible in the name of art. In his rave New York Times review, Ben Brantley called it "a coruscating comedy . a play that perpetually examines itself, from every possible angle, and yet manages to transform self-consciousness from something that paralyzes into something that propels."
Mr. Paul chose the play because "I am fond of plays that talk back with history, and I consider revisionist and modernist adaptations of classic plays and literature to be my specialty," the director said. "This play is so bold, so theatrical, and so incredibly provocative - it takes the genre to new levels."
With a subject as potentially incendiary as race in America, circa 1959 and now, "it feels so current," Mr. Paul said, mentioning stories in the news about the Virginia governor and actor Liam Neeson. With "An Octoroon," the playwright "confronts our preconceptions about race and identity. The play is at times both laugh-out-loud funny and purposefully offensive but ultimately forces its audience to come face to face with its own prejudices."
A large multiethnic cast is led by Ananias J. Dixon ("Sweat" at the Public), Martin Giles and Point Park grad Melessie Clark, with newcomer Sarah Hollis in the title role.
Friday through Feb. 24 at the New Hazlett Theater, 6 Allegheny Square E., North Side. Tickets ($36, $20 for ages 25 and under) and times: www.showclix.com or 1-888-718-4253.
SHAKESPEARE MONOLOGUE & SCENE CONTEST
While "The Tempest" reigns onstage for Pittsburgh Public Theater, the 25th annual Shakespeare Monologue & Scene Contest for thespians in grades four-12 holds forth on the O'Reilly Theater's "Tempest" set Friday and Monday. To mark the anniversary, the Public's education department has put together an online event, "25 Days of Shakespeare Celebration," which includes trivia, games and prizes at facebook.com/PPTShakespeare.

Texto completo: Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said he has "no knowledge" of a woman's allegation that she was sexually assaulted by a former Blue Devils player and he believes the school should and will investigate.
Lawyer Nancy Erika Smith has said her client, Meredith Watson, was raped by a player while she was a student at Duke. The New York Times and other publications identified the player as Corey Maggette, who has denied the allegation. The reports cited a friend of Watson, R. Stanton Jones, who said she told him about the alleged assault at the time.
Watson also said Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her while they were students at Duke in 2000. Smith said Watson told a high-ranking administrator about the assault by a player but was dissuaded from filing a complaint or notifying police.
Maggette played at Duke in the 1998-99 season and then left for the NBA.
Krzyzewski was asked about the allegation after Duke's 71-69 victory over Louisville on Tuesday night in Louisville, Ky. He said he wasn't aware of the details.
"At that level for that serious an accusation, it's always university level. Our university, they'll handle everything and that's what should happen," Krzyzewski said.
Vols win 19th straight: Admiral Schofield had 21 points and 10 rebounds as No. 1 Tennessee defeated visiting South Carolina 85-73 on Wednesday for its school-record 19th consecutive victory.
Tennessee owns the longest active winning streak of any active Division I team and is 11-0 in Southeastern Conference competition for the first time in school history.
The Volunteers (23-1, 11-0 SEC) also earned their 23rd straight home win. Tennessee's last home loss was a 94-84 setback against Auburn on Jan. 2, 2018.
South Carolina (12-12, 7-4) made a season-high 14 3-pointers and shot 60.9 percent from beyond the arc but couldn't slow Tennessee's high-powered offense. Tennessee was 9 of 20 on 3-point attempts.

Texto completo: Perfectionism is creativity's biggest foe. Your own impulse is perfect in one way: It's perfectly you. If you don't sound like Michael Chabon or Elmore Leonard, thank goodness. You are not them, other than in that you've also shown the courage to leap headlong into creating works that would never delight anyone if they were stopped for want of perfection. Matt Richtel
PUT DOWN THE ERASER. If you're an aspiring creator, this scenario might sound familiar: You come up with an idea, give yourself permission to write, start feeling audacious that this is going to change the way the entire world looks at literature, put pen to paper, write two pages -- and begin rewriting. The next thing you know, you're in your late 80s with nothing but wrinkles and eraser marks to show for it.
To underscore this, I'll relate my own conversion tale about perfectionism. Fifteen years ago, I never thought I'd write a book -- it sounded absurd, all those words, all tied together in one place -- but in 2004, I started writing a story I couldn't let go of. I didn't show anybody and I didn't pause. Somewhere around 80,000 words, about three-quarters finished, I showed the beginning to a colleague at The New York Times who doubled as an author. She professed to love it and showed it to her agent, who, in turn, professed to love it. Great news, right? Nope. I couldn't write another word.
For two weeks, an experience that had been pure joy turned pressure-filled. Fortunately, it was a temporary state. A few weeks later, the external world of expectation and perfection disappeared and I happily finished a book that would become my first thriller, "Hooked."
AFTER YOU'VE CREATED, SEEK FEEDBACK. Do not fear feedback. It's rarely personal. It means someone is taking your muse seriously, and you are inspiring them to react. But this is all said with a big caveat: Seek feedback from someone who speaks your language. They will be most able to see you and your creation for what it can be.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, had breached his plea agreement by lying multiple times to prosecutors after pledging to cooperate with the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
The decision by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court in Washington may affect the severity of punishment that awaits Mr. Manafort. Judge Jackson is scheduled to sentence him next month on two conspiracy counts, and he is also awaiting sentencing for eight other counts in a related fraud case.
After Mr. Manafort agreed in September to cooperate with the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, the judge found, he lied about his contacts with a Russian associate during the campaign and after the election. Prosecutors claim that the associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, has ties to Russian intelligence, and have been investigating whether he was involved in Russia's covert campaign to influence the election results.
The judge also found that Mr. Manafort had lied about a payment that was routed through a pro-Trump political action committee to cover his legal bills, and about information relevant to another undisclosed investigation underway at the Justice Department.
Mr. Manafort joins a string of former Trump aides who have been found to have lied to federal investigators about their involvement with Russians or their intermediaries, including Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump's first national security adviser; George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser; and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's longtime fixer and lawyer.
Judge Jackson decided that prosecutors failed to prove that Mr. Manafort, 69, had deceived them about two other matters: Mr. Kilimnik's role in a conspiracy with Mr. Manafort to obstruct justice, and whether Mr. Manafort had been in contact with Trump administration officials.
Although the defense won on those points, the judge's split decision bodes poorly for Mr. Manafort. The ruling decreases any chance that Judge Jackson will show Mr. Manafort leniency, although legal experts have said that sentencing guidelines already made that highly unlikely. It could also affect the severity of his punishment in a case tried in Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., over the summer. He was convicted by a jury there in August for tax evasion, bank fraud and other crimes.
Prosecutors had declared in November that Mr. Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying, relieving them of any obligation to suggest a lighter sentence because of his plea and cooperation. The judge found that the prosecutors had reached their conclusion in good faith, rejecting arguments by the defense that Mr. Manafort had misspoken merely because he was confused or could not remember clearly.
Judge Jackson's reasoning could become clearer in the next few days when a transcript of Wednesday's closed hearing on the matter becomes public. But like transcripts of earlier hearings, it is likely to be heavily redacted to protect the secrecy of the special counsel's inquiry.
The prosecutors convinced Judge Jackson that Mr. Manafort had deceived them about his talks with Mr. Kilimnik, including their conversations about a possible deal that might have served the Kremlin's ends. The two men repeatedly discussed a proposal to resolve a conflict over Russia's incursions into Ukraine, possibly giving Moscow relief from punishing American-led sanctions that had been imposed after Russia seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.
Andrew Weissmann, one of Mr. Mueller's top deputies, told the judge this month that the interactions between the two men go "to the larger view of what we think is going on and what we think is the motive here." He suggested that Mr. Manafort had misled the prosecutors into believing that he had rejected the Ukraine plan with Mr. Kilimnik out of hand during a meeting on Aug. 2, 2016, while Mr. Manafort was still running Mr. Trump's campaign. Only after he was confronted with evidence did Mr. Manafort acknowledge that he and Mr. Kilimnik continued to discuss the proposal on at least three other occasions after Mr. Trump was elected, he said.
The prosecutors also told the judge that Mr. Manafort deceived them about transferring Trump campaign polling data to Mr. Kilimnik during the campaign. The New York Times has reported that the data included both private and public data, and that Mr. Manafort wanted the information delivered to two Ukrainian oligarchs who had financed Ukrainian political parties that were aligned with Russia.
Mr. Manafort's lawyers had suggested that Mr. Manafort had only wanted to share public data in the interest of promoting himself and maybe winning lucrative work overseas. The oligarchs and their allies had paid Mr. Manafort tens of millions of dollars in Ukraine to help Viktor F. Yanukovych win the presidency there. Mr. Yanukovych was forced out of power in a popular uprising in 2014 and fled to Russia.
But the prosecutors seem to have pitted Mr. Manafort's assertions against those of Rick Gates, Mr. Trump's former deputy campaign chairman. Mr. Gates pleaded guilty to two felonies and has been cooperating with Mr. Mueller's team for the past year.
During the earlier hearing, Mr. Weissmann appeared to suggest that Mr. Manafort's lies about the polling data were too important to dismiss as innocent memory lapses. Whether any Americans, wittingly or unwittingly, engaged with Russians who were trying to interfere in the presidential election went to "the core" of the special counsel's inquiry, Mr. Weissmann said.
He suggested that Mr. Manafort might have been trying to cover up the data transfer because it might hurt his chances of winning a presidential pardon for his crimes.
If it became known that Mr. Manafort had given Mr. Kilimnik the campaign's polling data, Mr. Weissmann said, it could have "negative consequences in terms of the other motive that Mr. Manafort could have, which is to at least augment his chances for a pardon."

Texto completo: Los Angeles financier Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a billionaire with long ties to the Mideast and a close ally of President Trump, apologized Wednesday for saying it was a mistake to criticize the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist killed at a Saudi Arabian consulate last year.
Barrack, founder and chief executive of Colony Capital Inc., first said at a Milken Institute summit in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday that "whatever happened in Saudi Arabia, the atrocities in America are equal or worse to the atrocities in Saudi Arabia."
"The atrocities in any autocratic country are dictated by the rule of law," Barrack said. "So for us to dictate what we think is the moral code there, when we have a young man and a regime that's trying to push themselves into 2030, I think is a mistake," he said in an apparent reference to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's 33-year-old de facto ruler.

After Barrack's comments were reported, first by Gulf News, Barrack -- whose firm has joined with Qatar and other Persian Gulf investors in the past, and reportedly Saudi investors as well -- quickly backtracked by issuing a statement that the killing "was atrocious and is inexcusable."
"I apologize for not making it clear at the time that I consider the killing reprehensible," Barrack said.
Barrack's comments drew criticism from celebrities, political commentators and elected officials, including Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance), who asked on Twitter why Trump chooses to "surround himself with people like Tom Barrack who put down the U.S.?" Conservative commentator Bill Kristol tweeted that the remarks show "Trumpism 'blows out the moral lights around us' and insists 'there is no right principle of action but self-interest.'"
Khashoggi, an insider-turned-critic of the Saudi ruling regime, was killed and dismembered by people close to the crown prince at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul after he entered to pick up documents, Turkish authorities allege.
Saudi Arabia has said the crown prince was not aware of any plan to kill Khashoggi, although the U.S. intelligence community concluded that he probably ordered the killing.
The killing sparked a crisis in U.S.-Saudi relations after Trump built his Middle East strategy around an alliance with the kingdom. Saudi Arabia was the first nation Trump visited after taking office in 2017 and he frequently touted U.S. weapons sales to the Saudis that were brokered during his trip.
The death of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who wrote for the Washington Post, sparked outrage internationally and in Congress, where even top Republican leaders such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina broke with the president and pushed to sanction the kingdom.
The 71-year-old Barrack -- who has a net worth of $1 billion, according to Forbes -- has been friends with Trump for the last three decades and he planned the president's inauguration in early 2017.
Barrack's Los Angeles-based Colony Capital is a publicly held investment firm with $44 billion of assets under management that often bets on distressed assets.
In 2008, for instance, Colony bailed out Michael Jackson when the late singer's Neverland Ranch was on the brink of foreclosure.
The grandson of Lebanese Christian immigrants, Barrack also has busines ties to the Mideast -- and a deep knowledge of its politics and cultures -- dating to the early 1970s, when as an attorney he worked on a project in Saudi Arabia and then spent the next four years there as an advisor to the royal family.
At Colony Capital, Barrack also has tapped various Mideast investors to help fund the firm's operations.
With partners from Qatar, Barrack was part of an investment group that bought Miramax Films in 2010, later selling the studio to investors in Qatar. However, his dealings with the gulf state have been complicated by a blockade of Qatar started in 2017 by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
More recently, Barrack has done deals with sovereign wealth funds in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, according to published reports. Colony typically does not disclose investors in its funds and declined to comment Wednesday.
Between Trump's nomination and mid-2018, Colony raised more than $7 billion in investments and 24% of that money came from the Persian Gulf, all from either Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, the New York Times reported last year.
However, Colony has had financial problems of late in the aftermath of its merger with the NorthStar asset management and real estate finance firms in early 2017.
Colony's earnings have dropped, and its stock has plummeted from about $14.50 a share two years ago to a close of $6.07 on Wednesday.
Barrack resumed his role as Colony's chief executive last November to help Colony bolster its performance; he's also the firm's executive chairman.
On Monday, Colony also announced that it was forming a committee to evaluate the company's assets and make recommendations for any changes to the firm's operations.
Barrack spoke Tuesday at the Mena Summit in Abu Dhabi, which was organized by the Milken Institute, a Santa Monica think tank founded by financier Michael Milken.

S.E. Cupp: Omar should be held accountable for spreading anti-Semitic claims

Texto completo: The past few weeks have been painful and eye-opening for many Americans.
The image of a white politician (apparently) donning blackface in an old yearbook, a deeply offensive and racist mockery of African-Americans, opened fresh wounds for many — and during Black History Month. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has apologized, as has the state's attorney general for a similar episode, but neither has resigned.
Likewise, a Minnesota congresswoman has had to apologize twice in three weeks for troubling anti-Semitic tweets.
Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, this week tweeted a vile comment, suggesting Israel's supporters in Congress are beholden to AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. "It's all about the Benjamins, baby," she asserted. The tweet drew immediate gasps and ire from all political corners, deservedly, including her own party leadership.
The Anti-Defamation League responded, "At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise in the U.S. and abroad, Rep. Omar is promoting the ugly, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews have an outsized influence over politics. The notion that wealthy Jews are controlling the government is a longstanding anti-Semitic trope and one of the pillars of modern anti-Semitism. …"
It wasn't the first example of Omar's willingness to traffic in these anti-Semitic themes. Just weeks ago, she had to defend a 2012 tweet in which she claimed, "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."
Amid calls for her to resign, she, like the men in Virginia, apologized, but is also defiant, tweeting: "Listening and learning, but standing strong."
That's another parallel in these two troubling tales: ignorance. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring blamed his college blackface on "ignorance and glib attitudes." Northam has also suggested he needs to educate himself on the history of racism in America. If a recent interview with Gayle King is any indication, he has a ways to go; she had to correct him that the term was "slavery," not "indentured servitude."
Omar also admitted she needs an education and responded to New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss on Twitter: "You are correct when you say, 'Perhaps Ms. Omar is sincerely befuddled and not simply deflecting'" in failing to grasp why the "hypnotized" comment was so offensive.
But for all the similarities, there's an important difference between Omar and the two Virginia politicians. While many Democrats in Virginia — including African-Americans — say Northam and Herring's policies have been good for blacks, Omar supports one policy that is patently bad for Jews.
The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign is a pro-Palestinian movement to punish Israel through boycotts, divestments and sanctions. Omar is one of only two House members — Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib is the other — to support it. As the ADL describes it, "many of the founding goals of the BDS movement, including denying the Jewish people the universal right of self-determination, along with many of the strategies employed in BDS campaigns, are anti-Semitic."
To be clear, the BDS movement is not just a criticism of Israeli policy. I spoke with JNS.org editor-in-chief Jonathan Tobin last week, who said millions of Israeli Jews wake up every morning and criticize Israeli policy. BDS, on the other hand, is about demonizing and delegitimizing Jews and a Jewish state — as Tobin reminds, "the only Jewish state on the planet."
Ignorance isn't a sin — though, we'd presumably expect our elected officials, from the president on down, to know something about the important histories of racism and anti-Semitism.
But ignorance can't explain Omar and Tlaib's support for a movement whose anti-Semitism is plainly stated and painfully obvious.
They've apologized for their tweets. Will we hold them accountable for their policies?

Texto completo: Former Duke University basketball player Corey Maggette has denied raping the woman who has accused Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of assaulting her when she was a Duke undergrad 20 years ago.
Meredith Watson has accused Maggette of raping her while the two were Duke students in 1999, according to a report in The New York Times.
The accusation, first reported by the Times on Monday, cited Facebook messages and a friend of Watson, a 2001 Duke undergrad. The Times also quoted Washington attorney R. Stanton Jones, a childhood friend of Watson's, as saying he remembered Watson telling him Maggette raped her.
Through a spokesman, Maggette denied the accusation to the Times.
"It has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson's lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about these sexual assault allegations," Maggette said in a statement. "I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge."
Maggette, 39, played one season at Duke in 1998-99, helping the Blue Devils go 37-2 and reach the NCAA tournament final. He turned pro after that season and was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round of the NBA Draft.
After playing 14 years in the NBA, Maggette retired and is now part of the Los Angeles Clippers television broadcast team on Fox Sports West.
A Fox Sports spokeswoman told The News & Observer via email Tuesday that they are aware of the accusations against Maggette. "FOX Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter," the statement said. "We have no further comment at this time."
Duke spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said the school is looking into Watson's claims. "We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed," Schoenfeld said.

Trump Offends Iranian With Use of Her Photo

Texto completo: TEHRAN -- All her life Yalda Moayeri, a 37-year-old photojournalist from Iran, has struggled with men. She has dealt with mansplaining colleagues, Iranian censors and the country's security forces. Some created obstacles, others pressured her. She always fought back.
Now she's tangling with President Trump, who used a photograph she shot without permission for his own political purposes.
On the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, celebrated on Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted an iconic image taken by Ms. Moayeri. The image -- taken under dangerous circumstances -- shows an unidentified protester in Tehran, her left fist raised while surrounded by smoke, during demonstrations in 2017.
Mr. Trump took aim at Iran's leaders, who he, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John R. Bolton all indirectly say must be changed.
"40 years of corruption. 40 years of repression. 40 years of terror. The regime in Iran has produced only #40YearsofFailure. The long-suffering Iranian people deserve a much brighter future," the president said in the Twitter post. Mr. Trump also posted the message in Persian, using the same image.
When Ms. Moayeri saw the post, she said, something snapped.
"I felt cheated and abused, it causes me great sorrow to see the man who is inflicting so much pain upon me and my compatriots to use my image for his own agenda," she said. "I did not take this risk to have someone using it to pressure us Iranians even further."
Trump administration officials in Washington did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment on Ms. Moayeri's criticism.
The day she went out to photograph the image, Dec. 30, 2017, many places in the country were convulsed by protests over worsening economic conditions. Protesters also shouted slogans against the government and Iran's Islamic leaders.
When Ms. Moayeri got word of protests at Tehran University, she found students and riot police throwing stones at each other. Despite her fear of arrest, she started snapping photographs.
A stone hit her leg and some police officers blasted fire extinguishers, filling the air with billowy white fumes that resembled tear-gas smoke, she recalled, as the protests spilled outside the university's gates.
"Suddenly this young woman appeared through the smoke, covering her face with her head scarf and flashing a victory sign, I snapped some images," she said. "I never figured out who she was. Only when I came home I saw the picture had power."
Thousands were arrested, 25 people died, the authorities tried to control the news and Ms. Moayeri possessed an image that had captured it all. As a freelancer who had worked in Sudan, Somalia, Pakistan, Iraq and elsewhere, she had many places to sell the picture, but also knew that if her name were published she might get into trouble with the authorities.
She ended up selling the image to Iran-based photographers for The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse. It quickly spread via social media as the symbol of the protests in Iran. There was no contract, and Ms. Moayeri said she still owned the rights to the image.
After six months she decided she had waited long enough to take public credit for the image. Ms. Moayeri sent it to the annual Iranian Photojournalists Association and won first prize. She did not get in trouble.
She provided The New York Times with the sequence and original pictures taken that day.
"Taking pictures that tell the truth is the job of all photojournalists," she said.
When Mr. Pompeo used the image last July ahead of a meeting with Iranians living in the United States who oppose the Islamic republic and its leaders, Ms. Moayeri said she had been upset, "but thought, 'O.K., whatever."'
But she lost her temper when President Trump posted the image on Monday. "His sanctions are devastating our lives. Our money became worthless. People are becoming poor. Because of his travel ban, many Iranians cannot visit their family members in the United States. My father lives there and I can't go either," she said. "I just don't want to be any part of his agenda against Iran."
She wrote a statement on her Instagram page, distancing herself from the use of the image by Mr. Trump. "It's not as if I can sue the president of the United States as an Iranian, so I guess this is all I can do," she said.

Texto completo: Quality of life
Allow me to offer another perspective than the one presented by Columnist Jimmy DeButts regarding investments that the county has made into the quality of life for the citizens of Anne Arundel County (The Capital, Feb. 10).
Yes, the county has invested significant monies into golf courses in recent years, just as it has into a variety of recreational facilities and activities for the improvement in the quality of life for the citizens of Anne Arundel County. The operations at Compass Pointe and the acquisition and renovation of Eisenhower Golf Course contribute significantly to that quality of life.
The question I must ask is why the recreational activity of golf is measured by a different metric than any other recreational investment. Golf pays for its operational costs. No other recreational activity does. Not swimming, not tennis, not the provision and maintenance of fields for youth and adult athletics, not regional parks such as Kinder Farm Park or Quiet Waters Park, not environmental or conservation preservation.
Only golf charges user fees sufficient to cover operating costs. And yet, despite this ability to cover the operating costs, golf is singled out for criticism for not paying for debt service as well. No other recreational pursuit comes close and yet all contribute significantly to the quality of life here in Anne Arundel County, a great place to live, work and play.
Mr. DeButts, I'd like to suggest that your vision is through too narrow a prism. Broaden your perspective to consider the contribution of the property taxes collected annually on the upscale development surrounding Compass Pointe.
Development that could not have occurred without the county persevering in the development of the golf course and aggregating the adjoining properties in an administrative plat to make it all possible.
Administrative malfeasance or a vision of providing recreational opportunity in return for, and as a benefit of economic development? A 'money pit' or an investment in the quality of life for the citizens of the county?
Continued investment in recreation and leisure opportunities, agricultural conservation and resource protection in the county, either generally through my tax dollars our through user fees for specific activities is an investment I am more than willing to pay. It makes living here worth the investment.

Subway stabbing
We now know that the Feb. 3 murder of a young man in New York City Subway was allegedly committed by a MS-13 gang member who is an undocumented alien.
The New York Times reported that the MS-13 gang member had recently been charged by the "Queens district attorney with conspiracy and attempted murder, as well as drug and weapons charges and was free on $2,500 bail awaiting trial."
Had the Queens district attorney turned him into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the 287(g) program requires when arrested the first time, the illegal alien would have been detained and likely deported due to his MS-13 affiliation and the murdered young man would still be alive and with his family today.
So, I ask you, County Executive Steuart Pittman and those who support his ending of Anne Arundel County's participation in the 287 (g) program, when a person is murdered or maimed in Anne Arundel County or elsewhere by an illegal alien who would otherwise been incarcerated and/or deported had the county participated in the 287(g) program, will you personally apologize to the murdered one's family?
Will you and your supporters go to the family's home and explain the benefits of ending participation in the program?
Will you at least admit that the person would be alive if Anne Arundel County participated?
More importantly, will The Capital, report that the crime was committed by same?
Be prepared Mr. Pittman and those of you who supported his political stunt, it is only a matter of time.

Here's what you need to know about the Ilhan Omar controversy

Texto completo: Here's a quick rundown on the Ilhan Omar controversy that is brewing in Washington:
Who is Ilhan Omar? Omar is a freshman representative from Minnesota. A former Minnesota state legislator, she is a 37-year-old Somali-American who was swept into office in November's “blue wave" of Democrats. She is one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.
What's the controversy about? Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, and other Republicans were already attacking Omar and fellow Representative Rashida Tlaib, the other Muslim woman in Congress, accusing them of anti-Semitism, the Washington Post reported. The Republicans have focused on past comments by the two women — and Omar apologized last month for remarks she tweeted. But both congresswomen have also fired back, saying critics are trying to conflate their policy views on Israel with hatred, the Post reported.
With that in the background, things heated up with two terse tweet responses Sunday night in which Omar suggested that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a powerful pro-Israel interest group, paid members of Congress to support that country.
How much criticism has she gotten? Democrats, who had previously been reluctant to criticize Omar, joined in after Sunday's tweets. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the entire House leadership issued a statement on Monday saying that “legitimate criticism of Israel's policies is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate that the United States and Israel share. But Congresswoman Omar's use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters is deeply offensive." They called for an immediate apology for the “hurtful comments." Pelosi also said she had spoken with Omar and said they “agreed that we must use this moment to move forward as we reject anti-Semitism in all forms."
What does Omar say? Within hours, Omar issued a statement, saying, “I unequivocally apologize." She said, “Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes. My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole." At the same time, she said, “I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry. It's gone on too long and we must be willing to address it." She said in a tweet she was “listening and learning, but standing strong."
What's the big picture? The New York Times reported earlier this month that criticisms of Omar and Tlaib had exposed a generation gap in the Democratic party between older, staunch supporters of Israel and young liberals who are willing to accuse the Israeli government of abusing human rights and who are demanding progress toward a Palestinian state. The Post reported that the GOP is trying to paint itself as the better defender of Israel and to increase its appeal to traditionally Democratic Jewish voters, at a time that dozens of liberal Democrats have been critical of Israeli policy.

Texto completo: On Tuesday, Feb. 12, the Glenbard Parent Series Navigating Healthy Families will present a day with investigative journalist Katherine Reynolds Lewis, author of "The Good News About Bad Behavior: Why Kids Are Less Disciplined Than Ever and What to Do About It."
Lewis will give these two presentations.
* "Why Won’t Kids Do What You Want" will be offered at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 12, at Glenbard West High School, 670 Crescent Blvd. in Glen Ellyn.
Drawing on her personal experience, as well as the latest research on play, technology and failure, Lewis will share a new model of discipline and outline a theory that centers on listening and building a child’s skills to address the root causes of misbehavior. Learn how you can help young people grow their independence, foster mental health and develop the motivation to behave well.
Parents and guardians will learn to respond to their children’s misbehavior instead of reacting to it so that they get the results they want — children who are self-disciplined, confident and better equipped to handle life’s challenges.
* "The Good News About Bad Behavior/Early Childhood" will be presented at 9:30 a.m. Feb. 12 at Marquardt School District 15 administration center, 1860 Glen Ellyn Road in Glendale Heights. For this presentation, Lewis will address her remarks to parents, guardians and caregivers of children ages 3 to 10.
A recent study of first-graders found they could sit still for no more than three minutes, only a quarter of the time that their peers could in 1950. Master the skills to build self-control, strengthen empathy and connection, and peacefully resolve family conflict.
Reynolds Lewis spent five years investigating this crisis: observing families at the dinner table, meeting educators who are transforming the school experience for kids with attention and mood disorders, studying psychological research, and looking introspectively at her own parenting habits.
Reynolds Lewis is an award-winning, independent journalist, author and speaker based in Washington, D.C., and a certified parent educator.
She contributes to The Atlantic online, Fortune magazine, USA Today’s magazine group, The Washington Post and Working Mother magazine. Her byline has also appeared in Bloomberg Businessweek, MSN Money, Money, The New York Times, Parade, Slate, and The Washington Post Magazine.
Her story for Mother Jones magazine about school discipline went viral after it was published in July 2015, becoming the site’s most-viewed piece. In two decades as a journalist, her work has won recognition from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, the Society of Professional Journalists and the Chicago Headline Club. Continuing professional development units are available.

Trump's legacy felt in Costa Rica town

Texto completo: At his home on the misty slope of Costa Rica's tallest mountain, Dario Angulo keeps a set of photographs from the years he tended the rolling fairways and clipped greens of a faraway American golf resort.
Angulo learned to drive backhoes and bulldozers, carving water hazards and tee boxes out of former horse pastures in Bedminster, N.J., where a famous New Yorker was building a world-class course. Angulo earned $8 an hour, a fraction of what a state-licensed heavy equipment operator would make, with no benefits or overtime pay. But he stayed seven years on the grounds crew, saving enough for a small piece of land and some cattle back home.
Now the 34-year-old lives with his wife and daughters in a sturdy house built by "Trump money," as he put it, with a porch to watch the sun go down.
It's a common story in this small town.
Other former employees of President Donald Trump's company live nearby: men who once raked the sand traps and pushed mowers through thick heat on prized golf property -- the "Summer White House," as aides have called it -- where his daughter Ivanka got married and where he wants to build a family cemetery.
"Many of us helped him get what he has today," Angulo said. "This golf course was built by illegals."
The Washington Post spoke with 16 men and women from Costa Rica and other Latin American countries, including six in Santa Teresa de Cajon, who said they were employed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. All of them said they worked for Trump without legal status -- and that their managers knew.
The former employees who still live in New Jersey provided pay slips documenting their work at the Bedminster club. They identified friends and relatives in Costa Rica who also were employed at the course. In Costa Rica, The Post located former workers in two regions who provided detailed accounts of their time at the Bedminster property and shared memorabilia they had kept, such as Trump-branded golf tees, as well as photos of themselves at the club.
The brightly painted homes that line the road in Santa Teresa de Cajon, many paid for by wages earned more than 4,000 miles away, are the fruits of a long-running pipeline of illegal workers to the president's course, one that carried far more than a few unauthorized employees who slipped through the cracks.
Soon after Trump broke ground at Bedminster in 2002 with a golden shovel, this village emerged as a wellspring of low-paid labor for the private club, which charges tens of thousands of dollars to join. Over the years, dozens of workers from Costa Rica filled jobs as groundskeepers, housekeepers and dishwashers at Bedminster, former employees said. The club hired others from El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala who spoke to The Post. Many ended up in the blue-collar borough of Bound Brook, N.J., piling into vans before dawn to head to the course each morning.
Their descriptions of Bedminster's long reliance on illegal workers are bolstered by a newly obtained police report showing that the club's head of security was told in 2011 about an employee suspected of using false identification papers -- the first known documentation of a warning to the Trump Organization about the legal status of a worker.
Other supervisors received similar flags over the years, including Bedminster's general manager, who was told by a worker from Ecuador several years ago that she entered the country illegally, the employee said.
Eric Trump, a son of the president who runs the Trump Organization along with brother Donald Trump Jr., declined to comment on the accounts by the former workers. Bedminster managers did not return requests for comment.
The company's recent purge of unauthorized workers from at least five Trump properties contributes to mounting evidence that the president benefited for years from the work of illegal laborers he now vilifies.
It remains unclear what measures Trump or his company took to avoid hiring such workers, even after he launched a White House bid built around the threat he says they pose to Americans.
White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Eric Trump has said he and other senior Trump Organization executives did not know the company hired illegal workers, noting that the employees used falsified documents.
"We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices," the company said in a statement in December. "If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately. We take this issue very seriously."
Over the years, the network from Costa Rica to Bedminster expanded as workers recruited friends and relatives, some flying to the United States on tourist visas and others paying smugglers thousands of dollars to help them cross the U.S.-Mexico border, former employees said. New hires needed little more than a crudely printed phony green card and a fake Social Security number to land a job, they said.
Some workers described Bedminster as their launchpad to buy homes and start businesses. Others remembered it as grueling labor under bosses who were demanding, even bigoted -- and who at times used the workers' illegal status against them.
After the New York Times in December reported about two housekeepers without legal status who worked at Bedminster, the Trump Organization fired at least 18 employees at five golf courses in New York and New Jersey, part of what Eric Trump has said is "a broad effort" to identify unauthorized workers. An additional undisclosed number were fired from Bedminster, former employees said.
As president, his father has repeatedly called for a crackdown on illegal immigration.
"Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel," Trump said during his recent State of the Union address
But the lax hiring practices at Bedminster and other Trump properties described by former employees -- including some who said their supervisors discussed their fake documents -- stand in sharp contrast with Trump's rhetoric.
While other top-tier golf U.S. courses adopted the federal government's E-Verify system to check the immigration status of potential hires, the Trump Organization is only now planning to implement it.

Texto completo: Michelle Obama stole the show at Sunday night's Grammy Awards without singing a note.
The former First Lady took the stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles to honor Motown, Beyoncé and other musicians - whose work, she said, "allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in."
"From the Motown records I wore out on the South Side to the 'who run the world' songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story," Obama, wearing a glimmering gray pantsuit, said over a standing ovation at the 61st Grammy Awards.
"And I know that's true for everybody here. Whether we like country or rap or rock, music helps us share ourselves, our dignity and sorrows, our hopes and joys. It allows us to hear one another, to invite each other in. Music shows us that all of it matters, every story within every voice, every note within every song," she said.
Obama's appearance followed an opening performance of "Havana" by Camila Cabello.
Joined onstage by Lady Gaga, Jada Pinkett Smith and Jennifer Lopez, host Alicia Keys - who was raised in Hell's Kitchen - praised the "magnificent goddesses" who all spoke of the impact music had made on their lives.
"They said I was weird - that my look, my choices, my sound - that it wouldn't work," said Gaga, who grew up on the Upper West Side. "But music told me not to listen to them. Music took my ears, took my hands, my voice and my soul and it led me to all of you and to my little monsters who I love so much.
Lopez, wearing a Grecian gown, went back to her roots in the Bronx, where she said music gave her "a reason to dance."
"And it kept me moving from the block to the big stages and even bigger screens," she said. "It reminded me where I come from, but it also reminded me of all the places that I can go. Music has always been the one place we can all feel truly free."
After last year's show saw only one female performer winning a major solo award - Alessia Cara for best new artist - Recording Academy President Neil Portnow worsened matters by advising female performers to "step up" if they want to see their name in lights.
The 2019 show started off better, as Gaga took home several awards for both "Joanne" and "Shallow" from "A Star Is Born." Ariana Grande walked away with best pop vocal album for "Sweetener," and Kacey Musgraves won best country solo performance, best country song, and other awards.
Brandi Carlile went three-for-three before the show even opened, winning best Americana album for "By the Way, I Forgive You" and best American roots performance and best American roots song for "The Joke."
The hip-hop community had its own issues with the Grammys as Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino all refused to perform.
"The fact of the matter is, we continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world," Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich told The New York Times ahead of the show. "When they don't take home the big prize, the regard of the academy, and what the Grammys represent, continues to be less meaningful to the hip-hop community, which is sad."
Last year, Jay-Z was nominated for eight awards, including album, song and record of the year - but walked away without a single trophy. Pulitzer Prize-winner Lamar lost album of the year to Bruno Mars, despite winning all five rap awards.

MEMOIRIST CHRISTINE O'BRIEN'S CRAVE' UNCOVERS ALL KINDS OF YEARNINGS

Texto completo: We crave a lot of things.
Food, if we're hungry. Safety, if we're scared. Normality, if we're a little different. Love, always.
So which is it, Christine O'Brien?
"All of the above," O'Brien says simply, with a wry grin.
The Walnut Creek author's newly published "Crave: A Memoir of Food and Longing" (St. Martin's Press, $28.99, 260 pages) details in poignant prose a childhood both shuttered from normality, yet in the spotlight. She grew up in New York City's most iconic celebrity-laden apartment building, the Dakota, on Central Park West. Her famous neighbors included Leonard Bernstein and Lauren Bacall, who gave out Tootsie-Pops at Halloween.
O'Brien's father was Ed Scherick, a producer of television (including "Bewitched," "Batman" and "That Girl") and films such as "The Stepford Wives" and "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three." Her mother, Carol, was a former beauty queen from Illinois. Parties at her home included guests such as Alan Alda and Marlo Thomas.
"But my parents were isolationists," O'Brien says on a recent rainy day at Papillon coffee house in Lafayette. "I only remember them throwing two parties while we lived at the Dakota. My dad schmoozed, and my mom felt uncomfortable."
As a child, she had lots of fears; New York in the '70s was scarier than it is now. "Muggings right and left. You never just walked down the street," O'Brien says. One of her fears was connected with the smell of Joy perfume, Carol's "going out" perfume; it meant her mom was leaving her, going out into the frightening city. Carol was a nervous mother, constantly hovering, warning them of everything such as small waves lapping at the shore when O'Brien's father fished, because you never know.
After Carol collapsed in their apartment one day and spent the next year in bed despite there being no physical illness, she began a regime of bizarre diets, such as raw liver, raw eggs, fresh yeast and at one point, coffee enemas. Then she forced the family to adhere to "The Program," which was mostly celery juice and blended salads. Boxes of vegetables crowded the kitchen counters, and her mother spent most of everyday mixing up her concoctions. Her father raged. O'Brien and her three younger brothers cowered.
But they stuck with the program out of loyalty to their mother, who at times demanded they do water fasts in the summer, when they stayed in bed for five days at a time.
"It was like solitary confinement," O'Brien says. "But once you're released from all those food sensitivities, you'd get into this high. So after that, I was always looking for that high."
There was a high when she was 16, and the family took a house in Point Lookout on Barrier Island, New York. Boys noticed her for the first time, and she found a true girlfriend. But after she finished writing "Crave," O'Brien found diaries written during that time, expressing her hunger, her shame at being different, her parents being elitist and not mingling with the other summer families.
"My next memoir will cover just that summer," O'Brien says.
Will it be called "Shame?" She grins. "No, but maybe it should be."
The family eventually moved to Los Angeles, and her parents divorced. O'Brien went to UC Berkeley, met her husband Tim, and started eating steak, which sent her into a guilt spiral. "I always believed what my mother was doing with The Program was right, which was hard, because I believed I wasn't pure if I craved steak. I still believe she was right, she was just 30 years ahead of her time. And the thing she didn't understand was no one diet fits all. She was unhealthy, because she was so rigid. I don't think you can be healthy if your mind is always looking for the way everyone else is wrong."
O'Brien still adheres to a version of The Program. Meals are vegetable-heavy, with blended salad drinks that are way easier to make nowadays. She still craves steak and chocolate. "I have to have chocolate with me all the time," she says, rummaging in her purse and bringing out a plastic bag with the remnants of bars of dark chocolate with raspberries and offering some.
O'Brien raised her two children, now in their 20s, to have a healthy relationship with food, but it wasn't easy at first. "It was hard for me to watch them eat meat at first. I felt like I was ruining their innocence."
Now a part-time instructor in English composition at St. Mary's College, O'Brien is now riding a high that comes from relief that the book has been so well-received. The New York Times reported she presents her parents with "loving generosity." She's been compared to memoirist Mary Karr ("Liar's Club"), and her father's still living contemporaries have told her he'd be proud. She feels her mom's spirit is still with her, encouraging her, and describes what she thinks is a little sign of it she encountered while she was feeling most vulnerable while writing the book. "Look," she says, pointing to a photo on her cell phone. "This is the tree outside my bedroom window. I woke up one morning, and this was the last leaf on it." The remaining leaf was a large, perfect, blood-red heart.
"It's her saying It's all right. I love you," O'Brien says.

More of Trump's private schedules leak as West Wing hunts down source

Texto completo: President Trump's private schedules were leaked for a second time in a week on Sunday, highlighting what appears to be an act of defiance as the White House frantically investigates who might be behind the breach.

Axios reported it obtained four more days of Trump's schedule from last week, showing the president spent nearly half his time in unstructured “Executive Time," which is time for which nothing was planned in advance.

Last Sunday the outlet published three months-worth of the president's private itinerary.

The first leak prompted Trump’s secretary Madeleine Westerhout to complain of "a disgraceful breach of trust" in a tweet.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed to Fox News on Sunday that an internal hunt for the source of the leak is underway, saying they are “hoping to have a resolution” this week.

President Trump took to Twitter Sunday afternoon to defend his use of “Executive Time.”

“The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President,” Trump tweeted. “The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess. Depleted Military, Endless Wars, a potential War with North Korea, V.A., High Taxes & too many Regulations, Border, Immigration & HealthCare problems, & much more. I had no choice but to work very long hours!”

The leak is the latest high-profile sign of defiance within the Trump administration. Last year an anonymous individual claiming to be a senior U.S. official wrote a New York Times op-ed criticizing Trump and detailing an insider “resistance." Trump said in September he wanted then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to find the mysterious author of that opinion piece, calling it a matter of "national security," but there so far has been no public indication that individual was ever caught.

Should the West Wing ever narrow down the source of the latest round of leaks, there may yet be some challenges.

“When you find that person or persons, and it’s likely going to be a career staffer, you’re going to learn a lot about how hard it is to fire federal workers,” Mulvaney said.

BSO, Andris Nelsons three-peat at Grammys with Shostakovich album

Texto completo: The Boston Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Andris Nelsons, won the Grammy Award Sunday for best orchestral performance for “Shostakovich: Symphonies Nos. 4 & 11," the latest release in its ongoing cycle of Shostakovich symphonies on Deutsche Grammophon. The cycle is three for three on Grammy wins; the two previous installments won the same award in 2016 and 2017.
“I don't even know what to say," said Nelsons, speaking over the phone shortly after the win was announced at the Grammy pre-telecast ceremony. “I'm very happy, and honored, but mostly I'm proud of the Boston Symphony for very deeply playing and understanding these great symphonies."
According to Nelsons, several aspects play a role in the BSO's prowess for the symphonies of Shostakovich, but most important is the musicians' “great nuances of powerful, intensive dramatic playing . . . not just simply loud, but a really deep and powerful sound." He expressed his hope that the album would bring new listeners to Shostakovich's music, which he described as one of his great loves.
Recorded at Symphony Hall during subscription BSO performances in 2017 and 2018, the album was engineered by Shawn Murphy and Nick Squire, and mastered by Tim Martyn. For their work on the album, the three were awarded the Grammy for best engineered classical album. With these wins, the BSO now holds a grand total of 11 Grammys.
The next installment in the cycle, a two-disc set including Symphonies Nos. 6 and 7, music from the Suite from “King Lear," and the Festive Overture, will be released on Feb. 22.

Rampell: Don't make Medicare-for-all a litmus test

Texto completo: It's the eggshells that 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are stomping through, backing up and stomping upon all over again, as they attempt to satisfy the base's delicate demands for Medicare-for-all.
The left-wing die-hards sometimes argue that supporting Medicare-for-all should be a litmus test for anyone seeking the 2020 nomination because it's not only good policy but good politics, too. The entrenched establishment may claim it's a "radical" idea, but surveys suggest it is mainstream.
"If I look at polling and 70 percent of the people support Medicare for All, if a very significant percentage of people think the rich, the very rich, should start paying their fair share of taxes," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told the New York Times, "I think I'd be pretty dumb not to develop policies that capture what the American people want."
In a sense, Sanders is right: The phrase "Medicare-for-all" polls favorably (though not always at 70 percent), and has for several years.
Here's the problem. The things Americans are apparently envisioning when they tell pollsters they support Medicare-for-all turn out to be a different, vaguer and more varied set of ideas than the specific thing that Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and others in the progressive base are proposing.
Sanders, et al. want all Americans enrolled in a single, generous, government-run - or single-payer - plan with no private insurers offering their own similar, competing policies. Sanders said he envisions the role of private insurers only for "cosmetic surgery, you want to get your nose fixed." (To be clear, this is not how Medicare currently works; the program relies heavily on privately run insurance plans.)
How does the public feel about this?
If you simply ask, "Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all?," 56 percent of respondents favor it, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll.
But mention that Medicare-for-all involves getting rid of private insurance companies, and support plummets to 37 percent. Which should not be that surprising. Most adults have private insurance, and most of them like it. They're nervous about losing it.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris, D-Calif., learned this the hard way, when the presidential candidate spelled out during a CNN town hall that she favored eliminating private insurance.
After a backlash, Harris's staff walked back her comments, noting that she preferred Sanders-style single-payer but had also co-sponsored other bills that allowed existing private insurance plans to coexist alongside expanded public insurance. That, in turn, inflamed the left. A former Sanders staffer said it was equivalent to saying "you're OK with people dying for being too poor."
Wary of provoking the single-payer-or-bust-ers, other Democratic 2020 candidates have given incoherent or noncommittal remarks on the subject. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said he supported "single-payer" but also the use of private insurers, eventually endorsing "Medicare for all who want it." Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) confusingly said he supported the continued existence of "private health care," which might mean insurers but also might simply mean providers.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) - who, like Harris and Booker, co-sponsored Sanders' single-payer bill - have both sidestepped the issue. Asked about private insurance, Warren said there were a lot of paths to get to "affordable health care for every American."
And you know what? That's the right answer right now.
The thing Americans want most, if you look at the polling, is not single-payer per se. They want universal, affordable coverage that doesn't leave them begging on GoFundMe for their kids' insulin. In that same Kaiser survey, support for "Medicare for All" was highest - 71 percent - when respondents were told it would "guarantee health insurance as a right for all Americans."
And purity tests aside, there are many ways to achieve that outcome. Across health policy wonkland, there are vibrant debates over many alternative ideas. These include allowing non-elderly adults to buy into Medicare; allowing employers to purchase Medicare for workers; a Medicaid buy-in program; and enrolling all newborns in a government health plan.
Rather than insisting that "there's no viable path to the Democratic nomination for someone who does not support single-payer health care," as one progressive writer put it, Democrats should start with principles and objectives, and figure out the most effective and feasible route to them.
This is the richest country on Earth. Truly, we can figure this out. But not if we let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

Texto completo: n most histories of how Americans became so polarized, the Great Inflation of the 1970s is given short shrift - sometimes no shrift at all. This is wrong. Inflation was as pivotal a factor in our national crackup as Vietnam and Watergate.
Inflation changed how Americans thought about their economic relationships to their fellow citizens - which is to say, inflation and its associated economic traumas changed who we were as a people. It also called into question the economic assumptions that had guided the country since World War II, opening the door for new assumptions that have governed us ever since. Here is the story.
The United States of the 1960s experienced many social upheavals. But in one realm, all was copacetic. The economy roared. The gross domestic product was increasing between 2 percent and 6 percent, wages grew, jobs were stable. The year 1968 was an annus horribilis - assassinations, riots, a bitter presidential race. But the Economic Report of the President for that year reflected at length on - imagine this - "the problem of prosperity."
Slowly, though, inflation entered the picture. It hit 5.7 percent in 1970, then 11 percent in 1974. Such sustained inflation was something that had never happened in stable postwar America. And it was punishing. For a family of modest means, a trip to the supermarket was now a walk over hot coals.
How different this was from previous economic crises! The Great Depression, the 20th century's first economic emergency, made most Americans feel a degree of neighborly solidarity. The government wasn't measuring median household income in the 1930s, but a 2006 Department of Labor study pegged the average household income of 1934-1936 at $1,524. Adjust for inflation to 2018, that's about $28,000, while the official poverty level for a family of four was $25,100. In other words, the average family of 1936 was near poor. Everyone was in it together, and if Bill couldn't find work, his neighbor would give him a head of cabbage, a slab of pork belly.
But the Great Inflation, as the columnist and author Joe Nocera has noted, made most people feel they had to look out for themselves. Americans had spent decades just getting more and more ahead. Now, suddenly, they were falling behind.
Throw in wage stagnation, which began in the early '70s, and deindustrialization of the great cities of the North. Pennsylvania's Homestead Works, which had employed 20,000 men during the war, started shrinking, closing forever in 1986. Today that tract of land along the Monongahela River where the works once stood is home to the usual chain restaurants and big-box stores, those ubiquitous playpens of the low-wage economy.
Inflation also produced the manic search for "yield" - it was no longer enough to save money; your money had to make money, turning every wage earner into a player in market rapaciousness. The money market account was born in the 1970s. Personal investing took off (remember "When E.F. Hutton talks, people listen"?).
Even as Americans scrambled for return, they also sought to spend. Credit cards, which had barely existed in 1970, began to proliferate. The Supreme Court's 1978 decision in Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corporation opened the floodgates for banks to issue credit cards with high interest rates. Total credit card balances began to explode.
Then along came Ronald Reagan. The great secret to his success was not his uncomplicated optimism or his instinct for seizing a moment. It was that he freed people of the responsibility of introspection, released them from the guilt in which liberalism seemed to want to make them wallow. And so came the 1980s, when the culture started to celebrate wealth and acquisition as never before. A television series called "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" debuted in 1984.
So that was the first change flowing from the Great Inflation: Americans became a more acquisitive - bluntly, a more selfish - people. The second change was far more profound.
Assumptionswere upended
For decades after World War II, the economic assumptions that undergirded policymaking were basically those of John Maynard Keynes. His "demand side" theories - increase demand via public investment, even if it meant running a short-term deficit - guided the New Deal, the financing of the war and pretty much all policy thinking thereafter. And not just among Democrats: Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon were Keynesians.
There had been a group of economists, mostly at the University of Chicago and led by Milton Friedman, who dissented from Keynes. They argued against government intervention and for lower taxes and less regulation. As Keynesian principles promoted demand side, their theories promoted the opposite: supply side.
They'd never won much of an audience, as long as things were working. But now things weren't, in a big way. Inflation was Keynesianism's Achilles' heel, and the supply-siders aimed their arrow right at it. Reagan cut taxes significantly. Inflation ended (which was really the work of Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve). The economy boomed. Economic debate changed; even the way economics was taught changed.
And this, more or less, is where we've been ever since. Yes, we've had two Democratic presidents in that time, both of whom defied supply-side principles at key junctures. But walk down a street and ask 20 people a few questions about economic policy - I bet most will say that taxes must be kept low, even on rich people, and that we should let the market, not the government, decide on investments. Point to the hospital up the street and tell them that it wouldn't even be there without the millions in federal dollars of various kinds it takes in every year, and they'll mumble and shrug.
There are signs this mind-set is changing. The Trump tax cut of 2017 is consistently unpopular. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks of a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent on income over $10 million and, instead of getting laughed out of town, she prompts a serious public debate.
Still, we have a long way to go. Dislodging 40-year-old assumptions is a huge job. The Democrats, for starters, have to develop and defend a plausible alternative theory of growth.
But others have a responsibility here, too - notably, our captains of commerce. They have enormous power, and in a country this polarized, they can move moderate and maybe even conservative public opinion in a way that Democratic politicians, civic leaders and celebrities cannot.
They will always be rich. But they have to decide what kind of country they want to be rich in. A place of more and more tax cuts for them, where states keep slashing their higher-education spending and tuitions keep skyrocketing; where the best job opportunity in vast stretches of America is selling opioids; where many young people no longer believe in capitalism and record numbers of them would leave this country if they could? Or a country more like the one they and their parents grew up in, where we invested in ourselves and where work produced a fair and livable wage?
The Great Inflation was an inflection point that changed us for the worse. This moment can be another such point, but one that will change us for the better.

Texto completo: Dear Howard Schultz,
We need to talk.
This whole running for president thing — it's not going to happen. The high-priced political consultants you hired may be telling you otherwise, but I've got a better place for you to sink your millions. And I'm not going to charge you for it.
First, it should really go without saying that a candidate who is pro-immigration, pro-gun control, pro-gay rights, and pro-racial equality isn't going to win over a lot of Republicans. Opposing raising taxes on billionaires, standing against Medicare-for-All, obsessing over the deficit, and suggesting cuts to Social Security and Medicare won't endear you to Democrats either.
That may explain why you've got a favorability rating of around 4 percent.
I think the Ebola virus scores higher than that.
Second, all your tweets are getting ratioed and even Donald Trump is dunking on you. Democrats are apoplectic that you're going to get the president re-elected by slicing off a little piece of the anti-Trump vote, and there's some polling that suggests they're right.
Do you really want to be that guy who gave us four more years of Trump?
I'm sure you don't. And I take you at your word that you love your country. After all, while you could just sit back and nap on a giant pile of money, you're out there talking to people, doing interviews, and getting heckled at Barnes and Noble.
So here's a suggestion that would do far more to help America: Go buy a newspaper. Buy a couple actually. I don't mean the New York Times or the Boston Globe. They're not for sale and their owners are among the finest people in the world.
Buy some mid-sized newspapers, the kinds operating on shoe-string budgets, staffed by overworked and underpaid reporters, and barely surviving. Hire smart, enterprising editors to run them and give them free rein and lots of cash to ramp up their operations and do great public interest journalism. This kind of financial investment couldn't be more urgent. It's only February and more than 2,000 journalists have already lost their jobs this year.
You've seen the headlines: Buzzfeed, Vice, Huffington Post, McClatchy, Gannett, the Dallas Morning News. It's been a bloodbath. Two thousand newspapers have closed or merged. Between January 2017 and April 2018, more than a third of the largest newspapers in the country laid off employees. About 1,800 newspapers have closed or merged since 2004, and more than 1,300 communities lack a local paper, in effect, becoming news deserts.
This growing dearth of local news is terrible for democracy. Without effective news outlets in smaller cities, who will hold political leaders accountable and keep citizens informed of what's happening in their communities? You live in Washington state. When the Seattle Post-Intelligencer closed there in 2009, studies show that civic engagement actually decreased.
You've said that no one wants to see Trump leave the White House more than you. Well, here's something to think about: he outperformed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney in communities with low newspaper circulation. . . and did worse in places with heavier circulation.
Local newspapers are failing, in part because they haven't figured out the challenge of finding an effective business model that ensures profitability in the digital age.
But maybe that's not the future of journalism. Maybe newspapers are the new Carnegie Libraries — supported by smart, civic-minded, philanthropic Americans with deep pockets. Look at what Jeff Bezos did with the Washington Post. He plunged tens of millions of dollars into the paper and it's doing some of the best journalism of the Trump era. The Los Angeles Times and the Atlantic are ramping up their operations because of support from billionaire owners. You can be that guy!
I've heard you say that you're “living proof" of the American dream and it's hard to disagree. Your rags-to-riches story is impressive. Now you have a chance to take what you've accomplished and use it to strengthen democracy and build stronger and more resilient communities. And I can promise you one thing: If you make newspapers, not the presidency, your focus, you'll be remembered for a lot more than coffee and cake pops.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
After midnight on Jan. 31, the coldest day in New York City in three years, I got an email from an unfamiliar address.
The subject line was "MDC Brooklyn without Power."
"No heat no power no proper food," read the anonymous message. "Over 72 hours in lockdown. Please help."
M.D.C. is the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal jail on the Brooklyn waterfront that houses more than 1,600 inmates. Many of them have not been convicted and are being held before trial.
Reporters at The New York Times get a lot of email. Much of it is spam, unsolicited press releases, questions or complaints about our coverage. Occasionally, there is a solid news tip. But even then, it rarely feels as urgent as this one did.
I thanked the sender, asked for details and offered my phone number. No one called or replied.
I searched Google, Twitter. There was no mention of a power outage at the M.D.C. -- other than a tweet from a lawyer who had said two weeks earlier that she had recently been turned away from the jail: The staff said it had to shut down power because the jail was testing a generator.
I asked the lawyer, Betsy Ginsberg, who runs the civil rights clinic at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, if she had heard anything more since then. Yes, she replied, there had been a fire at the jail on Jan. 27, four days before.
"They have had no power since then and are on lockdowns with no lights, no corrlinks," the email system used by inmates, she wrote. "No social calls, some units have heat and some don't."
I tried to imagine what it must be like to be locked in the M.D.C. without lights or heat in the dead of winter. I had written about the jail once before -- which was probably why the person found my name -- around Christmas 2017. I remembered how shockingly cold it was when the wind blew in off the harbor.
Now it was surely worse: That morning, it had been 2 degrees.
Ms. Ginsberg, the lawyer, told me to email Deirdre von Dornum, the lead public defender at the federal defenders office in Brooklyn, which represents hundreds of indigent inmates at the jail.
She sounded almost as if she had been expecting me.
Calls had been pouring in from the jail, Ms. von Dornum said. A phone line that connects the holding facility to the federal defenders was working, and when inmates were briefly released from their cells, they rushed to the phone.
As the temperature dropped, the inmates' calls increased. "They sound really frightened," she said.
Ms. von Dornum's office had beseeched the warden for answers, but had received only curt replies, like, "legal visiting will be suspended."
By the end of the day I had talked to several federal defenders and paralegals, gathering the accounts of about three dozen inmates.
Leaders of the correction officers' union corroborated the inmates' accounts of conditions at the jail. I called the M.D.C. and wrote -- repeatedly -- to the warden and his staff, who work for the federal Bureau of Prisons.
The next morning, Feb. 1, we published a story that described in detail the darkened world inside the jail.
By later that day, news trucks were there. The local congresswoman, Nydia Velázquez, arrived. Ms. von Dornum secured a court order to go inside and check on the inmates.
After the story was published, officials at the jail sent a statement that said there was a power failure that had "minimally" affected the facility. Ms. von Dornum said that was not the case.
Legislators and protesters arrived at the jail over the weekend, as did I. The lawmakers came out denouncing the conditions and the dismissive response of the officials in charge. Calls for action swelled, amplified by social media, where people posted videos of inmates banging on their windows en masse.
Electricians were called in to work through the weekend. The power came back Sunday night, Feb. 3 -- a week after it had been knocked out by the fire -- and the heat was largely restored.
This week, a lawsuit was filed by the federal defenders. At hearings before federal judges -- which several lawyers had requested during the blackout to get their clients out on bail, or moved from the facility -- a clearer picture of what happened began to emerge.
And on Wednesday, the United States Department of Justice announced plans to have its internal watchdog, the inspector general, investigate.
Several of my colleagues, including Joseph Goldstein, Benjamin Weiser, Christina Goldbaum and Katie Benner, helped cover the fallout, from the protests and court hearings.
We also began to reconstruct the timeline of events, through interviews with inmates, their families, their lawyers, and others.
Have I heard back -- amid all of this -- from the person who first sent that desperate message?
Only once. The email came a few hours after the first story appeared. It offered just a hint about who the person was.
"I just read your article," it said. "I will let other waiting families know that you helped."

Shift in Tone for Foreign Relations Panel as Trump Ally Takes the Gavel

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee used his perch atop the storied Foreign Relations Committee to offer barbed criticisms of the president's foreign policy, once acidly referring to the White House as an "adult day care center" that would set the nation on a path to World War III.
For two years, the committee served as an arena for senators to air their grievances with President Trump's isolationist foreign policy, as Mr. Corker strove to take his place among the powerhouses who once wielded the gavel -- Henry Clay, Charles Sumner, Henry Cabot Lodge, Arthur H. Vandenberg, J. William Fulbright, Frank Church, Joseph R. Biden Jr., John Kerry and Richard Lugar.
Its new chairman, Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, appears intent on taking the committee in a new direction.
"My repertoire does not include sparring publicly with the president of the United States," Mr. Risch told the Idaho Press newspaper last month. "For many, many different reasons, I think that's counterproductive, and you won't see me doing it."
He added, "We exchange ideas about how we feel on things, but when we do disagree, we do it face to face, and not on the front page of The New York Times."
Mr. Risch, a former trial lawyer and current cattle rancher, has taken the gavel of the vaunted committee as dissatisfaction among Senate Republicans with the president's foreign policy has only mounted.
In December, Senate Republicans publicly broke with the president to approve a resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. This month, they were even more emphatic, voting almost unanimously to express their disapproval of his abrupt withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan.
House Republicans voted overwhelmingly last month to bar an American exit from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, after The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had expressed an interest in shattering the alliance.
But none of those issues have merited a hearing before the new Senate Foreign Relations Committee or a sharp word from the new chairman. A spokeswoman for Mr. Risch explained that while he takes seriously the committee's oversight role, he is confident that he has the president's ear on matters of foreign policy; he believes he is more effective when he raises his concerns with Mr. Trump privately on concerns where they may differ.
"He'll be addressing a lot of key issues," Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a committee member, said, expressing confidence in Mr. Risch. Besides, Mr. Portman added, "members are independent actors, and we're all going to speak up and let our views be known."
Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and another committee member, hit on the same point: "I understand that Chairman Risch has a different style and approach perhaps than Chairman Corker did, but I am determined that the committee will be no less effective."
Some foreign policy experts say even Mr. Corker was derelict in his duty to turn acerbic comments into real oversight or legislation. Under Mr. Risch, even the words might go silent. And that will have real consequences.
Leveraging the committee's oversight power is "a critical element of getting to the right place," said Wendy R. Sherman, an under secretary of state and acting deputy secretary of state under President Barack Obama.
"I'm not saying that Senator Risch should be combative with the president, but where there is disagreement, we rely on the U.S. Senate," Ms. Sherman said. "They can take the long view, and for them to defer to the president on everything really undermines the strength of that committee and the historic role that it's played."
Stewart M. Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former policy staffer at the State Department under President George W. Bush, said, "It's not enough simply to make, as Bob Corker did pretty frequently, made-for-TV sound bites expressing alarm or discomfort about U.S. policy unless there's going to be substantive hearings about the wisdom of those choices." He added, "The danger with Mr. Risch is that we are going to get neither expressions of alarm when the administration is off track, nor effective oversight."
Allies of the new chairman describe him as a workhorse, not a showhorse. But on policy, Mr. Trump has a friend at the helm of the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Risch has broken with the president on occasion, joining his colleagues to protest Mr. Trump's appetite for leaving the Atlantic alliance, and taking an aggressive stance on Russia.
But after The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump disclosed classified information provided by Israel to the Russian foreign minister, Mr. Risch told CNN: "There's a weasel here and the weasel is not the president of the United States. It's the traitor who disclosed these facts to The Washington Post."
While he joined his peers in voting for a bipartisan amendment sponsored by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, which warned the president of the dangers of a "precipitous withdrawal" of troops from Syria and Afghanistan, he took to the Senate floor to chastise news outlets for "badly mischaracterizing" the measure as a rebuke to Mr. Trump. Instead, he said, it commended the president "for all the things he's been able to do in Syria in getting ISIS contained down to the very small area that remains."
And he has remained sanguine about the president's ability to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, telling PBS NewsHour over the summer that Mr. Trump "should be given credit" for the work he had already accomplished.
"The president is committed to seeing this through, and as such we should all remember that negotiations involve both public and private diplomacy," Mr. Risch said in a statement. "Sometimes that means there will be public posturing on both sides, but I hope we can all give the president space to continue to move us in the right direction with North Korea."
Mr. Risch will have his issues, but they are likely to dovetail with President Trump's. He intends to delve into "the very real threat China poses to U.S. business and interests," he said in a statement.
And he is likely to join another member of the committee, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, in taking an aggressive stand challenging the regime of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.
In the House, Democrats will be more than happy to fulfill that oversight mandate, and have already listed a series of investigations that the House Foreign Affairs Committee might oversee, including scrutinizing accusations that Mr. Trump hid details of his meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from the public and his own staff.
But without a partner in the Senate, that committee's legislative work can only go so far.
That has Senate Democrats already expressing frustration.
At a time when "our allies are questioning our commitments and our adversaries are relishing the chaos the administration's policies have borne," Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the committee's ranking Democrat, said, it "can be constructive" to suggest alternatives to the administration's current policies.
"I understand that Senator Risch has said he won't be taking on the president publicly, but there are times when both on the jurisdiction of your committee and on the issues you truly believe, you can shape the direction of things," Mr. Menendez added. "It can be constructive" to make your thoughts known.

Texto completo: A salacious tabloid newspaper with a conservative owner and a history of unscrupulous methods finds itself under the microscope, forcing a national reckoning about the intersection of journalism, politics, celebrity and sleaze.
That's what happened seven years ago at Rupert Murdoch's News of the World in London. The paper folded in 2012 amid a phone hacking scandal that turned U. K. 's media and political establishment upside down.
But it could also describe – minus the phone hacking – the controversy engulfing the National Enquirer.
The Florida-based supermarket tabloid has mixed celebrity gossip, true crime and conspiracy theories for decades. But its association with President Donald Trump – and its new attacks on Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos – is shining a harsh light on the underbelly of tabloid journalism.
And now a legal fight with the world’s richest person could prove devastating for a company that has faced financial challenges, including substantial debt and the loss of revenue from print sales confronting even mainstream newspapers.
In a blog post Thursday, Bezos alleged that lawyers for the National Enquirer's parent company – American Media Inc. – tried to blackmail him into getting the Washington Post to drop its investigation into the company's ties to Trump.
More: National Enquirer owner responds to Bezos post, says it 'acted lawfully' in its reporting
Jeff Bezos is taking on the National Enquirer. Here's a look at the key players
Feds investigating Jeff Bezos' claims, examining agreement that shielded AMI from criminal charges
Bezos announced Jan. 9 that he and his wife were divorcing after 25 years of marriage. Later that same day, the National Enquirer published photos and texts showing Bezos involved in an extramarital affair with a former news anchor.
Bezos hired a private investigator to discover how the National Enquirer got his texts.
That wasn't the end of it.
In emails released by Bezos Thursday, the National Enquirer told him that it had even more compromising photos, including what it euphemistically described as a "below-the-belt selfie. " It threatened to publish the photos unless Bezos publicly stated that he has "no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces. "
AMI has denied any wrongdoing, saying it "believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos. " In a statement Friday, the company said its board of directors would open an investigation into the allegations.
The company could have criminal or civil liability if it was complicit in illegally obtaining the photos, said Michael Conway, a lawyer who has represented media organizations such as the New York Times and ABC, and now teaches at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.
“The key question here is, did American Media in any way encourage, facilitate or otherwise make an effort to get Bezos’ pictures and emails, which we don’t know,” Conway said. “If they did, then they’re complicit in the crime and the First Amendment doesn’t protect them from publishing it. ”
But that's not the only question. Bezos alleged that AMI's threats to publish more embarrassing photos amounted to extortion.
AMI's lawyers proposed a confidential agreement to settle a legal claim. Such non-disclosure agreements are common, said Harry Sandick, an attorney who formerly served as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. But "you aren't allowed to threaten to harm someone or their reputation in exchange for something. "
Last year, AMI agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors there who were investigating Trump's payments to women through long-time personal attorney Michael Cohen, who is also cooperating. As part of that agreement, AMI agreed not to commit further crimes, heightening the stakes for the company if it's found to have acted illegally in the Bezos affair.
Federal prosecutors are now investigating whether AMI's dealings with Bezos violated that immunity agreement.

The National Enquirer is only one of AMI's brands, but is its oldest and most iconic.
The Associated Press reported that the National Enquirer's circulation fell 18 percent last year, to 265,000 weekly. But that's just a small fraction of the 2. 3 million circulation AMI claims.
Other publications include lifestyle titles like Men's Journal and Muscle and Fitness. along with celebrity fare like In Touch, Us Weekly and Soap Opera Digest.
Last year, it bought up even more publications to form a near-monopoly of the supermarket aisle. Those included Life & Style, Closer. J-14 and GirlsWorld.
The company is privately owned and not traded publicly, so its financials are closely held. But just last month, the company announced that it refinanced $460 million worth of debt.
For example, Gawker declared bankruptcy in 2016 after former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan sued the online gossip site for invasion of privacy after it published a sex tape. Hogan won a $115 million judgment.
Murdoch, whose media empire includes the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, closed the News of the World in 2011 after multiple newspapers staffers were arrested in the phone hacking scandal. While the newspaper illegally obtained voicemails of athletes, celebrities and thousands of others, it was the hacking of a 13-year-old murder victim that most inflamed the British public.
The Bezos battle is just one of the controversies surrounding the tabloid group:
► The National Enquirer's editor, Dylan Howard, reportedly colluded with movie producer Harvey Weinstein to discredit women accusing Weinstein of sexual harassment and rape.
► In the run-up to the 2016 election, the National Enquirer published a string of dubious stories about Hillary Clinton's health, sex life and involvement in various conspiracies.
► AMI admitted paying a $150,000 to former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal as part of a "catch-and-kill" operation to silence her claims to have had an affair with Trump.
AMI Chairman and CEO David Pecker has close ties to Trump, and the New York Times and the Associated Press have reported that Pecker has used that access to leverage business deals in Saudi Arabia. Bezos said it's the Saudi connection that "seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve. "

Americans need to see Trump's tax returns

Texto completo: Far from a witch hunt or partisan political attack, Democratic congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns are a necessary exercise of legislative oversight responsibility. The president's returns, and those of his businesses, could answer essential questions about his fitness for office, and serve as an invaluable guide to what needs fixing in our tax code. Congress has a duty to pursue both investigations, and do so promptly.
On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee will hold a hearing on a proposal to require presidents and presidential candidates to release their tax returns. But Congress already has the duty and the right to obtain Trump's tax returns. Under a 1924 law enacted in the wake of another administration marked by legal challenges and potential conflicts of interest, the chair of each of three tax-focused committees has the authority to obtain the tax returns of any U.S. citizen, including the president.
Congress should act with urgency because it's likely Trump will resist its efforts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who would ultimately decide on whether to honor a request for Trump's taxes, has been noncommittal, saying only that he "will review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality." That could set up a legal challenge that might last months if not years, perhaps even past the 2020 election.
But voters deserve answers now. Here's why.
The law is broken and now it benefits Trump First, a review of Trump's taxes would highlight defects in our tax laws, as explained in a recent report from our organization. As a billionaire who has apparently paid zero federal income taxes in multiple years, Trump could serve as an illustrative example of how the wealthy are able to avoid paying their fair share and help spur urgently needed reform.
Second, we need to know whether and how much Trump personally gains from the tax policies he promotes and signs into law. We estimate that he and his family could save as much as $22 million from the Trump-GOP tax cuts enacted in 2017. Citizens have a right to know whether their leaders are pursuing policies for their private benefit instead of the public interest.
Another important issue is whether Trump has violated federal law by illegally evading taxes or has shown a disregard for his obligation to pay his fair share by engaging in flagrant tax dodging. Last year, The New York Times published an exhaustive report on "dubious" tax avoidance strategies pursued by Trump's family over the past half-century, including what the newspaper declared to be "instances of outright fraud."
Trump tax returns would reveal foreign ties Contrary to past practice, Trump failed to transfer his assets into a blind trust upon assuming office. Therefore, he has a good idea of how government policies will impact his personal finances. Among the problematic nations he has done business with are Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Trump's tax returns would likely reveal just how deeply involved he is in Russia and with oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin. Charting Trump's Russian connections might shed light on Trump's inexplicable deference to Putin.
Trump's pursuit of a luxury Moscow hotel deal through much of 2016 has been in the news lately as part of special prosecutor Robert Mueller's investigation. But Trump has sought and secured business deals and investments in Russia and with prominent Russians for some time, including all-cash real estate deals that shady businessmen use to hide and launder ill-gotten gains.
Saudi nationals and their agents have similarly been frequent buyers of Trump assets and reliable customers of his businesses, both before and since he became president. Trump has in turn been reluctant to criticize the Saudi kingdom.
Seeking out information to guide policy reform and keeping an eye on the executive branch are central roles of Congress and its committees. Under new leadership, the House Ways and Means Committee should act promptly to obtain Trump's tax returns in order to better identify flaws in our tax system and to judge serious legal and ethical questions confronting our president.

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint.
Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward,"De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."

This power has, for good reason, been exercised sparingly. It helped Congress unravel the Watergate scandal of the 1970s and was used as recently as 2014 by Republican lawmakers.
Congress should act with urgency because it's likely Trump will resist its efforts. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who would ultimately decide on whether to honor a request for Trump's taxes, has been noncommittal, saying only that he "will review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality." That could set up a legal challenge that might last months, if not years, perhaps even past the 2020 election.
But voters deserve answers now, well before the next presidential election. Here's why.
First, a review of Trump's taxes would highlight defects in our tax laws, as explained in a recent report from our organization. As a billionaire who has apparently paid zero federal income taxes in multiple years, Trump could serve as an illustrative example of how the wealthy are able to avoid paying their fair share and help spur urgently needed reform.
Second, we need to know whether and how much Trump gains from the tax policies he promotes and signs into law. We estimate that he and his family could save as much as $22 million from the Trump-GOP tax cuts enacted in 2017. Citizens have a right to know whether their leaders are pursuing policies for their private benefit instead of the public interest.
Another important issue is whether Trump has violated federal law by illegally evading taxes or has shown a disregard for his obligation to pay his fair share by engaging in tax dodging. Last year, The New York Times published an exhaustive report on "dubious" tax avoidance strategies pursued by Trump's family, including what the newspaper declared to be "instances of outright fraud."
The next pressing question is whether Trump's global business interests have compromised the exercise of his official duties.
Contrary to past practice, Trump failed to transfer his assets into a blind trust upon assuming office. Therefore, he has a good idea of how government policies will impact his personal finances. Among the problematic nations he has done business with are Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Trump's tax returns would likely reveal just how deeply involved he is in Russia and with oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin. Charting Trump's Russian connections might shed light on Trump's inexplicable deference to Putin.
Seeking out information to guide policy reform and keeping an eye on the executive branch are central roles of Congress and its committees. Under new leadership, the House Ways and Means Committee should act promptly to obtain Trump's tax returns in order to better identify flaws in our tax system and to judge serious questions confronting our president.

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint. Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward," De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."

By Lisa Friedman
President Trump didn't mention climate change in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, but on Wednesday Democrats worked to make sure the topic was front and center in Congress.
In two separate and simultaneous House committee hearings on global warming, lawmakers testified that climate change is real, happening now and requires urgent action. It was the first hearing the Energy and Commerce Committee had held on global warming in six years; for the Natural Resources Committee it was the first in more than eight years. In both cases, the rooms were packed with spectators.
"It's a breath of fresh air," said Representative Joe Neguse, Democrat of Colorado, who called climate change "the defining issue of our time."
Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, and Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, urged Congress to rein in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change, they said, has already hurt apple growers, farmers and military installations in North Carolina and commercial fisheries, maple syrup producers and ski resorts in the Northeast.
"If you have farmers or fishermen or resort operators or foresters in your communities or your districts, I promise you they are worrying about climate change all the time," Governor Baker said.
Republicans, for the most part, avoided questioning the established science of climate change, focusing primarily on criticizing economic policies put forward by Democrats, like the so-called Green New Deal legislation that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is set to introduce this week. Some others sought to position themselves as bipartisan on the issue.
"Republicans are focused on solutions that prioritize adaptation, innovation and conservation," said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon. "We want America's innovators to develop the next technologies that will improve the environment and create jobs here at home."
The question is whether any climate legislation will have a real shot of passing both chambers of Congress. Joel Clement, a senior fellow with the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group, called the hearings "anti-climactic."
"One gets the sense that this was just the early jockeying for rhetorical space around the most fraught issue of this Congress," Mr. Clement said.

The last five years were the five warmest years on record
By John Schwartz
I've experienced a week of wide-ranging weather. In New Jersey on Thursday, I woke up to 0 degrees Fahrenheit, roughly minus 18 Celsius, for my morning run. By Sunday, it was 50 Fahrenheit and I could grill outside in shorts. Now, I'm in Utah for a reporting trip and it's snowing again.
Occasional bitter cold snaps don't change the fact that the planet is warming over all. NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have announced that 2018 was the fourth-warmest year in the history of accurate measurement, which goes back more than a century. The last five years have been the warmest five years, all part of a trend that is unmistakable, said Gavin A. Schmidt of NASA. "We're no longer talking about a situation where global warming is something in the future," he told me. "It's here. It's now."
The changes are all around us, of course. You can see how your own city fared in 2018 with this feature; about 83 percent of the 3,800 cities measured experienced years that were warmer than normal. Then check out this piece from our colleague Nadja Popovich that shows what's happening to northern lakes that used to reliably freeze in winter.
In other ice news, NASA found a big hole in the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica about two-thirds as big as Manhattan and 1,000 feet tall. It could lead to more rapid melting of the glacier, which is about the size of Florida. Also, glaciers in the Himalayas are melting, with serious future consequences for those who depend on the current levels of melt for their water. (If you missed it, please feast your eyes on Henry Fountain's close look at those issues from the dwindling glaciers of Kazakhstan.)
In Australia, such torrential rainfall and flooding hit Queensland that residents reported snakes and crocodiles in the streets. In Europe, students have been demonstrating over climate issues. And in other news, Kendra Pierre-Louis wrote about what's killing off the sea stars. (Spoiler: Climate change is involved.) It's all part of another busy week at Team Climate.

One thing you can do: Choose winter produce carefully
By Jillian Mock
I always get a little lost in the produce aisle during the winter. A global economy means summertime favorites are always available, but, here in the United States, should I really buy those blueberries shipped in from the Southern Hemisphere if I'm trying to be carbon conscious?
There's a lot more to answering this question than just calculating shipping distance. It turns out that how far away my food was grown matters a lot less than how it was grown and whether it traveled by air. There's usually no sign in the store for these things, but I found a few tricks for picking produce in the winter.
First, just eating a more plant-based diet is a great start. Consuming less meat and dairy and reducing food waste are the two most effective ways to reduce your dietary carbon footprint, said Richard Waite, an associate in the food program at the World Resources Institute. (We'll be covering these topics more in the future.)
When buying off-season produce, be skeptical of anything that's perishable but super fresh, Mr. Waite said. While transportation accounts for only about 6 percent of food-related greenhouse gas emissions globally, not all modes of travel are created equal. Anything that travels by air, like fresh blackberries or asparagus from South America, is going to burn a lot of carbon.
Also avoid fruits and vegetables that were likely to have been grown in a heated greenhouse, said Martin Heller, who studies sustainable food systems at the University of Michigan. For example, if you live in New York and are choosing between a fresh tomato grown in wintry Canada versus one trucked in from Mexico or California, go with the one from southern climes. Even having been shipped farther, those southern tomatoes probably have a smaller footprint than the hothouse variety because it takes a lot of energy to keep a greenhouse warm during the cold months.
Root vegetables, winter squash and hearty greens are all good winter bets, Dr. Heller said. Carrots, potatoes and squash have long shelf lives, so they can sprout up in summer and still hit stores in the winter. And many greens can thrive under covered, unheated greenhouse conditions, growing fresh well into the colder months without the need for carbon-intensive heating.
"Food choice is one of the easiest things for people to change," said Chris Weber, a scientist at the World Wildlife Fund who has studied food shipping miles and climate impacts. "Because when you compare it to something like your transportation choices or home energy use, food is something you choose every day."

James W. Brown never put off pressing business. He arrived in St. Joseph from the Dakota Territory on a Sunday night in February 1880. On Monday, he went looking for a man he intended to kill.
A story in The St. Joseph Daily Gazette recounted it this way under a headline “Brown’s Bullets.”
Brown had come to town to attend his father-in-law’s funeral. However, he sought out James M. Hall, whose real estate business had its offices in the Opera House building. In that office, Brown got off four shots from his Smith & Wesson pistol before having the gun wrested from his hand.
No one got injured, but a bystander, Cullen M. Lincoln, had one shot pass through the crown of the hat he wore.
The quarrel between Brown and Hall has no clear origin and had no fatal resolution. But John Boessenecker saw the incident as one more colorful aspect of an eventful life.
Boessenecker has included a chapter on Brown in his latest book, “Shotguns and Stagecoaches: The Brave Men Who Rode for Wells Fargo in the Wild West.”
An attorney and best-selling author who has focused on western lawmen, Boessenecker said he chose Brown as a topic because of his background as a Pony Express rider and his largely untold story of guarding Wells Fargo shipments and adventures that led him to be known as “Shotgun Jimmy.”
Born in Kentucky and transplanted as a youth to Savannah, Missouri, Brown had turned 21 by the time the Pony Express began in 1860. He mostly fit the bill of an ideal rider, being an expert horseman and willing to risk death.
He drew the assignment of the first section heading west, leaving St. Joseph and riding usually to Seneca, Kansas, before handing off the mochila. He then rode the last relay leg eastward, the mail coming from California.
“His Express career began very early, and it was sort of a natural progression because he rode for Ben Holladay’s Overland Express and had all those adventures and then for Wells Fargo,” Boessenecker said in a telephone interview from San Francisco.
The Pony Express went out of business in 1861. Brown got a new job with Overland Mail & Express Co., out of Atchison, Kansas, serving as a conductor.
In this role, he and other conductors, at various points on the route, sat next to the stage driver and guarded express shipments and passengers to Colorado, through Wyoming and eventually to Salt Lake City.
In April 1862, Brown survived one of the most harrowing attacks on an Overland coach. A band of Native American warriors attacked two westbound coaches, and Brown got shot in the left side of his face, the ball lodging under his left ear.
The paralysis and disfigurement from this wound would plague him the rest of his life.
In 1870, Brown became a shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo, protecting shipments of the company’s treasure. He would later be involved in investigations of numerous thefts, and he cracked a case that led to the conviction of notorious stage robber Frank Clifford.
A gang led by a highwayman named Big Jack Davis attempted to steal a Wells Fargo box during a Nevada stage run. Brown killed Davis with his shotgun but took a bullet in the left leg, keeping him on crutches for months in late 1877.
One newspaper editor described Brown as “a complete walking arsenal.” Brown would die in 1886 at age 47. He is buried in Helena, Montana.
Boessenecker, whose book “Texas Ranger” became a New York Times best-seller, said he got interested in Wells Fargo when his grandmother took him at age 10 to the company museum in San Francisco.
Other books, he said, have addressed the company’s early history, but most took an institutional approach.
“I wanted to know who was on the front boot of the stage and what kind of shotgun they carried and who they shot,” the author said. “I wanted to know who was fighting the bad guys.”

Texto completo: Families of the Sandy Hook school shooting victims have won a series of victories in their defamation suits against the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that would open Mr. Jones's business records to them and compel him to speak under oath.
Ten families are pursuing lawsuits against Mr. Jones over his role in spreading bogus claims about the shooting, including that the victims' families were actors in a plot to confiscate firearms from Americans. The families have endured death threats, stalking and online abuse.
Mr. Jones, a far-right provocateur and the owner of Infowars, a radio show and website on which he sells diet supplements, survivalist gear and gun paraphernalia, has come under growing scrutiny over the past year and has lost access to much of his online audience. Facebook, Twitter, Apple and YouTube have all banned him, and a recent deal for his show to stream on Roku was revoked last month after public outrage.
The suits by the Sandy Hook families have advanced on several fronts in recent weeks.
A Texas judge on Jan. 25 ordered Mr. Jones and representatives of his company to submit to questioning by lawyers for Scarlett Lewis, the mother of Jesse Lewis, one of the 20 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. The Texas judge also granted access to Mr. Jones's relevant business records, and denied his lawyer's motion to keep the records sealed.
In Connecticut, a judge ordered Infowars representatives and business partners to testify, and a ruling is expected as soon as mid-February on the families' request to depose Mr. Jones, and several Infowars "reporters" and associates.
They include Wolfgang Halbig, a former school administrator and Infowars contributor who for years has deluged Newtown officials with open records requests, demanding, among other things, records from the cleanup of "bodily fluids, brain matter, skull fragments and around 45-60 gallons of blood."
Some families of the victims have been subjected to years of harassment from people who have embraced the bogus crisis-actor theory promoted by Mr. Jones.
Robbie and Alissa Parker's eldest daughter, 6-year-old Emilie, died in the Dec. 14, 2012 shooting that killed six adults as well as the 20 first graders.
In October 2016 in Seattle, Mr. Parker was walking to meet his family at a hotel, he said, when a middle-age man, dressed in khakis and a sport coat, approached him. The man, Mr. Parker said, asked if he had lost a child at Sandy Hook.
"Yes, my daughter," Mr. Parker responded, offering his hand. The man ignored it, and instead spewed obscenities at him, Mr. Parker said.
The man trailed him, "jabbering in my ear," Mr. Parker recalled in an interview, as he walked for blocks, trying to put distance between the harasser and his family.
"It was absolute venom," said Mr. Parker, who is a plaintiff in one of three defamation suits against Mr. Jones. "He was absolutely disgusted with the person that he believed that I was."
Mr. Jones did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyer, Marc Randazza, acknowledged the series of decisions in favor of the families, but said, "If you're keeping score here, this is just the coin toss."
Mr. Jones's role in spreading baseless conspiracies about the families began within days of the shooting.
The night after the shooting, Mr. Parker had agreed to meet a news crew in front of a Newtown church to share a statement about Emilie. Surprised to find a sea of waiting reporters and cameras, he gasped out a nervous laugh before stepping forward to speak.
"This world is a better place because she has been in it," he said, his voice cracking.
The footage ricocheted among conspiracy theorists, and Mr. Jones seized on it. "He's laughing, and then he goes over and starts basically breaking down and crying," Mr. Jones told his followers, according to court documents. "This needs to be investigated. They're clearly using this to go after our guns."
On another show, Mr. Jones mocked Mr. Parker's emotions as "method acting."
Mr. Randazza said the issue was not one of taste but of Mr. Jones's First Amendment rights.
"If we're going to reset the rules about what you're allowed to say, then let's reset them for everyone," Mr. Randazza said. "And I don't think anybody would be happy with that."
Mr. Jones, once an obscure radio personality, gained national visibility in 2015, when Donald J. Trump appeared on his show as a presidential candidate, praising his "amazing" reputation. Mr. Jones has invited a number of Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists on his show, shared video footage and some families' photos and personal information.
Mr. Trump has echoed Mr. Jones's claims that establishment media companies have conspired to silence conservative voices online, and in November, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, used a misleading Infowars video to bolster the administration's claims that a CNN reporter had manhandled a White House aide.
As the lawsuits inch toward trial, Mr. Jones is fighting to shield his records and himself. Last week the Connecticut Supreme Court rejected his appeal, letting stand the lower court's ruling granting access to his records. Also last week, Mr. Jones's lawyers and Mr. Halbig, who is representing himself, filed a request to change the location of an eventual jury trial from Fairfield County, which encompasses Newtown, to a Connecticut county more distant from the scene of the shooting.
The families are asserting that the case is about preventing harmful falsehoods from proliferating in the "post-truth" ecosystem of the internet.
"This was not journalism. It was marketing; Jones used these lies to sell his Infowars brand products for profit," the families' Connecticut lawyers wrote in court documents. The families are represented by Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder in Connecticut, and by Farrar & Ball in Texas.
Though Infowars and its affiliates are private and do not report financial results, a New York Times investigation last year found that in 2014 Infowars' revenue was more than $20 million a year, according to testimony Mr. Jones provided in an unrelated court case. Mr. Jones recently claimed revenue of up to $50 million, saying on his show that it "all goes to lawyers."
Last week, the police arrested a man suspected of stalking Emilie Parker's family sporadically for years, sending letters that terrified them, because they realized he knew where they lived.
Authorities said the man, Kevin Purfield, 51, of Portland, Ore., was arrested on stalking charges after he repeatedly called and wrote the editor of The Oregonian, asserting that its reporting on Sandy Hook and other mass shootings was false, because they never happened. Mr. Purfield was imprisoned in 2013 for harassing victims' families after the 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. When his probation ended, he resumed harassing the Parkers, Mr. Parker said.
Mr. Parker and his family joined the legal effort against Mr. Jones only after speaking with a family whose daughter died in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla., last year.
"The mom said, 'My husband did a media interview, and now he just gets attacked online by all these conspiracy theorists,"' Mr. Parker said.
"I thought, 'These people aren't going away,"' he said. "'It's time for us to see what we can do about it."'

Texto completo: Of all the millions of people who have spit into a plastic vial and sent their DNA off to have it analyzed, writer Dani Shapiro might be the most prepared for what happened next.
The core of Shapiro’s work — this bestselling author has written 10 books — has always concerned family issues, those tangled emotional webs we weave around each other and the secrets we keep.
“It has been a huge part of what formed me as a writer — I had an obsession with searching and digging, trying to understand,” Shapiro says, noting that half of her books are memoirs about deep, personal exploration. “I idly wondered why (I kept writing memoirs) but those were the books that continued to present themselves to me as necessary. And that comes very much out of not knowing something and writing in order to try to know.”
Part of what she didn’t know was why, with her fair hair and blue eyes, she barely resembled her parents, both Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe — an otherness remarked upon by people throughout her life.
All is revealed when the results of an Ancestry.com test that she took “on a whim” come back: She is not her beloved father’s biological daughter after all, but the product of artificial insemination her parents turned to when they could not conceive. Why that happened and what meaning Shapiro makes of it is the subject of her riveting new memoir, “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love.”
“This discovery poured gasoline over everything I thought I knew and threw a match on it,” she says. “Now I see the whole picture.”
Since its release in January, the book has quickly risen to the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and has already been optioned by Hollywood, a clear indication that both her writing and the topic of family secrets is speaking to the hearts of millions.
“I certainly wanted it to resonate with people who had been through similar experiences or discovered there were family secrets —everybody seems to have them,” said Shapiro in a phone interview while she was on the road for her national book tour that lands in Southern California for several appearances this week.
“Adoptees, people who discover they were donor conceived, or have half siblings — there are so many of those kinds of secrets tumbling out of the closet right now,” she observes.
More like an avalanche.
She notes that in 2018 alone 7 million Ancestry.com kits were purchased — and that doesn’t take into account what might be sold for other commercial DNA services like 23andMe. (DNA kits were the No. 1 holiday gift last year, too.) Shapiro discovered while researching “Inheritance” that out of the 7 million kits, 14 percent revealed what’s known in that industry as ”NPE,” Not Parent Expected: “That’s a huge number of people. Many of them, like me, were just recreational DNA testing.”
The ease and accessibility of these DNA tests herald a historical shift, she believes. “I think this is a moment in our culture when secrets and the impossibility of secrets is reaching a deafening roar,” Shapiro observes. “Paternity, ethnicity — these were secrets people could keep since the beginning of time, and did. And now that is over. I think in a few decades the idea that there ever were these secrets is going to seem like the most ridiculous thing you’d ever heard.”
Yet the exploration she undertakes in this book is even more universal: At the center is the question: How do heredity and history combine to make us who we are?
Says Shapiro: “I was also very aware that I did not only want people that could directly relate to the material to be readers of this book, because I felt I had learned so much in this really sort of harsh and complicated, and ultimately liberating, journey. I learned so much about identity, and family, and what makes a father a father, and about nature and nurture.”
Anyone who knows Shapiro’s work understands that she was close to her father, who died in an accident when she was 23, and distant from her abusive mother. These are themes that have run throughout her work. Reconciling her experience with her biological makeup was the “emotionally challenging” part of her journey to write this book.
“One of the things I had to contend with was the deep suspicion that I was part of my father’s sadness. The man that I tried so hard to make happy. But I don’t think that diminished in any way the love he had for me,” she says. “The irony is my biological parent is the one I felt a deep disconnection from, while my father, who was not my biological parent, was the one to whom I was connected. I think that my mother looked at me for all of our shared life together and found it very challenging because I was her secret. I was a reminder of their infertility; I was not my father’s child and on some very deep animal level, she knew it.”
There’s a moment in “Inheritance” where a friend tells her, “Everyone feels other,” and that she had been the explorer to come back to teach us all something about what that means. “I very much took that to heart,” she says.

Top Mueller prosecutor reveals 2016 meeting between Manafort and Russian national at 'heart' of investigation

Texto completo: One of special counsel Robert Mueller's top prosecutors said this week an August 2016 meeting between former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik, his old associate who the FBI claims has ties to Russian intelligence, is at the "heart" of the federal Russia investigation.

Andrew Weissmann, who the New York Times has dubbed Mueller's "legal pit bull," made the revealing statement to a federal judge in a closed hearing Monday, according to a highly redacted D.C. court transcript released Thursday.

He said the meeting, which reportedly took place at the Grand Havana Room in New York City and was also attended by former Manafort associate Rick Gates, is at “the heart of what the Special Counsel's Office is investigating."

Weissmann further told U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, "This goes to the larger view of what we think is going on, and what we think the motive here is."

It's unclear what transpired during that meeting, but the court filing offers a rare look into what Mueller's team is focusing on in what is widely expected to be the end of the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

Earlier this year, Manafort's attorneys accidentally revealed through botched redactions that their client shared polling data before the election with Kilimnik. The court filing also revealed Manafort had been accused by Mueller of lying about discussing a Ukrainian peace plan with Kilimnik during the 2016 campaign.

Kilimnik, a Russian national, was indicted by Mueller last June on charges of obstruction of justice and tampering with a witness on behalf of Manafort.

Mueller's team believes Manafort breached the terms of his plea deal by making false statements about his interactions with Kilimnik, as well as contacts with members of the Trump administration and a $125,000 loan he received in 2016, according to ABC News. Manafort denies that he intentionally misled investigators.

On Monday, Berman Jackson delayed Manafort's sentencing date in March by a week.

Mueller’s team accused Manafort, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiracy against the U.S., of lying to investigators in November. In September, he pleaded guilty in a second trial in Washington, D.C., to two counts of conspiracy.

Manafort was first convicted in August on eight counts of bank and tax fraud by a jury in Virginia. Sentencing for that case is scheduled for Feb. 8 in Alexandria, Va.

Manafort faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.

Mike Conley rebuffs East-preference rumor: 'I'll play anywhere'

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Memphis point guard Mike Conley rebuffed a widespread rumor that he doesn't want to play in Utah — or anywhere in the Western Conference, for that matter.
Hours before trade deadline Thursday, Conley told reporters at the Grizzlies' shootaround that he doesn't have a preference about which conference he'd like to play in. Reports from respected NBA media members surfaced Wednesday that the 11-year NBA veteran, whom the Jazz are reportedly trying to acquire in a trade before today's 1 p.m. deadline, wanted to head East not West.
Not true, Conley says.
"I’ll play anywhere," Conley said. "I never ran from a conference or any particular place. I don't know where that came from."


ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported on Wednesday's episode of "The Jump Show" that Conley's agent said despite progress the Jazz were making in procuring a trade for the talented veteran that the 31-year-old would rather play in the Eastern Conference.


The New York Times' Marc Stein reported that he'd heard the same thing about Conley.


Conley's agent is his father — Mike Conley, Sr., of BDA Sports Management — but he insisted that that mentality was not from him.
"I never said that," Conley said. "When I saw that on the internet, I just let it go because no reason for me to get between that stuff."
As a courtesy, the Jazz did inform the two main pieces in the rumored Conley trade package — Derrick Favors and Ricky Rubio — that there have been talks but nothing has yet been solidified, Jazz beat writer Eric Woodyard of the Deseret News reported.


The trade deadline is 1 p.m. MST.

Democratic Party politics fuels push to oust Northam

Texto completo: The effort to compel Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to resign should concern us all when it comes to protecting the integrity of our democratic process.
Northam, a Democrat, has been bumbling his way these past few days through a controversy involving a racist photograph printed on a page containing information about him in his 1984 medical school yearbook.
The photograph shows one person in blackface next to someone else wearing the white hood and robe of the Ku Klux Klan. Northam initially apologized for appearing in the picture, but a few days later he denied either was him. However, he admitted to darkening his face while once dressing up as Michael Jackson.
This ignited a firestorm of condemnation from across the country. The pressure for Northam to step down has been building.
It appears, though, that the decision of whether Northam should remain in office will be left to him. A story published Tuesday by USA Today reports that this scandal may not pass constitutional muster if state legislators considered removing him through impeachment.
The wave of fury that has resulted over this repulsive photograph is understandable. Northam has been governor for a year, and constituents are obviously insulted over something so inflammatory.
And Northam has not helped his cause at all with the manner in which he's handled the incident. The optics on this, to say the least, are horrible.
The push to oust him from office, though, raises serious concerns. A story published Sunday by The New York Times highlights the true motivation of Democrats who are leading the charge.
"The refusal by Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, to resign after the revelation of a racist photograph is threatening his party's political fortunes in Virginia, where Democrats are on the brink of consolidating power after a decadelong rise in the once-conservative state," the Times article reported. "With Mr. Northam's turmoil erupting during a legislative session in an election year, Democrats and Republicans said Sunday that his fragile hold on power risked his party's policy ambitions and its aspirations for this fall, when control of both the state's legislative chambers is expected to be bitterly and closely contested."
Should the result of an election be overturned to help one political party obtain more influence? The only people who have a say in this matter are Virginia's voters, and they clearly expressed themselves more than a year ago.
People can argue that they didn't know about this photograph during the 2017 campaign. But this is mitigated by the fact that the graphic appeared several decades ago, and voters have had plenty of time to assess Northam's track record as an elected official on the issue of race relations since then.
If they found nothing questionable in his public comments and/or policies, it's likely that his views have evolved for the better. If they came across something unsavory, they put it aside and voted for him anyway. And if they didn't bother to scrutinize this aspect of his career, it didn't matter enough to them when he was duly elected.
Since 2016, we as a nation have wrestled with how to ensure that our democratic process remains secure from outside influence. Seeing what's at stake, this is a worthwhile conversation for us to have.
The situation occurring now in Virginia presents the same dilemma. Democrats who fear that Northam's problems will curtail their future objectives are ratcheting up the rhetoric in a quest to force him out.
This is unseemly - they must respect the right of voters to elect someone of their choosing.
Unless Northam is proven to have committed a crime or otherwise violated the oath of his office, they shouldn't attempt to replace the voters' wishes with their own. If people believe that Northam needs to go, they'll have to wait another three years to give him the boot.
Virginia played a vital role in giving birth to democracy in our nation. And this constitutional right that we cherish cannot be sacrificed there to the whims of momentary outrage.

Texto completo: "Song of Parkland" follows Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School drama students after the mass shooting. And a "Papillon" remake is available to stream.
What's on TV
SONG OF PARKLAND 7 p.m. on HBO; and available on HBO streaming platforms. This short documentary from the filmmaker Amy Schatz examines what happens to a group of high school students after a tragedy, in this case the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 students and staff members dead. The film follows the drama teacher Melody Herzfeld as she continues to work with her students, rehearsing for a musical production, in the aftermath. Many of those students went on to perform at last year's Tony Awards, surprising the audience with "Seasons of Love" from "Rent," where Herzfeld won the award for excellence in theater education.

SUPERNATURAL 8 p.m. on the CW. During 14 seasons, this dark fantasy series has garnered a dedicated cult following and even an honorary holiday. Now the show, starring Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as the Winchester brothers, is set to hit a big milestone: its 300th episode. If you've never seen the show and 300 seems like a daunting number of episodes to binge, you can catch the tail end of TNT's four-day "Supernatural" marathon, which will show reruns until 1 p.m.
FLORIBAMA SHORE 9 p.m. on MTV. The Season 2 finale of this reality show says goodbye to its rowdy bunch of roommates, who have been sharing a house in Panama City Beach, Fla. After the finale, the "Jersey Shore" star Vinny Guadagnino sits down with cast members to discuss the season, and the drama that didn't make it into the broadcast.
What's Streaming
PAPILLON (2018) on Amazon Prime, Google Play and YouTube. In this remake of the original 1973 film, Charlie Hunnam stars as the French criminal Henri Charrière, whose memoir the story is based on. Serving time for a murder he says he didn't commit in French Guiana, he meets Louis Dega (Rami Malek), a convicted counterfeiter, who agrees to finance Charrière's escape. In her review in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the remake, like the original, "isn't interested in questions of innocence and guilt or jurisprudence." Instead, she added, "it's about tough men toughing it out in tough conditions while laughing -- or stoically staring or occasionally trembling -- in the face of death."
WORLD'S MOST AMAZING DOG on Facebook Watch. Sure, every dog owner believes that his or her pet deserves this title. But this new interactive competition series aims to let the Facebook community decide. Dog owners from around the world submitted videos of their pups sledding, jumping rope or just being adorable, and on Thursday the finalists will be revealed, each competing to take home $100,000. If you're the kind of person who spends way too much time watching cute animal videos at work, this might be the new show for you.

Texto completo: There's a new boss at "60 Minutes."
The signature newsmagazine, which has held down a Sunday night slot for CBS since 1968, named Bill Owens as its executive producer.
Mr. Owens served as the longtime No. 2 to Jeff Fager, who ran the program from 2004 until he was fired in September after having sent a threatening text message to a CBS reporter who was asking about allegations of harassment against him for a segment that ran on "CBS Evening News." Since Mr. Fager's ouster, Mr. Owens has been the interim executive producer of "60 Minutes."
In its announcement, CBS said Mr. Owens would report directly to Susan Zirinsky, the incoming president and senior executive producer of CBS News. That was a telling inclusion. Outside lawyers who conducted a monthslong investigation of sexual harassment at the network last year reported that the separation of the "60 Minutes" staff from the rest of the news division meant that the show was unable to prevent inappropriate conduct by some of its top executives.
The investigation started in August with the purpose of examining allegations involving Leslie Moonves, the former chief executive of the CBS Corporation, as well as the workplace environment at CBS News and "cultural issues at all levels of CBS." Mr. Moonves was ousted in September, and the company's board determined that he had been fired for cause after the investigators' report was filed in December. Another prominent CBS employee, Charlie Rose, a co-anchor of "CBS This Morning" and a correspondent on "60 Minutes," was fired in 2017 after multiple accusations of sexual harassment were made against him. (Mr. Moonves and Mr. Rose have denied the allegations against them.)
In a statement, Ms. Zirinsky praised Mr. Owens, a popular figure among the "60 Minutes" rank and file who got his first experience at CBS as a summer intern in 1988.
"Bill Owens is steeped in the storytelling style audiences have come to expect from '60 Minutes,"' Ms. Zirinsky said. "We are fortunate to be able to put such a talented veteran in charge of this iconic program."
Mr. Owens joined "60 Minutes" in 2003, working with the correspondent Scott Pelley to cover Hurricane Katrina and the genocide in Sudan. After a stint at "CBS Evening News," he rejoined the newsmagazine in 2007 as a senior broadcast producer. In 2008 he was named executive editor.
"To be named the executive producer of '60 Minutes' is an inspiring responsibility and a privilege," Mr. Owens said in a news release. "I am honored to work alongside the best journalists in the business who cover the most important stories from around the world. I promise that will never change."
Mr. Owens is the third executive producer of the newsmagazine in its more than 50-year history. The show has maintained high ratings throughout its time on the air, and remains among the top 10 most-viewed television programs.
Its founder was Don Hewitt, a journalistic legend who led the show for 36 years. But, as The New York Times reported in December, investigators who examined the corporate culture at the network revealed that CBS continued to pay a settlement to a woman who claimed that he had sexually assaulted her on repeated occasions and destroyed her career. The settlement, reached in the 1990s, was amended multiple times, including last year. In total, CBS agreed to pay the former employee more than $5 million.
Ms. Zirinsky, the first woman to lead CBS News, met with "60 Minutes" employees to tell them of the appointment of Mr. Owens on Wednesday afternoon. Shortly afterward, she sent an email to the staff that said, in part, "We are in a new era. As an organization, and as an industry, we are forever changed."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Eleonora Antillón had kept her secret bottled up for more than 30 years.
But when she read an article on social media on Tuesday saying a woman had accused Óscar Arias Sánchez, the former president of Costa Rica, of sexual assault, she did not hesitate: "From personal experience with him," she wrote on the social media platform, "I BELIEVE her!!"
Ms. Antillón is among four women in a 48-hour period to accuse Mr. Arias, 78, of unprovoked and unwanted touching or sexual assault.
The allegations are a serious blow to the legacy of Mr. Arias, who won the Nobel Prize in 1987 for his effort to bring peace to Central America. Twice president of Costa Rica, he has been one of Latin America's most respected figures.
Ms. Antillón, a former talk show host known by her nickname, Nono, said in an interview that Mr. Arias sexually assaulted her in 1986, when he was a presidential candidate and she was a young press aide.
Two former journalists and a book editor came forward after The New York Times and Seminario Universidad published accounts by a psychiatrist at a state hospital in San José, who filed a formal criminal complaint saying that four years ago, Mr. Arias grabbed her and forced his fingers inside her.
"People end up thinking, 'If she dared, others will dare,"' Ms. Antillón said in a telephone interview. "I want to unmask the impostor politician."
Mr. Arias is among the most well-regarded political leaders in Latin America, a senior statesman who used his Nobel winnings to start a foundation that promotes peace and democracy. Now, as the #MeToo movement has reached Costa Rica, he joins a legion of powerful men around the world whose legacies have been tarnished by accusations of sexual assault or harassment.
Prosecutors opened an investigation on Tuesday after the psychiatrist, Alexandra Arce von Herold, 34, gave a formal statement saying that Mr. Arias had sexually accosted her in his home office. She left the country to avoid the scandal and could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
Mr. Arias "categorically" denied the assault allegations, saying he never acted in a way that disrespected the will of any woman.
"In my public life I have promoted gender equality, because I believe that it is an indispensable means to achieve a more just and equitable society for all people," Mr. Arias said in a statement on Tuesday, after Dr. Arce's accusation became public.
His lawyer, Erick Ramos, said the new allegations were not part of the court case opened this week and so Mr. Arias and his legal team would have no comment on them.
Ms. Antillón said Mr. Arias recruited her from her job in television to work as a press aide on his campaign. In one of their earliest meetings, he put his hands on her leg, she said. Another time, he put her hand on his erect penis. When she resisted, he pushed her against a wardrobe and kissed her, she said. She clenched her mouth shut, and he licked her face, Ms. Antillón said.
The episode ended when people outside the office started knocking on the door, apparently in response to the ruckus, she said. "At no moment did I scream," she said. "I did not call for help."
She never told a soul.
Ms. Antillón, now 60, said she completed her three-month contract on the campaign and went back to her regular job. She found herself dressing plainly to not call attention to herself and preferring the company of women, she said. When Mr. Arias returned to public life a decade ago, Ms. Antillón did not want to face him and retired to the countryside.
"I am, I was, almost an Oprah Winfrey in Costa Rica," she said. "I am totally isolated now, practically hidden."
Emma Daly, 53, the communications director of Human Rights Watch, was a 25-year-old reporter for Reuters and The Tico Times when she met Mr. Arias at a crowded event at the InterContinental Hotel in Managua.
"I asked him some question, and instead of answering, he literally ran his hands over my chest and between my breasts and said, 'You're not wearing a bra!"' Ms. Daly said. "I was so stunned that all that I could think of was to say, 'Yes, I am!"'
Although she told her boyfriend and other people when it happened, it never occurred to her to file a complaint against a sitting president, she said.
"I didn't get physically hurt the way other people do," she said. "It was the humiliation of being made to feel you don't matter in any way."
Marta Araya Marroni, a 53-year-old book editor, said she met several times with Mr. Arias as the editor of his 2012 collection of essays and speeches, Con Velas, Timón y Brújula. In one meeting, he suddenly put his hand on her leg. She brushed him off, telling him that he had a girlfriend and the move was inappropriate. She said he then called her twice, insisting that she come over to his house for a massage. Ms. Araya said she finally hung up on him.
"I never kept it a secret. I told everyone," Ms. Araya said. "The only reason I would have to publish this is so that the people believe the women who file complaints. It disgusts me a lot that people always think these are lies."
For Ms. Antillón, although the statute of limitations for sexual assault -- 10 years in Costa Rica -- is long past, she said she would be happy to make a declaration in court.
"I owe it to myself, and I owe it to a lot of women," Ms. Antillón said.

Texto completo: SANTA FE A Santa Fe freelance journalist has been named one of two 2019 recipients of the American Mosaic Journalism Prize, which comes with a $100,000 cash award.
Abe Streep was recognized for his New York Times feature titled “What the Arlee Warriors Were Playing for,” which focused on a high school basketball team from the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana, and “The Last Best Place,” a Harper's magazine feature about a Syrian refugee family, also in Montana.
Streep is a contributing editor at Outside magazine, headquartered in Santa Fe.
The Heising-Simons Foundation, based in Los Altos, Calif., initiated the Mosaic prize in 2018 for freelancers displaying “excellence in long-form, narrative or deep reporting about underrepresented and/or misrepresented groups in the American landscape,” a news release says.
Recipients are chosen by a panel representing major news organizations, universities and freelance journalism. The other winner this year is Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, of New York.
“To be recognized by these judges and to be mentioned in the same breath as Rachel is a profound honor,” Streep said in a statement released by the foundation.
“I am overwhelmed and deeply gratefulfirst and foremost to the Abdullahs (from Syria) and the Arlee community (in Montana) for trusting me to tell these stories.”
The judges said of Streep:
“Abe Streep's reporting bursts with compassion and urgency as he lifts up stories of often-overlooked communities in the American West, such as a Syrian refugee family building a new life in Montana, or a Native American high-school basketball team grappling with a flurry of suicides in its community. With great sensitivity, his work reveals the rich tapestry of cultures and lives that intersect in a part of the country far too often characterized by the stereotypes of an urban-rural divide.”
Streep has also written about the Santa Fe Fuego minor league baseball team for The Atavist in a piece called “The Legends of Last Place: A Season With America's Worst Professional Baseball Team.” He's a contributing writer at The California Sunday Magazine.

Texto completo: The State of the Union? Well, it's a long story.
President Donald Trump's speech Tuesday night, which clocked in at 82 minutes and was the third longest State of the Union address of all time, was of course met with very different reactions depending on political leanings.
For many of his fellow Republicans, it was a bold outline for America. For many Democrats, it was a hypocritical string of misrepresentations.
The gulf between those two reactions is enough to wonder if people were watching the same speech -- or if Americans are living in concurrent, but alternate realities based on their ideologies and sources of information.
[What Maine's congressional delegation thought of Trump's speech]
The president and his aids have a fondness for the phrase "Trump Derangement Syndrome," using it on Twitter to describe those who strongly oppose anything he does, regardless of the substance of that action. Tuesday night emphasized that our entire country -- both the left and the right -- may be suffering from some form of Trump derangement. It almost doesn't matter what he says at this point: If you're a Republican, you stand and cheer, and if you're a Democrat, you shake your head and roll your eyes.
For all the appeals to unity, standing ovations, and slightly awkward "USA" chants in the House chamber Tuesday night, we remain in many ways a divided nation. The president's assertion that "the state of our union is strong" was met by voracious applause from his party but a head shake from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It was a telling moment about the current American political landscape, where we have trouble keeping our government open and can't agree on basic facts.
Trump's speech, which almost didn't happen and for weeks seemed likely to be a casualty of shutdown politics, was objectively well-written and provided an opportunity to stay on script and appear presidential -- an opportunity he largely seized. Trump was able to get Democrats on their feet with appeals for action on potentially unifying issues such as lowering health care costs and drug prices, supporting U.S. workers, investing in infrastructure and providing paid leave.
It's a common move for president's to bring inspiring guests to the State of the Union, highlight their stories and elicit a wave of applause. But Tuesday night still managed some uplifting surprises. Take, for example, the chamber's moving and impromptu birthday song for Holocaust and Pittsburgh synagogue shooting survivor Judah Samet.
The president even made a strong pitch to end "the politics of revenge," imploring Congress and the country to "choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction."
[Fact checking Trump's claims in his State of Union address]
Considered in a vacuum, those statements are spot on. But given Trump's own history of lashing out at political opponents, as he did to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Twitter just hours before Tuesday's polished push for unity, the president isn't exactly an honest broker on that front.
Tuesday's address can be broken down as two distinctly different speeches -- one an overall message of unity delivered at the beginning and end of the evening, and a second more combative interlude in the middle, in which Trump attacked Democrats with a particular emphasis on border security, abortion and presidential nominations.
Adding to this seemingly disjointed approach is a report from the New York Times that the president spent time criticising Democrats and the late Sen. John McCain at a private lunch with TV anchors on Tuesday. The president doesn't seems to have fully embraced his own message of unity.
With another deadline to fund the government quietly but rapidly approaching on Feb. 15, we hope Trump's appeals to cooperation win out over his impulses to attack political opponents.
To borrow from his State of the Union address, it's time we all chose progress over pointless destruction.

Texto completo: After leaving the Dane County Board, I threw my energies into supporting the Urban League's proposed school-district charter school. Madison Prep promised to focus on young men of color with a "no-excuses" philosophy.
The graduating class of a similar school in Chicago came to Madison to lend support. Their dean of students, himself a black man, did not apologize. "I discipline hard," he declared. "But I love harder."
Afterward, the young men toured the UW-Madison campus.
Eight years after the district rebuffed Kaleem Caire's Madison Prep school, discipline is being stigmatized as racist.
Madison teachers are unfairly accused of feeding the "school-to-prison pipeline." F-bombing social justice warriors harass parents who support policing our troubled high schools. They actually shut down the annual budget meeting.
No other candidate has criticized this bullying or supported the police. If parents are intimidated at School Board meetings, imagine the chaos in the classroom!
In January 2018, my opponent Ali Muldrow told an audience at the City-County Building: "I struggled to understand how Madison could be so liberal, and racist enough to discriminate against children at school."
Yes, there is racial disparity in academic achievement. But school resource officers three black men and one Hispanic woman aren't the ones instigating cafeteria brawls. The kids hijacking cars and shooting up the school bus at La Follette High School are not being turned away at the schoolhouse door.
Madison teachers are not racists!
All the counselors in the world won't help if we keep telling those kids they are helpless victims, incapable of determining their future. When a candidate for mayor blames "white supremacy B.S." for her failure to get on the ballot you know the race card is overplayed.
Good teachers like Sherman Middle School's Karen Vieth are quitting in frustration. The district's overall achievement score has declined in the last five years to 58.2 from 63.5 points in 2012-13, according to the Department of Public Instruction. Madison residents are fleeing our schools a net loss of 804 students through the open enrollment program taking with them $5.6 million in state aid.
The 82-page bureaucratic Behavior Education Plan is both symptom and cause.
After four years and $15 million, Madison's public school classrooms are more unruly than ever. Out-of-school suspensions dropped while "behavior incidents" nearly doubled. Why is anyone surprised?
The purpose of the BEP was never to keep order but to jigger the numbers to avoid being sued for discrimination due to "disparate impact." As the Wall Street Journal reported, the Obama administration "demand[ed] racial parity in school discipline, regardless of who was being disruptive, which is as silly as demanding racial parity in police arrests, regardless of who's committing crimes."
The federal Commission on School Safety recently blamed the 2014 directive for an increase in school violence.
According to The New York Times, the commission found that the focus on race over safety has made schools more dangerous, not less. Ali Muldrow should read that report. She wrote Progressive Dane's education platform, which demands:
? Cops out of schools.
? No more student expulsions.
? "An end to zero-tolerance for the use of cell phones and other personal devices."
? "Fund legal services/right to counsel for students facing formal discipline."
Hey kids, lawyer up!
Yes, too many students of color have been traumatized by neglectful or abusive parents. Too many young people have never been read to. Their teachers and the school resource officer may be the only responsible adults they will see that day. Put teachers back in charge of their classrooms for safer schools and a safer community.
CANDIDATE OP/EDS
The Cap Times invited candidates with Feb. 19 primary races to write op/eds making their cases to voters. Today we run op/eds for School Board Seat 4. Seat 5 candidate columns ran last week. Mayoral candidates will be in print Feb. 13. You will be able to find them all, along with City Council candidate columns, at captimes.com over the next few weeks.

Online’s ‘walled gardens’ must stop assuming real news is free

Texto completo: Facebook and Google have been brutal to the news business. But this primarily reflects a failure of imagination. The tech giants are the world’s best distribution platforms and could be an answer for journalism instead of a grave threat.
As readers have shifted to digital sources, the two companies have taken a large majority of online advertising revenue. More important, the platforms now act as "regulators" of the news business — determining what information gets delivered to whom, and when. With the flick of an algorithmic finger, those two companies decide what news you see and whether a publisher lives or dies.
The impact on journalism has been clear. Just within the past week, we have seen over 1,000 planned layoffs at Gannett, BuzzFeed and HuffPost, and no one thinks we are anywhere near the end. Facebook and Google’s answer so far has been to pledge to spend $300 million each over the next three years to help journalism. But that money will be dribbled across a huge news landscape, and much of it will undoubtedly be used to encourage further use of Facebook and Google products.
But such investments amount to charity, and charity will never be the answer. What news publishers really need are active partners who are willing to embrace the idea that quality journalism sustains our civic society and that the answer to bad information is more good information.
We can start with the fact that "free" isn’t a good business model for quality journalism. Facebook and Google flatly refuse to pay for news even though they license many other types of content. Both companies have deals to pay music publishers when copyrighted songs play on their platforms. And the companies also aggressively bid to stream live sports and entertainment content to run on Facebook Watch and YouTube. These deals are varied and often secret, but none of them are based on "free." Why are the platforms so unwilling to pay news publishers for access to the quality journalism that users need and value?
There’s no reason those who produce the news shouldn’t enjoy the same intellectual property protections as songwriters and producers (regulators in Europe are looking at replicating some of these safeguards for journalism).
The tech giants are also run as "walled gardens" that minimize brands and separate publishers from their readers — even while hoarding information about those same readers. Imagine trying to build a trusted relationship with an audience when you can’t even know who they are. Publishers need new economic terms that include more revenue and more information about our readers. Any minor costs to these companies would pay huge dividends not only for our society but also for their credibility with Congress and policymakers around the world.
Facebook and Google also need to be willing to acknowledge investments in quality journalism through their algorithms. They are constantly on the defensive about spreading false and misleading "news" that hurts people. They could start to address the problem by simply recognizing that The Miami Herald is a much better news source than Russian bots or Macedonian teenagers — and highlighting original, quality content accordingly. Recognizing and promoting publishers that have consistently delivered quality news content can’t be that difficult for sophisticated tech companies. And there are a range of qualified independent ratings organizations, such as NewsGuard, that could help them separate the wheat from the chaff.
Whether they like to admit it or not, Facebook and Google are at real risk when it comes to the news business. Under the adage "You break it, you buy it," the platforms now own what happens when quality journalism goes away. A study by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism found that more than 1,300 American communities have completely lost sources of local news.
David Simon, a former newspaper journalist who became a TV writer, lamented the loss of local coverage and said in an interview with The Guardian: "Oh, to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years, before somebody figures out the business model. To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city, as a local politician! It’s got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption."
Facebook and Google could address these risks by embracing responsibilities and becoming partners, rather than minor benefactors, for journalism. They need to come to the table with a real deal on revenue, data and algorithms.
Jonah Peretti of BuzzFeed has talked about digital publishers merging to gain more negotiating leverage over the tech platforms on these issues. Legislation sponsored by Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, would allow news publishers to collectively negotiate with the two companies without violating antitrust rules.
Facebook and Google talk incessantly about how they are improving the world. Why not do something genuinely good for all of us and support journalism instead of destroying it? And it wouldn’t even have to be that hard. There is plenty of money and quality content to go around. All it would take is a little enlightened self-interest and a real commitment to the continued existence of quality news.

Don’t make ‘Medicare for all’ a litmus test

Texto completo: Hear that crunching sound? It’s the eggshells that 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are stomping through, backing up and stomping upon all over again, as they attempt to satisfy the base’s delicate demands for Medicare-for-all.
The left-wing die-hards sometimes argue that supporting Medicare-for-all should be a litmus test for anyone seeking the 2020 nomination because it’s not only good policy but good politics, too. The entrenched establishment may claim it’s a "radical" idea, but surveys suggest it is mainstream.
"If I look at polling and 70 percent of the people support Medicare for All, if a very significant percentage of people think the rich, the very rich, should start paying their fair share of taxes," Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, told The New York Times, "I think I’d be pretty dumb not to develop policies that capture what the American people want."
In a sense, Sanders is right: The phrase "Medicare-for-all" polls favorably (though not always at 70 percent), and has for several years.
Here’s the problem. The things Americans are apparently envisioning when they tell pollsters they support Medicare-for-all turn out to be a different, vaguer and more varied set of ideas than the specific thing that Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, and others in the progressive base are proposing. Sanders, et al. want all Americans enrolled in a single, generous, government-run — or single-payer — plan with no private insurers offering their own similar, competing policies.
How does the public feel about this? If you simply ask, "Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all?," 56 percent of respondents favor it, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll. But mention that Medicare-for-all involves getting rid of private insurance companies, and support plummets to 37 percent.
Wary of provoking the single-payer-or-bust-ers, some Democratic 2020 candidates have given incoherent or noncommittal remarks on the subject. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachussetts, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York have both sidestepped the issue. Asked about private insurance, Warren said last week there were a lot of paths to get to "affordable health care for every American."
And you know what? That’s the right answer right now. The thing Americans want most, if you look at the polling, is not single-payer per se. They want universal, affordable coverage that doesn’t leave them begging on GoFundMe for their kids’ insulin. In that same Kaiser survey, support for "Medicare for All" was highest — 71 percent — when respondents were told it would "guarantee health insurance as a right for all Americans." And purity tests aside, there are many ways to achieve that outcome. Rather than insisting that "there’s no viable path to the Democratic nomination for someone who does not support single-payer health care," as one progressive writer put it, Democrats should start with principles and objectives, and figure out the most effective and feasible route to them.
This is the richest country on Earth. Truly, we can figure this out. But not if we let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

'Rent' returns to Central Valley for quick run

Texto completo: The 20th-anniversary tour of "Rent" — the powerful, sometimes controversial Tony Award-winning musical that first shook audiences in the mid-'90s — begins its two-day run Feb. 6-7 at the William Saroyan Theatre. The musical, which follows a diverse group of seven New York City artists and their daily struggles as members of various marginalized communities, first made waves in 1996. It's loosely based on Giacomo Puccini's opera "La Boheme," which premiered 100 years before the opening of "Rent." This century-later remix includes a handful of characters that are HIV-positive. Several of them are gay or bisexual, one's getting over the suicide of a loved one and many are trying to fight their way out of poverty.
That's heavy stuff, yet there's much more to it than just black clouds. As the New York Times wrote back in '96, "this vigorous tale of a marginal band of artists in Manhattan's East Village ... rushes forward on an electric current of emotion that is anything but morbid."
The musical is the creation of the New York-native composer and playwright Jonathan Larson, who wrote the book, music, and lyrics. Larson died unexpectedly of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 35 the night before the show's first off-Broadway performance. He never got to see the success of "Rent," which earned him three posthumous Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize for Drama, among other honors.
A feature film version of "Rent" was released in 2005 and featured several members of the original Broadway cast. The production ran on Broadway from 1996 to 2008 for more than 5,000 performances — making it the 11th longest-running show in history.
Locally, two Broadway touring shows of "Rent" have stopped at the William Saroyan Theatre over the last 20 years and the Fourth Wall Theatre mounted a production of the musical in 2011.
And on Jan. 27, a live version of "Rent" aired on Fox. Unfortunately, that show failed to impress many critics, with USA TODAY television writer Kelly Lawler writing: "It failed to create the deep, affecting emotion the musical is known for."
The 20th-anniversary revival launched, as you might have guessed, in 2016. It's directed by Evan Ensign based on the original work by Michael Greif, and the original choreographer, costume designer, and music supervisor jumped back in.
In a review of a Rochester, New York performance, Marcia Morphy wrote for Times-Delta/Advance-Register's sister paper the Democrat & Chronicle that the show's rebirth is long overdue.
"Much of 'Rent's' timeless appeal comes from its relatively harsh, unapologetic views of reality," she wrote. "And while it's easy to get swept up in the joy and rowdiness of its rich musical landscape, deep down it's about living life each day as if it were your last."
Because it deals with adult themes, it's not recommended for children younger than 13.
If You Go
What: 20th-anniversary tour of "Rent"
When: 7:30 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, Feb. 6-7

Did you know?
"Rent" ran on Broadway from April 1996 to September 2008 for 5,123 performances.
The musical was loosely based on Puccini's 1896 opera "La Boheme," which debuted in Turin, Italy.
"Rent" was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, winning four, including best musical and best score
Jonathan Larson, who wrote the book and score for the musical, died of a misdiagnosed heart condition the day before the musical's debut. He was 35.
In 1997, Larson was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for drama.
A film version of the musical was released in 2005.

Texto completo: Kristaps Porzingis provided a list of four desired destinations when he requested a trade in a shotgun meeting, but the Knicks had already quietly negotiated a deal after shopping the Latvian for a month.
These details were revealed on Tuesday by the New York Times, before the Knicks lost to the Pistons, 105-92, at the Garden. The report portrayed both Porzingis and the Knicks as ready to move on from one another long before he was officially traded.
According to the story, the Knicks became aware of Porzingis' discontent in the beginning of January - right around the time the Daily News reported his re-signing was not guaranteed because of a desire to play for a winner.
After failing to pry Donovan Mitchell out of Utah, De'Aaron Fox out of Sacramento and Anthony Davis out of New Orleans, the Knicks settled for cap space and two first-round picks from the Mavericks. According to the Times, the Knicks could've pulled the trigger on the trade Wednesday evening, but first wanted to hear from Porzingis in their planned sitdown on Thursday.
The meeting was a mere formality. A source told the News it lasted between two and three minutes. The Knicks wanted to pull the trigger, got the sentiment they expected and quickly the circumstances were leaked to the media. Within an hour of the meeting going public, news circulated that Porzingis was traded. The Knicks' front office, according to a source, did not believe in Porzingis as the franchise star. It had valid reasons, too: the 23-year-old is coming off ACL surgery, struggled to stay on the court previously because of other injuries and faded in the second half of seasons.
But instead of using these concerns to justify the trade, the Knicks wanted to send the message their hands were tied by Porzingis' malcontent and his puppeteer brother. This is from the same team that employed Carmelo Anthony's brand manager, allowed Anthony's agency - CAA - to influence moves, employed Amar'e Stoudemire's security guard and gave J.R. Smith's brother a contract because he was J.R. Smith's brother. Whether or not Porzingis deserved superstar treatment is debatable. But it was hypocritical for the Knicks to accuse him and his brother, Janis, of being too demanding.
According to the Times, Porzingis' list of desirable destinations included the Nets and Clippers. Dallas was not on the list.

Texto completo: Major League Baseball and the Chicago Cubs moved to distance themselves from one of their own Tuesday, after the news outlet Splinter published a cache of racist emails sent and received by Joe Ricketts, the billionaire whose family owns the Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field.
Many of the published emails, sent between 2009 to 2013, focused on a fear of Muslims and contained conspiracy theories about former President Barack Obama. The false assertion that Obama, who identifies as Protestant, was Muslim and born outside the United States were prevalent in right-wing politics during his presidency.
In one email, Ricketts wrote to somebody identified only as S.V. that "Christians and Jews can have a mutual respect for each other to create a civil society," but "Islam cannot do that." He went on to write that, "we cannot ever let Islam become a large part of our society," and that "Muslims are naturally my (our) enemy."
Major League Baseball released a statement condemning the emails but seemingly tried to absolve Ricketts of some responsibility.
"While many of the emails were not written by Mr. Ricketts, the content is extremely offensive and completely at odds with the values and principles of Major League Baseball," the statement said.
In a statement on his website, Ricketts apologized for his emails. "I deeply regret and apologize for some of the exchanges I had in my emails," he wrote. "Sometimes I received emails that I should have condemned. Other times I've said things that don't reflect my value system. I strongly believe that bigoted ideas are wrong."
Tom Ricketts, chairman of the Cubs, denounced his father's emails in a statement and tried to distance the Cubs from him.
"We are aware of the racially insensitive emails in my father's account that were published by an online media outlet," the statement read. "Let me be clear: The language and views expressed in those emails have no place in our society."
Tom Ricketts continued: "My father is not involved with the operation of the Chicago Cubs in any way."
The Cubs are owned through a trust the Ricketts family controls.
Joe Ricketts, who earned his fortune as the founder and chairman of brokerage TD Ameritrade, and his wife Marlene, sold $403 million of stock to finance the purchase.
Ricketts's four children run the Cubs day to day. Tom Ricketts is the chairman; on the board of directors are Pete Ricketts, the Republican governor of Nebraska; Todd Ricketts, finance chairman of the Republican National Committee; and Laura Ricketts, who was a major bundler for the presidential campaigns of Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The Ricketts family purchased a 95 percent stake in the Cubs and Wrigley Field from the Tribune Company in 2009.
In other sports leagues, offensive behavior has led to owners selling their franchises. Donald Sterling was forced to sell the Los Angeles Clippers of the N.B.A. after a tape of him making racist comments became public. Sterling was banned from the league for life.
Jerry Richardson, the owner of the N.F.L.'s Carolina Panthers, announced he would sell his team shortly after a report came out that revealed he had been accused of sexually harassing employees and making racist comments.
In September, the N.B.A. fined Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, for the way he and team officials handled sexual harassment complaints.
For Joe Ricketts, this is not the first time his political activities have harmed the Cubs. He is a major funder of conservative causes and gave $1 million to a political action committee supporting Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.
In 2012, The New York Times reported that Joe Ricketts was considering spending $10 million on a campaign that would attack Obama's connection to Reverend Jeremiah Wright, a former spiritual adviser who Obama denounced during the 2008 presidential campaign. At the same time, the Cubs were asking Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel for $300 million in public money, as part of a $500 million renovation of Wrigley Field and the surrounding area.
Emanuel, who served in the White House as Obama's chief of staff, was reportedly "livid" over the proposed campaign, and stopped talking to Cubs officials about the renovation shortly thereafter. The Ricketts family ultimately financed the renovations privately. Those renovations are ongoing.
In a statement Tuesday, Emanuel condemned the emails. "Joe Ricketts once said that I do not share his values. Truer words were never spoken," he said. "The ignorance and intolerance he has espoused are not welcome in Chicago. I am proud not to share his bigoted opinions. Hate has no home in Chicago."

Texto completo: With Wright State University’s administration and faculty union still at an impasse, a deal that’s eluded both sides for years might not be what actually ends an ongoing strike. But, court action could.
Members of the Wright State chapter of the American Association of University Professors returned to the picket line on Monday in what may already be the state’s longest faculty union strike. Union members have been picketing at the entrances to campus along Colonel Glenn Highway for 15 days now.
“This is not the way that you want to make history in Ohio,” said Randy Gardner, chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education.
Following negotiating sessions last weekend, the strike is poised to go on even longer unless a compromise is made or the university files an injunction in the hopes that a court intervenes. In some cases, colleges have been successful when asking a court to order professors back into the classroom.
When asked Sunday whether she thought ending the strike would require court action, WSU president Cheryl Schrader demurred and instead said she hoped an offer extended to the union last weekend would become a contract.
“Certainly our hope is that tonight we have that opportunity to have that approval from the union membership,” Schrader said. “With that or without that we certainly hope our faculty come and join us in the classroom.”
Court action is a strategy that’s worked in the past though. At Michigan’s Ferris State University last fall and at Central Michigan University in 2011 judges ordered faculty back into the classroom, according to news reports at the time.
Randy Gardner, chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education talks with students at Wright State University on Monday. The university’s faculty union is in its 15th day on strike.

A 29-day faculty strike at Philadelphia’s Temple University in 1990 concluded after a federal judge ordered it to end. In the Temple ruling, a judge ordered professors back to work by arguing that “education is vital to the health, safety and welfare of this nation and this community,” according to an archived story that printed in The New York Times.
Despite precedent, AAUP-WSU president Martin Kich said he does not think the Wright State administration would be successful if it considered filing an injunction.
“They can file whatever they want but I don’t see it having an impact,” Kich said.
When asked if the administration would file for an injunction, spokesman Seth Bauguess said the university was instead focused on working with the State Employment Relations Board on unfair labor practice charges filed last month. Both the administration and the union have filed complaints with SERB that are being investigated.
The administration told SERB the union had its members mislead the university about whether they intended to strike, spread misleading information to students about attending classes and told department chairs they should resign, among other things, according to the university. The AAUP-WSU filed a complaint with SERB saying the board of trustees negotiated in public by telling the media about implementing its terms of employment before telling the union.
There is no statuatory guideline for a timeline on when a complaint has to be investigated, said Christine Dietsch, executive director of SERB.
Last month, the administration asked SERB to declare the faculty strike unauthorized on the basis of workload and accusations that union members attempted to “intentionally sabotage” classes from continuing. After an emergency hearing, SERB issued a decision that the AAUP-WSU strike was lawful and allowed to continue.
That ruling, Kich said, would foreshadow the fate of an injunction if the administration sought to have a court intervene.
The latest attempt to reach a deal to end the strike failed Sunday after the board of trustees approved a contract offer that union leaders quickly rejected. Kich called the board’s action “a stunt” and said the AAUP-WSU would not bring the offer up for a vote because it didn’t represent a tentative agreement.
Health care remains the central issue on the negotiating table.
The terms of employment imposed by the Wright State board of trustees on Jan. 4 state that health care can be changed at the university’s discretion. The administration must give 60-days notice to the faculty union before health benefits are altered, according to the terms.
But, AAUP-WSU leaders have long said that agreeing to the administration’s terms for health care would eliminate their right to bargaining for health benefits.
Gov. Mike DeWine and Gardner have been closely monitoring the Wright State strike.
Student body president Daniel Palmer said he’s asked Gardner if the state could intervene in any way to end the dispute. Gardner was at Wright State Monday to talk directly with students or as he put it “the reason Wright State University exists” in the first place.
“I don’t believe that there’s anything immediately in terms of the statutory authority or constitutional authority that we can do…But, we’re going to roll up our sleeves and do what’s right for students,” Gardner said.

Federal prosecutors subpoena Trump's inaugural committee

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Federal prosecutors in New York issued a subpoena Monday seeking documents from Donald Trump's inaugural committee, furthering a federal inquiry into a fund that has faced mounting scrutiny into how it raised and spent its money.
Inaugural committee spokeswoman Kristin Celauro told The Associated Press that the committee had received the subpoena and was still reviewing it.
"It is our intention to cooperate with the inquiry," she said.
A second spokesman, Owen Blicksilver, declined to answer questions about which documents prosecutors requested. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, which issued the subpoena, declined to comment.
The investigation is the latest in a series of criminal inquiries into Trump's campaign and presidency. Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia and whether the president obstructed the investigation. In a separate case in New York, prosecutors say Trump directed his personal lawyer Michael Cohen to make illegal hush-money payments to two women as a way to quash potential sex scandals during the campaign.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a copy of the subpoena, reported that prosecutors asked for "all documents" related to the committee's donors and vendors, as well as records relating to "benefits" donors received after making contributions.
The newspaper reported late last year that federal prosecutors are investigating whether committee donors made contributions in exchange for political favors— a potential violation of federal corruption laws. It said the inquiry also was focused on whether the inauguration misspent the $107 million it raised to stage events celebrating Trump's inauguration.
The subpoena also requested documents relating to donations "made by or on behalf of foreign nationals, including but not limited to any communications regarding or relating to the possibility of donations by foreign nationals," the Journal reported.
The New York Times reported late last year that federal prosecutors are examining whether anyone from Qatar, Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee. Foreign contributions to inaugural funds and PACs are prohibited under federal law.
The head of the inaugural committee, Tom Barrack, confirmed to The Associated Press that he was questioned by Mueller in 2017. He told the AP he was not a target of the Mueller investigation.

The rise of the disrupters

Texto completo: Howard Schultz, the former head of Starbucks, and Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, could seriously disrupt the political landscape if they decide to run for president next year. And for anti-Trumpers, the choice is clear: Encourage Hogan to get in, and tell Schultz to get lost.
Hogan, a highly popular Republican in a deep blue state, is contemplating a challenge to President Trump in the Republican primaries, and history teaches a powerful lesson. Over the last 50 years, four incumbent presidents have faced severe primary opposition, and the internecine warfare left every one of them mortally wounded.
Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George Bush 41 in 1992 were all defeated for re-election. In March 1968, Sen. Gene McCarthy won 42 percent of the vote against President Johnson in New Hampshire’s Democratic primary, and a few weeks later, Johnson ended his campaign. In 2016, Bernie Sanders badly damaged Hillary Clinton by refusing to concede defeat until July and instigating his followers to distrust the nominating process and disdain the Democratic nominee. Academic analysts estimate that between 6 and 12 percent of Sanders voters backed Trump, enough to swing three states that provided the president’s margin of victory — Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Schultz is threatening to run as a third-party "centrist independent," and his vast wealth plus a vow to qualify in all 50 states is causing nasty flashbacks for Democrats. The virtually unanimous reaction among party leaders was expressed by Washington state chairman Tina Podlodowski: "I have just two words for Howard Schultz on a potential run for president as an independent. Just. Don’t."
Democrats bitterly recall that Ralph Nader received about 97,000 votes in Florida in 2000, while George Bush 43 beat Al Gore in that state — and clinched the presidency — by a mere 537 votes.
Democrats also resent two other insurgent candidates, libertarian Gary Johnson and green party nominee Jill Stein, who together won about 6 million votes in 2016. "A small but still significant number of left-wing voters may well have thrown the election to Trump," wrote Hillary Clinton.
Of course, the Clintons also profited from a third-party candidate in 1992, when Ross Perot garnered 19 percent of the vote and helped Hillary’s husband Bill defeat Bush 41 while winning only 43 percent.
All this talk of primary and third-party challenges is turbocharged by the elections last fall and the recent government shutdown that devastated Trump’s standing. Suddenly, the president seems more vulnerable than ever, and The New York Times reports that Trump advisers are "growing anxious that he could face a draining primary" next year. Moreover, "they are pessimistic about his path to 270 electoral votes after his party’s midterm defeats" in key Midwestern states.
Trump’s core supporters remain fervently loyal, but they account for roughly one-third of the electorate, not nearly enough to guarantee him a second term. A new Washington Post/ABC poll finds that only 28 percent of all voters say they will "definitely" support the president for re-election, with another 14 percent saying they are possible Trump voters. A clear majority of 56 percent say they will "definitely not vote for him."
Trump’s approval rating stands at 37 percent, down 4 points from October, and only 1 point above his career low. Over his first two years in office, Trump’s average favorable score stands at 38 percent, by far the lowest of any of the 12 presidents who have served since modern polling began after World War II. This dismal showing is fueled mainly by women, with only 27 percent liking the president these days, down 9 points since November.
The government shutdown hurt the president badly. In an AP survey, 60 percent placed a "great deal" of the blame on his shoulders, while only about one-third said building a wall on the Southern border would make the country "safer." That episode exacerbated doubts that already existed about Trump’s personality. Only 35 percent in the ABC/Post survey trust him to "make the rights decisions" for the country, about the same number that finds him "honest and trustworthy."
Trump is in serious trouble, and the forthcoming report from special counsel Robert Mueller is likely to ignite even more political turmoil. Hogan and Schultz are only the first of many disrupters who will take a turn in the spotlight and make the next 21 months one of the most volatile and unpredictable periods in recent political history.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Leading congressional Republicans demanded Monday that an internal government watchdog who had issued a critical report related to President Donald Trump's luxury hotel in Washington produce reams of documents to support her conclusions.
The letter, to the General Services Administration's inspector general, was a clear signal that Trump's allies in Congress plan to aggressively defend his business dealings as his company comes under increasing scrutiny by House Democrats and others.
The letter was penned by Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee.
It centered on a Jan. 16 report by inspector general Carol Ochoa criticizing the government's decision-making that allowed Trump to keep the lease on the Trump International Hotel downtown, which is in a building owned by the GSA.
The report charged that the GSA "ignored" concerns that Trump's lease of a government-owned building might violate the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bars presidents from taking payments from foreign governments or individual U.S. states.
Johnson and Jordan suggested that Ochoa's office may have overstepped its bounds by studying whether the government had ignored the Constitution in reviewing Trump's lease.
They also questioned why Ochoa's office failed to cite Justice Department arguments on the matter.
Iraqi president hits back at Trump over U.S. army presence
BAGHDAD - Iraq's president hit back at Donald Trump on Monday for saying U.S. troops should stay in Iraq to keep an eye on neighboring Iran, saying the U.S. leader did not ask for Iraq's permission to do so.
"We find these comments strange," said Barham Salih, speaking at a forum in Baghdad.
Trump has angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by arguing he would keep U.S. troops in Iraq and use it as a base to strike Islamic State group targets inside Syria as needed.
In an interview with CBS News' "Face the Nation," he said U.S. troops in Iraq were also needed to monitor Iran.
"He didn't ask Iraq about this," Salih said Monday. He said the Iraqi Constitution forbids the use of Iraq as a base to threaten the interests or security of neighboring countries.
Afghan government frozen out of peace talks with the Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan - Taliban representatives and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's political rivals plan to discuss the future of Afghanistan on Tuesday in Moscow, a move seen by some as a further blow to the authority of the country's current administration.
The two-day meeting brings key Afghan power brokers together with the insurgents to discuss ending the war that began in late 2001.
The Moscow talks follow a series of direct negotiations between Taliban members and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad amid a renewed push by President Donald Trump to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.
Ghani's government was excluded from all of those meetings because of the Taliban's objection to an administration it regards as a U.S. puppet.
U.S. calls for repatriation of foreign fighters held in Syria
BEIRUT - The United States on Monday called on other nations to repatriate and prosecute their citizens who traveled to Syria to fight with the Islamic State group and who are now being held by Washington's partners in the region.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces say they have detained more than 900 foreign fighters during their U.S.-backed campaign against the Islamic State group in northeastern Syria, where they are currently battling the extremists.
The question of what to do with the detained foreigners has grown increasingly thorny since President Donald Trump's surprise announcement in December that he intends to withdraw all American forces from the country.
Very few countries have expressed readiness to repatriate their citizens.
Prosecutors subpoena Trump inaugural papers
NEW YORK - Federal prosecutors in New York have issued a subpoena seeking documents from Donald Trump's inaugural committee.
A spokeswoman says the committee intends to cooperate with the inquiry and was reviewing it.
The Wall Street Journal reported last year that federal prosecutors are investigating whether inaugural committee donors made contributions in exchange for political favors.
The newspaper said the inquiry also was focused on whether the inauguration misspent money it raised to stage inaugural events.
The New York Times reported recently that federal prosecutors are examining whether anyone from Qatar, Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee.
Judge: Victims of shooting at church can sue gun retailer
SAN ANTONIO - A judge has ruled that victims of a mass shooting at a Texas church can move forward with a lawsuit against a sporting goods chain where the gunman bought the weapon and ammunition used in the massacre.
The decision Monday by state District Judge Karen Pozza clears the way for families of the 2017 Sutherland Springs shooting to potentially bring their case against Academy Sport & Outdoors before a jury.
The retailer is where gunman Devin Kelley bought an assault-style rifle used in the church shooting that killed more than two dozen people.
Some families have also separately sued the U.S. Air Force over failing to report Kelley's past crimes to a federal database. Kelley was an Air Force veteran who was discharged in 2014 for bad conduct.
Nomination: President Donald Trump says he's nominating a Washington veteran with lobbying ties to U.S. energy companies to lead the Interior Department.
David Bernhardt, currently Interior's acting head, would replace Ryan Zinke - who resigned in December - if the Senate approves his nomination.
Manfort sentencing: Paul Manafort has a new sentencing date. A federal judge Monday set a March 13 sentencing for the former Trump campaign chairman on two felony charges stemming from witness tampering and crimes related to his Ukrainian work. Manafort faces up to five years in prison on each charge.
Caption: Investigators enter a home in Yorba Linda, Calif., on Monday, a day after a piece of airplane wreckage pierced the roof. A small plane broke apart Sunday, raining debris and igniting a fire in a separate house that killed four people inside. The pilot also died.

States' new abortion laws illustrate the banality of evil

Texto completo: C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: "The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks."
Lewis, perhaps, couldn't have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion of a baby who could live outside the womb would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York's passage of the absurdly named Reproductive Health Act.
Upon signing the bill, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims - and the birth of a baby girl.
What a weird, wicked world we live in.
Last Monday in Virginia, Delegate Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors' approval for such a procedure. The bill, subsequently tabled, would've required only one's. It was hardly the stuff of "infanticide," a word that began tumbling from certain critics' lips, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn't helpful. Two days before his yearbook scandal broke, he talked during a radio interview about making distressed newborns "comfortable" while the family decides whether to resuscitate.
Just maybe we're not very good at talking about the unspeakable.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court actually made Roe stronger.
Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby's viability was set at 24 to 28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.
In New York, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy. Most Americans oppose such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.
Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Bill Clinton's 1996 call for making abortion "safe, legal and rare," but had hoped we'd seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They've also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.
Are they afraid that someone may change her mind?
My own thinking about abortion was partly formed by having almost witnessed a "back-alley abortion" when a college friend sought an abortion in 1970 in Spain. We walked into a room with a linoleum table over which, not kidding, a single lightbulb hung. We bolted, called home for money and put her on a plane to London for a legal abortion.
No one wants women to be subjected to such last resorts. But nor should we be celebrating laws that ignore the humanity of an unborn child. While only four doctors in the U.S. perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, "no one gets an abortion on the delivery table," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.
It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators' new efforts are aimed at undoing their pro-life counterparts' state-level "victories" - even, apparently, if it means putting women's lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions, as the New York law does.
But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we've come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality - whether the developing human baby is a "clump of cells," a "fetus" or, even, a "product of termination" - we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Here are the guests Southern California lawmakers are bringing to State of the Union address

Texto completo: Think of it as the Oscars red carpet, State of the Union style.
But instead of outfits and hairdos, the focus is on who members of Congress are bringing as guests to the annual speech from the president about how America is doing. Often, the choice of guest is – much like the speech itself – a political statement, one meant to show approval or scorn of a president’s policies.
This year’s State of the Union guests from the Democrat-heavy California delegation include a woman who lost her home to a wildfire and her income to last month’s federal government shutdown, President Donald Trump’s former housekeeper, and undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.
Here are some of the guests who will be in the gallery when Trump speaks Tuesday, Feb. 5.
Victims of fire, shutdown, or both
Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, guest of Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, is a wife of a Navy veteran and a mother of three. In 2017, her family was displaced by the Thomas Fire, which destroyed their Ventura home.
They moved to a rental property in Camarillo, which they had to evacuate in 2018 when rains threatened to cause flooding and mudslides in burn areas from that year’s Woolsey and Hill fires.
So far this year, Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic control specialist, has been forced to work without a paycheck when the government shut down for 35 days over a dispute between Trump and congressional Democrats over the president’s demand for a border wall.
She won’t be the only air traffic controller affected by the shutdown to attend Trump’s speech. Shyan-Lasater-Bailey of Moreno Valley, who works at Palm Springs International Airport, will be the guest of Rep. Mark Takano, D-Riverside.
Coast Guard members also worked without pay during the shutdown. To bring attention to their struggles, Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragan, D-San Pedro, is inviting retired Coast Guard Capt. Charlene Downey.
Trump’s former housekeeper
A Costa Rica native and the guest of Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Los Angeles, Sandra Diaz worked as a housekeeper at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., from 2010 to 2013.
Now a U.S. citizen, the New York Times reported that Diaz was an undocumented immigrant at the time that she worked for Trump, and her supervisors were aware of her status. “She said she washed and ironed Mr. Trump’s white boxers, golf shirts and khaki trousers, as well as his sheets and towels,” the Times article read.
“It’s no small feat for a migrant from Costa Rica to stand up to a bully and hypocrite in the White House,” Gomez said in a news release.
“She is living proof that President Trump couldn’t be more wrong – both morally and factually – when he demonizes those who come to America seeking a better life.”
Opioid crisis
The guest of Rep. Judy Chu, D-Pasadena, Ryan Hampton became addicted to opioids 15 years ago during treatment for an injury, said Ben Surato, a Chu spokesman.
Since then, Hampton has stopped using heroin and written a book about the opioid crisis, “American Fix: Inside the Opioid Addiction Crisis and How to End It.”
“He was able to get treatment, only to see his friend die in a sober-living facility due to lack of training and resources,” Surato. “After that, he reached out to Rep. Chu … That meeting resulted in … the Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act which was ultimately included in the opioids package signed into law last year.”
Tuesday, an op-ed by Hampton, who once worked in the Clinton White House, will run in USA Today “about how pharmaceutical companies and domestic policies are driving the opioid crisis, not the (border) wall,” Surato added.
Feb. 2, 2019 marked Hampton’s fourth sober anniversary.
DREAMers
For several lawmakers, their State of the Union guest will be a DREAMer, an undocumented immigrant who was brought to the United States as a child. The residency status of most DREAMers has been in limbo since the president announced plans to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that shields DREAMers from deportation.
Rep. Lou Correa, D-Santa Ana, is bringing a former DREAMer, Marco Villada, who last year became trapped in Mexico (he previously had received State Department permission to leave the U.S.) while attempting to change his residency status after marrying his husband. He has since returned to the United States.
Other DREAMers accompanying members of Congress to the State of the Union include Lucero Sanchez, who attends UC San Diego and is the guest of Rep. Mike Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano, and Miriam Tellez, a Cal State Fullerton student and the guest of Rep. Gil Cisneros, D-Yorba Linda.

Does Beto still have lightning in his bottle?

Texto completo: On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will deliver his State of the Union address, Gov. Greg Abbott will deliver his State of the State speech, and Beto O’Rourke will reveal his current state of mind to Oprah Winfrey in an interview in New York’s Times Square.
When it airs, in the weeks that follow on the Oprah Winfrey Network (Feb. 16, 8 p.m.) and in a podcast (Feb. 27) as one of “Oprah’s Super Soulful Conversations,” O’Rourke’s interview will be the most public appearance of the former congressman from El Paso since he somehow barreled out of a losing campaign for the U.S. Senate last November into what post-election polls indicated was the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 alongside old-shoe septuagenarians Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
In the interim, O’Rourke has done some solo roaming in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico. He talked to folks at bars, cafes, museums and classrooms about their lives and the future of the country, obliquely looking for an answer about whether he should run for president, but without the self-defeating clamor and crush of media
that would have inevitably ensued if he had done it in more of a public way than he did.
And then, as is his wont — he does have a literature degree from Columbia University — he wrote about the travels and posted it on social media, in this case on Medium, to the mockery of some who considered his earnest quest an act of white privilege or emo self-indulgence or Kerouacian quackery. But he seemed to find what he was looking for, a reason to run for president if that’s what he wanted.
“Over the course of the trip I’d gone from thinking about myself and how stuck I was, to being moved by the people I’d met,” he wrote in his last dispatch from Taos Pueblo in New Mexico. “Forgot myself in being with others.”
One could imagine him repeating those words to Oprah, or to the American people.
Heading into the 2020 election cycle, Beto O’Rourke is at 46, in the description of Bethany Albertson, a University of Texas political psychologist, the “lurking front-runner.”
It is not an outrageous claim.
The New York Times has called him the “wild card” of the Democratic race.
“Beto O’Rourke Weighs Presidential Campaign From an Unusual Position: Front-Runner,” read the headline on Wednesday’s Wall Street Journal story.
The story included a telling detail: “New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, during her first swing through Iowa as a presidential candidate, told a private dinner of state lawmakers that Mr. O’Rourke was selfish for not sharing any of his 2018 fundraising haul with down-ballot Democrats, according to two people in attendance. An aide to Ms. Gillibrand disputed the characterization of the conversation.”
Yesterday’s flavor?
These past weeks have been treacherous ones for O’Rourke, accustomed to the adoration of Democrats everywhere during his sometimes ecstatic run against U.S. Sen. Ted. Cruz, R-Texas. As his political persona went from electric to acoustic on Nov. 6, a growing din could be heard from partisans of a gathering field of rival Democrats keen to remind party activists that before he was last year’s sensation, O’Rourke was a relatively obscure middle-of-the-road congressman, who, until Donald Trump reset the bar, had no claim to being ready to be president, a threshold no one thought he needed to meet when he was challenging Cruz.
Then there was a much-cited mid-January interview with The Washington Post on his home turf, in which O’Rourke seemed to lack answers about the border — the border he waxed so eloquently about during the campaign: “When it comes to many of the biggest policy issues facing the country today, O’Rourke’s default stance is to call for a debate — even on issues related to the border and immigration, which he has heavily emphasized in videos posted to Facebook and Instagram over the past month.”
A few days later, in a front-page story in The New York Times, some Texas Democrats expressed frustration with O’Rourke for not backing Gina Ortiz Jones in her razor-thin loss in November, to U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Helotes, out of his friendship for Hurd, whose cross-country March 2017 road trip with O’Rourke had really been the test run for the social media acumen and post-partisan élan that defined his Senate campaign.
“Politics is about timing and showing up,” said Texas political strategist Mark McKinnon, the co-creator, co-producer and one of the on-air ringmasters of “The Circus,” Showtime’s ongoing, real-time political documentary series. “The question for Beto is whether there is still lightning in his bottle.”
“The national media and Democrats’ love affair with Beto is already starting to turn,” McKinnon said. “Running for president is an acid bath that makes running for the Senate seem like a soothing sauna. Beto still has a lot of juice. And so he’s got be thinking, ‘If I don’t use it, do I lose it?’”
In the “viciously quick” start of the 2020 nominating process, “it is stunning how quickly you can become yesterday’s flavor,” observed Daron Shaw, a UT government professor.
For O’Rourke, the newfound contention around him might be a measure of his perceived potential.
“The criticism is emerging in part because he is this lurking front-runner, and he’s lurking in a very on-brand way,” Albertson said. “If anybody is surprised by the way O’Rourke is approaching his decision about whether to run for president, they shouldn’t be. This is completely consistent with the way he’s campaigned and the way he’s entered the public dialogue.”
“On a more elemental level, the question he is going to have to face is not ‘why didn’t you give to down-ballot candidates’ or ‘why are you hanging around with Will Hurd,’” Albertson said. “The attack he is going to face is a thin legislative record.”
A light résumé
Barack Obama was in the Senate less than O’Rourke’s six years in the House, when he ran for president, but he had written a remarkable memoir, and he would make history as the first black president.
Julián Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration, who announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12 in the neighborhood where he grew up in San Antonio, also has what would historically be considered a light résumé for a presidential candidate. But O’Rourke’s — with three terms on the El Paso City Council and three terms in Congress — is a lot lighter.
“But Julián Castro isn’t half, or a fourth or a tenth of the campaigner Beto is,” Albertson said.
“Is he waiting too long? I don’t know,” Albertson said of O’Rourke. “I can see it working out just fine.”
“He is completely fine,” agreed Jeff Roe, who ran Cruz’s Senate campaign and his 2016 presidential campaign.
“He doesn’t need to move until the end of the first quarter,” said Roe of O’Rourke. “Every day into April that he hasn’t moved is bad. Oprah saves the first 60 days for him. Let the others punch out a bit and then assess.”
March will come in with a lion for O’Rourke with the premier at South by Southwest of “Running with Beto,” a full-length documentary by Austin filmmaker David Modigliani, whose crew was embedded with O’Rourke for the last year of the campaign — a perfect segue to a sequel.
“Because he’s such a transcendent, once-in-a-generation candidate, he can come in late and be fine,” said Nate Lerner, the Brooklyn political activist who, without ever having met or laid eyes on O’Rourke in person, launched Beto for President, one of two national draft efforts. “If anything, it’s an advantage because he’s throwing everybody for a loop by not letting them in on what he’s doing. I mean, nobody has any idea what Beto’s going to do.”
A losing candidacy
For a losing candidacy, O’Rourke’s 2.6-point loss to Cruz was a stunning success. Eschewing PAC money, he raised more money than any U.S. Senate candidate in history. He built a national following.
But there are Texas campaign professionals, both Democratic and Republican, who believe that O’Rourke missed a real opportunity to actually defeat Cruz.
He was no match for Cruz in debates. He allowed the Cruz campaign to paint him as a far-left, open borders socialist, without real rebuttal. He resisted attacking Cruz, and when he did it was halting and then amateurish. He could have had the finest ad talent in the nation and instead talked into his iPhone. Despite traveling to all 254 counties, the centerpiece of his campaign, he failed to significantly narrow the gap in rural Texas, and he didn’t run the table the way he might have with Hispanic voters on the border and elsewhere.
Still, he ran on his gut and his gifts as a campaigner, and he came very close. So far, he has made no apparent moves to staff up for a national campaign.
“The honest answer is he hasn’t made up his mind whether or not he’s going to run, and I don’t think he would feel right asking people to put their lives on hold to sign up for a journey he hasn’t committed to,” said Bob Moore, former editor of the El Paso Times, who has observed O’Rourke’s political rise.
If he runs, Moore said, one should expect a candidate and a campaign very much in the mold of his Senate run.
“I’ve come to figure that he was the first millennial. He was just way ahead of his time,” Moore said. “He’s used to letting it all hang out there, warts and all. That’s just who he is. There was some of that criticism during the campaign that he was just too authentic and I wish he’d quit being himself for a while. That was the secret of his success and to expect him to back off, I don’t get where that criticism comes from. He is who he is.
“People can project onto you what they want to project,” Moore said. “That was really his whole campaign. He was deliberately vague at times, in part because he didn’t have all the answers, but also because he wanted people to be free in part to sort of project their best hopes onto him, sort of what Obama did in 2007 and 2008.”
Obama echoes?
The similarities between O’Rourke and Obama in their political appeal and approach are obvious.
Throughout this recent interlude, David Axelrod, Obama’s chief strategist and senior adviser, has kept a warm and watchful eye on O’Rourke’s progress, tweeting last week: “Who knows where he will wind up on this presidential race? But it is clear that @BetoORourke is taking the same unconventional-and intriguing-approach as he did in the Texas Senate race that made him a national figure.”
But for those on the left, particularly Sanders’ supporters, who considered the Obama presidency a grave disappointment on policy, O’Rourke threatens to be the inheritor of Obama’s political mantle.
“They see someone who can make centrist bland Democratic policies cool,” Elizabeth Bruenig, a Texan who is an opinion writer for The Washington Post, said on a December edition of the Brooklyn-based left-wing podcast Chapo Trap House.
“I think it’s important for the left to understand that this guy doesn’t share your politics,” Bruenig said.
“Beto’s interesting,” Shaw said. “He’s not quite Obama, but he’s genuinely a little different and a little orthogonal, which is I think why he scares a lot of the more conventional candidates.”
Orthogonal? Sideways to the customary order.
“I think he’s orthogonal to the usual left-right in the Democratic party,” Shaw explained. “All of us are thinking of a Bernie-to-Biden continuum and where do you put Beto on that? That continuum is irrelevant to him.”
Instead of providing a checklist of policy prescription, Shaw said that what O’Rourke is offering is, “Here’s an individual we like and we trust and he tells us what politics is about now.”
In manner and approach, Shaw said, O’Rourke is an especially good fit for the Iowa caucuses that begin the nominating process precisely a year from now.
“Heck, how hard is a 99-county strategy once you’ve done a 254-country strategy,” Shaw said.
Bryce Smith, the 27-year-old Democratic Party chairman in Dallas County, Iowa, who watched O’Rourke’s performance in the Senate race and his ability to bring out new voters, agrees.
“I would equate him to being a kind of new age campaign leader,” said Smith, who owns a bowling alley in Adel, a booming Des Moines suburb. “The things he brought to his Senate campaign, I could see him bringing new twists and new ideas to a national campaign that would change the dynamics not just of the caucus or the primary but the race for president in general.
“He has a good approach,” he said. “I would call it that kind of Midwestern voice of reason that can connect to everyone regardless of race or income or gender and be able to talk to them in common terms but then relate it back to politics. He is willing to find common ground.”
Social media
Shannon McGregor, a University of Utah communication professor who studies the intersection of politics and social media, found that in the first year of the Trump presidency, 87 percent of Trump’s tweets — mostly those that attacked the news media and other perceived enemies — generated news stories.
By contrast, in the first year of his second term only 3 percent of Obama’s tweets generated news stories, “even though we thought of him as the social media president.”
For O’Rourke the medium was Facebook Live, and virtually every event during the Senate campaign, from town halls to folding his laundry and getting his hair cut, was livestreamed.
For the length and breadth of his campaign, O’Rourke and those around him were a constant, natural, intimate presence for a vast audience of supporters.
Even after the campaign ended, a few days after Thanksgiving, McGregor said, “it was something like a couple of hundred thousand people looked at a Facebook Live of him and his wife cooking a chicken dinner.”
“Our research in this area shows that if candidates share a personal story, or family stories, or what could be more intimate than watching your family cook dinner, that it develops this sense that you know who they are, and you have a relationship with them, even though you never come in physical contact with them, and this can increase the likelihood of voting for them. And because that is on these large platforms, that is certainly scalable to a national level if he decides to run for president,” she said.
For all their obvious differences, what Trump and O’Rourke share is an ability to make a direct connection with voters with barely a skeletal staff and almost none of the traditional campaign infrastructure.
All Trump needed was a plane, a place to hold a rally and a cable audience. For O’Rourke, it was an SUV, a room and an iPhone.
Often, for O’Rourke during the campaign, it seemed more about the journey than the destination.
“He loves hearing people’s stories. It gives him oxygen and energy. He just absorbs it and layers it all together into really great messages,” said Cari Marshall, a communications consultant in Austin, who went to see O’Rourke at a small fundraiser at the Austin Motel the day after he announced for the Senate and ended up working as a full-time volunteer for the duration.
“I love that he is doing it his own way. I encourage him to take his time,” she said of his decision on a presidential run.
Whatever happens, she said, “It’s been so nice to get back to the Medium posts and his lovely thought process.”
“I know we can do it,” O’Rourke wrote from Taos Pueblo. “I can’t prove it, but I feel it and hear it and see it in the people I meet and talk with. I saw it all over Texas these last two years, I see it every day in El Paso. It’s in Kansas and Oklahoma. Colorado and New Mexico too. It’s not going to be easy to take the decency and kindness we find in our lives and our communities and apply it to our politics, to all the very real challenges we face. ... But a big part of it has got to be just listening to one another, learning each other’s stories, thinking ‘whatever affects this person, affects me.’ We’re in this together, like it or not. The alternative is to be in this apart, and that would be hell.”
“I don’t know if he’ll run or not. He probably doesn’t know or not,” said Tzatzil LeMair, who works at a cross-cultural advertising agency in Austin and, like Marshall, immersed herself in the Senate campaign as a volunteer and founder of Latinas for Beto.
“Personally, I think it’s a no-brainer,” said LeMair, who is now part of the leadership team at Draft Beto. “It’s not an easy decision, but he might not get another chance. I really hope he runs.”

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a 2020 presidential candidate, rubbed elbows with the Hollywood elite during a pair of fundraising events in Los Angeles on Saturday.

The first event took place under a backyard tent — as it was raining — at the home of David Cooley, the CEO and founder of the Abbey, a gay bar in West Hollywood, according to Variety.

The second event was located at the Beverly Hills home of Jeff Shell, who is the chairman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. A number of industry heavyweights were present at the afternoon reception, including "Empire" creator Lee Daniels, actress Eva Longoria, and several studio leaders.

During Harris' speech at the first event, which was attended by the likes of "Modern Family" star Jesse Tyler Ferguson and former NSYNC singer Lance Bass, she disavowed "identity politics" and President Trump. She told a cheering crowd Trump's actions are “not reflective of our America." Tickets for that event ranged from $200 to $2,700.

Harris is already off to a strong fundraising start. She declared her candidacy on Jan. 21 and raised $1.5 million from 38,000 donors within the first 24 hours.

Harris officially initiated her 2020 campaign last weekend during an event in Oakland, drawing a larger crowd in Oakland last weekend than Obama did more than 10 years ago when he officially entered the presidential race.

Harris has entered a crowded field that also includes Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gilligrand of New York, and Cory Booker of New Jersey; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and Julian Castro, who served as secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department under Obama. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are among the other notable figures weighing a run for the Democratic nomination.

Harris has already secured some early endorsements from the likes of Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and New York Times columnist David Brooks.

Happy Year of the Pig Celebrate with dumplings. Bonus points for fillings made from leftovers.

Texto completo: Chinese New Year festivities kick off tomorrow evening and run through Feb. 15 as celebrants usher in a Year of the Pig. The pig symbolizes wealth, overall, and its chubby face and big ears are signs of good fortune.
Due to my mix of Irish, Italian and what my great-grandmother Mabel referred to as "swamp Yankee" roots, I can make no cultural claims to this holiday other than I dearly love one of its festive foods: dumplings. While dumplings are eaten year-round, I've read in many Chinese cookbooks that when they are wrapped in preparation for and eaten on Chinese New Year's Eve they hold special meaning. Scholars argue over the origins of the word, but according to one theory, the Chinese word for dumpling, jiao zi, means both "exchange" and "midnight hour," so dumplings consumed on this special occasion symbolize the exchange between the old and new year.
I will certainly make a visit to chef Cara Stadler's Bao Boa Dumpling House in Portland at least once before Chinese New Year celebrations wrap up. Stadler and her team are the professionals and her filling combinations - Kung Pao Chicken and Peanut, Seasonal Vegetarian, Bulgogi Beef Habanero Shrimp, and Shiitake, to name just a few that are in the rotation - are as varied as they are delicious.
Still, I want to have my own varied dumpling stash in the freezer because the plain pork ones I buy regularly at Trader Joe's are getting monotonous. Since making dumplings is one of those repetitive culinary tasks where many hands make light work, I hosted a dumpling-making party.
I've held Stone Soup soirees in past winters, when I've drawn neighbors out of their midwinter hibernation with the promise of warm conviviality fueled by soups and breads made strictly from leftovers or stray ingredients attendees happen to have on hand. I employed the same inviting tactics to assemble a dozen of my female friends around the table to make dumplings.
Don't worry if you haven't made dumplings before, the email invitation read, as others who have can easily teach you the technique. I'd supply the wrappers, which can be handmade or found in the freezer section of most Asian grocery stores. I asked each guest to bring 2 cups of dumpling filling. "Bring on the pork fillings, the seafood fillings, the vegetarian fillings! Extra bonus points for using locally sourced ingredients. Extra, extra bonus points if you take this as a challenge to use up leftover bits and bobs of food sitting in your refrigerator."
I pulled some chicken from my own fridge, some local black fermented garlic I'd bought to try and added in white hakurei turnips left over from last week's root vegetable haul to make my first filling. I thawed a pound of shrimp and half a bag of shelled edamame and combined them with some preserved maitake mushrooms a fellow dumpling maker had plucked from the bottom of her oak tree last fall. They formed my backup filling.
The first friend to show up brought a second chicken filling, but hers was flavored with Thai ingredients like lemongrass and fish sauce. Another friend followed with a pan-Asian rice bowl recipe she liked to eat for lunch and contributed 2 cups of it to the party. A third simply sautÃ©ed winter squash, onions and garlic she had sitting around. And a fourth contributed a bag full of spicy braised beef left over from a New York Times recipe she's tried earlier in the week. Two made vegetarian fillings with ingredients bought that morning at the farmers market. We had cooked pork filling, a raw pork filling, and a pork and prawn filling. Together we drank three bottles of bubbly (bringing in the western New Year's tradition, you see) and made over 450 dumplings from our collective leftovers.
I may not be Chinese, but I am fortunate to usher in the 2019 Year of the Pig with a wealth of female friends and a freezer full of waste-not sustainable dumplings.

Trump Jr.'s mystery calls in '16 weren't to his father; Investigators say business associates were on the line

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. ... Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who now chairs the House intelligence committee, were skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to The New York Times, Trump Jr., said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton - or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show Trump Jr. called Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a blocked phone number.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House intelligence committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad," he added Thursday.

Texto completo: Foxconn, the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, said Friday that it was committed to building a factory in Wisconsin after a conversation between the company's chairman and President Trump.
In a statement, the company said it "is moving forward with our planned construction of a Gen 6 fab facility," a type of plant that turns out displays for consumer products.
Foxconn did not say when the conversation between Mr. Trump and Foxconn's chairman, Terry Gou, had taken place or who had initiated it.
Mr. Trump hailed the announcement Friday in a Twitter post, calling it "great news."
The development followed a tumultuous few days in which Foxconn sent mixed signals about its proposed $10 billion facility in Wisconsin -- an investment that Mr. Trump announced in 2017 at a White House event with Mr. Gou.
It was not immediately clear how many manufacturing jobs the company would ultimately create. The project, with a promise of 13,000 jobs, became a focus of political contention in Wisconsin over the $4 billion in tax credits and other inducements that it involved over a 15-year period.
On Wednesday, Louis Woo, the special assistant to Mr. Gou, told Reuters that the company was reconsidering whether it would make advanced TV screens at the site, citing the high cost of making them in the United States.
"In terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S.," Mr. Woo told Reuters. "We can't compete."
The comments took Wisconsin lawmakers by surprise, and prompted concern among local officials that the company might not devote the facility to large-scale production, after all.
After Mr. Woo's initial statement, the company insisted that it was not retreating from its plan to build a factory but was re-evaluating what products would be made there. Mr. Woo later told The New York Times that while the company still planned to hire 13,000 workers, he expected that only 25 percent of them would be focused on manufacturing. "The remainder of our work force will be knowledge workers," he added.
Mr. Woo said that "the global market environment has necessitated a reconsideration of which technology" would be produced in Wisconsin.
The company did not say Friday whether the expected mix of its work force would change after the conversation with the president.
Taking questions from reporters at the State Capitol on Friday, Gov. Tony Evers said he had spoken with Mr. Woo before Friday's announcement and said it was a reiteration of previous commitments, not a shift.
"Their message hasn't changed much recently," said Mr. Evers, a Democrat who took office last month. "But the fact of the matter is, it is different from what the original plan was."
Foxconn last year committed to building a Generation 6 facility. That plan was itself a step back from its original promise to build a Generation 10.5 plant, producing larger screens.
Asked if he still thought Foxconn's investment would produce 13,000 jobs, Mr. Evers said, "It's likely not going to be tomorrow, I'll tell you that." The governor said the state would need to "continually monitor the progress and thinking that goes on" and noted that the state incentives were pegged to specific goals that Foxconn would need to achieve.
Republicans who control Wisconsin's Legislature welcomed the president's intervention.
"Our state has an ally in the White House," said a statement from the Assembly's speaker, Robin Vos, and the Senate's majority leader, Scott Fitzgerald. "Southeast Wisconsin and the entire state will see an influx of manufacturing jobs and billions in investments."
But Mr. Woo's comments to Reuters about the infeasibility of making liquid-crystal display panels have some lawmakers questioning whether the thousands of promised jobs will ever materialize.
"They're giving us the prospect of making cash payments to a company for the next 15 years for a factory that the company has admitted can't be competitive in the marketplace," Assemblyman Gordon Hintz, the Democratic minority leader, said in an interview. "That doesn't sound like a good taxpayer investment."

Texto completo: The self-declared interim president of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, has refused to rule out accepting U.S. military support amid the escalating political crisis, saying that the Venezuelan people want to end President Nicolas Maduro's dictatorship with "whatever pressure is necessary."
But Mr. Guaido cautioned that he hopes it doesn't come to that.
Asked by CNN's Christiane Amanpour whether he would accept U.S. military support, he said through an interpreter: "Here in Venezuela we are doing everything we can to put pressure, so that we don't have to come to a scenario that no one would wish to have."
"We are trying to restore the sovereignty of this country, to restore the liberty and democracy of Venezuela," he added.
Mr. Guaido, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself acting president of Venezuela last week, invoking an obscure constitutional rule to open a rare challenge to Mr. Maduro's claim to the presidency.
The announcement was welcomed by huge crowds in the capital and recognized by a chorus of world leaders, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who issued a video message supporting Mr. Guaido's "courageous decision."
Mr. Guaido told CNN that he was appreciative of the U.S. support, which included a phone call Wednesday from President Donald Trump, adding that he has also spoken with a number of other world leaders.
Until very recently, Mr. Guaido, an industrial engineer and former student leader, was almost virtually unknown on the global stage.
The 35-year-old was head of Venezuela's assembly for merely three weeks before making the move, but has quickly energized the movement against Mr. Maduro, who was sworn in for a second term earlier this month.
Writing in an opinion piece published in The New York Times on Thursday, Mr. Guaido called Mr. Maduro's re-election on May 20, 2018, "illegitimate" and that, by continuing to stay in office, he was "usurping the presidency."
"Mr. Maduro's time is running out, but in order to manage his exit with the minimum of bloodshed, all of Venezuela must unite in pushing for a definitive end to his regime," Mr. Guaido wrote, adding that any transition of power could not happen without support from "pro-democratic governments" and "key military contingents."
Mr. Guaido told CNN that he has been in talks with members of the military, but did not present a clear plan of how he would get them to withdraw their support from Mr. Maduro.
"We're asking that the armed forces are on the side of the constitution, which is very different from it being a coup here in Venezuela," Mr. Guaido said, rebutting Mr. Maduro's accusation that the U.S. was or4chestrating a military coup in the country.
Mr. Maduro has been crisscrossing Venezuela overseeing military exercises and vowing to defend his socialist government no matter the cost. The military's top leadership is backing Mr. Maduro, though analysts warn that rank-and-file troops frustrated by their country's economic and humanitarian crisis may not share their unwavering loyalty.
Later on Thursday, the Venezuelan opposition leader warned officers from a feared state security unit Thursday to stay away from his family after he accused them of showing up at his apartment in a tense brush with the very force he is trying to persuade to switch allegiance and back him.
A visibly flustered but determined Mr. Guaido - holding his smiling daughter - described outside his home how four agents from the police's Special Action Force had arrived at the building and asked security guards stationed there for his wife.
"Children are sacred," he admonished the agents as a crowd of supporters applauded. "Wives are sacred. So don't cross that red line."
In a statement on Twitter, Venezuela's police denied that special agents had gone to Mr. Guaido's home.

THE LONELINESS OF THE MODERATE DEMOCRAT 'IT TAKES A LOT OF SPINE TO BE A CENTRIST IN AMERICA TODAY'

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE, R.I.
I did it. I found a significantly accomplished, defensibly qualified Democratic officeholder who isn't flirting with - and hasn't fantasized about - a presidential run in 2020. I had to take the train to Rhode Island, where we talked over pizza and eggplant parmigiana. We drank wine, too. It helps these days.
Her name is Gina Raimondo. She's the governor of this state. She just began her second term after being re-elected by a margin of more than 15 percentage points, and you would think that this commanding victory plus her youth (she's 47), her working-class background, her educational pedigree (Harvard, Rhodes scholar, Yale Law), her role as the chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association and her situation far from the nation's swampy and unpopular capital would start chatter about a move there. But no. Crickets.
The most obvious reason? Her relationship to the Democratic Party of the moment. Both stylistically and substantively, she's out of sync with it.
She can't tweet worth a damn and the same goes for Instagram. She winces at talk of a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent and cringes at the growing use of "corporatist" as a slur against Democratic politicians deemed too cozy with business interests. She thinks that big companies often need to be prodded forcefully to do right by their employees, but that it's bad policy and bad politics to paint them as the enemy.
She recalled an exchange with college students not long ago. One of them said: "I get who you are. You're one of those spineless centrists."
"And I was like, 'Excuse me?'," she said. "It takes a lot of spine to be a centrist in America today. You get whacked from the left and whacked from the right. That's my life. I get whacked."
Moderate Democrats have certainly had their day and their sway. In fact the passions of the left arise in part from how much compromise there has been - and here we are stuck with Donald Trump. The rage of less moderate Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is earned and righteous. And Ms. Raimondo said precisely that to me.
But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is by no means the whole of the Democratic Party. And is the leftward lurch that she personifies the best and safest bet for 2020? I worry, because there's no political priority higher than limiting Trump to one term. Ms. Raimondo also worries - a lot.
"So many Democrats just assume we're going to win," she said. "They underestimate how hard it's going to be." And it might be a serious tactical mistake, she added, to nominate any candidate who seems to be at war with capitalism itself or entertains the idea of a guaranteed minimum income.
"We have become the party that is anti-business," she told me. "We need to be the party of work."
She acknowledged that "the system we have today is totally broken." She cited grotesque income inequality. She noted that too many Americans have no economic security and no prospects for achieving it.
"But I fall in the camp of: Let's fix it," she said. "Let's embrace business to come to the table. Someone needs to make the case that it's in the best interest of businesses and wealthy people to be better corporate citizens. Pay for health care. Help people get their college degree. Pay for job training."
Along those lines, she recently proposed that companies doing business in Rhode Island be taxed up to $1,500 annually for every employee who is enrolled in Medicaid because he or she can't get health insurance through a company-sponsored plan. "I hope that they're embarrassed," she said.
But, she added, "Where I think we are at risk is if all we do is beat up and crap on businesses."
That's an exaggeration of where the party is, but I take her point. And I'm fascinated by her unflashy example and the questions it raises about how we currently accord importance to politicians and how much that really relates to their impact.
Journalists obsess over the most camera-ready emissaries and provocative assertions, and we often outsource our judgment to social media. To go viral is to be relevant. "In the future," the Politico media columnist Jack Shafer wrote a few days ago, "your news source of choice will contain only stories about Donald Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez." Mr. Shafer forgot Beto O'Rourke, which is funny, because he once wrote an excellent broadside about how political reporters can't forget him.
When I checked social media during Ms. Raimondo's re-election campaign, I mostly saw people bashing her, and she wasn't bothering to engage with that hate. I assumed she was in trouble.
But she won her primary against a progressive rival by more than 20 points, then trounced her Republican opponent in the general election, 52.8 percent to 37.3 percent. (Third-party candidates received the remainder of the vote.) She had ample support in the end. It just didn't show up on Twitter, where an overwhelming majority of Americans still spend no time at all.
And that support undoubtedly reflects the concrete difference that Ms. Raimondo has made over the past four years. With aggressive tax incentives, she persuaded some two dozen companies to expand or establish operations in Rhode Island, creating what The New York Times' Katharine Seelye described as a "frenzy of economic and job development." For most of the year before she took office, the state's unemployment rate was well above the nation's; at the end of last month, it was the same - 3.9 percent.
Thanks to her advocacy, Rhode Island is among a minority of states in which community college is free. And thanks to a tax that she levied on large commercial trucks, its awful infrastructure is receiving desperately needed repairs and upgrades.
K-through-12 public education, however, remains a mess. And Ms. Raimondo has stains on her record, including the botched rollout of a $650 million public-assistance computer system that wasn't ready, wreaking epic havoc. To get re-elected, she raised - and spent - significantly more money than her opponents. And many Democrats fairly question whether her corporate giveaways had to be as generous as they were.
But some of them obviously backed her anyway. "At the end of the day," Ms. Raimondo said, "people want a decent job, and I think they thought that I was the candidate who was going to bring that to them and their families."
And that's a political reality - and a glimpse into the electorate - that shouldn't be forgotten as Democrats plot their course. The media attention to full-throttle progressives among newly elected House Democrats is disproportionate to their numbers, and it sometimes obscures a sizable, practical middle. Besides, their more moderate peers are the ones who wrested seats from Republicans in districts that, like America, aren't deep red or emphatically blue.
"I don't think the lefties can win a general election," Ms. Raimondo said. But, she conceded, "Who knows? I'm not running in 2020. I could have missed the boat."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Last year The New York Times introduced Past Tense, an initiative to revisit history through a present-day lens. Its projects begin in The Times's photo archive, affectionately known as the morgue, where more than six million pictures are held.
The first project was "California: State of Change," a portfolio of the state and the mentality it represented during the rapid growth of the 20th century. More recently, picture essays of Fidel Castro, fitness trends and the rise of the New York pizza slice were published.
Its latest endeavor: 100 pictures for what would have been the 100th birthday of Jackie Robinson, the first black player in Major League Baseball, who endured racial venom with stoicism and proved a genius on the basepaths in Brooklyn Dodger white. "For sociological impact," The Times declared in Robinson's 1972 obituary, he was "perhaps America's most significant athlete."
The project, "42 at 100," reacquaints readers with the many dimensions of the Hall of Famer and civil rights icon. There is Robinson the officer in the United States Army, and Robinson the corporate executive who voted for Richard M. Nixon in 1960. We meet him in a family photo, as a boy in Pasadena, Calif. As a four-sport star at U.C.L.A. On a picket line in Cleveland. On his lawn in Stamford, Conn., hosting a jazz benefit for the N.A.A.C.P.
"We wanted to show the entirety of Jackie Robinson," said Brian Gallagher, the deputy editor of Past Tense.
The digitization of The Times's photo archive is continuing, and the Past Tense team searched the morgue by hand for pictures of Robinson. "This was a big opportunity," said Veronica Chambers, editor of Past Tense. "Being that this happened in Brooklyn, we knew it was something we could find in the Times narrative."
To fill out a comprehensive portrait of Robinson's life off the baseball field, the team reached outside of its own collection, to the archives of U.C.L.A., Ebony Magazine and The Pittsburgh Courier, a leading black newspaper in the 20th century.
A digital slide show and the pictures selected for today's 24-page broadsheet print section present an opportunity to run photos that appeared in The Times 70 years ago in a new context, at a much larger scale. There are words, too, including personal essays from the former Times sportswriters George Vecsey and Claire Smith (a pioneer in her own right: the first woman elected into the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame), and excerpts from the work of the Pulitzer Prize winner Dave Anderson, who died last year (and wrote Robinson's obituary).
There is a scene at the end of the 2013 Robinson biopic, "42," that takes place after the Dodgers clinched the National League pennant in 1947, the year Robinson broke the color barrier. He picks up a copy of The New York Times. A banner headline reads, "Hail to Those Brooklyn Bums."
This is a historical inaccuracy: The Times was hardly that effusive in writing of Robinson's major league debut.
The news was covered, to be sure. After the Dodgers signed him to their minor league team, the Oct. 24, 1945, headline read: "Montreal Signs Negro Shortstop." After his first minor league game in Jersey City, the headline on April 19, 1946, was: "Montreal Winner as Robinson Stars." In 1947 The Times also reported that the St. Louis Cardinals players considered striking as long as Robinson was in the lineup against them, and that he received threatening letters to "get out of baseball."
But the restrained tone in those sports pages does not match the way Robinson was exalted in the black press, and the way America celebrates his legacy today.
"You can see history taking shape, and we really didn't deal with it that day," Jay Schreiber, a 27-year veteran of the sports desk, said of the day Robinson signed his contract. Mr. Schreiber, who retired in 2017 and edited today's special print section, said journalism works differently today.
"Now, we would connect all the dots: Why are you signing him?" Mr. Schreiber said.
That's part of the reason The Times started Past Tense: to tell "the stories of the past, with the wisdom of today," Ms. Chambers said. "We are showing him in a way The Times might not have shown him in his lifetime. We now know more about what we did, and how we missed."
When the clock strikes midnight, Jackie Robinson's 100th birthday will end, and Black History Month will begin. Once again, he leads the way.

Texto completo: Toni Morrison is a Nobel Prize- and Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist. Among her best known novels are 'The Bluest Eye,' 'Song of Solomon,' 'Beloved' and 'A Mercy.'
Who Is Toni Morrison? Born on February 18, 1931, in Lorain, Ohio, Toni Morrison is a Nobel Prize- and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, editor and professor. Her novels are known for their epic themes, exquisite language and richly detailed African-American characters who are central to their narratives. Among her best known novels are The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Beloved, Jazz, Loveand A Mercy. Morrison has earned a plethora of book-world accolades and honorary degrees, also receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.
Toni Morrison Best Books
'The Bluest Eye'
Morrison's first novel, The Bluest Eye, was published in 1970. She used as her literary first name "Toni," based on a nickname derived from St. Anthony after she'd joined the Catholic Church. The book follows a young African-American girl, Pecola Breedlove, who believes her incredibly difficult life would be better if only she had blue eyes. The controversial book didn't sell well, with Morrison stating in a 1994 afterword that the reception to the work was parallel to how her main character was treated by the world: "dismissed, trivialized, misread."
'Sula'
Morrison nonetheless continued to explore the African-American experience in its many forms and eras in her work. Her next novel, Sula (1973), explores good and evil through the friendship of two women who grew up together in Ohio. Sula was nominated for the American Book Award.
'Song of Solomon'
Song of Solomon (1977) became the first work by an African-American author to be a featured selection in the Book of the Month club since Native Son by Richard Wright. The lyrical story follows the journey of Milkman Dead, a Midwestern urban denizen who attempts to make sense of family roots and the often harsh realities of his world. Morrison received a number of accolades for the novel, which would go on to win the National Book Critics Circle Award and become a perennial favorite among academics and general readers.
Pulitzer for 'Beloved'
A rising literary star, Morrison was appointed to the National Council on the Arts in 1980. The following year, Tar Baby was published. The Caribbean-based novel drew some inspiration from folktales and received a decidedly mixed reaction from critics. Her next work, however, proved to be one of her greatest masterpieces. Beloved (1987) explores love and the supernatural. Inspired by real-world figure Margaret Garner, main character Sethe, a former slave, is haunted by her decision to kill her children rather than see them become enslaved. Three of her children survived, but her infant daughter died at her hand. Yet Sethe's daughter returns as a living entity who becomes an unrelenting presence in her home. For this spellbinding work, Morrison won several literary awards, including the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Ten years later, the book was turned into a movie starring Oprah Winfrey, Thandie Newton and Danny Glover.
Morrison Wins a Nobel Prize
Morrison became a professor at Princeton University in 1989 and continued to produce great works, including Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination (1992). In recognition of her contributions to her field, she received the 1993 Nobel Prize in Literature, making her the first African-American woman to be selected for the award. The following year, she published the novel Jazz, which explores marital love and betrayal in 20th-century Harlem.
At Princeton, Morrison established a special workshop for writers and performers known as the Princeton Atelier in 1994. The program was designed to help students create original works in a variety of artistic fields.
Background and Education
Born Chloe Anthony Wofford on February 18, 1931, in Lorain, Ohio, Toni Morrison was the second oldest of four children. Her father, George Wofford, worked primarily as a welder, but held several jobs at once to support the family. Her mother, Ramah, was a domestic worker. Morrison later credited her parents with instilling in her a love of reading, music and folklore along with clarity and perspective.
Living in an integrated neighborhood, Morrison did not become fully aware of racial divisions until she was in her teens. "When I was in first grade, nobody thought I was inferior. I was the only black in the class and the only child who could read," she later told a reporter from The New York Times. Dedicated to her studies, Morrison took Latin in school and read many great works of European literature. She graduated from Lorain High School with honors in 1949.
At Howard University, Morrison continued to pursue her interest in literature. She majored in English and chose the classics for her minor. After graduating from Howard in 1953, Morrison continued her education at Cornell University. She wrote her thesis on the works of Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner, and completed her master's degree in 1955. She then moved to the Lone Star State to teach at Texas Southern University.
Mother and Random House Editor
In 1957, Morrison returned to Howard University to teach English. There she met Harold Morrison, an architect originally from Jamaica. The couple married in 1958 and welcomed their first child, Harold, in 1961. After the birth of her son, Morrison joined a writers group that , met on campus. She began working on her first novel with the group, which started out as a short story. Morrison decided to leave Howard in 1963. After spending the summer traveling with her family in Europe, she returned to the United States with her son. Her husband, however, had decided to move back to Jamaica.

Texto completo: Rush Limbaugh’s December 2018 Limbaugh Letter has an article titled "Demonizing White Men." It highlights — with actual quotations from people in the media, academia and the political and entertainment arenas — the attack on white men as a class. You can decide whether these statements are decent, moral or even sensible. Should we support their visions?
Don Lemon, a CNN anchorman, said, "We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them." Steven Clifford, former King Broadcasting CEO, said, "I will be leading a great movement to prohibit straight white males, who I believe supported Donald Trump by about 85 percent, from exercising the franchise (to vote), and I think that will save our democracy." Teen Vogue, a magazine targeting teenage girls, wrote, "Not only is white male terrorism as dangerous as Islamic extremism, but our collective safety rests in rooting out the source of their radicalization." Economist Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a column titled "The Angry White Male Caucus," in which he explained, "Trumpism is all about the fear of losing traditional privilege."
There have been similar despicable statements made by academics. James Livingston, a Rutgers history professor: "OK, officially, I now hate white people. ... I hereby resign from my race." Stacey Patton, a Morgan State University professor: "There is nothing more dangerous in the United States than a white man who has expected to succeed and finds himself falling behind." Stony Brook University sociology professor Michael Kimmel explained, "White men’s anger comes from the potent fusion of two sentiments: entitlement and a sense of victimization."
Not to be outdone, entertainers have hopped on the demonizing-white-men bandwagon. Joy Behar, talking on ABC’s "The View" about senators supporting Kavanaugh, said: "These white men — old, by the way — are not protecting women. They’re protecting a man who is probably guilty." Actress Gabourey Sidibe, also on "The View," said: "Older white men are a problem, y’all, for everyone. We’re all at risk." Moira Donegan wrote an article for The Guardian titled "Half of white women continue to vote Republican. What’s wrong with them?"
That is just a partial list of statements that would be viewed and condemned as racist simply by replacing "white men" with "black men," "Mexican men" or "Asian men." You can bet the rent money that university presidents and media executives would sanction any of their employees for making similar broad, sweeping statements about nonwhite men. Suppose a white anchorman said, "Black people are the greatest murder threat in this country." I guarantee you that he’d be shown the door.
There are only two ways to explain the silence by people who should know better. Either they agree with the sentiments expressed or they are out-and-out cowards. Decent American people ought to soundly reject and condemn this brazen attack on white men. I think that the attack is on masculinity itself and that white men are a convenient scapegoat — for now.

Schultz decried as 'elitist'; his campaign a 'vanity project'

Texto completo: Howard Schultz's book launch — and potential presidential bid — is off to a rough start.
Just one day after announcing that he was preparing to run for president as a third-party candidate, the former Starbucks CEO kicked off a nationwide tour Monday evening to promote his new book. He had barely begun to speak at a Barnes & Noble in New York when a protester interrupted.
"Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire!" the unidentified bearded man yelled, adding an expletive. "Go back to being ratioed on Twitter!"
The brief disruption summed up the animosity and outright hostility that Schultz has faced since Sunday, when he told CBS's "60 Minutes" that he was seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent.
"Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world," the man at the book launch shouted as private security guards hustled him out of the room and a handful of audience members booed.
A few minutes later, a second heckler spoke up, HuffPost reported.
"Health care is a human right!" the man chanted repeatedly, in apparent reference to Schultz's claim from the "60 Minutes" interview that "the country cannot afford" to provide free health care for all. He, too, was removed from the event.
The interruptions to Schultz's first book tour event followed two days of negative backlash online and in print. As The Washington Post's Michael Scherer reported, Schultz's announcement on Sunday was met with immediate blowback from Democrats. High-profile liberals, including the singer Cher, threatened to never set foot in a Starbucks again. (Schultz no longer runs the company, but remains one of its largest shareholders.)
"Vanity projects that help destroy democracy are disgusting," tweeted Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and a former campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. "If he enters the race, I will start a Starbucks boycott because I'm not giving a penny that will end up in the election coffers of a guy who will help Trump win."
Washington Post
Ga. gubernatorial candidate to respond to Trump speech
WASHINGTON — Stacey Abrams, a rising star from Georgia who narrowly lost a race for governor there last year, will deliver the Democrats' official response to President Trump's State of the Union address next week.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Tuesday that he invited Abrams to make the televised response weeks ago. She publicly agreed to the often-thankless task on Tuesday.
“She is just a great spokesperson," Schumer told reporters. “She's an incredible leader. She has led the charge for voting rights, which is at the root of just about everything else."
The designation provides Abrams, 45, with a nationally televised platform to burnish her profile at a time when she is said to be considering her next political steps, including a possible run for Senate in 2020 against Senator David Perdue, a Georgia Republican. But it also carries substantial risks: A notoriously awkward format, State of the Union responses have been more memorable in recent years for the memes they have produced than persuasive oratory.
New York Times
Flake says he will not challenge Trump in primary
WASHINGTON — Former senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, on Tuesday ruled out a primary challenge to President Trump next year, saying he doesn't see "a path right now" but still hopes another member of his party steps forward to run.
"I have always said that I do hope that there is a Republican who challenges the president in the primary," Flake said during an appearance on "CBS This Morning." "I still hope that somebody does, but that somebody won't be me.'
Before retiring from the Senate in January, Flake had been one of Trump's more vocal Republican critics, accusing him at one point of not demonstrating "grown-up leadership."
Flake stoked speculation about a 2020 challenge to Trump in March, when he traveled to New Hampshire, the nation's first primary state, to deliver an address to a crowd of business leaders and political activists.
Flake said during his CBS appearance, however, that he has a difficult time envisioning prevailing against Trump.
He also cited the strong backing of Trump by the Republican National Committee.

Terry Crews, in #MeToo PSA: 'I will not be shamed'

Texto completo: Terry Crews has a message for survivors of sexual assault: "I will not be shamed. I did nothing wrong." It's a mantra the actor says anyone who has experienced sexual violence should repeat "until you believe it."
Crews narrates a video that was released over the weekend as part of a PSA series by #MeToo, a movement geared toward helping survivors of sexual violence. The former NFL player, who now stars on NBC's cop comedy "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," has become a key figure in the #MeToo era since he publicly alleged in 2017 that a prominent Hollywood agent had groped his genitals.
Crews came forward the week following the New York Times and the New Yorker's explosive stories about the powerful film producer Harvey Weinstein - a moment he references in his video, titled "Terry."
"I remember right after the [Weinstein] story broke, I was just going through my feed, and there were so many men, in particular, that were calling these women liars. They were calling them opportunists," Crews says in the video, which uses a high-pitched tone to obscure Weinstein's name. "For me to remain silent, I would have felt like a fraud. Because when this happens to you, you are trapped. And you are not a victim that needs help. You are a problem that needs to be eradicated."
Crews's video is one of four in the series.
They were produced in partnership with the marketing agency, Deutsch, and first premiered at the Sundance Film Festival over the weekend.
Tarana Burke , the activist who founded #MeToo in 2006 as a phrase she used in her work with black women and girls who had experienced sexual violence, shared each of the videos on Twitter with a message of her own: "These stories are real. These people are real. See them, Hear them, Believe them," she wrote. "Let's get to work."

Texto completo: Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog organization at the University of Toronto, has published hard-hitting research on powerful targets in recent years: Chinese government censorship, Silicon Valley's invasion of customers' privacy, despotic regimes' electronic surveillance of dissidents. It's the kind of work that can make enemies.
So when John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, got an odd request for a meeting last week from someone describing himself as a wealthy investor from Paris, he suspected a ruse and decided to set a trap.
Over lunch at New York's five-star Peninsula Hotel, the white-bearded visitor, who said his name was Michel Lambert, praised Mr. Scott-Railton's work and pried for details about Citizen Lab. Then -- "as I was finishing my crème brûlée," Mr. Scott-Railton said -- a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press, alerted by Mr. Scott-Railton and lurking nearby, confronted the visitor, who bumped into chairs and circled the room while trying to flee.
At least two other men nearby appeared to be operatives -- one who stood at the door, another who seemed to be filming from a table, said Mr. Scott-Railton, who himself filmed his lunch companion.
The case of the bumbling spy is the latest episode involving undercover agents, working for private intelligence firms or other clients, who adopt false identities to dig up compromising information about or elicit embarrassing statements from their targets.
"Michel Lambert" is a pseudonym and the Paris company he claimed to represent does not exist. The New York Times, in collaboration with Uvda, an investigative television show on Israel's Channel 12, has confirmed that the mysterious visitor was Aharon Almog-Assoulin, a retired Israeli security official who until recently served on the town council in a suburb of Tel Aviv.
Contacted by The Times on Sunday, he said, "I do not have any interest in continuing with this conversation" and hung up. Mr. Scott-Railton, shown a photograph of Mr. Almog-Assoulin, said he was certain it was the man he had met.
The phenomenon of private spies drew widespread attention in 2017, when Black Cube, an Israeli private intelligence firm, was found to have used undercover agents to approach women who had accused Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer, of sexual misconduct. Black Cube later was identified as having sent agents, again under false cover, to investigate Obama administration officials who had worked on the Iran nuclear deal.
Black Cube denied that it had played any role in approaching Citizen Lab employees, but the same undercover agent turned up in an earlier case in Canada with a Black Cube connection.
In October 2017, a man who resembles Mr. Almog-Assoulin appeared in Toronto, using another pseudonym, to meet someone involved in long-running litigation between Catalyst Capital Group and West Face Capital, two feuding private equity firms. The person, who asked not to be named to avoid further legal trouble, said that when he saw the photo of "Michel Lambert" in an A.P. story on Saturday, he immediately recognized him as the man who had approached him, given him a false business card and questioned him about the lawsuits.
In court papers, Catalyst Capital has acknowledged that to provide support for its litigation, its law firm engaged a company that subsequently hired Black Cube as a subcontractor.
Asked by The Times whether Mr. Almog-Assoulin has worked for Black Cube, the company and its lawyer replied with letters threatening legal action and saying the company had no part in the Citizen Lab case. The letters did not directly answer multiple questions on Mr. Almog-Assoulin's role.
At the lunch with Mr. Scott-Railton, the supposed Mr. Lambert had asked repeated questions about one aspect of Citizen Lab's work: a series of damning reports since 2016 on NSO Group, an Israeli company that makes surveillance software used by multiple governments to spy on their opponents, including a friend of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who was murdered by government agents in October. The company has received extensive media coverage, including in The Times, often citing the Citizen Lab work.
A spokesman for NSO Group denied that the company had any connection to the Citizen Lab encounters.
"NSO had absolutely nothing to do with this incident -- either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, we did not hire Black Cube or anyone else to investigate Citizen Lab's activities and we did not ask any person or organization to hire Black Cube or any other person or firm to investigate Citizen Lab," the spokesman said. He said NSO is "quite familiar with Citizen Lab's shoddy 'research' and its philosophical opposition to our work helping intelligence agencies fight terrorism and crime."
Mr. Scott-Railton was especially alert to the possibility that Citizen Lab might be a target of hostile attention because a colleague of his, Bahr Abdul Razzak, had been approached by a different undercover agent. Mr. Abdul Razzak quickly determined that the name and company that visitor had given were false, and he warned other Citizen Lab workers to watch for similar approaches.
In both cases, according to the Citizen Lab employees, the mysterious visitors claimed to have money to invest and asked questions about Citizen Lab's work, particularly its research on NSO Group. They also seemed to be trying to provoke the Citizen Lab researchers into making anti-Semitic or otherwise offensive comments.
"Do you hate Israel?" Mr. Abdul Razzak was asked by the first visitor, who gave his name as "Gary Bowman," apparently a pseudonym.
Mr. Scott-Railton noted that private intelligence companies often claim that they target only wrongdoers and act ethically and legally. "Well, the conduct of those who commissioned this work against Citizen Lab, and whoever executed it, crosses every ethical and moral line," he said.
The operatives, whoever they were working for, did not seem especially smooth. Mr. Almog-Assoulin, posing as "Michel Lambert," claimed to be intrigued by Mr. Scott-Railton's doctoral research on using kites to lift cameras aloft, though drones have made that work a bit out of date.
At their lunch meeting, he read questions from cue cards of three colors that seemed to be organized by topic, explaining that at his age he needed them to keep the details straight. He held the cards in one hand, while in the other he held and awkwardly pointed a pen that appeared to contain a video recorder, Mr. Scott-Railton said.
In a phone conversation, he had told Mr. Scott-Railton that he had a son about his age. When they met, he said the child was a daughter.
At one point, Mr. Scott-Railton said, the supposed Mr. Lambert suggested that they move their conversation to a nearby cigar bar, noting that he was especially fond of Punch cigars, a premium brand.
As it happens, Mr. Almog-Assoulin's profile picture on WhatsApp, a tool for secure texts and calls, is an image of the Punch cigar logo.

Texto completo: Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, said on Sunday that he was “prepared to fight for my life" and prove his innocence in the case brought against him by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.
Stone, who was charged Friday with obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and making false statements, said on ABC News' “This Week" that text message exchanges that were cited in his indictment were being misrepresented.
“It has to be seen in context," Stone said of his exchanges with Randy Credico, a former associate and political gadfly. “It is a humorous exchange. They're taking things out of context to present them in a light that mischaracterizes their significance. I never told Mr. Credico to lie."
Stone told Credico in 2017 to “do a 'Frank Pentangeli' " when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. The reference was to a character in “The Godfather: Part II" who ultimately avoids implicating another person in his own testimony before Congress.
Stone's legal team has said that other text exchanges reveal that he and Credico often had jocular back and forths, before and after the ones in question, that undercut the notion that Credico could have felt threatened.
Stone said he had forgotten about some exchanges with Credico when he told House investigators that they did not exist, a statement that was part of the indictment against him.
Stone also said that he never spoke with Trump about WikiLeaks, and that they did not discuss a pardon or the investigation into collusion with Russian officials.
According to the indictment, a top official from the Trump campaign dispatched him to get information from the group about the thousands of hacked Democratic e-mails that were damaging to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
On Sunday, Stone did not rule out the possibility of speaking with Mueller's investigators.

Ex-Starbucks head prepares run for presidency
Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks and a self-described “lifelong Democrat," said Sunday he was preparing to run for president as an independent and had already begun the groundwork required to be on the ballot in all 50 states.
Schultz, in an interview with The New York Times, said he planned to crisscross the country for the next three months as part of a book tour before deciding whether to enter the race. A billionaire, Schultz would face a difficult road despite his considerable wealth: Independent candidates have not mounted successful challenges for the White House.
“We have a broken political system with both parties basically in business to preserve their own ideology without a recognition and responsibility to represent the interests of the American people," Schultz said in the interview.
Schultz was also featured in a segment on “60 Minutes" on Sunday night before the publication of his new book, “From the Ground Up," in which he criticized President Trump as “not qualified to be the president."
The possibility of Schultz's candidacy as an independent has drawn condemnation from Democrats, who said that an independent run would split the vote on Election Day 2020 and hand Trump a second term.
“I have two words for Howard Schultz on a potential run for president as an independent: Just don't," Tina Podlodowski, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party of Washington, said last week as speculation mounted about Schultz's plans.
Schultz said he was well aware of the criticism.
“I am certainly prepared for the cynics and the naysayers to come out and say this cannot be done," he said. “I don't agree with them. I think it's un-American to say it can't be done. I'm not doing this to be a spoiler."

Groups press lawmaker to seek Trump's tax returns
Liberal and Democratic-leaning advocacy groups are hoping to pressure US House Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal to immediately begin the process of obtaining President Trump's personal and business tax returns.
The groups Tax March, Stand Up America, and Indivisible sent the Massachusetts congressman a letter urging him to immediately seek the documents. They also drafted a letter they say Neal could send to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig to request Trump's returns.
The Democrat has said he plans to ask for Trump's tax returns, but also hoped Trump would release them voluntarily. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, breaking with standard practice.
Tax March executive director Maura Quint said the only solution is for Neal to request Trump's tax returns immediately.

Harris says the powerful seek to divide America
Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Sunday that those in power are trying to turn people against each other, which she says is "not our America."
Harris, a first-term US senator who announced her candidacy last Monday, rallied supporters outside City Hall in Oakland, her hometown and where she served as a prosecutor before becoming the state attorney general. The event was the formal kickoff for her campaign.
"We are here because the American Dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before," she said. "And we are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question: Who are we? Who are we as Americans? So, let's answer that question to the world and each other right here and right now. America, we are better than this."
Harris also said that racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and transphobia are real in the United States. "They are age-old forms of hate with new fuel. And we need to speak that truth so we can deal with it," she said.
Harris cast herself as the kind of leader who can unify the country and would fight for the needs of all Americans.
The daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, Harris entered the race on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Campaign aides say she has drawn inspiration from Shirley Chisholm, who in 1972 became the first black woman to run for president from a major party.

Texto completo: A doctor in California whose practice is centered around medical marijuana recommendations has been disciplined for approving the treatment for a 4-year-old without consulting a psychiatrist. A new poll shows Utahns can’t agree on whom to blame in the shutdown. And Salt Lake County has a new mayor.
Happy Monday. Dr. William Eidelman is a natural medicine physician in Hollywood who recommended marijuana cookies to the father of the youngster after diagnosing the boy with ADHD and bipolar disorder. California’s medical board found Eidelman was “grossly negligent” for not consulting a psychiatrist and not collecting adequate information from the boy’s teachers and parents. His license has been revoked. The board clarified that it didn’t find fault with recommending marijuana to a child, but with Eidelman’s diagnosis without sufficient basis. [LATimes]

Texto completo: In his guest column this month, Todd Blodgett asserts: "It's time to listen to those who are actually on the border."
I am a Mexican immigrant. I was born and lived in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. I went to my first two years of school there. My parents bought a home on the American side. I go back occasionally.
Blodgett quotes Raul Ortiz, the chief of the U.S. Border Patrol for the Rio Grande Valley sector: "Come walk in my shoes." That hardly counts as compelling evidence for "the wall."
Indeed, Blodgett never defines "the wall" because President Donald Trump does not have a stable definition in the first place.
On June 15, 2015, Trump said: "I will build a great wall — and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me — and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."
On Aug. 11, 2016, he told a crowd that the wall would be made of "concrete plank ... Precast. Precast, right? Boom. Bing. Done. Keep going."
Today, the wall could be "artistically designed steel slats" according to Trump's tweet from Dec. 18, 2018.
Would "artistically designed steel slats" stop illegal drugs? Some calculate that the gaps between the slats are about nine inches. One could pump a lot of drugs through such gaps. Furthermore, most drugs come through legal ports of entry.
The trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, is taking place in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.
According to The New York Times, one witness said "cartel operatives first created front companies that appeared to be selling legal items like cooking oil. After shipping a few real loads of oil from Mexico to various American cities to make it seem as if the company was legitimate, Mr. Guzmán's workers then packed cocaine into secret compartments in the tankers and sent them over the border."
Did Ortiz explain how "artistically designed steel slats" would stop those incursions?
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics, the number of people "apprehended or turned away" in 2016, during the administration of Barack Obama, was about half a million.
By 2017, those numbers were far less than the approximately 1.2 million apprehended or turned away in 2005. So, there is a decreasing "crisis" of immigrants pouring over our borders.
Perhaps Mr. Blodgett should also heed the report on terrorism released by Trump's own Department of State in 2017 for the year 2016: "There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States."
Based on numbers provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, one estimate had five people on the suspected terrorist watchlist stopped between ports of entry in the first half of fiscal year 2018.
At least twice as many were stopped at the Canadian border in a comparable period.
Canada has many more miles of open border (5,525 miles) than Mexico (1,954 miles). But I don't hear Mr. Blodgett calling for a border wall with Canada.
We don't possess enough precise data to calculate the cost and benefit of undocumented immigrants. Blodgett cites one estimate from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) "that illegal immigrants cost taxpayers $116 billion annually."
Trump's own tweet from Dec. 18, 2018 says: "Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year."
Blodgett also does not explain how lower prices for food and services generated by cheap and exploited labor factor into the cost of the wall for Americans.
Trump's initial boast that Mexico would pay for the wall is not heard much anymore.
Right now, the ones paying the price are unpaid Americans, many of whom are tasked with ensuring our security on land, air and sea.

Texto completo: [Video: I Am the Night featuring Chris Pine & Patty Jenkins [TRAILER #1] | Coming January 2019 | TNT Watch on YouTube.]
A search for family ties takes a dark turn in "I Am the Night" on TNT, and a London publicist finds the humor in detective work in "Agatha Raisin" on Acorn TV.
What's on TV
I AM THE NIGHT 9 p.m. on TNT. Chris Pine and the director Patty Jenkins, who worked together on the megahit "Wonder Woman," partner again for a limited series inspired by true events. The show, set in 1965, follows Fauna Hodel (India Eisley) as she begins to trace her family origins with the help of the tormented journalist Jay Singletary, played by Pine. They soon discover that her past may be tied to the infamous gynecologist George Hodel (Jefferson Mays), a chief suspect in the gruesome Black Dahlia murder. Dr. Hodel remains an ominous figure whose powerful connections and desire to keep secrets buried may put Fauna and Jay in serious danger as they edge closer to the truth.
BRESLIN AND HAMILL: DEADLINE ARTISTS (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO Go or HBO Now. In timing that can only be called bittersweet, this documentary highlighting two of New York's most prolific journalists comes to HBO just a few days after the death of their counterpart Russell Baker. Jimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill receive a thorough examination of their lives and careers, and how the intersection of the two created stories that resonated with the masses and helped define one of the greatest periods of journalism.
THE KING (2017) 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings); rent on Amazon, Google Play and YouTube. The director Eugene Jarecki does much more than paint a portrait of one of America's greatest musical legends, Elvis Presley, in this acclaimed documentary. Jarecki takes Presley's Rolls-Royce on a road trip across the United States, tracing his life and how he, one of country and rock music's most beloved figures, could still fall prey to the struggles of American life and the consequences of sacrificing it all for fame. In a review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis calls the documentary "wildly ambitious," much like the film's subject.
What's Streaming
AGATHA RAISIN AND THE CURIOUS CURATE stream on Acorn TV. Agatha Raisin (Ashley Jensen) is not your typical amateur sleuth. With flashy style and a penchant for gossip, she takes on a murder mystery in the conclusion of the show's second season. Joined by her friend Sarah (Lucy Liemann) and ex-lover James (Jamie Glover), Agatha attempts to solve how an attractive new church curate (Olly Rix), his adoring fans and a murder could all tie together in the charming British town of Carsely.
BLACK EARTH RISING stream on Netflix. Kate Ashby (Michaela Coel), a survivor of genocide in Rwanda now living in Britain, confronts her horrific past by working with an American lawyer (John Goodman) to solve war-crime cases. In a review in The Times, Mike Hale writes that the show has "sharp, moving performances."

Texto completo: Reading Andrew S. Curran's "Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely" will, among other things, make you feel very lazy. On a typical day, Curran points out, Diderot might "write on ancient Chinese and Greek music first thing in the morning, study the mechanics of a cotton mill until noon, help purchase some paintings for Catherine the Great in the afternoon, and then return home and compose a play and a 20-page letter to his mistress in the evening." The 18th-century French philosopher (he was called "le philosophe" by his contemporaries; "the philosopher," not "a philosopher") was the most famous atheist of his generation. He edited the "Encyclopédie," for which he wrote 7,000 articles. He was also an art critic, a novelist, a political writer and a satirist, though much of this was known only long after his death. He wrote dozens of manuscripts that he meant to be discovered after he was gone, hoping and trusting that future generations would better sympathize with his more radical thoughts. Below, Curran talks about grave robbers, Diderot's political prescience, how he was like Benjamin Franklin and more.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
It starts in 2013, with The New York Times, when I wrote an op-ed about Diderot's 300th birthday. Right after that happened, Other Press contacted me and said, "Do you want to write a biography?" I jumped at the chance. I had had it in the back of my mind that it would be great to do something different than what was out there. All the biographies had been 700 pages, 800 pages, and very useful and scholarly for people who study Diderot. But I thought that for somebody who was so interested in posterity, it was important to work for him and help him out with that posterity, to make him more accessible.
He's so interesting and human. He's vulnerable, open, complicated and very fun to read about. He's like Montaigne or Benjamin Franklin, too, in that he can become your friend -- a lifelong companion. My thesis adviser at N.Y.U., who died last year, once told me the only man she has loved, other than her husband, is Diderot.
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
I always knew he was a complete workhorse, just an intellectual beast. But I really didn't grasp how important he was as a political thinker until I worked on him. He went to Russia to speak with Catherine the Great, who was his benefactor, and tried to democratize the Russian empire. He didn't get too far.
But later on -- and this was discovered only in the 1940s -- he was a ghost writer for one of the best sellers of the 18th century, "Philosophical and Political History of the Two Indies," in which he tackled major subjects that were incredibly influential. He ultimately wrote about 20 or 25 percent of it. He criticized Louis XVI for income inequality. He said France was a powder keg that was going to blow up, nine years before the revolution. And he was also a great antislavery voice, around 1780. What's remarkable is that he didn't just say slavery is bad, he refuted all the racial stereotypes in a way no one else was doing at the time. The name of the guy who ostensibly wrote the book was Raynal; he got kicked out of France, whereas Diderot, who wrote the most incendiary parts, got to stay.
In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?
The most obvious way of tackling a life is what I call putting a tracer on the person and tracking them from the moment they're born until they die. I started off that way. But after about a year, I figured out this wasn't going to work for Diderot because so much of his existence was based on the idea of posterity. He made a huge bet, by putting these things aside, that people like us would ultimately read his unpublished works. One of the most revealing things he wrote was: "One only communicates with force from the bottom of the grave."
After screwing up a lot of introductions -- I have a huge compost pile -- I opened the book with the story about grave robbers breaking into the church where he was buried, nine years after his death. They stole lead from his coffin, and tossed him out on to the floor. He had essentially been forgotten by then, while the other two figureheads of the era, Voltaire and Rousseau, had been reburied in the Paris's Panthéon. But slowly his legacy started to shift. I flipped it and started there. I had to start where I could bring ideas of legacy and posterity to the fore.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
One day in my early 20s, I was walking around the Paris Metro and I saw a cassette under a bench. I picked it up and saw the name Charlie Parker on it. I didn't know who Charlie Parker was. I took it back to my apartment and just fell in love with it. I listened to it thousands of times. It became part of my brain.
He was a genius, for sure, but in his first gig, the drummer got ticked off and threw a cymbal at him. He went back and worked at his craft. There's something that anyone who's a musician or a visual artist or a filmmaker can aspire to: that unbelievable spontaneity that comes from really knowing what you're working with. I know I'm no Charlie Parker, but he provides this model for hard work, initially, and later on, the kind of spontaneity that's almost invisible.
Persuade someone to read "Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely" in 50 words or less.
This is a book about a person who fought to change the way that people thought about everything in the 18th century: from religion to politics to human sexuality. It's also a book about a sympathetic and complicated genius you'd die to spend time with.

Facebook reportedly looks to link Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram messaging

Texto completo: Facebook is reportedly working to make messages across Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp work together, a strategy that the social network says could improve privacy but also keep users within its ecosystem of applications.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is overseeing the move to create an underlying platform to integrate the company's messaging systems, The New York Times reported Friday, citing four people involved in the project.
Thousands of employees are at work on the strategy, which is in its early stages, the Times reported, but is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 or in early 2020.
All three apps will have end-to-end encryption to prevent outsiders from reading messages. Upon completion, Facebook users could send an encrypted message to someone on Instagram or WhatsApp and vice versa, sources told the Times.
Those apps all have separate messaging systems currently. Integrating them could keep users within Facebook's ecosystem – it paid $19 billion for WhatsApp in 2014 and $1 billion for Instagram in 2012. That integration would not only increase user activity within Facebook's applications, but also give the company potential revenue generating opportunities through increased ad sales and new services, sources told the Times.

More: Ex-Sears CEO Eddie Lampert orchestrated 'scheme' to 'steal' Sears, creditors allege
Such synergy could connect billions of users and, perhaps, impact competitors such as Apple and Google. Facebook has about 1. 5 billion daily active users, while WhatsApp, the world’s most popular messaging app, has 1. 5 billion users. About 500 million use Instagram daily; 800 million use it at least once a month.
“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can; and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private," Facebook said in a statement to USA TODAY. "We're working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work. ”
But users input different information to use the apps – personal information such as name, age, relationship status, work history are used on Facebook and to a lesser extent, Instagram, while a cell phone number is used for WhatsApp.
Facebook's ability to compile a more robust user profile across the three messaging services could raise concerns. The company continues to face criticism over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, involving a U. K. political firm and exposure of personal data of an estimated 87 million Americans to manipulation for political purposes during the 2016 election.
Facebook in November 2018 also said it had removed 85 accounts on Instagram and 30 on Facebook that the company feared were linked to Russian operatives and were covertly orchestrating online activity on the eve of the U. S. midterm elections.
WhatsApp has had issues, too. The assailant in March 2017's London terror attacks that killed four and wounded dozens more reportedly used WhatsApp. And last week, WhatsApp said it would limit the number of recipients in forwarded messages to five, down from 20. That came after India experienced violence last summer after viral hoax messages resulted in more than a dozen lynchings, CNN reported.
WhatsApp said it decided to move forward after a six-month test of the five-recipient limit in India. Facebook had been testing the five-forwarding limit in the country after it experienced violence last summer after viral hoax messages resulted in more than a dozen lynchings, CNN reported.
When Facebook acquired WhatsApp and Instagram, Zuckerberg said those companies would remain independent.
In recent months, the co-founders of those apps have departed as concerns over the Cambridge Analytica scandal shook consumer confidence in Facebook.
WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who left the company last year to start a foundation, urged people to delete their Facebook accounts in March 2018 over privacy concerns and gave an push to the #DeleteFacebook movement. WhatsApp CEO and co-founder Jan Koum left a month later.
Instagram's co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger resigned in September 2018 and the sources told the Times that internal concerns about Facebook's growing designs led to their departures. WhatsApp employees have also raised concerns about the plan on internal message boards and during a staff meeting last month, the Times reported.
The move could put too much messaging power in the hands of one company, suggests Peter Singer, co-author of "LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media. " While an integration would help Facebook align its policies, it could suggest "monopoly concerns," he said in a post on Twitter on Friday.
Most users wouldn't "think twice about" the integration of Facebook's trio of apps, says Forrester senior analyst Jessica Liu. But the encryption of messaging is a double-edged sword. The development "is both good and bad: Good for privacy-minded users," she said in an analyst note sent to USA TODAY. "Bad for perpetuating bad (and untraceable) actors/activity on these messenger apps. "
Facebook's plan to integrate messaging across the three services could lead to additional scrutiny from lawmakers, which last year called Zuckerberg and other executives from Twitter and Google to testify before Congress.
“We have heard a lot from Facebook about how it is committed to changing course and protecting its users’ information, but the company repeatedly has ignored its promises," said Sen. Edward Markey , D-Mass. , in a statement Friday. "Now that Facebook plans to integrate its messaging services, we need more than mere assurances from the company that this move will not come at the expense of users’ data privacy and security. We cannot allow platform integration to become privacy disintegration. ”

Retirement investing do's and don'ts for 2019

Texto completo: People often review their retirement investment strategy in January. But more will probably do it this year after 2018’s rocky close. Here are 18 "do's and don’ts" to keep in mind.
DO save more: Contribution limits for 401(k)s rise to $19,000 this year ($25,000 for the 50-and-older set). The more you put away now, the longer your investments have time to grow, paying off big-time down the road.
DON’T peek: It's unwise to look at your investments more than once a month. Once is often enough to verify that your portfolio is working like it should and that market movements haven’t created big stock or sector concentrations. Looking more often, however, leads to tinkering with your investments – usually a recipe for buying stocks high and selling them low – plus extra costly commissions.
DO think long term: If you’re still working and investing for retirement, your time horizon may be 30, 40 years or more. Short-term wiggles even out over long stretches. If you got out of the market before December’s plunge and got back in at year-end and avoided that nasty period, it makes very little difference over the long term.
DON’T think short term: Avoid a sudden re-evaluation of your portfolio because of news stories. Stocks look forward, not backward. They’ve priced in whatever you just read.
DO get perspective: Get a good hobby to clear your head when stocks get violently volatile. Hiking, bird-watching, parasailing – whatever happily gets your mind off the wild wiggles of markets.
DON’T get hooked on a feeling: Resist changing your portfolio because you suddenly feel good or bad. Fear and greed drive most investment errors. They’re usually backward-looking. Reacting to the recent past is never wise.
DO diversify: Make sure you diversify enough. No one security should exceed about 5 percent of your total portfolio. Too risky.
DON’T make decisions after drinking: Too many folks work all day, tipple a few while relaxing, then look at their portfolio, get emotional and make bad investment moves. Decisions require muted emotion.
DO invest globally: Owning familiar U. S. names may feel best. But it’s a big world. America is just over half the global stock market. Quality opportunities abound in the other half.
DON’T think you’re a passive investor: Calling yourself "passive" when you’re buying and selling index funds or ETFs is self-deception. Those tools are passive, but trading them is active.
DO tune out 2020 chatter: Ignore speculation about the 2020 election and its stock market impact. It’s too far out. Early polls usually aren’t predictive. No one can pick the winner this far in advance – or gauge the election’s impact on the market.
DON’T overemphasize small differences in returns: If Fund 101 returned 9 percent annualized in the past 20 years but Fund 337 did 7 percent, it says nothing about how they’ll do in the years ahead.
DO know you'll often be wrong: So, own some things that will do fine when what you think will do well doesn’t, just in case.
DON’T obsess: Don't get hung up on best and worst performing stocks in a month, quarter or year. They usually cancel each other out. The totality – the broad middle – is what matters.
DO embrace mistakes: They’re learning opportunities. Ignoring them sets you up for future failure.
DON’T get cocky: We’re human. If you make a great trade, it may be skill. Or more likely luck. The road to ruin is paved with overconfidence.
DO remember capital preservation and growth can’t coexist: True capital preservation means no risk – and no return. It's just cash, or something like it. Returns require risk.
DON’T get jealous: If your neighbors boast about big returns, good for them! But they aren’t you. Maybe they’re taking risks that aren’t right for you. Maybe they calculated performance wrong. Or got lucky. Or lied. Don’t shoot yourself in the foot trying to keep up.
Do keep learning: Build your investing and retiring know-how via daily reading.

Texto completo: From Beck Road to Broadway, Plymouth native Sabrina Imamura's path to the pinnacle of performing arts has been nothing short of remarkable.
A 2009 graduate of Plymouth High School, Imamura flourished in the ensemble role of "Woman 1" in the smash hit Broadway musical "Hamilton" for two months in November and December after serving in the same position for approximately 18 months during the musical's first national tour starting in 2017.
Fueled by unyielding perseverance, a passion to perform, a ton of talent and some exquisite DNA, Imamura is the rarest of rare performers who can proudly stamp Broadway on their resume.
"I've been interested in the performing arts for as long as I can remember," said Imamura, who has lived in New York City since 2013. "My mom (Jennifer) was a classical pianist, so she signed up my older sister (Tatiana) and I for piano lessons and dance when we were young."
Imamura's pre-Broadway credentials are stellar. In addition to performing two summers with The Joffery Ballet, she sparkled as a featured dancer in "The Stars of Ballet and Broadway" at the Detroit Music Hall and even participated as a contestant on Fox's "So You Think You Can Dance."
When asked who had the biggest influence on her success, Imamura didn't hesitate to say her mother, Jennifer, a former model and classical pianist, and her father Nich.
"As a mother, anytime my children succeed in something, especially something that not too many people can succeed in, it makes me incredibly proud," Jennifer Imamura said. "Whenever I see Sabrina on stage for anything, I get emotional and cry."
'Big Apple' bound Not long after graduating from the University of Michigan in 2013 with a bachelor of fine arts degree in dance and art history, Imamura moved to New York, where she made ends meet by freelancing as a contemporary ballet dancer, actor, bartender and waitress/hostess — basically, whatever it took.
"There are things I miss about Plymouth: the hometown aspect, the greenery and, of course, my family. But I am obsessed with living in New York," she said. "Wherever you go — except the touristy places like Times Square — people are always on the go, always grinding, always in a rush.
"The feeling here is, like, there are only so many minutes in a day and we'd better use every one we can. I love the energy. New York is an amazing city."
Imamura eventually signed as a dancer and model with an agent at MSA Talent, igniting her career on Broadway.
Breaking barriers When it came to securing roles on Broadway, Imamura's Asian-American ethnicity — her father Nich is Japanese, her mom is Polish — was detrimental, until "Hamilton" came along.
The Tony Award-winning musical is based on the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton — with a twist. The cast is diverse (Thomas Jefferson is played by an African-American, for example) and many of the songs have hip-hop and soul beats.
"Our cast looks like America looks now and that's certainly intentional," "Hamilton" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda told the New York Times in 2015.
The concept proved beneficial for Imamura.
"When my audition for 'Hamilton"s first national tour came up, I didn't get my hopes too high, because there were hundreds of actors who had been auditioning for many, many months for just 11 ensemble spots," she said.
Imamura was called back for a second pressure-packed audition that stretched from 9:30 a.m. to after 8 p.m. — exhausting and exhilarating at the same time, she said.
A few weeks later — with her parents in New York to help her move into a new apartment — Imamura's agent called.
"I missed the call because we were moving things," she said. "When I called her back, she said, 'Where are you? Put me on speaker!' Then she told me I had made the cast of 'Hamilton"s first national tour and that I'd have to move to the West Coast. I couldn't stop smiling."
Up to the challenge Over the ensuing 18 months, Imamura would perform in close to 400 three-hour shows — sometimes twice a day — six days a week, in cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.
"I loved it," she said. "In a lot of shows, the ensemble cast are kept in the background, but not in 'Hamilton.' They encouraged us to make each track our own performance. Everyone got to sing a solo or got a few lines in a speaking role."
The grueling 18-month journey eventually took a physical toll on Imamura's body, forcing her to step away and move back to New York.
The big break Just a few months into her time away from "Hamilton," Imamura received a life-changing email from her agent.
"The girl who played woman 1 for the Broadway show had to take a leave of absence, so they wanted me to cover for her," Imamura said. "My debut on Broadway was an unreal moment. Even though I had performed the track between 300 and 400 times, I was still nervous before that first show.
"A friend of mine was planning to attend one of the shows and she asked me if she'd be able to see me (on stage). I said, 'Oh yeah, you'll see me!' I covered for two months. I wish it could have been longer, but it was an unbelievable experience."

Texto completo: The World Health Organization has ranked vaccine hesitancy – the growing resistance to widely available lifesaving vaccines – as one of the top 10 health threats in the world for 2019.
That news will not come as a surprise in New York City, where the worst measles outbreak in decades is now underway. Nor in California or Minnesota, where similar outbreaks unfolded in 2014 and 2017, respectively.
Leading global health threats typically are caused by the plagues and perils of low-income countries – but vaccine hesitancy is as American as can be. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of children who are unvaccinated has quadrupled since 2001.
The consequences of this disparity are substantial: a surge in outbreaks of measles, mumps, pertussis and other diseases; an increase in influenza deaths; and dismal rates of HPV vaccination, which doctors say could effectively wipe out cervical cancer. But infectious disease experts warn that things could get much worse. Trust in vaccines is being so thoroughly eroded, they say, that these prevention tools are in danger of becoming useless. The next major disease outbreak "will not be due to a lack of preventive technologies," Heidi Larson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, writes in the journal Nature, but to an "emotional contagion, digitally enabled."
Thwarting this danger will require a campaign as bold and aggressive as the one being waged by the anti-vaccination contingent. Here's how to get started.
Get tough. After the 2014 California measles outbreak, the state eliminated nonmedical exemptions for mandatory vaccinations. After a similar outbreak in Michigan, health officials there began requiring individuals to formally consult with their local health departments before opting out of otherwise-mandatory shots.Other states ought to follow this lead, and the federal government should consider tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines.
Be savvy. The Vaccine Confidence Project is a London-based academic endeavor that monitors anti-vaccine websites for rumors and conspiracies and addresses them. It also puts out a vaccine confidence index. Federal health officials would do well to implement a similar program and pair it with an aggressive social media campaign.
Vaccines, to some extent, are victims of their own success. In the United States especially, they've beaten so many infectious foes into oblivion that hardly any practicing doctors, let alone new parents, remember how terrible those diseases once were. An effective pro-vaccine campaign needs to remind us: Vaccines prevent two million to three million deaths globally each year.
Enlist the right support. Some doctors and scientists have referred to ""uneventful vaccination" as "The Greatest Story Never Told." Though they may not spread on the internet like the stories of terrible mishaps that anti-vaxxers traffic in, these far more common tales of inoculation without incident can be a powerful elixir for a nervous new parent. The best ambassadors of these stories are likely to be parents themselves. If health officials corralled these families and trained them in the basics of vaccine science, they might succeed where official voices sometimes fail.

Clean Wheels? Yes, and More

Texto completo: Every decade or so, Hollywood produces a movie that is not only entertaining but also raises the question just what is entertainment.
The 1934 musical "Stand Up and Cheer," in which the president of the United States appoints a secretary of amusement to dispel the Depression, is an example of what could be called meta-entertainment. Martin Scorsese's "The King of Comedy" (1983) and Ben Stiller's "Cable Guy" (1996), both self-reflexively predicated on characters who are mass-culture personified, are others. So is Michael Schultz's 1976 "Car Wash."
A movie in which mass media, specifically radio, exerts a powerful influence on its characters' lives, "Car Wash" is an energetic, vulgar, socially conscious farce -- scored by the master of psychedelic soul Norman Whitfield and focusing on a single day at the Dee-Luxe Car Wash in downtown Los Angeles. It manages to have its cake and eat it too: The film is simultaneously downbeat and uplifting. The New York Times critic Vincent Canby called it "a terrifically shrewd piece of movie-making," noting that "if 'Car Wash' makes no comment on our pop culture, it's because it's a piece of it."
Yet "Car Wash" does comment on itself: The contradictions between their labor and our leisure are manifest in the irresistible title song. Punctuated by the exhortation "work and work and work," the song by the soul group Rose Royce explains that while the Dee-Luxe is "no place to be if you plan on being a star" (never mind that at least in the final credits just about everyone gets to be one), it's "better than digging a ditch" (what isn't?) and "the boss don't mind if you act the fool" (of course not). Heard over the radio, the tune sets the Dee-Luxe employees bopping while they work in a speeded-up version of the Funky Robot dance. Has a $ 3-an-hour job ever been more fun?
"Car Wash" evolved out of the 1970s blaxploitation genre: Schultz, the director, had a hit with the coming-of-age drama "Cooley High," and the screenplay was by Joel Schumacher, who wrote the Motown-influenced showbiz musical, "Sparkle." In other ways, too, "Car Wash" is a quintessential 1970s film. Political exhaustion and economic recession are never far below its candy-colored surface.
Unsympathetic reviewers saw "Car Wash" as a lowbrow imitation of "American Graffiti" (1973) or "Nashville" (1975). "It has no more class than Hostess Twinkie," Pauline Kael wrote, adding "it, too, may make you gag." But "Car Wash" is more a critique of those movies. That which was freewheeling and expansive, whether teenage car-culture in "American Graffiti" or boomtown star-making in "Nashville," is here drastically downsized.
A microcosm of Hollywood, the Dee-Luxe is a stage, and everyone, except perhaps the anxious boss, Mr. B (Sully Boyar), and his gruff ex-con employee, Lonnie (Ivan Dixon), entertains a fantasy or at least wields a shtick. Fittingly, the cast is packed with stand-up comics -- Franklyn Ajaye, George Carlin, Irwin Corey and Richard Pryor. The most compelling dreams belong to the playfully romantic T.C. (Ajaye) and the sullen black nationalist Abdullah (Bill Duke), formerly Duane.
T.C.'s childish fantasy of being a black superhero parallels that of the boss's pot-smoking son (Richard Brestoff), who wears a Mao T-shirt and tells dad's employees, "Brothers, I'm here to unite with you!" Abdullah's tortured self-invention is contrasted with that of the self-confident snappy queen Lindy (Antonio Fargas) who, in the movie's best-known line, tells Abdullah, "I'm more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get."
Abdullah also mixes it up with and fails to faze the resplendently smiling Daddy Rich (Pryor), the founder of the Church of Divine Economic Spirituality, transported to the Dee-Luxe in a gold limousine accompanied by a glam gospel trio (the Pointer Sisters). Their song is an utterly transparent riff on his con man's appeal: "You gotta believe in something, why not believe in me?"
The Dee-Luxe crew includes Latinos, a Native American and one hapless white dude, but the perspective is black. Not that the African-American press was universally favorable. The Amsterdam News called "Car Wash" "something Stephen Foster might have written about a day in the life of black folk on an antebellum plantation." Or a movie lot. That the harried owner, his nitwit son and the brash, insecure cashier played by Melanie Mayron are Jewish suggests that the carwash might be a metaphor for the entertainment industry.
The Jewish characters are well-meaning but clueless, like Carlin's white liberal cabdriver. The white customers are privileged brats basically making a mess for media-addled minimum-wage workers to clean up. The Guardian, a Marxist weekly -- fancifully suggesting an ideological connection to Lenin's manifesto "What Is to Be Done?" -- noted that the movie "poses the day-to-day practical experience of the working class against the 'abstract' theory of those who would politicize it."
"Car Wash" has its flaws. The most obvious is that the female roles are underwritten and cursory, including the glum hooker played by Schultz's wife, Lauren Jones. But the movie is sensitive to heartache, Abdullah's not the least. "It's all falling apart, man," he admits to Lonnie, whose situation is only marginally less hopeless. However the bright orange uniforms worn by Dee-Luxe employees appeared in 1976, they now seem eerily predictive of prison jumpsuits. The perfunctory happy ending is suffused with melancholy.
Yet to be included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry, "Car Wash" is a landmark. It provided a showcase for Pryor, the most bankable black star between Sidney Poitier and Eddie Murphy, who was subsequently directed by Schultz in "Greased Lightning" and "Which Way Is Up?" (both 1977). "Car Wash" also features Garrett Morris, an original member of the "Saturday Night Live" cast, and is distinguished by the presence of two notable directors, Ivan Dixon and Bill Duke, as well as the multitalented pioneer Clarence Muse.
It was the first movie by an African-American director shown in competition at Cannes; there would not be another until Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," a 1989 film for which "Car Wash" furnished a template. Schultz serves as a template himself -- he directed more feature-length Hollywood movies than any black director before Lee.
"Car Wash" is available on Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes, Google Player, and Starz; "Cooley High" is available on Vudu.

Texto completo: A picture of Dwight Eisenhower, the 34th president, hung in my sixth-grade classroom. No one paid attention to it unless our teacher, Miss Murray, referred to it to make a point. When we failed to meet expectations, Miss Murray would point to the image of Ike and remind us that the leader of our country embodied traits defining a good and decent person: humility, honesty, empathy, integrity, strength, respect for others and more. She encouraged us to strive to be like him.
Sixth-grade teachers cannot use the 45th president as a role model today. Can you picture a sixth-grade teacher referring to the president's "performance" in the Access Hollywood tape or his defense of white supremacists at their Charlottesville rally as behavior to emulate? Nor can parents encourage their children to model themselves after No. 45, unless of course, they want them to become liars, bullies, disrespectful of women, insensitive to the needs of others and adept at crude insults. Paul Krugman, op-ed writer for The New York Times and Nobel laureate, said No. 45 is "surely the worst human being ever to hold" the office. (1)
But role models can be positive or negative. We should not allow No. 45's behavior to go to waste. It should be a prime example of how not to behave. Can you think of any better demonstration of the insensitivity and hurtful nature of mocking a person than what No. 45 did to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford? Was it not a great teaching moment for a grandparent and their grandchild watching TV together when immigrant parents were forcibly separated from their children? No. 45 is a role model to be sure - a pathetic, negative role model.
Sixth-graders are not the only ones who can benefit from having someone to admire. No one is too old to benefit from measuring their behavior against that of No. 45. Would any of us call African nations "shithole countries" or purposely and publicly embarrass longtime close friends and allies of the U.S. as No. 45 has done with Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Justin Trudeau? What about his treatment of Senator John McCain? Are we capable of behaving similarly? Let's hope not.
Role models lead by example. Thanks to the actions of a single individual, the U.S. is in grave danger of abdicating its role as leader of the free world and is instead rapidly becoming a negative role model for all to behold.
Mark Asmus is an artist living and working in Taos.

Texto completo: Theater review
"She Loves Me," reviewed Jan. 12 at Lake City Playhouse, 1320 Garden Ave., Coeur d'Alene, continues through Sunday. Visit www.lakecityplayhouse.org/ for showtimes and ticketing.
The 1963 musical "She Loves Me" is charming and quirky, sweet with just a hint of sour. Lake City Playhouse's production, which wraps up this weekend, features some talented voices, clever bits of stagecraft, and warmth in abundance.
Based on the 1937 play "Parfumerie" by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo, "She Loves Me" tells the story of Georg (Daniel Bell) and Amalia (Amy D'Orazi), co-workers in a small Hungarian cosmetics and perfume shop who don't like each other at all, only to discover they've been falling in love as anonymous pen pals.
If the story is familiar, that's because it is. It's been made into three films, including 1940's "The Shop Around the Corner," with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. "She Loves Me," with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and book by Joe Masteroff, was revived on Broadway in 2016 prompting the New York Times to hail this "old-fashioned and unpretentious show" as being like ascoop of the best vanilla ice cream, "the hand-cranked, homemade variety that at its best is a transcendent marriage of human labor and carefully mixed ingredients."
The action centers on the shop owned by Mr. Maraczek (Vermont Trotter), where Georg is the trusted second in command, and Amalia is the new clerk who grates on Georg's nerves. The cast of characters also include the delivery boy, Arpan (Tyler McCabe); the sad sack, Ladislav Sipos (Brad Pfau); the Lothario, Steven Kodaly (Joseph Hall); and the lovelorn single girl, Illona Ritter (Amber Fiedler). And while each of these characters gets a chance to shine, George and Amalia take center stage and keep it.
Makes sense, too, considering both of these actors have done memorable work on the Lake City stage previously. Bell was among the cast of "All is Calm" in 2014, the beautiful treatise on the Christmas truce during World War I. And that same year, he was quite memorable as Javert in "Les Miserables," a show I still can't believe they pulled off on that small stage. And just a year ago, D'Orazi was delightful in "Falsettos" as the shiksa caterer, Cordelia.
Both turn in fine vocal performances and bring to life characters that are relatable. Bell brings exuberant anticipation to "Tonight at Eight" and an air of satisfaction to the show's title song. Meanwhile, D'Orazi shines in the cheery "Vanilla Ice Cream," and is beautifully heartbroken in "Dear Friend."
Meanwhile Fiedler, also a veteran of that 2014 "Les Mis," as Eponine, has a standout, powerful solo too, with "I Resolve," where she promises to stop falling for men who treat her badly. Fielder nails it.
Trotter, as Mr. Maraczek, brings the gravitas, and a bit of darkness, to the story. Balancing business struggles and marital woes, he lashes out at Georg, wrongly, and makes a wrong step, only to be saved by Arpan.
There's some nifty stagecraft at work here, as the shop's interior becomes the exterior - quickly, and frequently while people are walking through the door - thanks to walls on wheels. There's some whimsy, too, as the clerks bid farewell to every single customer with a song: "Do call again, madame!"
When I saw the show opening weekend, it took until Act II for it all to really click. In particular, "A Romantic Atmosphere," was an elaborate dance number set in a cafe that could have used a little more rehearsal. Still, "She Loves Me" deftly handled Christmas Eve chaos in the shop with humor and good cheer. And that's the vibe of the whole show. It's fun and cheerful, sweetly romantic. Not even the dark bits cast a long shadow.

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway isn't letting negative reviews of "Serenity," her new film with Matthew McConaughey, change her opinion of the project.
The 36-year-old actress shared a photo on Instagram of her look from the "Serenity" New York premiere, with a message saying she's standing by the film.
"We keep it real around here: some critics get @serenityfilm and, like me, find it interesting, moving, ambitious and different, and for some it just doesn’t work," she wrote. "That’s cool- there is no failure, only learned events, not everyone has to like everything, and the critical response doesn’t change my feelings about the movie.
"However, other people’s time and money are not to be taken for granted, so I just want to be clear: I endorse the movie, many critics don’t ," she added. "Anyway, wasn’t my @givenchyofficial skirt for the premiere rad?"
Critics: Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey's 'Serenity' is 'the daftest movie of 2019'
The movie, which stars McConaughey as a fishing boat captain and Hathaway as his ex-wife, was lambasted by critics for its wacky plot.
"The more we learn about that half of things the less sense the rest of the movie makes," Wesley Morris wrote for The New York Times. "That includes a big reveal that’s like the worst of Christopher Nolan, M. Night Shyamalan and the condolence-card section at Walgreens. "
The Arizona Republic's Andy Cordova agreed, writing, "A twist ending satisfies when it's surprising yet logical: You look back and say, 'Oh, now I see what that meant' and you piece together how things add up. That's fun. ' But when an inane ending appears out of nowhere and purports to add depth to a movie which has little? That's just maddening. And the twist in 'Serenity' leaves you feeling both cheated and annoyed, which surely isn't the filmmaker's intention. "

Shutdown fight highlights missing ingredient that has impeded Trump's agenda

Texto completo: President Trump's strategy of forcing a government shutdown to get funding for a border wall took another blow on Thursday when a Democratic bill to reopen the government received more votes in the Republican-controlled Senate than his own compromise bill that included wall funding.

There is, right now, more evidence that Trump's support is fracturing than there is of disunion among Democrats, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is showing no signs of retreat. The chances of Trump getting his border wall dwindle by the day.

Watching how poorly Trump has played his hand on the border wall, dating back to the start of his presidency, when his party controlled both branches of Congress and he was coming off an election win, really highlights a missing ingredient that has severely imperiled Trump's agenda. It comes down to personnel. Trump's administration has included people who want to fight for his agenda who have little or no experience getting things accomplished in government. It also has people who have experience with government, but have no loyalty to his agenda. It has very few people who have both attributes. And many who have neither.

This is among the most common complaint I've heard from people who are sympathetic to Trump, but frustrated on progress on a number of issues, whether on immigration, healthcare, or foreign policy. Just look at Pelosi and how she's wielded her power in the border wall fight. Even on something ultimately unimportant like the State of the Union. She knew she had the power to block a joint session of Congress and thus prevent him from giving a high-profile speech in the House chamber, she asserted that power, held firm, and Trump backed down. It just reinforced a feeling that Democrats know to use power when they have it to fight for their agenda, but Republicans never do. Trump was supposed to change things, but he has not been able to, because he's lacked the right people.

Advisers such as Stephen Miller or, formerly, Steve Bannon, by and large, support the Trump agenda. But neither of them had the skill set to either build consensus on Capitol Hill, or wield power in a way that can muscle policies through Congress. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and ex-chief of staff John Kelly came to their jobs with reputations for competence, but clearly were not fully on board with Trumpism and spent much of their time trying to contain him.

You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist about the "deep state" to recognize that many career employees of government agencies hate Trump and want to thwart his agenda. Even many appointees have approached their job as if their purpose is to manage him rather than to go to war for his policies — a sentiment infamously demonstrated by the anonymous New York Times op-ed.

There are other figures we've seen who were kind of the worst of both worlds. Reince Priebus had been an effective RNC chairman, but he was not the right fit to be chief of staff — nor did he really share Trump's vision for the country. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may have been an impressive CEO, but was completely out of his depth in Foggy Bottom, and fought to undermine Trump's foreign policy, particularly on Iran.

Trump's greatest successes have come in areas in which there were people working together who a) shared his goals and b) knew how to make them happen. A perfect example is judicial nominees, in which former White House Counsel Don McGahn consulted with outside groups such as the Federalist Society, who were eager to help Trump fulfill his promise of appointing conservative judges. The Trump team coordinated things closely with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who understood what it would take to get a lot of them confirmed.

There have also been successes in some areas of regulatory policy.

But Trump is seriously lacking people who are true believers in his cause who know enough about how to get things done in Washington. The reality is Republicans had the power in 2017 to build a wall if there was somebody knowledgeable about both immigration policy and legislative tactics to enable Trump to harness that power. This was always going to be a major challenge running as an outsider, against the party's establishment, with plenty of seasoned hands in the party refusing to join the administration.

So he finds himself in the current situation — a protracted shutdown in which he lacks leverage. On the one side, people who want him to cave in and offer more fig leafs to Democrats, and on the other, people who are eager to see him carry on the fight with no strategy to win. This is the story of much of Trump's presidency.

Collins backs NATO proposal

Texto completo: US senator says measure would show 'strong statement of support'
A day after the U.S. House voted overwhelmingly for a measure aimed at making it difficult for a president to quit NATO, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins declared her support for the proposal.
Collins, a Maine Republican, is part of a bipartisan group that introduced a resolution this month to prohibit a president from withdrawing from NATO without first securing approval from the Senate.
"Over the past seven decades, NATO has proven to be the world's most successful military alliance and a major force for peace, stability, and prosperity. It is critical that we reaffirm the United States' commitment to this vital pillar of our national security," Collins said Wednesday in a prepared statement.
Collins told her colleagues that supporting the measure "would be a strong statement of support for this important alliance that serves the strategic interests of the United States."
Both of Maine's U.S. House members -- Democrats Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden -- were among the 357 lawmakers who supported a proposal Tuesday to bar the use of federal funds by a president to withdraw from the treaty that has locked the U.S. to Canada and European allies in common defense since 1949.
The Senate resolution requires the president to win two-thirds support from the Senate to suspend, terminate or withdraw from NATO. It also prohibits funding any effort to do so and grants congressional counsel permission to challenge a president in court if he tries to sidestep the provision.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said in a prepared statement that President Donald Trump's "repeated threats to withdraw from NATO are dangerous."
"Our NATO allies have fought alongside our troops since World War II, yet President Trump disparages these nations and cozies up to our adversaries," he said. "At a time of increased Russian aggression and global threats, our alliance with NATO is more important than ever to ensure the safety of the American people."
Collins and Kaine were joined by Republicans Cory Gardner, of Colorado; Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; and Marco Rubio, of Florida; along with Democrats Jack Reed, of Rhode Island; Chris Coons, of Delaware; and Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut.
The New York Times reported recently that senior administration officials said that several times over the course of 2018, Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
In public, the president has griped on a number of occasions that European nations are failing to spend what he considers their fair share of the cost of the mutual defense required by the NATO treaty.
A bill with the same provisions was introduced last year after a July summit, which included Trump and other NATO leaders, led to fears the president might try to quit the organization. It was championed by Kaine and U.S. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, who died Aug. 25.

Texto completo: To usher in the new year, PEN America invited writers last week to raise a glass to their favorite books of 2018. It's was a classic writers' party, full of insecurity and awkward moments, but on a grander scale.
Rather than drawing people to a cramped East Village walk-up, it was held at Sean Kelly, a cavernous gallery on 10th Avenue near the Hudson Yards. Bowls of popcorn were more numerous, the cheese plates of better quality, and the wine came out of bottles, not boxes.
But all the same types were there, starting with bubbly book lovers like Glory Edim, the founder of Well-Read Black Girl, a hip reading club turned literary festival.
There was the aggrieved guy, who stormed over to ask why The New York Times doesn't "review more books from independent publishers." Then there were the writers who seem both younger and more successful than everyone else in the room, like Crystal Hana Kim, the author of "If You Leave Me."
And finally, the literary lion: in this case, Ron Chernow, commanding his corner as if it were a mountaintop, refusing to speak. (Perhaps he didn't want to be asked about Ishmael Reed's play "The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda," which needles Mr. Chernow for racial insensitivity in his biography that inspired the musical juggernaut "Hamilton.")
So, what was everyone doing there?
"What Pen America is most fundamentally about is celebrating literary expression and insisting on its cultural value," said Jennifer Egan, the group's president and the winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for "A Visit From the Goon Squad." "This moment has a tremendous focus on free speech, partly because of our president's effort to quash the free expression of the press."
Toasted at the party was Ahmed Naji, an Egyptian novelist who served 10 months in prison after a sexually explicit passage in his novel, "Using Life," was excerpted in a magazine.
In another corner, two young poets were composing haikus on demand. Tania Asnes, whose puff of blond curls suggested a cartoon thought bubble, was asked to write a haiku about Mr. Chernow and his refusal to be interviewed.
She thought for a moment before banging out on her manual typewriter:
Invisible ink,
Uttered into-onto air
Voices cross it out.
Ode to Chintz
A jar of plastic cockroaches, and the steady march of plutocrats, suggested that something unusual was happening at the Park Avenue Armory on Monday night.
The largely female crowd of around 200 social registrants had gathered inside a mahogany-paneled room to pay tribute to Mario Buatta, the society decorator who died in October at the age of 82. Nicknamed "the prince of chintz," he popularized the English-country-house style that a generation of Wall Street wives adopted for their Upper East Side classic sixes.
The fur-clad attendees included Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, and his wife, Hilary Geary Ross; Anne Eisenhower, a granddaughter of Dwight Eisenhower; Christopher Forbes, chairman of his family's namesake publishing company; Patricia Hearst Shaw, the heiress and cultural icon; Susan Gutfreund, the acclaimed hostess still looking to unload her Fifth Avenue duplex (now discounted to $68 million); and Jean Shafiroff, the ubiquitous socialite.
The event was a celebration of Mr. Buatta's life, complete with Champagne and a tinkling electric keyboard. Many speakers explained that the insect motif was a reference to Harold, the plastic cockroach that Mr. Buatta kept in his pocket and delighted in using to upstage fancy dinner parties.
An inveterate prankster, he was also known for his collection of fright wigs and false teeth. "He really was an uncultivated Vegas stand-up," said David Patrick Columbia, the social chronicler, not without affection.
Could Mr. Buatta's over-the-top aesthetic -- ruffles on sofas, tassels on drapes, pictures hung with huge silk bows -- have been its own kind of joke, the ultimate sight gag?
"The reason people liked it was because he used a lot of color, and it lifted people," Mr. Columbia said. "It didn't make them laugh. Although he would have preferred to make them laugh."

HERE ARE FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT HANNAH BEACHLER:
1) SHE’S WORKED VERY HARD TO GET WHERE SHE IS TODAY.

Long before the “Black Panther,” Beachler was a single mother in her late 20s studying film at Wright State.
“I was a single mom. I worked two jobs, and I went to school full time. If it weren’t for help from others, I would not have been able to so that,” she told us during a recent podcast interview. “I was a commuter student. There was a lot of that at Wright State, where people have families and they are going back to school and you need all the help you can get, especially nowadays.”
Beachler talked to us about her life-changing experience at Wright State; hanging with the skater kids and overcoming bullies as a kid in Centerville; the example her father set, her grindhouse girl gang movie and how advice from Madonna changed everything forever. The What Had Happened Was podcast with Beachler, hosted by Amelia Robinson, is available here.
2) SHE WAS ON THE GRIND.
Beachler went to great lengths to work her craft, and had more than a few setbacks and rejections along the way.
For the 2013 critically acclaimed independent film “Fruitville Station” — her first job with Black Panther director Ryan Coogler — Beachler told us she drove alone from New Orleans to work on the film in California.
Beachler took a pet-sitting job for a place to stay.
“It was really people I knew who had neighbors who were going out of town who needed their dogs watched... I became like the little town dog watcher, and I had a place to stay,” Beachler said. “That’s how that worked. They didn’t have the money to put me up, and I didn’t have a place to go, but I was still going to go whether it was me sleeping in the car or office or something like that.”
3) HER RESUME IS IMPRESSIVE.

In addition to “Black Panther,” Beachler has received mega praise for her work on “Fruitvale Station” “Moonlight,” “Miles Ahead,” “Creed” and Beyonce’s “Lemonade.”
She was recently featured in the New York Times along with Coogler and his two other female “Black Panther” department heads.
4) SHE WANTS TO HELP OTHERS.
Beachler still has strong ties to Dayton.
Her father, the late Mark Beachler of Mark Beachler & Associates, lives in Kettering while her mother, Marsha , resides in Centerville. Her sisters are also still in the area.
She has given several talks at Wright State and the Neon movie theater in downtown Dayton, offering encouragement to local students, filmmakers and film lovers.
In August, Hannah Beachler announced that she would establish a scholarship fund for Wright State University and Dayton-area high school students interested in careers in communications, media, film and entertainment fields.
4) SHE IS ON THE DAYTON WALK OF FAME.

In September 2018, Beachler was inducted into the Dayton Walk of Fame along with a class that included Oscar-nominated filmmaker Julia Reichert, one of Beachler’s professors at Wright State.
Beachler dedicated her award to her father.
5) SHE IS FOLLOWING A TREND.
This Oscar nomination makes Beachler the third person with Miami Valley roots in recent years recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Oakwood-raised actress Allison Janney earned the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role last year at the 90th annual Academy Awards for “I, Tonya.”

Texto completo: Herrera Beutler is making strides
Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, seems to be reinventing herself. An op-ed piece from Beutler, several “In Our View” editorials quoting her viewpoints, stating her positions, and glowing articles from “Our Readers' Views.”
Her voting record January 2011 through May 2016 shows she missed 503 out of 3,729 votes, a 13 percent absence rate six times the average of fellow House members, ranking her 51st out of 434 voting members.
Since having a close re-election against Carolyn Long, Herrera Beutler now is making a huge effort to reinvent herself. She states she is not voting with the president on all issues (voted 91.6 percent with him in 2017-2018), and will be making independent decisions based upon our needs. Sponsoring a bill to enable people to get insurance with pre-existing conditions, she has repeatedly voted to stop the Affordable Care Act.
Perhaps she has found her moral center, begun to think for herself, and placed the good of the people ahead of party politics. We will wait to see if this trend continues, or is a passing phase. She has two more years to prove which it is.

Stop pipeline in Southern Oregon
Am I the only one who's been freaking out since the IPCC released their 2018 report telling us that we had 12 years to get ourselves carbon neutral or face huge consequences? I know we've been torpedoed with so much bad news lately that even the most committed among us have lost our fervor for outrage — but this alarm seemed to disappear from the public conversation a little too fast. After a few months of feeling depressed and hopeless, I decided we didn't have any more time for depressed or hopeless. I hope you'll join me.
Right now, Pembina, a Canadian company, is trying to build a 229-mile fracked gas pipeline and export terminal in Southern Oregon to ship liquefied fracked gas to Asian markets. In addition to all the clear-cutting and compromised waterways necessary for this project, we have no chance of meeting the Paris agreement targets if we keep building new fossil fuel infrastructure.
Luckily, we can stop this. The group 350PDX has had lots of success in the past preventing these projects, interrupting their permitting by submitting public comments. Head over to 350PDX.org/jordancove to learn how before the deadline on Feb. 3.
Don't give up, we still have a chance.

Prevent influx of immigrants
Your apparent policy of publishing all-Trump-haters-all-the-time is becoming tiresome. Case in point is the Jan. 13 piece by Ann McFeatters, which rehashes every possible reason to hate Trump, just in case any readers forgot one or two of them.
It bothers me that the USA is now supposed to admit anyone who is “escaping poverty,” according to McFeatters. Lemme see, that could include most of the population of El Salvador, Honduras and any of the countries of Central and South America.
Are we supposed to give automatic citizenship to hundreds of millions just because they are “poor”? The Columbian prints these crazy assertions as if they are accepted truth, without ever giving the opposing view. Does this country need a flood of unskilled poor people who do not even speak our language?
Admittedly, Trump acts like a jerk most of the time, but he is trying to stop uncontrolled illegal border crossers, which is the right thing to do. That border has been a crisis for 50 years and Trump is the first president willing to say it, and actually do something.
The USA now has 325 million people. Is that enough? Some think we are filled up. Just try buying a piece of land to build a house on in Clark County.

U.S. inflicts terror on children
According to CommonDreams.org, “the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services reported on Thursday that thousands more children were separated from their parents at the southern U.S. border by the Trump administration, long before it first publicly unveiled the family separation policy last spring.”
This past June, a federal judge in San Diego ordered the administration to end the policy and reunite families. However, the New York Times reports that, in violation of the order, the separations have continued.
Ann Maxwell, the Health and Human Services Department's assistant inspector general for evaluation and inspections, said “the total number is unknown. It is certainly more than 2,737 (reported to the court) but how many more, precisely, is unknown.” Moreover, that number may never be known: department officials, she said, had told her office that there were “no efforts underway to identify that.”
“Ms. Maxwell's spokesman confirmed that inspectors believed the number of separated children may be ‘thousands' more than the 2,737 reported to the court.”
Each day of separation is another day of lifelong PTSD. We are paying to inflict terror on children. Who will pay for their health care?

Wall benefits are not clear
I have read a lot of comments regarding Trump's wall, pro and con. Some critics have noted that the wall is static and a static solution to a problem loses value as time goes on. Just like cybersecurity, if it is not dynamic and undergoing continuous upgrades, “bad guys” like Putin will find a way to breech any static security.
I have yet to see any security experts give a cost-benefit analysis of having a wall, to solve the problems that Trump thinks his wall will sol

Strengths of women candidates test donors

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Just over two decades ago, Barbara Lee, the Boston-based philanthropist and Democratic donor, distributed a ballot in national magazines featuring 20 women she believed were qualified to run for president.
Readers were asked to pick a favorite. The idea behind the project? To expose American voters to how many qualified women were out there, even at a time when they made up tiny fractions of the country's governors and members of Congress.
“When I first started this work, people all thought I was crazy," Lee recalled. “They would pat me on the hand and say, 'That's nice."'
The scenario Lee dreamed of is here: The 2020 ballot could be crowded with women. Four, maybe even five, top-tier women candidates are gearing up to compete against each other for the Democratic nomination.
Now the challenge will be: Whom should feminist donors like Lee and others support? At this point, many donors are taking a wait-and-see approach — and luxuriating in the abundance.
“Having multiple women on the debate stage will be a dream come true for me," said Lee, who founded the Barbara Lee Family Foundationto encourage more women to run for office. “There's never been a year like this."
With Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren and US Representative Tulsi Gabbard taking the first steps to be in the race, and Senator Amy Klobuchar reportedly not far behind, the Democratic primary is shaping up to force some hard choices among those whose priority is to break what Hillary Clinton famously called the “highest, hardest glass ceiling."
And Donald Trump's victory over Clinton, despite widespread coverage of allegations of sexual assault and a tape of him bragging about grabbing women's genitals, has many in the Democratic Party gun shy about picking the wrong candidate. It could increase the appeal of a safer option, which might translate into “not a woman."
Women “absolutely" want to finally elect a female president, said Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton's campaign manager in 2008. “But they want to beat Trump more."
There's a reluctance among advocacy and funding groups to jump into the primary on behalf of any one candidate early on as many voters want to see which candidates sink or swim on his or her own. “They saw the failure of the [Clinton] coronation of 2016 and they want a fair fight this time," Solis Doyle added.
Faced with this situation, some donors are weighing a spread-the-wealth approach, at least in the early stages, giving their dollars to a number of the female candidates and seeing who gains traction. There are plenty of men running, too, of course, in a possible Democratic field that numbers up to 30 or more potential candidates.
“Electing a woman president is one of the most important causes of my life and I think we get there by uplifting as many women candidates as possible at this early stage," said Gretchen Sisson, a sociologist and donor in California, who plans to give to three to four women candidates in the primary. “At some point I have to decide who I'm voting for and that'll be a choice I make as a voter. That is a different calibration than the choices I make as a donor."
Lee said it's too soon to think about strategies for getting a woman over the finish line, saying now is the time to let the candidates “show you what they've got."
Ilyse Hogue, the president of the abortion rights group NARAL, echoed the idea of giving to multiple female candidates, saying many donors are embracing that strategy. Women candidates tend to raise less than their male competitors in early stages of campaigns, meaning early dollars to them can be a matter of life or death for their campaigns.
“Sitting out too long may be participating in erecting barriers that are harder for women to overcome," Hogue said.
NARAL and Emily's List, a powerful political group that backs progressive female candidates with early campaign money, have not decided whether they will pick a favorite among the Democratic field.
“As the primary continues we'll have to reevaluate, but right now we're just excited that some of our great candidates are deciding to throw their hat in the ring," said Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications for Emily's List.
Choosing among female candidates has led to controversy in the past. Stacey Evans complained to The New York Times when Emily's List passed her over to back Stacey Abrams in Georgia's gubernatorial primary race last year.
“If I were a donor, I would be very upset to know that my dollars were going to fight for one prochoice woman against another," Evans said.
Massachusetts Representative Katherine Clark, who helped recruit women candidates to run for Congress, said the issues Emily's List and other groups have in picking among talented women candidates is a “great problem to have," signifying the spike in women's willingness to run for office.
But if women-centric groups and donors stay on the sidelines, unable or unwilling to pick among popular female candidates, some fear a candidate such as Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, could swoop in and grab the momentum and donations.
“Pull up your big girl pants and pick somebody," urged Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston Democratic political consultant. “Do it early enough in the process to actually help a woman win."
Warren, Gillibrand, and Harris have all shown a formidable ability to raise funds, with Warren amassing the most money of any potential 2020 candidate in the Senate. But once the race begins in earnest, the small-donor money could be spread more thinly as more candidates announce.
And despite a risk averse feeling in the base after Clinton'sloss, women say they are fired up after propelling Democrats in races for the US House and several state houses in 2018. They made up 54 percent of voters in battleground districts and female candidates snagged a majority of the seats Democrats flipped, leading to the most female Congress in history. “Women won a lot of these key elections so I think a lot of us feel really energized," said Andrea Steele, the founder of Emerge America, which encourages women to seek office.
The effect of having several top-tier women candidates in the race could transform what it's like to run, Lee, and others hope, as the idea of a woman president finally becomes disentangled from Hillary Clinton, long the only plausible hope.
“In our focus groups for over 20 years, people say, I would vote for a woman just not that woman," she said. “And I do think that voters have been able to hide behind that bias."
Now, voters will have several women, all with very different backgrounds and leadership styles, to choose from. “I do think it's going to test that bias and I think it's going to break it down," she said.

Texto completo: Headnote Where coal-state Sen. John Barrasso got it wrong in a recent New York Times op-ed
In December, after world leaders adjourned a major climate conference in Poland, Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, penned an opinion piece in The New York Times headlined "Cut carbon through innovation, not regulation."
Those first two words were enough to get me to continue reading. After all, when was the last time you heard a conservative Republican, particularly one who represents a state that produces more than 300 million tons of coal per year, advocate for cutting carbon?
"The climate is changing," he wrote, "and we, collectively, have a responsibility to do something about it." What?! In one sentence he not only acknowledged the reality of climate change, but also admitted, obliquely, that humans are causing it - and have a responsibility to act. I had to re-read the byline. Had someone hacked the senator from Wyoming?
Unfortunately, no, as became clear in the rest of the op-ed. The "responsibility" thing was just the first of three "truths" that Barrasso gleaned from the climate conference. He continued: "Second, the United States and the world will continue to rely on affordable and abundant fossil fuels, including coal, to power our economies for decades to come. And third, innovation, not new taxes or punishing global agreements, is the ultimate solution." Ah, yes, there's the sophistry we have come to expect from the petrocracy.
Translation: We've got to stem climate change, but we have to do it by plowing forward with the very same activities that are causing it. And we have to take responsibility by, well, shirking that same responsibility and hefting it off on "innovation" instead.
Fine. Meanwhile, I'll be over here getting rid of my growing love handles while I continue to eat three pints of Chunky Monkey per day.
Aside from the abstract answer of innovation, Barrasso offers two specific solutions to take the place of regulations or carbon taxes. The first is nuclear power. Aside from the waste and the uranium mining and milling problems, nuclear power can be a great way to cut emissions - as long as it displaces coal or natural gas, which doesn't seem to be what Barrasso has in mind.
His primary solution, however, is carbon capture and sequestration. It sounds great. Just catch that carbon and other pollutants emitted during coal or natural gas combustion and pump it right back underground to where it came from. Problem solved, without building any fancy new wind or solar plants. But there are currently only 18 commercial-scale carbon-capture operations worldwide, and they're not being used on coal power plants, where they're most needed, because of technical challenges and high costs.
Once the carbon is captured from a facility, it must be sequestered, or stored away somewhere, perhaps in a leak-free geologic cavern. Most current carbon-capture projects, however, pump the carbon into active oil and gas wells, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery. This widespread method of boosting an old well's production usually uses carbon dioxide that has been mined from a natural reservoir, the most productive of which is the McElmo Dome, located in southwestern Colorado under Canyons of the Ancients National Monument.
Using captured carbon instead makes sense. It obviates the need to drill for carbon dioxide under sensitive landscapes, and it can help pay for carbon capture projects. But none of that changes the underlying logical flaw in the whole endeavor, which amounts to removing carbon emitted from a coal plant only to pump it underground in order to produce and burn more oil and therefore emit more carbon.
Barrasso writes: "The United States is currently on track to reduce emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 ... not because of punishing regulations, restrictive laws or carbon taxes but because of innovation and advanced technology. ..." And he's right. Carbon emissions from the electricity sector have dropped by some 700 million tons per year over the last decade. But it wasn't because of carbon capture, or more nuclear power. It was because U.S. utilities burned far less coal, period.
Sure, innovation played a role. New drilling techniques brought down the price of natural gas, and advances in solar- and windpower did the same with those technologies, making them all more cost competitive, displacing some coal. But Barrasso seems not to understand whence that innovation comes. It doesn't happen in a vacuum. More often than not, innovation is driven by money, regulations or a combination of both. Fracking was a way to increase profits in old oil and gas fields. Renewable technologies moved forward in response to state energy requirements. Carbon taxes would encourage renewables, nuclear and, yes, carbon capture, by making them more competitive with fossil fuels.
"People across the world," Barrasso wrote, "are rejecting the idea that carbon taxes and raising the cost of energy is the answer to lowering emissions." He mentions France, and the Gilet Jaune, or Yellow Vest, movement, the members of which have passionately protested against higher taxes on fuel, among other things. But the Yellow Vests aren't opposed to carbon-cutting or environmental regulations. They were demonstrating against inequality, and against the fact that the fuel tax was structured in a regressive way, hurting the poor far more than the rich. The lesson is not that regulations are bad, but that they must be applied equitably and justly. That, in turn, will drive innovation, and, we hope, more thoughtful future op-eds.

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series Navigating Healthy Families will present "Enough as They Are: Helping Teens Move Beyond the Impossible Standards of Success."
Teens may seem more successful today, yet they’ve also never struggled more with anxiety, stress and depression.
Rachel Simmons will tackle these topics during two presentations: one at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 29, at the College of DuPage McAninch Center in Glen Ellyn and the second at noon Wednesday, Jan. 30, at the Marquardt School District 15 administration center, 1860 Glen Ellyn Road in Glendale Heights.
Simmons translates the toxic messages about achievement that teens have internalized and teaches parents how to help young people practice self-compassion, redefine success, pursue purpose, and most importantly, let them know they are enough as they are.
Simmons, who has been researching and inspiring young women for two decades, is the author of "Enough as She Is" and the New York Times bestsellers "Odd Girl Out" and "The Curse of the Good Girl."
Simmons will share the strategies to help girls and boys overcome brutal self-criticism, an acute fear of failure and feelings that they will never be smart enough, successful enough, attractive enough, thin enough or popular enough. She will share practical parenting wisdom, including teaching teens how to manage overthinking, resist the constant urge to compare themselves to peers, take healthy risks, navigate negative elements of social media, prioritize self-care and seek support when needed to not just survive but thrive.
Students are encouraged to attend.
The Glenbard Parent Series is generously sponsored by the Cebrin Goodman Center, Cooperative Association for Special Education (CASE), College of DuPage, DuPage Medical Group, Emmy Gaffey Foundation, Glenbard Early Childhood Collaborative, Holiday Inn/Carol Stream, Prevention Leadership Team of the DuPage County Health Department and Birth to 5 Community Coalition District 93.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Some people who tuned in to watch President Donald Trump's proposal on Saturday to end the 28-day government shutdown took issue with one particular line of the 13-minute address.
The president proposed a compromise: the $5.7 billion to build a wall along the southern border for temporary protections for undocumented immigrants, including children. He called the proposal "a common-sense compromise both parties can embrace."
"To physically secure our border, the plan includes $5.7 billion for a strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall," Trump said. "This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high-priority locations."
Those at home took notice that Trump seemed to downplay the scope of his wall plan, which he has boasted about during campaign rallies. Many also noted the very public way Trump noted that the wall would not be made of concrete as he had said and wouldn't extend the full length of the border.
"Not sea to sea, not paid for by Mexico, only steel slats. #Trump is walking back more than Michael Jackson," one Twitter user said after the speech.
Another chimed in, saying the president "finally acknowledged that the wall will not be from sea to sea or 1954 miles, because it is would be physically impossible given the terrain. The right will not be happy."
Trump's proposal also drew criticism from some hard-line conservatives, who argued it would encourage more illegal immigration.
"A Big Beautiful Concrete Border Wall will be a monument to the Rule of Law, the sovereignty of the USA, & @RealDonaldTrump," Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, wrote on Twitter. "If DACA Amnesty is traded for $5.7 billion(1/5 of a wall), wouldn't be enough illegals left in America to trade for the remaining 4/5. NO AMNESTY 4 a wall!"
Conservative commentator Ann Coulter accused Trump of proposing "amnesty" for undocumented immigrants.
"100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals," she tweeted. "So if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall."
While the president's comments have changed significantly when it comes to what the wall will be made of and how much it will cost, Trump and his Cabinet have said multiple times that a wall would not stretch the entire length of the U.S.-Mexico border, which extends about 1,933 miles.
The New York Times, which tracked Trump's "evolving" remarks on his proposed border wall, noted that as far back as 2015, the president called for a wall extending about half the length of the border.
"As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall. We're going to create a border. We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come in legally," Trump said at a presidential debate in 2015, according to The Times. "And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that. They built the Great Wall of China. That's 13,000 miles. Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers. So we need 1,000."
Already, 34 percent of the border has a wall or fence, about 654 miles. But other areas of the border without fencing would be difficult to enclose because of the Rio Grande and private property, which the government would have to seize, setting up years of legal challenges.

Texto completo: When Richard Gergel was elevated to the federal judiciary by President Barack Obama in 2010, he found himself assigned to the Charleston, S.C., courtroom of an illustrious predecessor, J. Waties Waring, who had changed the course of American constitutional law.
Few -- including Gergel -- knew much about him.
The paradox was not lost on Gergel, a lifelong South Carolinian well-versed in local history. But soon, using his knowledge of court procedures and F.B.I. records and the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act, he was on a crusade.
Now, despite judicial duties that included the 2017 trial of Dylann Roof, the young white supremacist sentenced to death for massacring nine African-American worshipers at a Charleston church, Gergel has written a book about a largely forgotten racial atrocity that turned a Confederate soldier's son into an improbable giant of civil rights jurisprudence. (Gergel would not comment on the Roof trial.)
The book, published Jan. 22 by the Sarah Crichton Books imprint of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, "Unexampled Courage: The Blinding of Sgt. Isaac Woodard and the Awakening of President Harry S. Truman and Judge J. Waties Waring," reinvestigates an unpunished crime that, in Gergel's telling, ignited the modern civil rights movement, including Truman's desegregation of the military and the Supreme Court's historic ruling overturning school segregation.
"I stumbled across the story and stumbled across Truman's role," said Gergel, 64, on a recent visit to New York. "It was a case that not only woke up Waties Waring, it woke up Truman."
"There was no one like him," he said of Waring. "In the South in the 1940s there was a sense that something had to change but no one could figure out how to break the Gordian knot of Jim Crow."
What turned a Southern gradualist into a revolutionary? "I started digging," the judge said. Beyond the book, his quest ended in a 2015 renaming of the Charleston federal courthouse as the J. Waties Waring Judicial Center.
The backdrop of the Woodard case was indeed harrowing. On Feb. 12, 1946, Army sergeant Isaac Woodard, 26, discharged with a chest of medals after three years of fighting in the Pacific in a segregated unit, boarded a Greyhound bus from Camp Gordon, in Augusta, Ga., en route to home in Winnsboro, S.C.
There were conflicting accounts of what happened on that bus. Joyous soldiers, black and white, may have been sharing a celebratory bottle of whiskey. Woodard and the driver argued about restroom breaks and Greyhound's rules requiring a driver to accommodate passengers's needs.
When the bus stopped in Batesburg, a small town about 30 miles from Columbia, the state capital, the driver summoned the town's two police officers, Chief Lynwood Shull and his deputy, Elliot Long, and Woodard was ordered off the bus.
Shull admitted using his blackjack on the sergeant. When Woodard wrested it away, Long, gun drawn, ordered him to drop it. Then, by the Gergel book's account, Shull rained blows on Woodard so ferociously the blackjack broke. Woodard was left sightless, both eyes gouged out, and thrown in jail, igniting a racial fuse that would burn its way across America to Waring, the White House and eventually the Supreme Court.
"It's more than just an incident, it's a huge historical moment," said Patricia Sullivan, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and author of "Lift Every Voice: The NAACP and the Making of the Civil Rights Movement."
As a law student at Duke University in the 1970s, Gergel had read of Waring. But passing mention of Woodard escaped him and he didn't think much of Waring again until, as an intellectual property and personal injury lawyer and outside counsel to the city of Columbia, he was named to the federal bench.
"In my installation talk, I spoke about Judge Waring," Gergel recalled. "I saw blank looks."
He plunged into research, using his inside knowledge of court dockets and evidentiary records. "I understood what I was looking at," he said. "I knew what to ask for."
Waring, he found, was an eighth-generation Charlestonian born in 1880, with ancestry going back to slaveholders and colonists who arrived in the 1600s. He served as an assistant United States Attorney in Charleston, and with the support of the racially demagogic South Carolina Democratic Senator Ellison "Cotton Ed" Smith, was named by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as one of three judges on the district court in 1942.
His first years on the bench were undistinguished. But in 1944, Waring settled a case in favor of a black teacher paid less than white counterparts, astonishing her NAACP lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, later the first African-American Supreme Court justice. In a second equal-pay case, Waring ruled for the black plaintiff, under the prevailing separate-but-equal doctrine.
Woodard, meanwhile, was convicted of drunk and disorderly conduct and settled his $50 fine with his last $44 cash. Doctors pronounced him irretrievably blind, and the government disclaimed responsibility as he had been discharged from the military five hours before his injury.
Outrage built as news of the assault spread through what was then called the Negro press, attuned to anger over the 900,000 black veterans who had fought for democracy abroad and were now demanding it at home. Orson Welles denounced the beating on his national radio show. Joe Louis, Nat King Cole, Cab Calloway, Woody Guthrie and other stars staged a benefit in Harlem where Woodard spoke.
In various archives, including NAACP files, Gergel found overlooked material on the reaction of Truman, who told an aide: "Enough is enough. Dammit, I'm going to do something immediately." Truman directed the Justice Department and F.B.I. to pursue a criminal civil rights case against Shull. The case fell to Waring, who was skeptical of any federal role in enforcing racial justice and ready to dismiss the charges. But prosecutors were pressed to proceed and the trial began in November 1946.
Woodard testified that Shull had driven the handle end of the blackjack into each eye. Shull countered that Woodard had attacked him without provocation and that in self-defense he had struck Woodard a single blow. Medical records never introduced in court but later tracked down by Gergel and shown to a pathologist confirmed Woodard's account.
The trial took one day. The all-white jury came back in 28 minutes to pronounce Shull not guilty. Waring, deeply troubled by a bungled prosecution, called the sham trial his "baptism of fire." Later, asked what changed him, Waring told reporters, "While on the bench, I developed a passion for justice."
The following year, Waring ruled that the Democratic Party had to open its whites-only primary to black voters. He sent a white farmer to prison for a year for forcing an indebted sharecropper to work without pay, a form of enslavement commonly winked at by Southern courts. He issued orders enforcing black voting rights and with more blacks appearing on juries, desegregated the jury box.
And in 1951, driven to search for a strategy to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 Supreme Court ruling legalizing segregation as long as the races were treated equally, Waring persuaded Marshall, still representing the NAACP, to present "a frontal attack" on segregation in a lawsuit brought on behalf of Henry Briggs, a black gas station attendant in Summerton, S.C., claiming that white children got bus transportation to school while black children did not. Waring was outvoted on a three-judge panel, but his forceful dissent attacking the policy as a violation of the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection of the law, strategically propelled the case into the Supreme Court where it was consolidated with similar cases and decided in 1954 as "Brown v. Board of Education" overturning school segregation.
For his efforts, Waring was menaced by the Ku Klux Klan and threatened with impeachment. A cross was burned in his backyard. He required 24-hour protection.
Waring left South Carolina for New York, dying there in 1968 at 87. Woodard died in the Bronx at 73 in 1992.
Among Waring's admirers, Gergel writes, was a young African-American minister who had masterminded a bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala. He "will long be remembered," said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., "for his minority opinion has now become a majority opinion."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Senator Kamala Harris leaned toward the microphone last week and looked at William Barr, President Trump's nominee for attorney general. The questions flew fast. Was he advocating for a border wall? Did he know most illegal drugs come through ports of entry? Had he been to one lately?
When Barr said he had not, Harris pointedly suggested he do so.
This is the Harris most Americans know, if they know the California Democrat: the calm, focused inquisitor on the dais of the Senate Judiciary Committee, directing withering questions at such Trump appointees as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or former attorney general Jeff Sessions (who once said her volley of queries made him feel “rushed" and “nervous").
On Monday, she jumped into the race for president, joining what could be the broadest Democratic field in a generation in a party eager to take on President Trump.
Harris announced her plans on Good Morning America, and released a video on social media that hinted at a broad and conciliatory political message.
“The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values," Harris, adding, “I'm running to lift those voices. To bring our voices together."
Aides to Harris said her campaign theme will be “For the people," a nod to her career as a prosecutor. Harris, the daughter of immigrants who is part African-American and part Indian-American, will also emphasize the historic nature of her candidacy. Aides said she will use yellow and red campaign imagery meant to evoke that of Shirley Chisholm, who became the first black woman from a major party to run for president in 1972.
.
Her rise in national politics has come quickly, and she is working hard to introduce herself to the more than half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, according to one recent poll, who have not heard of her (or are unsure how they view her). Harris is expected to instantly be considered a top-tier candidate, and her potential competitors — including Elizabeth Warren — are likely to eye her carefully.
Harris would “naturally attract a lot of buzz out of the gate," said Brian Fallon, a former press secretary for Hillary Clinton.
While other potential candidates have already made appearances in early primary and caucus states, Harris has offered a broad political message and focused on presenting herself as an enlightened former prosecutor and the daughter of immigrants — one from India and one from Jamaica — who has already made history as the second black woman elected to the Senate (and the first South-Asian American). She has won plaudits from Democrats for her willingness to oppose Trump.
“Look, political capital doesn't gain interest," she said at the New York event, recalling a phrase she instilled in her team while she was a prosecutor — and a possible hint of her plans. “So don't let it sit there. Spend it."
Harris is a relatively fresh face in national politics who has not faced stiff Republican opposition in a race since she was first elected California attorney general in 2010.
She is beginning to face more scrutiny, as when a New York Times op-ed last week argued her record as a prosecutor is not as progressive as she has made it out to be — a line of criticism that may grow in a party turning to the left on criminal justice.
“She is untested, and that's not a criticism — that's just the reality," said Darry Sragow, a political strategist in California. “I don't think anybody knows, including Kamala Harris, how it's going to work out."
Still, some Democratic groups and operatives are deeply intrigued by the prospect of Harris taking on Trump.
“We have the most divisive politician as president of the United States, and Senator Harris is the antithesis of that, its opposite, both in her policy outlook and her biography," said Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, who has known Harris since she was attorney general.
With her new book, “The Truths We Hold," Harris is telling this story.
Born in Oakland, Calif., in 1964, Harris grew up mostly in the care of her mother, Shyamala, a breast-cancer researcher. (Her sister Maya became a senior adviser to Clinton during her 2016 campaign.)
Harris was wheeled to civil rights marches in her stroller and decided early in life that she wanted to become a lawyer.
She attended Howard University, the historically black university in Washington, and became a prosecutor — a choice she says was driven by a desire to reform the system. “When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them in," Harris wrote.
Harris was elected district attorney for San Francisco in 2003 and ran for attorney general in 2010, winning a close race in which the Republican State Leadership Committee spent $1 million trying to defeat her.
During the New York book talk, Harris spoke warmly with a friendly moderator, moving easily between political platitudes — “Anything worth fighting for is a fight worth having," she said — and a spot-on impression of her New Jersey in-laws that drew peals of laughter from the crowd.
“She's a real human, and someone who talks about the truth in a way that I can resonate with," said Alison Fetten, 48, a newly elected member of the borough council in South Bound Brook, N.J., who watched the talk and said Harris was at the top of her list of presidential contenders.
Harris drew heavily on her work as a prosecutor. Asked about Trump's border wall, she spoke of dealing with transnational criminals: “The wall ain't gonna stop them!"
She has also touted a settlement she helped to secure from big banks that brought $20 billion in homeowner relief for Californians after the foreclosure crisis and emphasized her work on prison reentry initiatives, bail reform, and other pillars of criminal justice reform.
But some critics say Harris is painting an overly rosy picture of her time as prosecutor. A review in the Atlantic, for example, said her book “doesn't meaningfully reconcile her punitive track record as a California prosecutor with her more recent activist-adjacent positioning as a national Democratic darling."
Her spokeswoman, Lily Adams, said in a statement that Harris pushed for police accountability during her career and diverted young people to apprenticeship programs instead of prison.
“Kamala Harris has spent her career fighting for reforms in the criminal justice system," Adams said.
Harris is a formidable fund-raiser with a huge social-media following; online clips of her in Judiciary Committee hearings have been viewed millions of times.
She may also appeal to voters looking for a standard-bearer who embodies the party's diversity.
“The heart and soul of the Democratic Party today, and going into 2020, is fueled by women and candidates of color," said Mary Anne Marsh, a political strategist based in Boston.
That means the early primary map could be favorable to Harris, particularly if she connects with voters in her home state of California — which will vote much earlier than usual in 2020 — and with black voters in the southern states that helped power Clinton to a primary victory over Bernie Sanders in 2016.
But other likely candidates will be working hard to win over those same voters. Warren, who is among the potential candidates already hiring staff in key primary states, frequently mentions the role of racial discrimination in holding back people of color in her stump speech.
“I think Warren is very clearly showing that she understands the need to appeal to many of the same voters among whom Harris will have a quite natural appeal," Fallon said.
Warren and Harris may hit on similar themes about holding the powerful to account, since both are lawyers who have taken on corporate interests. (Warren, however, has built a reputation as more of an economic progressive.)
And both have been famously interrupted in the Senate, which rallied women to their sides. The phrase “Nevertheless, she persisted" originated when Warren was cut off by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell in 2017. And Warren herself tweeted the phrase in support of Harris when she, too, was interrupted by Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr while questioning Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Harris nodded to the phrase again in her book, when she recalled meeting with Warren while she was attorney general and Warren was developing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Harris told Warren she was not ready to sign on to any foreclosure settlement that would prevent her from doing her own investigation.
“As an administration official, she couldn't outright tell us to go our own way, but I got the strong sense she would understand if I persisted," Harris wrote.

Texto completo: The #10YearChallenge was all fun and memes until last week, when a tweet moved thousands of people to worry: Are we unknowingly helping giant corporations to improve their algorithms for biometric identification and age progression?
The #10YearChallenge gained widespread traction on social media this month. It calls for posting two photos of yourself side by side -- one from today and one from a decade ago -- to show how you've changed. People are participating mostly on Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.
Some made jokes, paid tribute to old hairstyles or drew attention to issues like global warming. Celebrities posted glamour shots that showed negligible changes from one decade to the next. (The singer Mariah Carey won this round. "I don't get this 10 year challenge," she wrote in a tweet, along with two identical photos side by side. "Time is not something I acknowledge.")
But one post went viral without featuring any side-by-side photos at all. It was written by Kate O'Neill, the author of the book "Tech Humanist: How You Can Make Technology Better for Business and Better for Humans."
"Me 10 years ago: probably would have played along with the profile picture aging meme going around on Facebook and Instagram," she wrote in a tweet last week. "Me now: ponders how all this data could be mined to train facial recognition algorithms on age progression and age recognition."
Her words hit a nerve.
People responded with concerns about whether they were helping the tech giant get better at identifying people. Ms. O'Neill's post got more than 10,000 retweets and more than 20,000 likes. She expanded on her thoughts in a widely shared article in Wired.
"I wondered about why this particular thought, in this particular moment, generated so much traction," Ms. O'Neill said on Friday, adding that she was not trying to stoke any panic.
Experts said the photos uploaded for the #10YearChallenge were drops in a very, very big bucket of data that Facebook has been collecting for years.
"We have an awful lot of data that we're sharing all the time, and companies are collecting it and using it in various ways," Ms. O'Neill said.
Supporters of facial recognition technologies said they can be indispensable for catching criminals or finding missing people. But critics warned that they can enable mass surveillance or have unintended effects that we can't yet fully fathom.
Lauren A. Rhue, an assistant professor of information systems and analytics at the Wake Forest School of Business, said the #10YearChallenge could conceivably provide a relatively clean data set for a company that wanted to work on age-progression technology.
But she added that Facebook already has billions of photographs on its platform, and people should be wary of any company being in possession of such a large trove of biometric data.
"The risk in giving up any type of biometric data to a company is that there's not enough transparency, not only about how the data is currently being used, but also the future uses for it," she said, pointing to another form of biometric data, DNA, which is increasingly being used by law enforcement to track down suspects -- something many people might not have anticipated when they volunteered saliva in exchange for help tracing their ancestral roots.
"There are things we don't think of as being threats," Professor Rhue said. "And then five or 10 years from now, we realize that there is a threat, but the data has already been given."
Like the rest of us, Facebook looked different 10 years ago. In 2009, the "Like" button was introduced, and the site unveiled a new home page to make it easier for people to see their friends' posts in real time. Facebook also reached 360 million active users in 2009; now, it has more than 2 billion.
Facebook announced that it was using facial recognition technology in 2010. When people upload photos of their friends, Facebook can use the technology to suggest the names of people in the picture. It can also alert users if they are in a photo posted by a friend.
Facebook has responded to concerns about photos and privacy in the past. The company said it does not intend to help strangers identify you, and has repeatedly pointed out that users can disable face recognition in their personal settings.
As for the 10-year challenge, Facebook said it's just a fun trend.
"The 10-year challenge is a user-generated meme that started on its own, without our involvement," the company said on Twitter.
Similar memes have popped up in past years, too. But this time, users are grappling with new concerns about a platform that helps people to stay in touch with grandparents but has also been used as a tool of Russian interference.
The company faced several crises in 2018. In March, it was revealed that a political consulting firm linked to President Trump had improperly obtained data on as many as 87 million Facebook users. The New York Times reported in November that company leaders had tried to play down major concerns about privacy or deflect blame, and in December that Facebook gave big technology companies more intrusive access to users' personal data than it had previously disclosed.
"The threat to privacy has become real to people in the last year," said Jennifer Lynch, the director of surveillance litigation for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. "My hope is that people will become concerned about this vast face recognition database that Facebook has amassed and push back on Facebook, turn off face recognition in our Facebook profiles, and push for strict privacy laws at the state and federal levels."
Ms. O'Neill said she was glad that the meme -- and her tweet -- started such a broad conversation about facial recognition and privacy.
"There's a lot of opportunities for technology to do wonderful things for humanity," she added. "But I think we need to recognize the potential downsides of it."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Battling internal power struggles, including accusations of anti-Semitism, the Women's March that roared onto the political scene following the election of Donald Trump as president is hitting the streets of Washington on Saturday, joined by "sister marches" in hundreds of other U. S. cities.
But a cause that in 2017 drew 3. 3 million to 5. 2 million nationwide – making it likely the largest demonstration in U. S. history – now may be lucky to attract half that many.
Demonstrations and rallies were held in Washington and at some 350 sites nationwide to display opposition to Trump, to demand an end to violence against women and to push for equality.
Marches are planned across the country, from Boston, to Los Angeles, to Dallas, Houston, Nashville, and in smaller cities like Burlington, Vermont. , and Grand Junction, Colorado.
In Madison, demonstrators began gathering early on the Capitol steps for a 10 a. m. rally, followed by a march into the Capitol building. One estimate put the crowd at at least 800.
In New York, because of internal disputes between organizers, rival marches turned out, one along Fifth Avenue and the other some 50 blocks away in Foley Square.
Rallies were also held in almost a dozen foreign cities, including Berlin, Rome and Kabul.
Unlike the first Women’s March in 2017, protesters — fewer in number this time — battled harsh winter weather, turning out in scarves and gloves. The cold did not dampen the mood, however, as protesters marched and chanted “this is what democracy looks like” and “women’s rights are human rights. ”
Like two years ago, many also sported the pink “pussy hats” made popular by the first march through the nation's capital.
Stephanie Helton, 52, attended the march with her husband, Joe Helton, 53, from Port Heuron, Michigan. She decided to attend the march immediately after Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
Helton said the energy at the march has been “wonderful. ”
“We’ve been worried about the direction of the country for a really long time, the assault on access to healthcare for millions and millions of Americans, the fact that we have a government that focuses on the issues that degrade members of our society and culture,” Helton said. “So, it’s great to be out here. We have lots of friends at home who told us ‘represent us! Represent us!’”
Even in cold, windy weather, the Bugnitz family flew from Columbus, Ohio to attend the march after Sadie, 10, Chris and Kristin’s daughter, learned about the march from a teacher.
“It’s really important to our family that girls and boys are all treated equally and we can listen to all voices,” Kristin Bugnitz said.
“A lot of people like Trump are being rude and sexist and trying to make sure that men only have the rights to do stuff,” Oliver Bugnitz, 7, said. “It’s not fair. ”
Noe Torres, came to the march with a group from Los Angeles. He wanted to attend the march to stand with the women in his life.
“Some of the strongest people in my life are the women in my life: my mom, my sister and my girlfriend,” Torres said. “I want to do my part in helping to undo the systemic oppression that’s keeping these amazing people from flourishing and thriving and doing something for this world. ”
The movement that galvanized the nation's capital has morphed from a show of force on the streets and sidewalks, into a mobilizing force at the polls.
As the movement has grown into a political powerhouse, it has also run into headwinds in the form of a splintered leadership and accusations of anti-Semitism against some of the original organizers.
The controversy, which prompted the Democratic National Committee and other groups to distance themselves from the Washington event, threatens to erode the movement’s gains, or at least slow its progress.
Without the motivation of Trump’s election or the midterms, the marches this year face such obstacles as travel inconveniences from the federal shutdown as well as harsh weather Saturday from the Midwest to New England.
“This is the heaviest lift they’re going to have,’’ said University of Maryland sociology professor Dana Fisher, author of the upcoming book “American Resistance. ’’
“In general, getting people to march in the winter is tough. It’s a hard ask, and right now there’s not an obvious goal, except for perhaps 2020 (the general election). I know Women’s March Inc. says they’re trying to use this as a pivot to start talking about doing more policy-based work, but I think that’s not a good mobilizer. ’’
In some ways, the movement is a victim of its own successes, the power of women at the ballot box — a direct result of the strong showing in the 2018 midterms that sent a record number of women into politics and into Congress.
Women, especially those in the suburbs, helped drive the Democrats’ 40-seat gain in the House of Representatives, flipping control of that chamber. A record 102 women – 89 of them Democrats – were voted into the House in November.
“You can draw a direct line from the 5 million who marched that day and our effort after that to impact elections to the makeup of the current Congress as the most diverse Congress that’s ever been elected,’’ said Vanessa Wruble, one of the leading organizers of the first march. “Already you see the movement shifting from reactive to proactive. ’’
However, with the growth has come distrust and division.
Much of the controversy stems from Women's March co-president Tamika Mallory's refusal to condemn Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a proponent of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories who recently described Jews as "termites. "
A detailed story by the Jewish online magazine Tablet said Women’s March board members Mallory and Carmen Perez – whom Wruble recruited to add diversity to the original organizing group of four – confronted her about the role Jews had in oppressing minorities.
Wruble, who is Jewish, was asked to leave the group shortly after the first march, and she told The New York Times her religion was a factor. She later co-founded March On, an organization that provides support and guidance to women-led groups throughout the country, and estimates 50 percent of Saturday’s "sister marches" will have gotten help from the group.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Fla. ), who attended the Women's March in 2017, published an op-ed in USA TODAY on Friday saying that she is "walking away" from the Women's March.
"I cannot associate with the national march’s leaders and principles, which refuse to completely repudiate anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry," Wasserman-Schultz wrote. "I cannot walk shoulder to shoulder with leaders who lock arms with outspoken peddlers of hate. "
Fisher said the controversy is taking a toll.
“Women’s March Inc. does not own the women’s movement, and it certainly does not own this march, which has been so much a combination of all of these locally distributed efforts across the country,’’ she said. “It’s a shame all of the bad press is having this effect. ’’
While Women's March Inc. has repeatedly denied charges of anti-Semitism, the issue was further inflamed when Mallory, a Women’s March co-president, appeared on ABC’s “The View’’ on Monday and declined to denounce the frequent anti-Semitic statements by Farrakhan, whom she has publicly lauded.
Women's March Inc. provided a statement about the "sister marches" Saturday, most of which are not affiliated with the group.
“Women's March is an organic movement, made of the fierce energy and power of millions of women and those who support them,’’ the statement said. “We're thrilled to see hundreds of marches sprout up in small towns, suburbs, and cities across America and around the globe. In 2017, we marched. In 2018, we took our power to the polls. In 2019, we're coming with an agenda created by women and for the people. ’’
In addition to addressing violence against women, that agenda includes items such as reproductive rights, racial justice and immigrant rights. The objectives are worthwhile enough for sponsors like the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood to remain on board.
A coalition of more than 100 supporters of the Jewish Women of Color signed a letter standing firm with the Women’s March.
On the other hand, the Jewish Democratic Council of America issued a statement joining the DNC and other groups pulling away from the Women’s March organization, though not the cause itself.

Texto completo: Thursday marked the 27th day of the US government shutdown, six days longer than the previous record, in 1995-1996. As a result, more than 800,000 federal workers nationwide are missing paychecks. Overall, the shutdown is estimated to be costing the US economy more than $1 billion a week.
In New England, the shutdown is being felt in a variety of ways. Here is a breakdown of employees by state and a look at cascading problems nationwide that could arise as a result of the shutdown.
New Hampshire
2,100 employees (46th). Departments with most affected workers: transportation, state, and agriculture.
Vermont
1,500 employees (47th tied). Departments with most affected workers: homeland security, agriculture, and interior.
Connecticut
1,500 employees (47th tied). Departments with most affected workers: homeland security, justice, and transportation.
Massachusetts
8,200 employees (18th). Departments with most affected workers: Treasury, transportation, and interior.
SOME KEY DATES
Throughout January : This is a critical month for science grants that are going unrewarded during the shutdown. Benjamin Corb, director of public affairs for the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, calculated how much funding National Science Foundation provided through Jan. 8 last year: $42 million in 2018 vs. $0 in 2019.
Jan. 25: Federal courts expected to deplete resources and may have to suspend some civil cases.
Jan. 28: The IRS begins processing tax returns and has recalled half its furloughed workers (without pay) to handle them and issue refunds. Audits will remain on hold.
Early February: The Census Bureau could run out of funding for work on the 2020 count, and rent subsidies from the Agriculture Department are expected to run out for nearly 270,000 rural low-income families.
Late February: The Food and Drug Administration would run out of funding to review new drug applications.
March : Federal food assistance program is at risk of running out. The country's AAA credit rating could be affected; and HUD's Section 8 rent vouchers for 2.2 million households may run out.

Texto completo: In the wake of bombshell allegations in a Massachusetts lawsuit filed against the maker of OxyContin, the mayor of Somerville is questioning whether two local and prestigious universities should strip the name of the family behind the pharmaceutical giant from its buildings.
In a Thursday tweet, referring to allegations by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's office, Somerville Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone wrote, “As a @Harvard graduate and Mayor of a city that's home to @TuftsUniversity, I think there needs to be a serious discussion about removing the Sackler name from those campuses given the revelations coming from @MassAGO about how #OxyContin was pushed in our state."
The Sacklers own Purdue Pharma, the Connecticut-based maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin, and the family name is on the walls at some of the world's great museums and universities. Harvard has the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. Tufts has the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences and the Arthur M. Sackler Center for Medical Education in Boston.
Members of the Sackler family have been accused in a lawsuit brought by the state of Massachusetts of deceiving patients and doctors about the risks of OxyContin.
A story published Tuesday in STAT, an online health and science publication produced by Boston Globe Media, detailed how Dr. Richard Sackler, who became Purdue cochairman in 2003, outlined a strategy two years earlier to blame addicts for mounting overdoses.
“By their misconduct, the Sacklers have hammered Massachusetts families in every way possible," the state's complaint read. “And the stigma they used as a weapon made the crisis worse."
In an e-mail Friday, a spokesman for Dame Jillian Sackler, the widow of Arthur M. Sackler, said Arthur Sackler had no connection to the opioid controversy and died nearly a decade before OxyContin came onto the market. She also said neither he nor his heirs are named in any of the lawsuits involving the drug.
During a phone interview Thursday night, Curtatone, who holds a master's of public administration from Harvard's Kennedy School, said he has yet to reach out to either school about sparking a discussion regarding the Sackler name at the universities but said he would consider doing so.
“I think we as a public should demand that they ask why," he said.
Tufts spokesman Patrick Collins said in a statement: “The Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences was established in 1980 by Jean Mayer, then president of Tufts University, and the Board of Trustees to promote collaborative and interdisciplinary graduate education to advance health."
He continued, “In 1983, Jean Mayer and the Board of Trustees established the Arthur M. Sackler Center. In both cases, the naming gifts were provided to the university more than a decade before OxyContin was introduced to the marketplace."
The Harvard Art Museums have stressed that the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation does not fund the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard: “Arthur Sackler generously donated the funds in 1982 that paid for the construction of the original building that housed the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at 485 Broadway. In 2014, the Arthur M. Sackler Museum was relocated to 32 Quincy Street, as part of the renovation and expansion of the Harvard Art Museums."
Messages left with Purdue Pharma were not returned Thursday night.

Texto completo: State Sen. Randy Feenstra's campaign to take on U.S. Rep. Steve King has gotten financial support just 10 days in: He claims he raised more than $100,000 and has a super PAC run by a former Iowa House speaker.
Feenstra, the chair of the Senate's Ways and Means committee, said he has received tremendous support from Iowa's 4th Congressional District as well national support.
Feenstra announced in early January he would vie against King — before the nine-term U.S. House member became embroiled in controversy over his comments on white nationalism and white supremacy.
Since the New York Times published quotes from King that seemed to embrace white supremacy, Republicans have stripped King of his committee posts and the House has rebuked him.
Among Feenstra's supporters is Christopher Rants, Iowa's state House speaker from 1992 to 2010 and a current lobbyist. He launched "Iowa Four PAC" Thursday, a new federal PAC to back Feenstra's bid for the 4th District GOP nomination. Rants registered the PAC with the Federal Election Commission Tuesday.
Rants said the PAC will help show 4th District Republicans they have other options for an "effective voice in Congress," and one that cares about Iowa issues.
"This is about trying to elect someone who cares more about what's happening in 4th District communities than talking about who's the mayor of Toronto," Rants said, referencing King's support of Faith Goldy, a white nationalist candidate for Toronto mayor.
Following the most recent King turmoil, several national Republican figures — including conservative commentator Ben Shapiro — weighed in with support for the state senator's bid.
Other conservatives, including Iowan Bob Vander Plaats of The Family Leader, Sens. Mitch McConnell and Mitt Romney and third-ranking House Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, have all called on the 4th District representative to step down.
King has not responded to calls for resignation. Instead, he sent out a campaign email to supporters which said the "rabid leftist media" and "NeverTrumpers" are coming after him for supporting President Donald Trump and because of his views on immigration.
This is Rants' first time launching a PAC for a congressional campaign, a necessary step as Republicans are concerned about holding the seat in the future.
Democrat challenger J.D. Scholten came close to unseating King in the 2018 midterms, receiving 47 percent of the vote to King's 50.4 percent in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats 190,000 to 120,000.
"(Fourth) District Republicans are tired of the embarrassment," Rants said. "Republicans are looking for a new voice and new leader in Congress, somebody who's actually focused on what matters."
But some analysts, like Brad Best, a political science professor at Buena Vista University, say conservative primary challengers shouldn't underestimate King's appeal to 4th District conservatives, or overestimate what 2018's close election means for future elections.
The 2018 election was unique because of the national anti-Trump sentiments in politics combined with a "high-quality challenger" in Scholten's campaign, Best said. Those factors might not be present in 2020, and King's previous controversial remarks have not been enough to make much impact in his previous elections, he said.
"A narrow win in a general election does not necessarily translate into vulnerability in the next primary," Best said in an email to the Des Moines Register.
"Though success is not impossible, Rep. King's challengers in the GOP have a tough road to travel; they'll have to draw heavily from sources of support — financially and rhetorically — from outside the district and outside the state."

Texto completo: Headnote Broadway Luminaries to Perform in let Freedom Ring' Concert
2019 has dawned as a different sort of year for many reasons, and not all good ones. But this year, the annual "Let Freedom Ring" concert, presented annually by Georgetown University in partnership with the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, is taking a new approach to the talent slated to perform with the Let Freedom Ring Choir, celebrating the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the annual holiday program.
This year, two performers usually associated with theater, Au-dra McDonald and Brian Stokes Mitchell, will share the marquee to present a new incarnation of the musical tribute to King. The two African-American luminaries are considered among the finest in musical theater currently performing.
McDonald is a multiple award winner for her roles in theatrical performances from "Carousel" to "Master Class." As the youngest recipient of three Tony Awards before the age of 30, she also has a dedication to African-American theater and music. Her legacy has been compared to that of Judy Garland and Barbara Streisand.
In 2004, she won a Tony for her role in "A Raisin in the Sun" and went on to reprise the performance in the made-for-television version with Sean "Diddy" Combs. She also received critical acclaim for her solo performance in "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill" adapted from the Broadway play for HBO.
She has also played major African-American characters in "Porgy and Bess" and was instrumental in reviving the Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake 1921 musical revue, "Shuffle Along," which she had to withdraw from performing to take an unexpected maternity leave.
"Maybe it is because my uncle and my parents were always very involved with the Civil Rights Movement., so I just grew up and I was raised that you have to speak out and look out for your fellow man, woman and child," McDonald said.
It is no coincidence that she will perform with Brian Stokes Mitchell, her frequent co-star who has played alongside her in "Shuffle Along" and also the Broadway version of "Ragtime," where Mitchell took on the role of protagonist Coalhouse Walker.
Dubbed the "Last Leading Man" by the New York Times, Mitchell's resume on Broadway and beyond is nearly unmatched by any performer, regardless of race.
Mitchell recently took the stage at Carnegie Hall for his solo debut, despite his long history in theater. The sold-out event where he performed with a 42 piece orchestra conducted by Paul Gemignani, saw him joined by some of his past leading ladies including Reba McEntire, Heather Headley and Phylicia Rashad.
Mitchell is best known for his work on the Broadway stage, where he has received impressive accolades, including Broadways highest honor, the Tony Award. Mitchell appeared most recently on Broadway in the revival of "Man of La Mancha," portraying the dual roles of Cervantes and Don Quixote and earning a Tony nomination and a Helen Hayes Award for his work.
The pair will perform part of the concert with the Let Freedom Ring Choir, created in 2006 for the King Day celebration. The choir, made up of local church choir singers and students from Georgetown University, is directed by Rev. Nolan Williams Jr., a local musician and scholar whose resume includes minister of music for Metropolitan Baptist Church and chief music editor of the critically acclaimed "The African American Heritage Hymnal."
The concert also includes the annual bestowal of a humanitarian award to a community activist who has played a significant role in the betterment of life through the lens of King's legendary work.
The yearly concert, held on the King holiday, is free and open to the public, with tickets to the concert being distributed onsite at the Kennedy Center's Hall of Nations beginning at 4:30 p.m. on Jan. 21.

Lawmakers here today, gone to Maui

Texto completo: As November and its slight autumnal chill — along with whipping Santa Ana winds, and huge wildfires in the north and the south — descends upon California every year, a state legislator’s mind turns to … well, naturally, to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
That’s where 10 members of the California Assembly and two state senators gathered this past November along with some of the state’s top power company officials at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort. It was four days of mai tais, long walks on the beach and casual conversation about just how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the destruction wrought by the fires that look to have been sparked in several cases by their company equipment.
Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the California Independent Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed, according to a report in The New York Times.
Uh huh. Perhaps by some formal definition, such as the names of specific numbered bills not being spoken out loud, there might have been no “lobbying” underneath the palm trees. But of course the utilities are trying to influence the politicians. Consumer Watchdog reports that the annual event’s sponsors included Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, utilities that contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.
Yes, this luau goes on every year and yes, we have criticized its untoward appearance in the past. We understand that the parties that attend the, well, party, who fork out $8,000 apiece to attend, “pay their own way” to do so. For the politicians, that means wealthy campaign donors foot the bill. Donors such as Edison and PG&E.
But as the latter goes into bankruptcy and all of the investor-owned utilities hit the panic button over their current and future wildfire-stoked liabilities, this looks worse than ever. Californians were running for their lives in Malibu and Paradise, and a dozen of their representatives in Sacramento were schmoozing with utility execs, buffeted by gentle trade winds.
The attendees were Assembly members Frank Bigelow, Bill Brough, Ian Calderon, Jim Cooper, Tom Daly, Heath Flora, Jim Frazier, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Freddie Rodriguez and Blanca Rubio, along with state Sens. Ben Hueso and Cathleen Galgiani.
Defenders of the yearly bash say that, yes, it’s in a nice corner of the world, but that it’s important for lawmakers to be able to visit with utility execs about the issues that concern the hard-pressed industry.
Here’s what Jack Pitney, the former Republican National Committee staffer and current Claremont McKenna College political science professor says: “Going to Maui for a public-policy conference is perfectly appropriate if, say, you work for the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. It does not make sense if your portfolio is in California. . . . There are plenty of conference centers throughout the state. If you wanted to get actual work done, you’d meet in Glendale, where there aren’t many distractions.”
And it’s not just the optics that concern us. The situation could not be more fraught with danger for California taxpayers as the utilities scramble for their financial lives. After the 2017 Maui confab, legislators put forward and approved a bill that allowed PG&E to issue billions of dollars in bonds that would help pay for wildfire damages earlier that year. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill and then allowed the company to pass those costs on to its ratepayers.
Who knows what utility-backed legislation will blow in from the tropics this legislative session?

King's removal comes during terrible time for state's farmers

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Steve King's removal from the House Agriculture Committee over racist comments eliminates a voice for Iowa farmers at the worst possible time, state leaders say.
"Iowa, a leading ag state, no longer has a representative on a committee that's critically important to them" and that's causing "a lot of concern," said Kirk Leeds, CEO of the Iowa Soybean Association.
This is the first time in 120 years that an Iowan hasn't been a member of the influential House committee.
Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig called losing a seat on the House ag committee disappointing.
Comments like King's "are offensive and are not representative of Iowa or the 4th district," said Naig, who grew up on his family's farm near Cylinder in King's northwest Iowa district.
King's removal comes as Iowa farmers are grappling with several tough issues: fifth year of low corn and soybean prices that's torpedoing profits; ongoing trade wars that have reduced exports and resulted in federal trade bailout payments; and implementation of a new farm bill, among other concerns, Leeds said.
"It's a terrible time to not be at the table," said Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union board.
King, a Republican, is under fire for his remarks in the New York Times last week questioning how white supremacy and white nationalism became offensive terms. On Monday, Republican leaders removed King from his committee assignments.
On Tuesday, House members passed an resolution rebuking King's comments. The Kiron lawmaker voted in favor of the resolution, which passed 424-1.
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country."
King said his comments to the New York Times did not come across as he intended.
Republican and Democratic leaders called for his resignation Tuesday. U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, an Iowa Democrat, said King should resign for the "good of the people of Iowa."
With King's loss of committee assignments, "he is no longer able to effectively serve the people of Iowa," Loebsack said in a statement. "It's past time for him to be held accountable for his actions."
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said it "will be a lot harder" for King to represent Iowa without committees seats.
Grassley, a Republican, said King will have to do what he does when he has a concern but doesn't have a seat on the committee discussing the issue. "I'll go talk with individuals on the committee and impress upon them the things I think need to be done," Grassley said in a call with reporters.
In addition to agriculture, King sat on small business and judiciary committees.
He also was on subcommittees overseeing foreign agriculture and livestock; nutrition; agriculture, energy and trade; contracting and workforce; and immigration and border security.
King was chairman of the subcommittee on constitution and civil justice. He's been on the ag committee since he was first elected to Congress in 2003.
Opponents have criticized King for not getting more legislation passed. But he's been a strong advocate on ethanol and biodiesel, and reducing regulations for farmers, among other issues, said Leeds, the Iowa Soybean Association CEO.
But, he added, King's controversial statements "have certainly impacted his ability to represent Iowa's interests."
Tim Hagle, a University of Iowa political science professor, said King's power to push state interests will be diminished.
"He's become so toxic, he couldn't go out and advocate for any particular ag issue," Hagle said. "Instead of talking about the agricultural issue, people will be talking about things he's said on immigration or race."
King's constituents might have believed he's been "picked on and misunderstood" in the past, but that might change with Republican leaders removing him from the ag committee, Hagle said.
King can only argue that journalists have "taken him out of context so many times," he said.
Lehman said King's past controversial statements already could have hurt Iowa farmers. The Iowa lawmaker was not part of the House and Senate conference committee that hammered out the new farm bill, which passed last year.
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, was on the conference committee and is a member of the Senate ag committee.
Lehman said he wished that King would have stayed focused on issues important to Iowa farmers, many of whom are struggling financially.
"We have farmers meeting with their landlords, their bankers, their suppliers, trying to find ways to make ends meet," he said.
King's comments about race are "not central to issues farmers are facing now. It's a distraction at best and at worst, they're embarrassments," Lehman said.
"I find very few farmers who agree with Steve King on these issues," he said.
Many Republicans have spoken out against King's remarks, including Grassley and Ernst. Both had previously campaigned with King.
The last time Iowa wasn't represented on the House Agriculture Committee was in the 55th Congress in 1897, according to the congressional directories. Iowa has had consistent membership, starting in the 56th Congress in 1899.
Rep. Steve King has been on the ag committee since 2003.

Texto completo: In the 1950s, women across the country wore practical, button-down housedresses with tight waists and deep pockets. In the '80s, shoulder pads were a symbol of power in the workplace, but also up and down supermarket aisles. In the aughts, moms (and their daughters) wore a whole lot of Juicy Couture velour sweatsuits.
For years, black Lululemon yoga pants and Uggs were the axis of the mom uniform, until the media cruelly shamed women out of them. Then last year, a pair of deliberately beaten-up-looking $500 Golden Goose sneakers and what is known as simply the "Amazon jacket," a $130 parka, was seen on moms in Chappaqua and Short Hills alike.
But in Brooklyn recently, a decidedly more bohemian expression of middle-aged fashion has emerged.
This ensemble is made up of two accessories: Part 1 is the No. 6 clog, which has become ubiquitous in upscale Brooklyn neighborhoods and on celebrities like Keri Russell, Julianne Moore and Claire Danes.
Part 2 is the Salt strap, a thick, detachable handbag strap woven from bright colors, made to hook onto luxury bags, as Salt's Instagram account promotes vividly, like the $2,500 Gucci, the $3,300 Hermès, a $2,600 Celine or a $1,700 Chloé.
Zora Ginsburg, a mother of two and a sales specialist for Rebecca Taylor who lives in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, has been wearing her No. 6 clogs for about eight years. She owns them in a variety of colors -- the shearling, the slides, the zip-up boots -- and never deviates from the brand. When she's not wearing No. 6 clogs, she's wearing Isabel Marant bootees and Dr. Martens.
Ms. Ginsburg was introduced to the strap by her friend Kacy Lubell, an owner of Salt, and rotates multiple straps between her Balenciaga, Fendi and Proenza Schouler PS1 bags. (Ms. Ginsburg once helped style a Salt shoot and in return received a strap; the rest, she paid for.)
Ms. Ginsburg was glad to see the strap taking off around Brooklyn and didn't think that an army of look-alike moms was impeding her look.
"It's like we're matching," she said, noting that the strap reminded her of the woven friendship bracelets she used to make in camp. "It's a unique way of styling yourself. When I see someone in a strap or a clog I don't have, I think, 'That looks good. I want that."'
This wasn't the intention, to be so matchy. "We view the Salt strap more as a way to make your bag unique," Ms. Lubell wrote in an email. "Customers send us so many bag and strap combinations and it seems like everyone is wearing it differently." (Ms. Lubell said she "lives" in her No. 6 clogs and her strap.)
Yet sometimes it seems that choosing to wear the same clothing as the people around us is a lot less about our materialistic desires than it is about our evolutionary development as humans.
That women in the same area are drawn to similar styles makes sense. Our evolutionary prehistory shows that we needed many people to help us raise our offspring, so we surrounded ourselves with those who had similar values or who looked like us.
We can still see an echo of that today, said Wednesday Martin, a social researcher whose most recent book is "Untrue," a study of female infidelity.
Ms. Martin owns four pairs of No. 6 clogs; she keeps two in her Manhattan apartment, the other two she keeps at her house in Sag Harbor. She does not own a strap, but she is familiar with them.
Ms. Martin compares the woman who dresses like her peer group to the bonobo ape: a female-dominant species that leaves its kin behind and bands together to form new communities to fend off male aggression.
"You can see how important it is for mothers to do this particularly when you consider how strange and isolating and depleting we have made motherhood in our culture," she said. "Through very canny social strategizing, we survived as a species through affiliating with others and by making others feel like kin."
Like the man in the gray flannel suit showed, or the Pink Ladies with their embroidered pink jackets in "Grease," or the Teddy Girls of London with their rolled up dungarees and blazers, or sure, mom jeans, wearing the same clothing sends a signal: On the one hand, it links you to people you want to resemble, and on the other it separates you from people you don't want to resemble.
The idea that fashion has these conflicting sides was first theorized by the sociologist Georg Simmel at the turn of the 20th century, according to Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "It's like a double-edged knife," she said. "It made you part of a group, and it also made you an individual away from another group."
"So you always had that 'Oh the horror,' of women in the '50s when they went to a party and someone was wearing the same dress," she said. "But I think that overlooks the fact that in many other ways, women wanted other women in their group to be wearing very similar clothes."
SaSaDi Odunsi, 42, a Park Slope mother of four and the co-owner of a bead collective, owns two pairs of No. 6 clogs as well as the blue and white "Duke" Salt strap, currently hooked onto an Oliveve snake-print leather bag.
She bought the strap because her children and Ms. Lubell's children attend school together and she wanted to support a "mom-owned business." Recently, she has seen a number of women around town wearing the strap/clog combo, which she gets a kick out of.
"There's a pretty affluent population of parents here, without question, which will help define whether or not people are buying certain things," Ms. Odunsi said. "Because we all know these things cost money. And sometimes when a trend is outrageously expensive, I look around and think, 'Ooh, there's a lot of people who can afford a lot of those things."' She lives in Park Slope, after all, where the average home goes for about $1.2 million.
Earth-mother message aside, a pair of No. 6 clogs can cost upward of about $450, and the strap, at $140, is marketed with bags that 99 percent of women can't afford.
Yet because of its straight-out-of-Laurel-Canyon-circa-1969 look, combined with a charitable element (Salt has a partnership with artisans from the La Guajira region of Colombia, according to its website, and donates a portion of its proceeds to the Wayúu Tayá Foundation, a Colombian nonprofit), the strap, in a way, "counters or at least reduces the extravagance of the bag," said Carolyn Mair, a psychologist and founder of a consultancy firm, Psychology.fashion.
"I think it's less acceptable now, at least in some circles, to be totally oblivious to the problems in the world," Ms. Mair said. "So perhaps by wearing the strap, these women want to be seen as acknowledging issues elsewhere by supporting a social cause."
Same goes for the clogs, which in many ways can't be separated from their working-class present (clogs show up in the workplace on cooks, nurses, farmers and gardeners) and past. (They originated among Dutch dairy farmers and later became a common work shoe in Europe during the Industrial Revolution.)
They're not known to be pretty or dainty, or even fashionable. In an oft-cited article on the clog, Lauren Mechling, who is behind the Instagram account Clog Life (and has contributed to The New York Times), wrote that her husband once compared them to "oversized eggplants."
For moms, specifically, the No. 6 clog gives off a message that you're very much interested in comfort and not so interested in appearance. Harling Ross, the fashion editor at Man Repeller, described this as "Menocore," a hateful takeoff on normcore, celebrated mostly by women in their 20s on Instagram who haven't even started going through perimenopause yet.
It's also possible that this new uniform is just about good timing. The Salt strap, for example, is benefiting from the handbag industry slump.
"Right now, the handbag industry is missing an 'It' shape and an 'It' brand," said Debbie Forman-Pavan, a luxury and contemporary accessories consultant. With this strap, she said, women can give their $4,000 Hermès bag or their $500 Michael Kors bag a "little face-lift for just 140 bucks."
If only an actual face-lift cost so little -- am I right, ladies?

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro said Wednesday he would not issue a pardon for President Trump.

"I would not be inclined to issue a pardon, because I don't think that anybody should be above the law," he told a crowd in New Hampshire.

That would mean no help for Trump from Castro if he wins the 2020 contest and the ongoing Russia-related investigations find wrongdoing by Trump.


Last week the New York Times reported that Trump became the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation after he fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. That inquiry has since been wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, which the president has routinely deried as a "witch hunt."

The visit to early-voting New Hampshire is the first for Castro since he formally joined the 2020 race.

The former Obama administration housing chief and former mayor of San Antonio officially launched a White House bid on Jan. 12.

Texto completo: "This body must speak out against this evil."
Rep. James Clyburn
D-S.C.
WASHINGTON – The House nearly unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday condemning Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, for questioning why phrases such as "white supremacist" are offensive.
King voted for the resolution himself. It passed 424 to 1.
Before the vote, King said he agreed with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn's resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy." The resolution invoked King's comments and condemned such words as "hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States."
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country.
"I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's vote for this resolution. I'm putting up a yes on the board here," King said.
He said his "white supremacist" comments had not come across as he intended.
King sat alone on the GOP side of the chamber as Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, urged his colleagues to support the resolution. A handful of Republicans sat nearby. Many stood up to condemn racism.
On the other side of the aisle, about two dozen Democrats sat in rapt silence as Clyburn, a civil rights veteran, invoked the work of Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday was Tuesday.
"Now is the time to do right," Clyburn said before the vote. "This body must speak out against this evil."
The sole "no" vote came from Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., an African-American, who said the measure did not go far enough.
Minimally, King should be censured, Rush said Tuesday, and if he continues making such remarks, he should be expelled from Congress.
"Steve King has made a career out of being a racist, and he needs to be called out as such," he said.
The vote followed a series of condemnations from lawmakers in both parties. A handful of prominent Republicans said King should leave Congress, and top House Republicans voted Monday not to assign King any committees in the new Congress. King was on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
He had been the chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee when Republicans controlled the House.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?" King said in an interview with The New York Times last week. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
"The House Republicans denounce his language. We do not believe in his language, and we've decided that he will not serve on any" committees, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Tuesday. He said it was up to King whether he should resign.
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the No. 3 House Republican, went further, echoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: "I think that he should find another line of work," she said. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also called on King to resign.
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, 235-199, with the help of a coalition of women, African-Americans and Hispanics. They ushered in the most diverse class yet, breaking records for the number of women and minorities. The House GOP became less diverse, seeing a decline in the number of women and the loss of the sole African-American Republican woman in the House, Mia Love of Utah.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., applauded Republican leaders for their "strong" actions against King on Tuesday. "I think they did the right thing," he said. "I think they're very concerned about their party being perceived as a Steve King party."
Hoyer said the party was discussing two measures that would censure King – one by Rush and a more narrow one from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio – acknowledging that such actions could open a Pandora's box. "It is a big deal to be censured," he said.
Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce, the first Republican to join Ryan's censure resolution and a member of the steering committee that stripped King of his committees, told USA TODAY he tried to have a "man-to-man" conversation with King when he "made stupid comments" about immigrants in 2013.
"My point was that when you say stupid things, it splashes on all of us," Joyce said. "He said, well, he gets good publicity out of it. I said, 'Well you need to think about other people here because it's not right.'"

25 years of 'Midnight': 'The Book' had an indelible impact on Savannah

Texto completo: Fewer than 3 million people were making trips to Savannah in the mid-1980s, but one of those people would go on to help put the Hostess City on the map as a sought-after destination.
"It's changed my life completely - for the better I think, obviously," said John Berendt, author of the New York Times bestseller "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," known to many locals simply as "The Book."
A tale of mystery and murder centered around antique dealer Jim Williams and a host of other eccentric characters who could only be found in Savannah, the book spent 216 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list after its release Jan. 13, 1994, thrusting Savannah into the national spotlight and helping lay the foundation for the city's ever-growing tourism industry.
Between hardback, paperback and audio, more than 4 million copies have been sold domestically.
'Stumbled on Savannah'
"I had a column in Esquire magazine and I would do a different subject every month, and I couldn't get very deep into any subject I chose for the column. ... So I thought it was time to write
a book, but I didn't know what I would write about," Berendt said.
"I stumbled on Savannah at that moment and I threw myself into it and I was crazy about Savannah and Savannahians."
Berendt said it wasn't just the city's beauty that attracted him, but also the humor in Savannah, which he said was intoxicating and very appealing.
"The people I met in Savannah had a certain ironic sense of humor, which in the book you can see with Joe Odom and (Lady) Chablis; both had that ironic sense, sort of joking outlook," he said.
Though tourism took off in the mid-1990s, Savannah in the 1980s was a little different, Berendt said.
"There were very few people on the street and Broughton Street was all boarded," he said, recalling the growth and changes in the city, including trips to the now-demolished Johnny Harris restaurant on Victory Drive, Crystal Beer Parlor and frequent meals at Elizabeth on 37th with Williams, who would often take home multiple desserts and always insisted on paying.
Did he expect the book to be as successful as it turned out to be? Not quite.
"I thought as I was writing it that people are going to enjoy this book because it's entertaining. It's about a murder, but it's not a gruesome book, so I thought people who are going to read it are going to like it, but I didn't have any expectation that it was going to be a bestseller," he said.
"Someone asked me, 'Do you think it'll be a bestseller?' and I said, 'Are you kidding? Look what's in it.' ... I thought there will be some word of mouth and it'll sell modestly and that's what my hopes were for it."
Changing tourism
Berendt, of course, doesn't take all of the credit for Savannah's growth, but looking at the numbers and listening to the chatter, it's obvious the book made and continues to make an impact.
According to records from Visit Savannah, about 5,010,000 people visited Savannah in 1993, spending $587 million; in 1994, visitors increased to 5,029,000, contributing $629 million to the local economy. The following year, in 1995, visitor numbers jumped to 5,348,000 and spending increased to $673.4 million.
"There's been a tremendous evolution, especially on River Street. We opened Spanky's in December 1976 and the plaza wasn't dedicated until June 1977, so in those days you could shoot a cannon off River Street and not hit anyone," said Ansley Williams of Live Oak Restaurant Group.
"We just tried to make it to St. Patrick's Day."
But then came the book and things started to change.
"That was a major league shot in the arm. We saw a spike in business immediately and another bump when the movie came out," Williams said.
"Then came Tom Hanks and 'Forrest Gump' and that was another blip on the screen and we were thrilled about all of it."
Angela Sergi opened Savannah Heritage Tours nearly 12 years ago, and at that time, she said, no one
really had a tour dedicated to the book, so she decided to offer her own.
"People said, 'People are tired of that book,' and I thought, 'No they're not,'" Sergi recalled.
The tour covers how Williams got his start in Savannah along with highlighting more than 20 of the homes he restored, the murder trial, Bonaventure Cemetery and a variety of the eccentric characters found in the book.
"When I started out in 2007, I had a little 15-passenger van and I was going out twice a day on that tour, seven days a week," Sergi said. "... The book has really had a huge impact on Savannah."
Sergi said some of her customers travel to Savannah because of the book, but others have just heard of the book or movie and are curious to learn more.
"I think it's truly the unique characters that are in it. Joe Odom, who partied all the time, and of course, Lady Chablis, she's the most popular character in the story and the fact that she played herself in the movie, people were coming here just to see her," Sergi said of why she thinks people continue to be captivated by the book.
"That always helped me out when she was in town."
Stepping stones
Though he didn't live in Savannah in the 1990s, Visit Savannah president Joseph Marinelli said people often tell him how much the area has improved since then, which is the best compliment to get.
"Today I look at the vibrancy of it all and just kind of smile," Marinelli said.
The impact of the book can be seen on any given day in the historic district, with visitors often carrying a copy and identifying landmarks, as well as still being a strong seller at the Visit Savannah gift shop and visitors center on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, he said.
When the Clint Eastwood-directed adaption of the book was released in theaters in November 1997, visitors numbers and interest jumped again.
"The book and the movie are part of the stepping stones of Savannah's modern history of becoming a visitor destination," Marinelli said.
Mystique continues
As far as why people are still captivated by "Midnight," it's simple: It's still a great book, Marinelli said.
"The mystique of the characters, whether they're fictional or not, and the intrigue of how the book tells the story about the city is still driving people here. People are still curious, because there are very few places in this country that have the live oaks, Spanish moss and the cobblestones and squares," he said.
"I think the combination of how the book was written and the fact that you can still come here today and experience what is portrayed in the book is what drives people here."
Though the book isn't the showpiece the organization uses to market the city to visitors, it still has a large presence, Marinelli said.
"It's still woven through our blog posts and social media," he said, including a guide on its website that takes visitors from the Mercer House on Monterey Square to the Telfair Academy to view the Bird Girl statue made famous on the book's cover to Bonaventure Cemetery and Clary's Cafe on Abercorn Street.
Marinelli said it's not just in Savannah that he and his team get quizzed about the book, either.
"We go to Atlanta, New York, Toronto, Charleston and meet with editors of national publications and it's fascinating to me that when we're having those conversations, people still inquire about certain characters or certain landmarks from the book to this day," he said, adding the people often ask about the Lady Chablis and Clary's.
"I think the fact that the book was so well-written and has been a bestseller for 25 years still is intriguing to people and we still get asked about it even when we're in a meeting with the biggest editors of publications, so it's just fascinating."

Texto completo: Steve King, known as much for the controversial things he says as he is for anything he's done in Congress, may have finally lost the support of key Iowa Republicans who have long stood by him.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" he's quoted as saying in a Jan. 10 New York Times article that highlighted King's long history of racially fueled rhetoric, particularly around immigration.
That quote has resulted in a steady drumbeat of denunciations from King's fellow Republicans, the stripping of his committee assignments in Congress and, on Tuesday, a formal, nearly unanimous condemnation on the floor of the House.
King adamantly denies supporting white nationalism and white supremacy. But this month's developments come less than three months after his last major controversy, in which he met with members of an Austrian far-right political party associated with neo-Nazi movements.
But King has made comments throughout his 16-year Congressional career that those on the left as well as the right have castigated as inflammatory, controversial, racially insensitive, racist and harmful to American discourse.
So why does this moment feel like a turning point for King's career?
Iowa Republicans interviewed by the Register say it's a confluence of factors in a unique political moment:
For Republicans seeking election in Iowa and across the country, King has become a political liability. For those who share many of his views on immigration and the border wall, he's become a distraction. And in Iowa's 4th District, where voters have elected him nine times, he appears to be — for the first time in his career — beatable.
Becoming a political liability David Kochel, a Republican strategist who advised Gov. Kim Reynolds' 2018 election campaign, calls King "the largest in-kind contribution Nancy Pelosi's received" because of the drag King represents to other Republican candidates.
"District by district, Republican candidates get asked about his comments," he said. "It is never in a context that is helpful to our candidates. ... The laundry list of comments that he's made, positions that he's taken over the course of several years — it's untenable for our candidates to have to answer for someone like that."
King made headlines right before the 2018 midterm elections in which he and Reynolds both were competing in closely contested campaigns.
With such a close race, could Reynolds afford to alienate King's voters by publicly denouncing him? But become too cozy, and she risked losing many of the more moderate Republicans across Iowa's other three districts.
She threaded the needle by condemning King's comments without removing him as one of her campaign co-chairs — an almost entirely symbolic position that enraged Democrats who thought Reynolds should have distanced herself more.
After the election, she came out with a more forceful denunciation of King, saying King "needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the 4th District or do something else, and I think he needs to take a look at that."
Kochel disputes the idea that Reynolds should have made that statement before Election Day.
"Gov. Reynolds is responsible for what she says and what she believes," he said. "And that's part of why I think there is a major effort now in the party to find the right candidate and defeat (King) in a primary."
Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst will be on the ballot in 2020 and no doubt will be questioned, as Reynolds was, about her thoughts on King. This month, Ernst joined other Republicans in condemning King's comments.
Nationally, Republicans lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives and may already be looking toward their ability to manage a 2020 cycle in which Democrats will undoubtedly seek to highlight Republican President Donald Trump's similarly controversial comments. Publicly admonishing King now helps them make the case that they don't tolerate racism within their party.
A growing distraction Other Republicans who live and work in King's district say they've known and respected King for years but are finding it increasingly difficult to support him.
Rep. Matt Windschitl, the speaker pro tempore of the Iowa House and a Missouri Valley Republican, said that for some, the constant controversy may be starting to pile up and outweigh the conservative work King has done in Congress.
"I think that many of his comments have distracted from the message that needs to be put forward," said Windschitl, who has championed an expansion of gun rights and restrictions on abortions.
Rep. Steve Holt, a Republican from Denison and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he agrees with King on things like immigration, border security and the need for a wall along the nation's southern border. Holt last year led an effort to outlaw so-called sanctuary cities in Iowa and has been a fierce advocate for "the rule of law."
"This isn't helpful because this is not what conservative values are about," Holt said.
"This is not what the Republican Party is about. The Republican Party is about advancing conservative values that I believe are in the best interest of everybody, regardless of their sex and regardless of their color. So, of course it's not helpful, because it's a distraction that isn't needed."
Belief that he's beatable Republicans also say that J.D. Scholten, King's Democratic challenger in the 2018 race, deserves some credit for this political moment.
Scholten showed for the first time since King first took office that not only is King potentially beatable but, with the right set of circumstances, he could even be beaten by a Democrat.
Republicans outnumber Democrats 190,000 to 120,000 in the 4th District, and many of those Republicans remain fiercely loyal to King. But Scholten came within 11,000 votes of King in the midterm elections — the closest call of King's political career.
Put up the right Republican — someone who matches King's deep-red, conservative bona fides with a base of support in the district and the ability to raise money — and it's possible King could be defeated in a primary.
State. Sen. Randy Feenstra, R-Hull, announced a primary challenge to King the day before the Times story was published.
Feenstra, who is chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, shepherded one of the most substantial tax cuts in state history through the Iowa Legislature last year.
His primary challenge is seen as credible in ways that many of King's other previous challengers have not, in part because his candidacy wasn't dreamed up by a group of Republicans from outside the district who recruited him to the race.
"Both Rep. King and President Trump benefit from the same odd phenomenon," said Brad Best, a political science professor at Buena Vista University. "They both have lengthy records of controversial, offensive remarks that, paradoxically, serve to trivialize the effects of any subsequent bad behavior."
In King's first eight Congressional races, there was no electoral cost, Best said. King won handily.
"The context in which King maneuvers is, however, changing," Best said. "And a growing number of Republicans with sound political credentials are betting that 'King fatigue' is peaking in the 4th District."

Trump's poor approach to border concerns

Texto completo: How fitting is it that President Donald Trump's first Oval Office address, which he requested be televised live in prime time by every major network, was aimed at stirring up the American public about a crisis largely of his own making?
Not that the border crisis is one of Trump's self-serving political fictions - like the deep state or widespread voter fraud. It may have started out that way, but the situation has, with the president's nurturing, become something far more tragic.
Pursuing poorly thoughtout and even more poorly executed policies on the pretext of battling a nonexistent national security crisis, Trump has helped create a pressing humanitarian one. Desperate migrant families being detained en masse at the border are overwhelming a system pushed beyond its limits by an administration that chose to ignore the implications of its actions - overcrowding, children falling gravely ill and, paradoxically, the haphazard release of throngs of detainees into border communities stretching from California to Texas.
Trump is now invoking the urgency of the situation as a justification for pursuing more wasteful, hard-line measures that most Americans do not support, chiefly the ludicrous border wall over which he has shut down critical pieces of the government.
The president and his enablers have been busily knitting together inaccurate data, misleading anecdotes, exaggerations and other "alternative facts" about the flow of criminals, drugs and terrorists across the southern border. He seems to hope he can paint a dystopian landscape of security threats and human suffering so dire that the American people will rally to his side and pressure congressional Democrats to succumb to his demands for a towering wall - preferably concrete, but at this point, it seems, steel will suffice.
Failing that, Trump has also been floating the possibility of stiff-arming Congress altogether. With his advisers increasingly anxious that Republican lawmakers are poised to abandon them on the shutdown, the president has raised the threat of declaring a national emergency, which he thinks would allow him to command the Pentagon to build his wall.
Such a move would prompt a swift and furious legal challenge, if not a fullblown constitutional crisis, that could drag on indefinitely. It would, however, also give Trump a way to reach a wall-free funding deal with Congress without losing face, thus weaseling out of the shutdown box into which he has nailed himself.
The border wall began life as an applause line at Trump's rallies, and it has endured as the rare - perhaps even sole - policy objective that actually matters to him. The substance of true border security may not interest him much, but this symbol sure does.
While Trump proved a wily campaigner and political street fighter, as president he has been painfully out of his element. Two years in, he remains ill suited to the complicated, thankless, often grinding work of leading the nation. Governance clearly bores him, as do policy details both foreign and domestic. He has proved a poor judge of talent. He prefers grandstanding to negotiating, and he continues to have trouble with the whole concept of checks and balances. While the Republican base remains enamored of him, most of the electorate has grown weary of his outrages and antics.
Which is why, with his wall on the line, Trump so desperately needs to convince the American people that they are facing an acute crisis - maybe even a bona fide emergency.
In times of trouble, an anxious public looks to its leaders, and the ability to telegraph strength, decisiveness and certitude assumes greater value than in periods of calm and prosperity. Circle-the-wagons patriotism, maybe even a little jingoism, becomes more appealing. People long to feel protected.
With his demagogy, Trump managed to fuel a sense of insecurity and unease throughout his campaign, along with the idea that he alone could Make America Great Again. In office, he has attempted to perpetuate that angst by proclaiming existential threats to the Republic, be they migrant caravans storming the border, Muslim terrorists flooding the airports or violent immigrants roaming the countryside. Shutting down the government is only the most recent effort at getting what he wants by traumatizing the nation he has sworn to serve.
Were Trump truly interested in securing the border, and easing the suffering his policies are making worse, there are immediate steps he could take. For starters, he could end this wretched shutdown so that the people responsible for protecting the border can get paid, immigration judges can return to processing asylum claims and, yes, the physical and virtual barriers already in place can be maintained and perhaps even improved.

Texto completo: Former Attorney General William Barr was on Capitol Hill Tuesday for confirmation hearings after President Donald Trump nominated him to return to his role as head of the Justice Department.
Because the new attorney general will oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election, Trump's nomination has received more scrutiny from the public and politicians than usual.
Trump's critics have been anxious for him to replace acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who they say is unqualified and unfit to oversee Mueller's investigation. Many of those same critics have expressed concerns about Barr because of his previous statements and opinions on the extent of executive power.
So who is the man Trump picked to replace the ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions?

William Barr: 7 things to watch at Senate confirmation hearing for Trump's AG pick
Early years
Barr, 68, earned his undergraduate degree in government from Columbia University in 1971 and his master's degree in government and Chinese studies from the same university in 1973, according to his profile at his current law firm, Kirkland & Ellis. After receiving his graduate degree he spent fours years working for the CIA.
Barr got his law degree from George Washington University in 1977, where he graduated with "highest honors. " After clerking for Judge Malcolm Wilkey of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Barr went to work in the Reagan administration.
From 1982 to 1983, he served on the White House domestic policy staff. After leaving, he joined the law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge as a partner and worked there until 1989.
As attorney general
Barr returned to government service in 1989, becoming assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel during the George H. W. Bush administration. He became deputy attorney general in 1990 before becoming attorney general in 1991. His appointment was unanimously approved.
As the nation's chief law enforcement officer, Barr oversaw high-profile investigations into the savings and loan scandal, Manuel Noriega – the corrupt former dictator of Panama convicted in 1992 of racketeering – and the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
Barr advocated stronger federal sentencing to combat violent crime and he was opposed to criminal justice reform legislation like the bill Trump recently signed.
During Barr's time as attorney general, Robert Mueller headed the Justice Department's Criminal Division and the two worked closely on those important cases.
Criticism of Iran-Contra special counsel
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Barr's tenure involved another special counsel investigation: Lawrence Walsh's probe into the Iran-Contra affair, where Reagan administration officials approved the sale of arms to Iran to help fund anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua.
According to The Washington Post's Bob Woodward, Barr said he long "had an itchy finger" to fire Walsh and that almost came to a head after the special counsel indicted President Ronald Reagan’s defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, four days before the 1992 election.
Instead Bush pardoned Weinberger and five other Reagan-era officials involved in the affair. Barr was a strong advocate of the pardons.
In 2001, Barr described Walsh as "a headhunter" who "had completely lost perspective, and was out there flailing about on Iran-Contra with a lot of headhunters working for him. The whole tenor of the administration was affected by that. "

As corporate lawyer
After leaving the Justice Department, Barr worked for GTE Corporation until it joined with Bell Atlantic to form Verizon in 2000. Barr stayed on with Verizon for eight years before retiring in 2008. His work dealt with deregulation and major corporate mergers. He argued two cases before the Supreme Court.
After leaving Verizon, Barr worked as "of counsel" for Kirkland & Ellis in 2009, meaning he did work for them but was not an official partner or associate, and returned to that role in 2017.
Controversial comments
Some of Barr's opinions have raised flags for congressional Democrats concerned about the integrity of Mueller's investigation under a new attorney general.
In July 2017, Barr told the Post that he thought Mueller should have greater ideological balance on his team. Additionally, in a May 2017 op-ed he said Trump made the right decision when he fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been charged with leading the Russia probe.
He also has said there is more reason to investigate Hillary Clinton's role in a 2010 Uranium One deal than the possibility of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, The New York Times reported in November 2017.
Sen. Warner: Barr’s nomination should be withdrawn
Personal life
Barr married Christine Moynihan in 1973 and the couple has three daughters, all of whom practice law, according to Fox News columnist Judith Miller. Daughter Mary Daly works at the Justice Department as director of opioid enforcement and prevention efforts, heading the Trump administration's legal effort to tackle the crisis.
Barr is an avid player of the bagpipes. He played with a band in competitions, including the world championships, "until his legal career ascended to the point where his competitive piping was put on hold," according to pipes|drums.

Texto completo: Where the investigations related to President Donald Trump stand and what may lie ahead for him:
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
Trump is facing criminal investigations in Washington and New York.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia and whether the president obstructed the investigation. Trump also plays a central role in a separate case in New York, where prosecutors have implicated him in a crime. They say Trump directed his personal lawyer Michael Cohen to make illegal hush-money payments to two women as a way to quash potential sex scandals during the campaign.
___
WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW TODAY?
Trump on Monday denied he ever worked for Russia against U.S. interests, addressing an extraordinary question that has haunted his presidency and shows no sign of going away.
Speaking from the South Lawn, Trump issued a flat denial: "I never worked for Russia."
Trump raised eyebrows over the weekend when he didn't directly answer the Russia question in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a friend of his.
He was asked about a New York Times report that law enforcement officials began investigating, in 2017, whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests.
Trump said the question was "insulting," but did not directly deny it.
Monday's clear denial demonstrated the unprecedented pressure Trump faces as the special counsel's Russia investigation shows possible signs of wrapping up. After two years in office, the president is still being questioned about whether he was compromised by Russian intelligence agencies, and he is still struggling to answer clearly.
___
SO ... DID THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA?
There is no smoking gun when it comes to the question of Russia collusion. But the evidence so far shows a broad range of Trump associates had Russia-related contacts during the 2016 presidential campaign and transition period, and several lied about the communication.
There is also evidence that some people in the president's orbit were discussing a possible email dump from WikiLeaks before it occurred. American intelligence agencies and Mueller have said Russia was the source of hacked material released by WikiLeaks during the campaign that was damaging to Hillary Clinton's presidential effort.
___
OTHER QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:
—WHAT ABOUT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE? That is another unresolved question that Mueller is pursuing. Investigators have examined key episodes such as Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey and his fury over the recusal from the investigation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
—WHAT DOES TRUMP HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS? Trump has repeatedly slammed the Mueller investigation as a "witch hunt" and insisted there was "NO COLLUSION" with Russia. He also says his former lawyer, Cohen, lied to get a lighter sentence in New York.

Ocasio-Cortez turns the nonplused media into a plus

Texto completo: She's been on the job for less than two weeks and already has generated more national press coverage than some members of Congress get in their whole careers.
Not that it's been all positive, of course. Far from it.
The news media - and not just on the right - doesn't quite know what to make of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old freshman representative from Queens who is a Democratic Socialist and proud of it.
Their inability to fit her neatly into a preexisting mold has resulted in a barrage of dubious stories, out-of-touch tweets and cable-news weirdness, the likes of which we've never seen before.
And, in just about every case, Ocasio-Cortez has flipped critical coverage on its head and continued to make her points - not always with perfect accuracy but with pitch-perfect tone and effectiveness.
Over the weekend, for example, she drew fire after she criticized CBS News's spirited (if tone-deaf) announcement of its 2020 campaign team. A graphic showed 12 reporters and producers, not a single one of which was black.
She tweeted: "This WH admin has made having a functional understanding of race in America one of the most important core competencies for a political journalist to have, yet @CBSNews hasn't assigned a *single* black journalist to cover the 2020 election."
"Unacceptable in 2019," she concluded. "Try again."
Josh Kraushaar, politics editor at the National Journal, took his shot: "Another thing AOC has in common with Trump: media scold." And, besides, he posited, the CBS group looked diverse to him, "with the exception of lacking an African-American."
Her comeback was scathing: "Do you understand how fundamental the black experience is to American politics? And to American history? One race isn't substitutable for another. It doesn't work like that. It's not about 'quotas.' It's about understanding the country you're living in."
By the time the dust settled, CBS News was promising that the initial announcement was only the beginning of their still-growing team.
Do you think that expanded team will include some black journalists? I'll happily take that bet.
But is her superior social-media skill really what defines an outstanding member of Congress, some seemed to be wondering.
"It's gonna be awesome when @AOC turns Twitter vitriol into legislation," offered Mike Murphy, deputy technology editor at Quartz.
Ocasio-Cortez wasn't about to let that go unanswered (even though it was a kind of compliment), responding that she had already co-sponsored bills in support of D.C. statehood, comprehensive voting reform and more, and would be "dropping my first original resolution soon."
Beyond social media there have been the incessant off-key stories about her wardrobe, her worries about affording rent in her district and in Washington, her college-age dancing caught on video, even - horrors! - her occasional nickname, "Sandy."
When she made a significant factual error in stating that $21 trillion in Pentagon waste could cover Medicare for all, and then seemed to suggest on "60 Minutes" that such errors weren't all that important, she was slapped down hard by media across the political spectrum.
Having lavished her with positive attention, commentators seemed to feel a palpable joy in taking her down a few pegs.
It's all way out of proportion - powered, in no small part, by unacknowledged sexism. (How often do you hear the word "scold" applied to men? Not never, certainly, but not nearly as predictably as to outspoken women, the same ones who should modulate their voices and smile more.)
Just what is it about Ocasio-Cortez that is flipping everyone out?
The historian and author Rick Perlstein offered some answers in a recent New Yorker interview with Isaac Chotiner.
"It's a profoundly generational phenomenon, and, clearly, it's scary," he said. Perlstein sees Ocasio-Cortez as part of a generation that doesn't bear the lingering psychic wounds of a Democratic Party stunned into wimpiness by the Reagan era and its aftermath.
In the moments after President Trump's televised address to the nation last week - a barely disguised campaign pitch promoting his border wall - his Democratic opponents' response was stilted and tepid.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in the felicitous phrasing of James Poniewozik of the New York Times, were "looking unfortunately like a cross between Grant Wood's 'American Gothic' and the twins from 'The Shining.' "
Whatever it was that was needed in that crucial moment, they lacked: Spunk. Passion. Vitality.
A few minutes later, Ocasio-Cortez made her first appearance with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, and exhibited precisely those qualities. She practically jumped off the screen into the nation's living rooms.
Yes, she's green (in more than one sense). She has made some clumsy mistakes. But she's authentic, fearless and unpredictable - with beliefs that seem to have, at their core, a moral humanity.
And in the jaded, prepackaged world of Washington politics and media, that seems to make no sense at all.

TRUMP URGED TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT, BUT KEEP NATIONAL EMERGENCY OPTION

Texto completo: FULLERTON, Calif.

WASHINGTON

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Sunday that President Donald Trump should agree to reopen the government and continue trying to hammer out a deal with Democrats on funding his long-promised border wall  but that the president should declare a national emergency if no progress is made in three weeks. In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Graham maintained that Trump is not going to give up on his demand for more than $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But he argued that reopening the government and attempting to find a legislative solution, then declaring a national emergency if those talks dont bear fruit, is the best way forward. I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug. See if we can get a deal. If we cant at the end of three weeks, all bets are off. See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers, Graham said. Waiting three weeks would take the negotiations past Trumps State of the Union address later this month. A new WashingtonPost-ABC News poll shows that more Americans blame Trump and Republicans in Congress for the shutdown than congressional Democrats. Fifty-three percent of respondents blame the president and Republicans, while 29 percent blame Democrats. Thirteen percent blame both equally. More Americans remain opposed to the idea of a border wall than support it, the poll found, although the margin has narrowed over the past year. Trump continued making his case for the wall in Sunday morning tweets, arguing that it will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country!

WASHINGTON

GOP leader may act over race remarks

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Sunday that he will meet with Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, this week to discuss Kings future and role in the party and promised action following the Iowa congressmans recent comments in defense of white supremacy. That language has no place in America. That is not the America I know and its most definitely not the party of Lincoln, said McCarthy, R-Calif., referring to President Abraham Lincoln. Action will be taken. Im having a serious conversation with Congressman Steve King. King was quoted in the New York Times last week as saying, White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization  how did that language become offensive? King has insisted he is an advocate for Western civilization, not white supremacy or white nationalism. McCarthy spoke on CBS Face the Nation.

OAKLAND, Calif.

Judge blocks Trump rules on contraception

A federal judge in California on Sunday blocked Trump administration rules that would allow more employers to opt out of providing women with no-cost birth control, from taking effect in 13 states and Washington, D.C.

Judge Haywood Gilliam granted a request for a preliminary injunction by California, 12 other states and Washington, D.C. The plaintiffs sought to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled today while a lawsuit against them moved forward. But Gilliam rejected their request that he block the rules nationwide. California and the other states argue that the changes would force women to turn to state-funded programs for birth control and lead to unintended pregnancies. The U.S. Department of Justice says the rules protect a small group of objectors from violating their beliefs.

At least 9 dead after storm batters Midwest

At least nine people, including a state trooper who was responding to a crash, were killed amid a winter storm that has battered the Midwest and continues to dump several inches of snow in the Washington, D.C., metro area. The storm that began in parts of the Midwest on Friday snarled traffic on highways with a deadly mix of sleet and slush, left thousands without power and canceled dozens of flights. It has left dozens of casualties in its trail as it moved eastward, dropping six to seven inches of snow in parts of Maryland and Virginia. Missouri took the brunt of the damage, logging more than 800 snow-related crashes that injured 57 and killed four. In a suburb of Chicago, Illinois State Police Trooper Christopher Lambert was standing outside his patrol car Saturday at the scene of a three-car crash when a driver struck him, authorities said. Lambert, a five-year veteran of the state police who previously served in the Army, died later at a hospital. The state police said earlier Saturday that they have responded to more than 200 snow-related crashes, including one other fatality. Three storm-related deaths were reported in Kansas. The Midwest appeared to be out of the woods as of Sunday afternoon, but conditions were expected to worsen in the Washington, D.C., area.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

Officer killed, another wounded in shooting

One Birmingham police sergeant was killed and another officer critically wounded early Sunday morning in a shooting as they questioned two people suspected of trying to break into cars in Alabamas largest city. Two suspects were in custody, one of whom was shot and was receiving medical treatment, officials said. Police identified the officer who was fatally shot as Sgt. Wytasha Carter, 44, who had been with the department since 2011. As of Sunday evening, they had not released the names of the wounded officer or the suspects. News outlets said Carter is the first Birmingham officer killed in the line of duty in more than 14 years.

DAYTON, Ohio

Trial set in lawsuit over shooting by cop

A jury trial is scheduled Feb. 4 in the wrongful death lawsuit over a white police officers fatal shooting in an Ohio Walmart of a black man who was carrying an air rifle he picked up from a shelf. John Crawford III, 22, was shot in suburban Dayton in August 2014. His family sued the city, police and the retailer in federal court. The Dayton Daily News reported that lawyers for Crawfords family and Walmart each requested summary judgment, arguing some claims can be decided in their favor from the facts, without trial. The judge hasnt ruled on that. Federal authorities concluded there wasnt enough evidence to charge the officer, who killed Crawford while responding to a 911 call.

Elsewhere

Avalanche toll mounts in Europe: Three German skiers were killed in an avalanche in Austria and a fourth is missing, police said Sunday as snowfall set in again in the northern Alps. In France, two ski patrollers were killed when the devices they use to trigger avalanches exploded. The two accidents brought to at least 26 the number of weather-related deaths reported in Europe this month.

Polish mayor stabbed on stage: A convicted criminal rushed on to the stage during the finale of a charity event and stabbed Gdansk Mayor Pawel Adamowicz in the abdomen multiple times Sunday before shouting that he did it for political revenge, in an attack that left Adamowicz fighting for his life.

Texto completo: A look at where the investigations related to President Donald Trump stand and what may lie ahead for him:
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
Trump is facing criminal investigations in Washington and New York.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia and whether the president obstructed the investigation. Trump also plays a central role in a separate case in New York, where prosecutors have implicated him in a crime. They say Trump directed his personal lawyer Michael Cohen to make illegal hush-money payments to two women as a way to quash potential sex scandals during the campaign.
___
WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW TODAY?
A published report said federal law enforcement officials were so concerned about Trump's behavior in the days after he fired James Comey as FBI director that they opened an investigation into whether Trump had been working for Russia against U.S. interests. The New York Times cited unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
Trump reacted with outrage during a telephone interview broadcast on Fox News Channel after host Jeanine Pirro asked whether he currently or has ever worked for Russia.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," he said. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing."
Trump went on to say that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.
___
FORMER TRUMP LAWYER TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS
Cohen will testify publicly before a House committee next month. The House hearing could serve as the opening salvo in a promised Democratic effort to greater scrutinize Trump, his conflicts of interest and his ties to Russia.
The House Oversight and Reform Committee announced Thursday that Cohen will testify before that panel Feb. 7, a little more than a month after the Democrats took the House majority.
The hearing marks the latest step in Cohen's transformation from a trusted legal adviser to the president to a public antagonist who has cooperated extensively against him. It is likely to pull back the curtain on key episodes involving Trump's personal life and business dealings, including hush-money payments to women and a proposed Moscow real estate deal, that federal prosecutors have been dissecting for months.
Three Democrats who head influential House committees are warning Trump not to obstruct their efforts to question Cohen.
Their statement follows Trump's comments in a Fox News Channel interview in which he alleges potential legal problems involving a Cohen relative and takes digs at Cohen's honesty and own legal woes.
___
SO ... DID THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA?
There is no smoking gun when it comes to the question of Russia collusion. But the evidence so far shows a broad range of Trump associates had Russia-related contacts during the 2016 presidential campaign and transition period, and several lied about the communication.
There is also evidence that some people in the president's orbit were discussing a possible email dump from WikiLeaks before it occurred.

Bigotry gets a new look

Texto completo: Imagine how the media and liberal pundits would react if either of these two fictional events had actually taken place:
* Scenario 1: President Donald Trump questions the fitness of Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib to serve in Congress because they are adherents of Islam. He demands they publicly disavow their faith because its most intolerant practitioners restrict women's rights and demand they shield their faces from public view.
* Scenario 2: Sen. Marco Rubio opposes the membership of Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee because of his Orthodox Jewish background, questioning whether he would allow his support for the state of Israel to outweigh his duties as an American.
The Washington Post, New York Times, MSNBC and CNN would offer round the clock commentary and talking heads denouncing Republican bigotry and hate mongering.
But where is the media outrage over the not so subtle jibes prominent Democrats have been making about Roman Catholics, Jews and evangelical Christians?
Remember Sen. Dianne Feinstein's questioning of a Trump judicial nominee, Appeals Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett, suggesting her Roman Catholic faith might impact her consideration of cases involving abortion rights?
The Roman Catholic faith prohibits abortion as murder, and "the dogma lives loudly in you," Sen. Feinstein told Ms. Barrett.
Last month, Democrat senators Kamala Harris and Mazie Hirono sent written questions to judicial nominee Brian Buescher raising his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic service organization.
They criticized the Knights, known for more than a century of public service and charity work, for opposing abortion and same-sex marriage and asked if Mr. Buescher would renounce the group. But the Knights' beliefs mirror the dogma of Roman Catholicism, an institution that claims more than 70 million Americans as members.
Israel has become another target of some of the new stars in the Democratic firmament.
Ms. Tlaib, who made headlines on her first day in office and drew a rebuke from Nancy Pelosi by using a foul adjective accusing the president of carnal knowledge of his mother, took to Twitter again last week to attack Israeli supporters in the Senate.
Her targets this time were fellow Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Rubio. The two sponsored a bipartisan bill to punish companies that join a pro-Palestinian initiative to boycott Israel, force companies to divest themselves of Israeli assets and sanction the country.
Ms. Tlaib implied the men's support of Israel was contrary to their duty to America, tweeting "they forgot what country they represent."
Sen. Bernie Sanders attacked Russell Vought when he was undergoing hearings for the Office of Management and Budget because as an evangelical Christian, he believes acceptance of Jesus Christ as savior is a prerequisite for spiritual salvation.
As such, Mr. Vought said in a piece published by his former college, Muslims "do not know God", a statement Sen. Sanders attacked as Islamophobic.
In an earlier, less hysterical time, candidates for higher office were judged by their policies on such issues as abortion.
Now, some liberals are measuring them by whether they belong to mainstream religions that are the bedrock of our country. Who's next?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: He's still not hosting the Academy Awards, but Kevin Hart has a No. 1 movie to celebrate.
Only days after quashing the idea that he would return as host of the Oscars, the actor and comedian is back at the top of the box office in STX's "The Upside," a dramedy starring Hart as a black parolee who becomes the caregiver and pal of a wealthy, white quadriplegic man played by Bryan Cranston. Despite an unenthusiastic reception from critics (the film has a 40 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes), the film exceeded most analysts' expectations, selling $19.6 million in tickets during its first weekend in theaters.
The movie's performance is especially notable given the controversy that has embroiled Hart while he's been trying to promote it. In December, shortly after Hart was announced as the Oscar host, he dropped out when several tweets and comments that were deemed homophobic resurfaced from his past. Since then, his appearances to talk about "The Upside" have also involved discussions about the controversy, as was the case with a spot on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" at the beginning of the month that briefly stoked rumors that Hart could be reinstated as host (he has since definitively ruled it out).
But audiences didn't seem to want to punish Hart: They bought enough tickets to allow "The Upside" to beat out the titanic "Aquaman" and claim the top spot at the box office.
[Read the New York Times review of "The Upside."]
Not that Warner Bros., the studio behind "Aquaman," has much to complain about. The superhero movie led by Jason Momoa brought in $17.3 million domestically this weekend and about $27.9 million overseas, bringing its cumulative global ticket sales to $1.02 billion, according to the studio. The film had spent three straight weeks atop the domestic box office, and its strong international turnout has cemented Momoa -- a "Game of Thrones" alumnus -- as a moneymaking leading man.
Sony's "A Dog's Way Home" was the only other debut in the top 10, landing in third place with $11.3 million during its first weekend in theaters, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. This family film directed by Charles Martin Smith stars a real dog making a difficult journey alongside a C.G.I. cougar. "If you've ever wondered what 'The Grey' might have been like if Liam Neeson were a dog," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times, "you must see this movie."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

What's next? Streaming trend likely to keep rolling, but vinyl isn't going away

Texto completo: While you're streaming the new 1975 album you got for Christmas or revisiting Pink Floyd's The Wall, it should be noted that Thomas Edison was the real music-consumption MVP.

That's right, the electric light bulb inventor had the brilliant idea in 1877 to build the phonograph, the first method to reproduce recorded sounds, even though he had lost most of his hearing.

That was more than 140 years ago.

But what comes next? How will people consume music in the future?

Fifty years ago when vinyl and radio were the main methods of consuming music, few could have predicted that people would one day be able to simply tap a mobile phone screen and stream songs. At the same time, in the present digital age, the recent surge in vinyl sales has also been a surprise.

In November, Verizon and AT&T started selling the Red Hydrogen One smartphone, which includes a four-view holographic display that allows users to expand their field of view and add a "look around" quality to images.

Holograms of artists such as Michael Jackson and Tupac have performed live throughout recent years, and Vimeo currently has a new 3D camera interface that allows users to stream live 3-D video (which requires a subscription to use the service).

While holograms are slowly starting to break the surface in the world of music consumption, streaming, as popular as it currently is, isn't going away anytime soon.

Tim Friedman, owner of Culture Clash Records in Toledo, said his shop would remain open if there is a post-streaming world in the future, but he believes streaming music will continue to be another part of the media landscape.

He said despite this simple, convenient method of consumption, streaming doesn't challenge the experience of listening to music, or looking at the album's artwork, or reading the liner notes on a physical copy.

"Buying and owning music has always been a little bit of an indicator of coolness, probably more for one's own self-being than what it actually means to anyone else," Friedman said. "Having the right and cool record, the right Zeppelin record in the '70s, having the best Michael Jackson tape in the '80s, having [an] *NSYNC CD in the '90s. These were indicators of being a part of something bigger. These were musical movements as with so many things, just being part of something larger than yourself."

Rolling Stone recently published an article about 2018's year of streaming, with data obtained from BuzzAngle, which tracks music consumption. The article concluded that 1,000 of the most streamed songs of 2018 were listened to about 121.8 billion times.

Steve Knopper, contributing editor for Rolling Stone, who also writes for Billboard, New York Times, and Variety, said he only sees streaming getting larger, especially as it spreads more thoroughly to China, India, Latin America, and elsewhere.

"The record business is starting to boom again and will continue to do so as this happens, but major labels have to be wary of DIY tools that allow artists to get into Spotify without their help," Knopper told The Blade. "Streaming services are not behaving like radio where you need high-priced middlemen to grant access. They will disagree with this, but their influence may diminish as far as breaking new artists. They will always be important due to catalogs, though."

As for how people will consume their music in the future, he said that might already be happening with the increased interest and fascination with voice-activated speakers such as Amazon's Alexa, Google Home, and Apple's new Homepod.

"I also wonder if Alexa and voice-activated speakers will become more and more dominant, especially when it becomes much easier in the car," Knopper said. "If you can get behind the wheel without pushing any buttons and say, 'Play 'Oops, I Did It Again' and it always works, that's a powerful thing for drivers and consumers."

Still, some might want to continue listening to music in a nondigital format.

Friedman said with the constant bots tracking personal data online, there are still music fans who will want to consume music apart from a screen.

The reality is not being tied to something on the Internet or something that is generating data for ad sales directed at you, Friedman said. That's not happening when you sit down and put on a piece of wax. You're having an experience close to the artists and musicians who put that together.

Matt Donahue, lecturer in the popular culture department at Bowling Green State University, said music fanatics will continue to enjoy physical copies as collectibles.

I think the physical product is still going to be hugely popular, Donahue said. Vinyl sales will continue to go up. Now you've got the novelty of the cassette going on. It clearly won't reach the level of what was going on in the 1980s when cassettes were hugely popular. [Now cassettes exist] more in terms of a gimmick ... a novelty.

He said the fast pace in technology shifts will play a key part in how music is consumed in as little as a few years from now.

This stuff is so technologically driven, Donahue said. You can buy a brand new car and you can't get a compact disc [player] in your vehicle. Back in the day, there used to be cassette players in your car, and you would want the best player. It's interesting to see how all of these changes are driven from technology.

Friedman said it's difficult to imagine what might come once music streaming dies out, or even if that will ever happen, but there will remain people who decide to opt out of the digital sphere.

The reality is that vinyl is still coming back, and while I have no idea if that's a bubble that is going to burst, I think the reality is we have larger market issues to be concerned about as a country and throughout the globe, Friedman said. When I think about the world and consumerism and capitalism, I have no idea what's going to happen.

I know there will be people like myself who will want to a bury their head in the sand and listen to a record and share that record and talk with people about that and how it made them feel. Being a part of something and sharing something greater, I think everybody is going to be looking smaller than we have [been], shopping smaller, supporting local businesses, and being wary of [places like] Amazon.

For now, streaming music seems to be the newest, most convenient method of listening to your favorite songs, a medium that promises to be around for a long time.

Music is turning into water. It streams into our homes constantly, Knopper said. You don't have to organize it by albums. My daughter hears songs she likes all over the place and sticks them on playlists and just always streams her playlist every waking second. She doesn't care about albums or catalogs.

There will be this type of consumer, and another more casual one who wants somebody else to pick the playlist radio style.

We will always be streaming.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.

Texto completo: The list of Republicans speaking out against Rep. Steve King's most recent controversial comments now includes both of Iowa's U.S. senators.
The growing backlash follows an interview with the New York Times earlier this week in which King, who represents Iowa's 4th District, lamented why terms like "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" are offensive.
King attempted to clarify the statements.
He issued a release denouncing white nationalism and white supremacy and took to the House floor Friday to address the matter, which he called "a freshman mistake."
But backtracking hasn't slowed the blowback.
"I condemn Rep. Steve King's comments on white supremacy; they are offensive and racist — and not representative of our state of Iowa," Sen. Joni Ernst tweeted Saturday. "We are a great nation and this divisiveness is hurting everyone. We cannot continue down this path if we want to continue to be a great nation."
Ernst also linked to a Washington Post op-ed from Sen. Tim Scott in which the South Carolina Republican pulled no punches addressing King's history of racially-charged rhetoric and the lack of action by his party to curb it.
"King's comments are not conservative views but separate views that should be ridiculed at every turn possible," Scott wrote in the piece.
Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley echoed the remarks from Ernst and Scott on Saturday while speaking with a pair of reporters from Axios.
"I find it offensive to claim white supremacy. I will condemn it," Grassley reportedly said.
Both senators have offered King support in the past or campaigned with him.
Shortly before the 2018 election, King released of video of Grassley in which Iowa's senior senator called King an "ally" who he needed in the House.
After the election, Grassley distanced himself from King but did not repudiate him.
Two Iowans this week announced plans to primary King ahead of the 2020 election. One of them, state Sen. Randy Feenstra of Hull, has come out swinging.
"Our current representative's caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table," Feenstra said on Twitter. "We don't need any more sideshows or distractions, we need to start winning for Iowa's families."
The other Republican challenger, Bret Richards of Irwin, said in an interview with the Des Moines Register about the contrasts between himself and King: "I know who I am. I know I won't embarrass the state."
Iowa officials said they were neutral in the potential primary.
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued an ultimatum to King after the election and has said she will stay out of the primary battle but appeared with the Kiron representative during her campaign.
Former 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush wrote on Twitter that "Republican leaders must actively support a worthy primary opponent to defeat King because he won't have the decency to resign."
Longtime King supporter Bob Vander Plaats, a former Iowa gubernatorial candidate and president of The Family Leader, a conservative political organization, also rebuked the 16-year congressman.
Vander Plaats said on Twitter Friday that the comments in the New York Times were "a bridge too far," and appeared on a CNN panel later that day.
"The people of the 4th District, where I grew up, they are good people," Vander Plaats told CNN's Erin Burnett. "They need to be represented well, but not with remarks like this. That's why I wanted to speak out."

Anthony Tommasini, chief critic of The New York Times, poses these and more questions at the start of his fascinating, provocative and eminently readable new book, "The Indispensable Composers: A Personal Guide," pointing out that "the field of classical music has justifiably been criticized for its obsession with greatness, with certifying a repertory of canonical masterpieces."
The germ that sparked this book was a controversial series of articles the author wrote in 2011 on "The Top Ten Composers," which solicited suggestions from the NYT readership and pleased practically no one, because some of everyone's favorite composers were inevitably omitted from the list. Here, Mr. Tommasini gives 17 of his own choices, from Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643) to Igor Stravinsky, who died in 1971 -adding an epilogue in which he discusses composers whose works are too recent for us to know whether they will eventually fall into the "greatness" canon.
"What's the big deal about Mozart? About Verdi?" Mr. Tommasini asks. "That's what I've attempted to explain."
In the interest of full disclosure, I admit that I can only write a subjective review of this very subjective book. Mr. Tommasini and I have much in common that has made my worldview of music akin to his. Although we have only met occasionally and under professional circumstances, and he's a decade younger, we were both born in Brooklyn, grew up listening to early LP recordings, taking music lessons while being exposed to New York's classical music scene, majored in music at an Ivy League college and went on to get doctorate degrees at Boston University.
When Mr. Tommasini cites Leo Schrade's 1950 Monteverdi biography to support the thesis that this composer was the seminal figure responsible for the coming of "modern" music, I recall that book as one of my musical bibles from college days -it still sits prominently on my shelf. I, too, would name Monteverdi as the first of the "great" composers. I could use the chapter on Monteverdi as notes for my own lectures on the birth of opera and the early Baroque without committing plagiarism. It contains everything I think an audience needs to know about the subject. Later in the book, Mr. Tommasini's explanation of Schoenberg and the development of the so-called 12-tone system is likewise brilliant and succinct.
I don't concur with all of Mr. Tommasini's choices. My own top 17 composers might overlap with his by nine or 10 -I particularly disagree with his gushing assessment of Puccini, for example. Nor would I place Brahms as high as he does, but I can see where he's coming from.
Beyond Mr. Tommasini's wide range of musical expertise, he is a compelling and colorful writer who can define musical terms succinctly for the layman -counterpoint, meter, recitative -without losing touch with the professional musician. He is a master of finding just the right adjective to describe a work or a performance -a particularly important skill for a music critic. "A colossal piece," "a titanic score," "a fine soprano," "a master pianist," "a slightly fractured yet skittish and charming dance." He also has the unique perspective shared by all long-time music critics: He has heard more music in more performances than almost anyone else, layman or professional.
Each composer is given a brief initial evaluation: the reason that Mr. Tommasini has chosen him. The author points out that, "alas, this gallery of greats is an all-male club .. Classical music during its formative centuries was especially uninviting to aspiring women composers." He goes on to outline each composer's life, including detailed descriptions of the works he considers protean to that composer's significance. Many of the works are seen through the prism of the author's own accomplished pianism, and his descriptions can be tantalizing. Several sent me scurrying to check out a piece I thought I knew well -to the printed score, YouTube or a recording that I already own. He is also refreshingly frank about gay issues in the composers' biographies, as well as the effects of his own early conflicts about being gay and coming out.
What comes through consistently and unequivocally is Mr. Tommasini's love for music and sense of adventure in listening to (as well as performing) it. Summing up Schoenberg, he concludes that the best 12-tone music "can offer a chance to take a leap, to enjoy denying your ear tonal grounding, to bask for a while in a realm beyond tonality and . hear the alternative coherence and logic of this new language .. Being a music lover should never involve an either-or choice." Who can argue with that!

Other Directors Worth Discussing

Texto completo: Ivo van Hove is a rarity: a stage director who has bridged the divide between experimental European theatermaking and the story-driven demands of the commercial American stage.
Who might follow in his arresting footsteps? Here, courtesy of critics and writers for The New York Times, are names to watch -- and where to watch some of their coming productions.
[Read our conversation about Ivo van Hove.]
Thomas Ostermeier
This German director's high-octane "Richard III" (incorporating a rap by Tyler, the Creator) left me breathless at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Mr. Ostermeier, who heads the Schaubühne theater in Berlin, excels at updating classics to a modern setting -- his violent "Miss Julie" took place in Putin's amoral new Russia -- but he also champions fascinating, intellectually inquisitive new works like "Returning to Reims." An announced Broadway debut with "An Enemy of the People" seems to have been indefinitely postponed. Perhaps it's time to give it another chance? ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
Katie Mitchell
One of the most imaginative -- and divisive -- pace setters of the theater of anachronism, this British-born auteur rose to fame with visually startling productions that recontextualized classics, from Euripides' "Iphigenia at Aulis" (reimagined within a stoical, World War II home front) to a ravishing multimedia interpretation of Virginia Woolf's "The Waves." Having focused largely on opera in recent years, Ms. Mitchell returns to London this month to direct Cate Blanchett in Martin Crimp's "When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other: Twelve Variations on Samuel Richardson's Pamela." BEN BRANTLEY
Yael Farber
The South African Ms. Farber finds new primal energy in theatrical war horses. Her version of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," at the Old Vic in London, was steeped in the sweat, dirt and darkness of colonists finding their way in a harsh new world, while her reimagining of Strindberg's "Miss Julie" as the post-apartheid-era "Mies Julie" conjured a lethally mixed cocktail of sex and politics. This season, she'll be staging her compatriot Athol Fugard's "Boesman and Lena" for the Signature Theater. BEN BRANTLEY
Benedict Andrews
This Australian maverick loves to steer celebrated stars out of their comfort zones in implosive, bare-knuckled productions that strip the poetry from lyrical plays. He has worked his rowdy magic on Cate Blanchett and Isabelle Huppert (in an antic take on Genet's "The Maids"); Gillian Anderson (playing a tigerish Blanche DuBois in a Darwinian jungle in Tennessee Williams's "A Streetcar Named Desire"); and Sienna Miller (red in tooth and claw as the title character of Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"). BEN BRANTLEY
Romeo Castellucci
Mr. Castellucci's cryptic shows exalt rather than frustrate audiences. This Italian director creates masterful living tableaux that often draw from classical and religious themes, and summon tectonic, elemental forces -- the striking visuals are sometimes accompanied by deafening soundscapes, and sometimes unfurl in a quasi-mystical quiet. Mr. Castellucci has become an in-demand opera director in Europe, but he shines most with his own company, Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio. Their "Democracy in America" will be part of Montclair State University's Peak Performances series from May 9-12. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
Simon Stone
Last year, this Australian director made a blistering New York debut with "Yerma," a tale of obsession descending into madness. The trademark of Mr. Stone's emerging career seems to be high-concept sets: an enclosed transparent box in "Yerma," a three-story grid of rooms in "Hotel Strindberg," a revolving abode in "Ibsen House." Just as the characters have nowhere to hide, Mr. Stone's productions turn classics inside out -- he usually rewrites them -- the better to reveal their guts. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
Milo Rau
The Swiss-born director's taboo-testing productions led one publication to call him "the world's most controversial director." He broke out in 2009 with "The Last Days of the Ceausescus," about the trial and execution of Romania's Communist leader and his wife, while "La Reprise" -- in which he re-enacts the murder of a gay man in Belgium -- was the talk of this year's Avignon Festival. His New York debut, in March at N.Y.U. Skirball, will be "Five Easy Pieces," about Marc Dutroux, a notorious pedophile and murderer. Almost all the actors are children. ALEX MARSHALL

Texto completo: Fiat Chrysler and German auto parts supplier Robert Bosch will pay $8.4 million to Pennsylvania and some $171 million to 52 jurisdictions nationwide for selling or leasing vehicles that allegedly cheated on emissions tests, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced Friday.
Illegal "defeat device" software allowed the vehicles to pass emissions inspections despite exceeding federal limits, a coalition of states charged.
Bosch was accused of supplying and helping to program the devices, which were installed in 2014-16 model year Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV and Ram 1500 truck diesel vehicles.
Fiat Chrysler will pay Pennsylvania $3.6 million, while Bosch will pay $4.7 million.
The news follows Thursday's announcement by the federal government that Fiat Chrysler agreed to pay an estimated $800 million in penalties and compliance costs to settle similar allegations.
As part of the federal settlement, London-based Fiat Chrysler will recall about 100,000 diesel-powered Ram 1500 trucks and Grand Cherokees to install new software and provide extended warranties, The New York Times reported. Owners also will be eligible for compensation from Fiat Chrysler and Bosch.
The investigations followed the larger emissions-cheating scandal involving Volkswagen that cost it $22 billion in settlements and fines.

FBI investigated President Trump for possible secret Russian favors, reports say

Texto completo: Federal counterintelligence agents began an investigation of Donald Trump last year that aimed to find out whether the president had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, the New York Times and CNN reported Friday.
The revelation, which the White House called "absurd" in a late-evening statement, suggests that the FBI felt Trump's firing of director James B. Comey in May 2017 was motivated by Russian interests and might constitute a threat to U. S. national security, the Times reported.
While the allegation of Trump's possible collusion with the Russian government has been raised before, to date there has been no evidence.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a lawyer for the president, was quoted by the Times as saying that the investigation seems to have gone nowhere. “The fact that it goes back a year and a half and nothing came of it that showed a breach of national security means they found nothing,” Giuliani said on Friday.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
“This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he’s a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia. ”
More: Trump's team had over 100 contacts with Russian-linked officials, according to think tank analysis
Related: Robert Mueller grand jury gets more time; judge extends 18-month term set to expire in coming days
Exclusive: James Comey strikes back against 'morally unfit' Donald Trump in scathing interview
The Times and CNN reports both cite unnamed sources.
The decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials who were confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Mr. Comey and enduring the president’s verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt,” the Times reported.
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the President's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire FBI Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, according to several USA TODAY stories at the time.
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election in order to help Trump.

Texto completo: U .S. companies have the power to nurture American values, including the importance of free speech, as they cultivate markets around the world. Or they can sacrifice those values for market share and cave in to the basest impulses of foreign governments, as Netflix did in yanking an episode of "Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj" that offended the uber-intolerant Saudi Arabian government.

In the Oct. 28 episode, comedian Hasan Minhaj discussed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's role in the murder of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi government claimed that the program violated a law barring material offensive for moral, religious, or public safety reasons. In December, Netflix pulled the episode from its streaming service in Saudi Arabia while leaving it available in other countries and on YouTube.

Netflix argued that it only was complying with a host country's laws, but the explanation rings hollow. Netflix - a California-based company that owes its existence to the First Amendment - disgraced itself by kowtowing to a regime that suppresses free speech. Suppresses it, as in Mr. Khashoggi's case, to death.

Worse is the precedent that Netflix's capitulation helps to set. Other authoritarian countries - Egypt, Turkey, and China, for starters - saw how easy it was to bully a profit-hungry company into submission and will be emboldened to target those offending their own political or religious sensibilities.

Companies seeking to do business in other countries must follow their laws. However, companies can decide the kinds of regulations they're willing to tolerate and pull out of countries that offend their sense of justice or morality. American consumers should boycott companies with malleable ethics, showing them that there's more than one way to lose market share.

Because they're perpetually insecure, authoritarian regimes are easily embarrassed, and the loss of Netflix would have been a very public rebuke to a Saudi government that desperately wants to be seen as modern. There was power to be leveraged there.

Some U.S. companies, such as those providing weapons for wars around the globe, always put the profit motive before any other. As the New York Times pointed out, Apple, Facebook, and Hollywood movie-makers also have buckled to free-expression restrictions in other countries. Shame on all of them.

But there's also a record of American firms doing the right thing, with some companies, as the Times noted, pulling out of South Africa in the 1980s to protest apartheid. More recently, hundreds of companies publicly opposed President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, a move that certainly put them at odds with segments of the American public.

The Ethisphere Institute, an Arizona think tank, calls global companies "society's strongest force to improve the human condition." They just need to find their backbone more often.

Texto completo: In the fall of 2016, American diplomats in Cuba complained of high-pitched sounds that were leading to headaches, vertigo, and hearing loss. A recording, made by diplomats and circulated by the Associated Press, fueled speculation about a sonic attack by adversaries of the United States. But two scientists, Alexander Stubbs of the University of California, Berkeley, and Fernando Montealegre-Z of the University of Lincoln in England, now say the evidence points to a more benign source: crickets. They're quick to say they can't rule out an attack altogether. But the sound they examined doesn't match up with that hypothesis. “All I can say fairly definitively is that the A.P.-released recording is of a cricket," Stubbs told The New York Times, “and we think we know what species it is." That would be the Indies short-tailed cricket (or a close relative), known for making an enormous racket.

AI, 8K TV and 5G cellular service all the buzz at CES 2018

Texto completo: Illustration Dave Taylor For the Camera
Attendees look at 8K televisions at the TCL booth Thursday at CES 2019 consumer electronics show.
Attendees wait in line for a 5G exhibition at the Qualcomm booth Thursday during CES 2019 consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.

Every year more than 175,000 people go through the drill of flying to Las Vegas and spending a week paying exorbitant prices for hotels and food so we can find out what's next. It's CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, and it takes over the City of Sin like a kudzu vine consumes a swamp.
From the biggest companies to tiny startups that try to entice journalists and buyers into their hotel suites for demos, it's a remarkably busy week of activities and events. The real showcase, however, is the trade show exhibition floor that consumes the entire Las Vegas Convention Center (which is more than 2 million square feet). But the show itself spreads further, too, ultimately encompassing 2.7 million square feet.
The trade show features 4,400 companies exhibiting in spaces ranging from the size of Folsom Field to a folding table tucked in the corner of a hallway. Like the crackling chaotic energy of the entrepreneurial world? Eureka Park, the startup-dedicated area of CES, had more than 1,000 companies from every corner of the globe exhibiting their inventions and gadgets.
To get a sense of the madness, it's commonplace for companies to rent entire restaurants and replace all the signage with their logos and promotional artwork and people just drift on by, completely blasc about it all. Or perhaps that's just Las Vegas.
What's the buzz Almost every year a theme or two emerge as the focus of the thousands of new product announcements, partnerships and strategic visions shared from this massive and vital industry. In past years I can remember HD-DVD versus Blu-Ray (with little colored flags on the players to denote which camp the company was in), the introduction of HD, then 4K television, car audio systems to blow the windows off your vehicle, drones, virtual reality and 3D printing all having their proverbial moment in the sun.
This year the undeniable drumbeat is AI. Artificial Intelligence, which is now being applied to anything and everything as it dilutes down to being almost meaningless. Your car lights turn on because you're walking toward it? Credit card company sending you a text message to confirm a transaction? Streaming TV service suggesting some additional programs you might like to watch? That's probably AI at work. At least in companies' marketing hype.
OK, that's a bit snarky, I admit. But the hype is rather overwhelming, with some companies insisting that even the most mundane smarts in a device is genius and the Next Big Thing. Still, as always-connected devices — including your car — and voice-activated, smart home ecosystems like the Amazon Alexa keep expanding, there are some really cool things that can be done through data processing and analysis.
Samsung was first out of the gate with its newly rebranded Bixby AI ecosystem that will let your fridge tell you when the washer is done and allow you to teach your house to be reactive to your wishes and lifestyle patterns. Meanwhile, Google has a massive temporary building in the parking lot that includes an It's a Small World-esque amusement park ride to sell people on the growth and success of Google Home.
Meanwhile, as televisions have grown bigger, it becomes increasingly obvious that what seemed like a "high definition" image on a 40-inch television ends up looking ugly, jagged and pixilated on a 75-inch television and really pretty miserable on that 100-inch TV that's going to replace an entire wall in your house. The industry response has been to go from NTSC, the earliest of TV standards, to 1080p HD television, to 4K television and now, you guessed it, 8K TV. Watching an 8K signal on a 22-inch TV is a bit daft, but on an 80-inch television it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous.
But where are we going to get content?
Like magic, the computing power inside a modern big TV is so great that it essentially creates its own. Through what's known as upsampling, an HD program can look better, and a 4K stream — or disk — can look really great. Original 8K content? Not available yet, but HD was just a pipe dream 15 years ago, too.
The third big theme of CES 2019 is 5G. The industry has been abuzz for years, but we're finally ready for wide-scale deployment of the next generation of cellular internet connectivity. And if it delivers what's in the spec, it's going to be a doozy: 5G cellular connections are being measured at 20 times the performance of a 4G LTE connection. If you like numbers, 4G LTE has a top speed of 1GB/second, while 5G is able to achieve speeds of 20GB/second. On your phone. Or tablet.
The wrinkle is that it's not going to be a smooth and even rollout because there are few industry segments more cutthroat than cellular. It played out this week with AT&T sharing photos of new phones using 5G (even though it's not yet available). T-Mobile responded in social media with a very funny — but cutting — photo showing a smartphone with a tiny Post-it saying "9G" stuck over the 4G LTE info and a comment that the company "didn't realize it was this easy, brb updating."
For its part, Verizon took out a full page advertisement in the New York Times to poke at AT&T and highlight its role in the 5G future. To be fair, Kyle Malady, Verizon chief technology officer, didn't name AT&T directly but it's clear who he was identifying when warning "companies that mislabel services as 5G risk confusing consumers." Apparently none of these companies learned to play well with others.
As is my habit, I posted dozens of photos from the trade show floor on my Instagram channel. From the amazing to the daft, you can see them all at instagram.com/d1taylor .
It's been quite a week and I've come home to snow, so it's time to get a good night's sleep and hope that I wake up to a bright, sunny day and that my feet stop throbbing after walking more than 25 miles in four days.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -
A Google shareholder sued the company's board of directors and senior management on Thursday, arguing that the tech giant's leaders breached their duty to investors when they allegedly covered up sexual misconduct by executives and gave harassers large payouts.
The suit, by shareholder James Martin, stems from revelations last year that the company awarded a $90 million exit package to executive Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android operating system, even as Rubin was being pushed out over sexual misconduct accusations. Google had asked for Rubin's resignation in 2014 after determining that allegations that he had coerced a woman into performing oral sex in a hotel room the previous year were credible.
Rubin was celebrated when he left Google, and the real reason for his departure was made public by the Information and the New York Times, which also reported the payout. Rubin has denied the allegations.
The story has roiled Google's workforce, a #MeToo moment that prompted thousands of employees in offices across the world to walk off the job in protest.
Thursday's shareholder lawsuit, which is being brought by several high-profile attorneys, including a former chair of the Federal Election Commission and former city attorney of San Francisco, takes particular aim at Google's board of directors. The suit charges prominent venture capitalists John Doerr and Ram Shriram, who led the board's leadership development and compensation committee, with approving the payment while being fully apprised of the allegations.
"If the board of directors is in charge, they were supposed to "do the right thing," and in this case they've done anything but the right thing," said Louise Renne, the former city attorney of San Francisco.
The suit also targets Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin; executive chairman Eric Schmidt; Rubin; current chief executive Sundar Pichai, former human resources director Laszlo Bock; chief legal officer David Drummond; former executive Amit Singhal; and others.
The charges include breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of power and corporate waste.
Two other shareholder plaintiffs, the Northern California Pipe Trades Pension Plan and the Teamsters Local 272 Labor Management Pension Fund, filed a separate lawsuit making similar allegations.
Google declined to comment.

This week in Mormon Land: Finding ERA champion Sonia Johnson, the Romney effect on scholars, a missionary’s great escape

Texto completo: The Mormon Land newsletter is a weekly highlight reel of developments in and about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whether heralded in headlines, preached from the pulpit or buzzed about on the back benches. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Subscribe here .
This week’s podcast: Much rejoicing about temple changes
The church made historic changes last week to its temple ceremonies, drawing widespread praise for implementing new gender-equitable language.
Neylan McBaine, author of “Women at Church” and founder of the Mormon Women Project, discusses what these changes mean for women, men and the wider church — and why female Latter-day Saints are rushing to the faith’s temples and rejoicing over these newly adjusted religious rites.
Listen here.
Finding Sonia
Whatever happened to Sonia Johnson, the firebrand feminist of the 1970s and ’80s whose criticism of Latter-day Saint leaders and crusade for the Equal Rights Amendment led to her excommunication and her own presidential pursuit?
Logan Herald Journal Managing Editor Charles McCollum answers that question, partly, in a recent column.
Because McCollum had written in 2010 about his failed quest to find Johnson, who had attended Utah State University, producers of the public television series “We’ll Meet Again” contacted the journalist and, ultimately, shared with him a sneak peek of the episode documenting the tearful reunion between Johnson, now 82, and her former “comrade in arms,” Zoe Nicholson.
“You know, we were going to make a new world,” Johnson tells Nicholson. “Nothing was happening, so you know what, I thought maybe I’ll just be somebody else. So I changed my name and just got over my broken heart — well, lived with my broken heart.”
The episode “The Fight for Women’s Rights” was scheduled to air Thursday and again Monday on KUED-Channel 7.
Get Mitt. It Pays.
Scholar and writer John Turner counts among his blessings the rise of Mitt Romney for elevating Mormon studies and giving his career a boost.
So Turner, associate professor of religious studies at George Mason University in Virginia and author of the award-winning biography “Brigham Young: Pioneer Prophet” as well as “The Mormon Jesus: A Biography,” welcomes Romney’s return to the political stage as the junior Republican senator from Utah and his emergence as an on-again, off-again thorn in the side of President Donald Trump.
“At the same time, I don’t like Romney’s public positioning of himself as Republican Trump critic No. 1,” Turner writes in a post for Patheos. “It’s a position usually filled by an Arizona senator, for starters [think the late John McCain and now-former Sen. Jeff Flake]. But really, what’s the point? Romney is not going to run for president in 2020. He’d get hammered. Barring massive changes on the political landscape, no other credible Republican candidate will challenge a president who absolutely thumped everyone in the primaries the last time around and has a solid electoral base. It’s just poppycock.”
So, Turner adds, “my fellow scholars of Mormonism should not get excited. No Mormon president anytime soon.”
But Latter-day Saint academics should thank Romney anyway, he says, for “making it easier to publish our books and get jobs partly because of his rising star.”
Fire escape
Ogden writer Rachel J. Trotter recounts the story of her missionary son’s harrowing escape from the devastatingly deadly Paradise Fire in Northern California.
Writing for Meridian Magazine and Evalogue.Life, Trotter notes the call she received Nov. 8 from a cousin telling her about the fast-moving blaze.
“Rachel, it’s really bad,” she was told. “You need to try and find out where Joseph is living and maybe you should contact the mission president. Houses are exploding. I don’t want to panic you, but I thought you would want to know.”
Trotter says she dropped to her knees in “in fervent prayer” and then shot off an email to the California Roseville Mission.
“I would then endure the longest 10 minutes of my life,” she recalls, before word came back from the mission secretary: “Your son was evacuated, and he is safe.”
He had gotten out with just the clothes on his back along with “a toothbrush, a towel, his scriptures, his bag with his teaching materials.”
Trotter then tells how “countless angels on earth” stepped up to help in the aftermath.
New kids (manual) on the block
Utah novelist Mette Harrison teaches the Sunbeams in her Latter-day Saint congregation but says the writers of the church’s new children’s Primary manuals — to be used with the shift to the two-hour block — may have a thing or two to learn about 3-year-olds.
“These lessons are so far over their heads, it’s silly,” Harrison laments in a guest commentary for Religion News Service. “The sad thing for me is that the old lesson manual (“Primary 1”) was absolutely spot on for this age group. I suspect I won’t be the only teacher looking back to those pages for help.”
For his part, By Common Consent blogger Sam Brunson is reaching out to readers, asking them for suggestions on how to help Primary teachers.
“I’d love to have a professor of elementary education write a guest post about teaching 4-year-olds,” he writes. “A special-education teacher write about how to teach a class that includes special-needs students. A preschool teacher write about engaging 3-year-olds.”
If the cause fits, wear it
The 2012 grass-roots initiative urging Latter-day Saint women to wear pants to church was more than a fashion statement — it was a fairness statement, a feminist statement, an equality statement.
At the time, “Book of Mormon Girl” author Joanna Brooks told The New York Times it was the “largest concerted Mormon feminist effort in history.”
Turns out, the 2012 and 2013 Wear Pants to Church Day may have helped set the stage for even more momentous strides toward equity in the faith, including the recent change allowing female missionaries to don dress slacks and the newly installed temple changes.
The Salt Lake Tribune revisited the pants push this week and the imprint it left inside the faith.
Mission: 2019
After an eventful 2018, Times and Seasons blogger Walter van Beek identifies the challenges facing the faith this year.
Included on his list:
* Strike a better balance between the U.S. church and the global church.
* Integrate the membership’s increasingly diverse cultures into the curriculum.
* Continue to expose outsiders and insiders to the warts and wonders of church history, a la the new “Saints” text.
* Recognize and adjust to the fact that church growth is “plateauing.”
* Use the church’s platform to address international issues, including war, terrorism, xenophobia, poverty, climate change and more.
“We are now at a stage,” van Beek writes, “where we can speak out on the problems of the world.”
Latter-day Saints and Christian Scientists
A recent “Seekers and Scholars” podcast from The Mary Baker Eddy Library features church historian Jennifer Reeder, co-editor of “At the Pulpit: 185 Years of Discourses by Latter-day Saint Women.”
The podcast topic: “Women’s voices in Mormon and Christian Science history — commonalities and differences.”
Among the commonalities between the two faith traditions Reeder pointed to was “sort of this dual God — Father and Mother.”
“That is a huge similarity,” she stated, “and the role of women in the inherent gospel of Jesus Christ.”
Brazil to get its 7th temple
Brazil, the nation with the third most Latter-day Saints (behind the United States and Mexico), will get its seventh temple in June.
The Fortaleza Temple will be dedicated June 2 after an April 27-May 18 open house, the church announced in a news release.
The South American nation, home to more than 1.3 million members, already has Latter-day Saint temples in Campinas, Curitiba, Manaus, Porto Alegre, Recife and São Paulo, with plans for four more in Belém, Brasília, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador.
Quote of the week
“We called it ‘Ladies Day at the Temple’ because literally there were just lines forming outside of the dressing room as women were changing, and there was just this sort of buzz and joyous flutter.”

Texto completo: The world is, as everyone knows, going to hell, but there's still the nervous thrill of waiting to see precisely which dark force will take us down. Will the economy collapse first, the ice sheets melt first, or chaos and war envelop us first?
So here's my antidote to that gloom: Let me try to make the case that 2018 was actually the best year in human history.
Each day on average, about another 295,000 people around the world gained access to electricity for the first time, according to Max Roser of Oxford University and his Our World in Data website. Every day, another 305,000 were able to access clean drinking water for the first time. And each day an additional 620,000 people were able to get online for the first time.
Never before has such a large portion of humanity been literate, enjoyed a middle-class cushion, lived such long lives, had access to family planning or been confident that their children would survive. Let's hit pause on our fears and frustrations and share a nanosecond of celebration at this backdrop of progress.
On a dirt road in rural Angola a few years ago, I met a woman named Delfina Fernandes who had lost 10 children, out of 15; she had endured perhaps the greatest blow any parent can, and she had suffered it 10 times.
Yet such child deaths are becoming far less common. Only about 4 percent of children worldwide now die by the age of 5. That's still horrifying, but it's down from 19 percent in 1960 and 7 percent in 2003.
Indeed, children today in Mexico or Brazil are less likely to die by the age of 5 than American children were as recently as 1970.
The big news that won't make a headline and won't appear on television is that 15,000 children died around the world in the last 24 hours. But in the 1990s, it was 30,000 kids dying each day.
Perhaps it seems Pollyannish or tasteless to trumpet progress at a time when there is so much butchery, misrule and threat hanging over us. But I cover the butchery and misrule every other day of the year, and I do this annual column about progress to try to place those tragedies in perspective.
One reason for this column is that journalism is supposed to inform people about the world, and it turns out that most Americans (and citizens of other countries, too) are spectacularly misinformed.
For example, 9 out of 10 Americans say in polls that global poverty is worsening or staying the same, when in fact the most important trend in the world is arguably a huge reduction in poverty. Until about the 1950s, a majority of humans had always lived in "extreme poverty," defined as less than about $2 a person per day. When I was a university student in the early 1980s, 44 percent of the world's population lived in extreme poverty.
Now, fewer than 10 percent of the world's population lives in extreme poverty, as adjusted for inflation.
Likewise, Americans estimate that 35 percent of the world's children have been vaccinated. In fact, 86 percent of all 1-year-olds have been vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.
"Everyone seems to get the world devastatingly wrong," Dr. Hans Rosling, a brilliant scholar of international health, wrote in "Factfulness," published in 2018, after his death. "Every group of people I ask thinks the world is more frightening, more violent and more hopeless - in short, more dramatic - than it really is."
I suspect that this misperception reflects in part how we in journalism cover news. We cover wars, massacres and famines, but are less focused on progress.
In the last year, I've covered atrocities against the Rohingya in Myanmar, starvation in Yemen, climate change in Bangladesh, refugees and child marriage at home, and some of the world's worst poverty, in Central African Republic. All those stories deserve more attention, not less. But I never wrote columns or newsletters about three nations that registered astounding progress against authoritarianism and poor governance in 2018, Armenia, Ethiopia and Malaysia.
It is of course true that there are huge challenges ahead. The gains against global poverty and disease seem to be slowing, and climate change is an enormous threat to poor nations in particular. And the United States is an outlier, where life expectancy is falling, not rising as in most of the world.
So there's plenty to fret about. But a failure to acknowledge global progress can leave people feeling hopeless and ready to give up. In fact, the gains should show us what is possible and spur greater efforts to improve opportunity worldwide.
Every other day of the year, go ahead and gnash your teeth about President Donald Trump or Nancy Pelosi, but take a break today (remember, just for a nanosecond!) to recognize that arguably the most important thing in the world now is not Trumpian bombast. Rather, it may be the way the world's poorest and most desperate inhabitants are enjoying improved literacy and well-being, leading to a day when no mom will again lose 10 children.
Nicholas Kristof writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

AT&amp;T is labeling phones '5G Evolution.' Don't be fooled, they aren't 5G

Texto completo: Shopping for a new phone on AT&T's website, you might come across a feature tab labeled "5G Evolution. "
Don't be fooled. This isn't actual 5G but rather AT&T's marketing department at work.
While the rest of the wireless industry gears up for next generation 5G wireless networks, AT&T has gone ahead and rebranded some of its latest 4G LTE phones. The goal: To convince people that these phones, which includes a number of recent iPhones, Galaxys and LG devices, are similar to the 5G devices due to arrive in the coming weeks and months.
AT&T is even updating the icons on some of its existing Android phones to feature a "5G E" logo.
Hate to break it to you, but your existing iPhone 8, iPhone XR, Galaxy S9 or LG V30 did not magically gain 5G capabilities. They will work the same as they did before, connecting to AT&T's updated 4G LTE network.
Actual 5G phones will need to have the proper chips inside to connect to the new networks, something current devices lack. Samsung, LG and OnePlus have all said they will release 5G phones this year, with AT&T announcing it will have two 5G Samsung phones in 2019.
These 5G devices will be able to take advantage of 5G's improvements, including its faster speeds and more responsive performance. While current 4G LTE phones will still work fine over the next few years, calling them a form of 5G is misleading. (Making things more confusing: AT&T plans for two different versions of 5G, one called 5G and another 5G+).
On its website, AT&T justifies the marketing by saying that they've "made changes that are already bringing faster speeds to the latest devices on our LTE network. "
More: Tech in 2019: 5G, AI, 8K – the year ahead looks like an alphabet soup of progress
More: AT&T turns on its mobile 5G network on Dec. 21, starting with 12 cities and mobile hotspot
More: You’re going to love 5G, but there are a few things you need to know first
Not the first time
This isn't the first time AT&T, or the wireless industry, has tried to blur the lines when it comes to new technology.
Before T-Mobile launched its LTE network, it rebranded its improved 3G network, known as HSPA+, as "4G" in 2010 to tap into the excitement around 4G and keep itself competitive in the public eye with the 4G networks being launched by its rivals.
The move ironically angered AT&T at the time, though the company soon rebranded its own HSPA+ network as "4G," changing the designation for its improved 3G network as it worked to launch LTE in 2011.
This switch is also why AT&T and T-Mobile iPhones today show "4G" when not connected to their respective LTE networks.
Verizon and T-Mobile have both taken advantage of AT&T's latest marketing ploy to get in a few digs at their shared rival.
In a tweet, T-Mobile replaced the LTE logo on an iPhone with a "9G" sticker, adding, "didn’t realize it was this easy, brb updating. "
Verizon, meanwhile, took out full-page ads in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and USA TODAY Tuesday to seemingly address AT&T's recent moves.
"The potential for 5G is awesome, but the potential to over-hype and under-deliver on the 5G promise is a temptation that the wireless industry must resist," Kyle Malady, Verizon's chief technology officer, writes in the ad. Confusing terms "risk alienating the very people we want most to join in developing and harnessing this exciting new technology. "
"Verizon is making this commitment today: We won’t take an old phone and just change the software to turn the 4 in the status bar into a 5. We will not call our 4G network a 5G network if customers don’t experience a performance or capability upgrade that only 5G can deliver. "

Keto? Paleo? Whole30?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: River horses are stealing the spotlight on yet another Cincinnati stage.
Yup, the hippos are here. Again.
We've got a twirling trio now via a new Joshua Stout mural at the corner of the Eighth and Main streets. (For reference, this is the Algin Furniture building near Arnold's Bar and Grill.)
These bright beauties in pink tutus and flower crowns prance on that brick wall. And remarkably, this is not Cincinnati's first ballerina hippo in the last month or so.
Yup, the Queen City's – and arguably, the world's – most famous hippopotamus, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden's Fiona, stole the show during the Cincinnati Ballet's recent "Nutcracker" performances at Music Hall. That elegant hippo was more than six-feet tall and also wore a pink tutu.
And we don't think that is a coincidence.
Even if it is, this mural marks the second painted hippo tribute in Downtown.
This summer, ArtWorks and the Cincinnati Zoo partnered to produce a Fiona mural now up at 910 Race St. This Lucie Rice design honors the premature Nile hippopotamus that beat the odds to survive and thrive.
Since Fiona's birth Jan. 24, 2017, the Nile hippo has raised the profile of her species here and, well, everywhere.
She became a social media darling.
Millions around the world watched her grow from a dangerously small 29-pound newborn to the now healthy hippo tipping the scales at 1,000 pounds.
Fiona became so popular she got her own "show" on Facebook. She was a New York Times Style section cover and a punchline on a late-night talk show. Her face graced thousands of beer cans and ice cream cones and T-shirts and playing cards.
She even inspired an online campaign for her to be Time's Person of the Year for 2017.
And with her second birthday coming up in just a few days, it doesn't appear that the hippo craze is fading any time soon.
These hippos prance on the wall near Arnold's.

Texto completo: BANGKOK -- Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, the 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family and avoided deportation from Thailand by barricading herself in an airport hotel room and posting about her plight on social media, spent her first day of freedom in Bangkok on Tuesday.
After appearing to be headed for deportation back to her family, whom she accused of abusing her, Ms. Alqunun won a reprieve from the Thai authorities on Monday night. Those officials turned her case over to the United Nations Refugee Agency, which will take up to 10 days to process her request for refugee status and find a country that will accept her.
Those days will be critical to her fate. Even as Saudi officials continue to lobby the Thai government to send her back against her will, United Nations officials have begun gathering information to determine whether she qualifies for refugee status and eventual asylum.
Here is the path ahead for Ms. Alqunun.
What happens to her now?
Ms. Alqunun is in the care of the United Nations Refugee Agency, also known as U.N.H.C.R. After leaving the airport on Monday night, she is staying at an undisclosed hotel in Bangkok, and could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.
Thailand's immigration chief, Maj. Gen. Surachate Hakparn, who met with Ms. Alqunun at the airport, said that agency representatives would take up to five days to determine whether she qualifies for refugee status and, assuming that she does, another five days to find a place for her to resettle.
The refugee agency will try to find a country to accept her and will make the case that her situation is urgent. Refugees often wait years for placement.
Likely candidates for Ms. Alqunun include Australia, where she had originally hoped to go, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, said Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.
"I want Canada to give me asylum!" she said in a post on Twitter after she left the airport.
If more than one country agrees to take her, it will be up to the refugee agency to decide where she goes under a policy aimed at preventing refugees from country shopping.
"She is not going to have a choice," Mr. Robertson said.
The Thailand representative for U.N.H.C.R., Giuseppe de Vincentiis, who also met with Ms. Alqunun at the airport, said in a statement Tuesday: "We are very grateful that the Thai authorities did not send back Ms. Alqunun against her will and are extending protection for her."
What is her family doing?
General Surachate said Ms. Alqunun's father and brother were expected to arrive in Bangkok on Tuesday.
Ms. Alqunun expressed concern on Twitter that her father might find a way to compel her to go back to Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has strict guardianship laws that allow men to control nearly every aspect of women's lives, including the right to travel, obtain a passport, marry or divorce.
But the family's best chance at getting her back would have been through deportation while she was stuck at Suvarnabhumi Airport. It could be much more difficult now that she is under the protection of the United Nations.
Ms. Alqunun slipped away from her family while they were on holiday in Kuwait and flew to Bangkok on her own. She said earlier in interviews with The New York Times that her brother frequently beat her and that her family had kept her locked in a room for six months after she cut her hair in a way they didn't like. If she can establish that she faces death or brutality at home, she has a strong case for refugee status.
General Surachate met with Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Thailand, Abdul-Ilah al-Shuaibi, and other Saudi officials on Tuesday to discuss the case.
The Saudis said this was a family affair and that Ms. Alqunun needed medical attention, according to video clips of the meeting released by the Immigration Bureau.
The Saudis also complained that Thai officials had not confiscated Ms. Alqunun's phone, allowing her to build up a large following on Twitter and bring worldwide attention to her plight.
"The girl has been using Twitter to contact media continuously," the diplomats' interpreter said during the meeting. "The ambassador said if the phone was confiscated, the whole story would not be blown out of proportion."
Does this mean Thailand is changing its asylum policies?
Thailand's decision to allow Ms. Alqunun to remain in the country was relatively unusual, given that it is not a signatory to international agreements on refugee status and has a history of handing asylum seekers back to authoritarian countries, including China, Pakistan and Turkey.
A former star soccer player from Bahrain, Hakeem al-Araibi, has been held in Thailand since November even though he has refugee status in Australia. Thai authorities detained him on a warrant from Bahrain when he landed in Bangkok for his honeymoon. He fears he will be tortured if he is sent back to Bahrain.
General Surachate said that allowing Ms. Alqunun to remain in Thailand would have no bearing on Mr. Araibi's case because it is now under the jurisdiction of a Thai court.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: It's been 10 years since Marin was proclaimed "just a little out there."
"I don't think it means we're loony," the late Elissa Giambastiani, then treasurer of the county's tourism bureau, which came up with the slogan, said. "It's not hot tubs and peacock feathers."
Right, it's not all hot tubs and peacock feathers, a reputation Marin acquired in Edwin Newman's controversial 1978 NBC documentary, "I Want It All Now."
I don't know if we're truly still "just a little out there." Talking with my friend Veronica recently, who was one of the "comely" (as per the website) waitresses at Sausalito's Trident in its heyday, when everyone from Joan Baez to Jerry Garcia to the Rolling Stones hung out there, we agreed that Marin seems to have lost some of its fun, its rakishness, its appeal to young folks who had numerous places to hear live music.
So I thought I'd watch "I Want It All Now" again to see how much we've changed  or not.
Talk about a flashback!
True, much of the documentary, with an Emmy-winning score by "Mill Valley" songwriter Rita Abrams, was later exposed to have been contrived, even labeled by a media watchdog group as "journalistically flawed at essential points." And while we may not be quite the den of hedonism portrayed, some things don't seem to have changed much, for better or worse.
"Marin County seems to have more of everything," narrator Newman enthuses. "More money, more beauty, more leisure, more education  more redwood hot tubs, more liberal thinkers  more joggers  more ecology enthusiasts and, so we're told, more cocaine snorters."
Yes, we do have more, or at least a lot beauty, money, education, liberals, eco-consciousness and exercise buffs. Leisure? I don't know a lot of people who have that, what with the hyper-intensive parenting, frazzled dual-income families, exhausting commutes. Hot tubs, though, are still a thing buying one was one of the best decisions I made besides having kids just probably not redwood ones. As for cocaine, well, I'm pretty sure the drug du jour is opioids.
As for our "loose swinging lifestyle" including open marriages, something Marin County Superior Court Justice Richard Breiner seemed concerned or amused about in the doc do you see much of that? I don't; I see
a lot more stress, overwhelm and distracted rushing around. And my guess is that there are a lot more affairs than open marriages here.
But in many ways, Marin hasn't strayed far from the stereotypes the documentary highlights.
We drank a lot then and we drink a lot now. In fact, we lead the state in adult binge drinking.
We still have a high suicide rate, double the statewide average.
A lot of us are divorced, then and now 13 percent, which, along with Sonoma County, is the highest in the Bay Area and more than the United States as a whole. As a divorcee myself, I don't see this as something bad. Back in the '70s and '80s, when there were few resources to help divorced families, especially kids, it was a different reality, as San Rafael author Christie Nelson has written.
Houses are still stupidly pricey.
We continue to drive foreign cars Mercedes, Porsche, Audi, BMW (aka Basic Marin Wheels) but, hey, have you noticed all the Teslas around? Take that, Newman!
While EST, the beginning of the "human potential movement" that was founded here, may be gone, the "narcissism business" from life coaches to intuitive guides to self-help retreats is still an integral part of Marin. We want happiness and we want it now!
Part of that often means therapy, and yes Marin still has a lot of shrinks, one for every 133 residents, more than any other county in the state.
Which made Sausalito pharmacist Fred Mayers, noting the number of tranquilizers and sleeping pills he fills, ask, "If we have such a fantastic good life and if the folks are making all this money, why aren't they happy?"
And that's a good question are we happy?
I don't know. The New York Times review of the doc signaled a warning: "The county's indefatigably trendy residents are discovering that the pot at the end of the overachieving rainbow contains little more than the next fad promising total happiness.  more money and leisure time are leading to orgies of self‐absorption."
So did Newman: "What is happening in Marin County may soon he happening where you live unless, that is, it's happening there already."
And hasn't it? I don't think Marin is all that unique anymore when it comes to materialism, narcissism and the relentless search for happiness.
In many ways, we haven't progressed from how we were depicted in "I Want It All Now." But what's missing is our sense of fun. I'd like to bring that back.
And that opening scene, when two naked men are giving a woman hours of sensual touch in and out of the redwood hot tub and with peacock feathers? Heck, let's bring that back, too.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vowed a "prudent" withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, embracing a new, more cautious timeline on Monday while appearing to deny that he had ever ordered an immediate troop departure in the first place.
"We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!" Trump said in a morning tweet. That was "no different from my original statements," he said, accusing the news media of inaccurately reporting "my intentions on Syria."
Last month, Trump declared the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and said troops would be "coming back now." Since then, senior officials have issued a series of statements that have cast doubt on his promise of a quick departure.
The president's endorsement of a flexible departure, conditioned on the still-to-come defeat of the Islamic State, was the latest indication of his administration's zigzagging foreign policy, in which decisions are often made by dramatic presidential tweets and followed by more circumspect policies reflecting top advisers' views.
The initial plan for a quick withdrawal, which would require turning over the U.S.-supported effort against remaining militants to NATO ally Turkey, was met with dismay among officials and lawmakers who feared the Islamic State could return in force. A day after Trump's announcement, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest.
Trump's new remarks appeared to endorse a revised proposal, floated by National Security Adviser John Bolton a day earlier, that would allow U.S. troops and their local allies to extinguish a small but stubborn militant force before they depart. It would also require Turkey to refrain from attacking Syrian Kurdish troops who are the chief U.S. partner on the ground.
The evolving plans came as Bolton traveled Monday to Ankara, Turkey's capital, for talks with Turkish officials on the U.S. withdrawal, including protection of the American-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, which Turkey has vowed to expel from northeast Syria.
Officials across the government have scrambled in recent days to keep up with shifting statements from administration leaders, even as they continued to make plans for a near-term military exit that they cautioned could squander the fruits of a four-year military effort. There are more than 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.
While Trump initially demanded a 30-day departure, officials said the administration later settled on an exit within 120 days to give the military more time to break down bases and safely remove equipment and personnel. The latest comments from Trump and Bolton intensified uncertainty about what would occur.
Trump's pullout plan fueled concerns among allied nations, including France and Britain, who have sent their own troops to Syria. It also drew criticism from his own party, including from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who on Sunday said Trump had "made a mistake" with his initial pronouncement but was now "slowing down."
On Monday, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee accused Trump of "changing course like a drunken sailor."
"It shows that our president literally doesn't know what he is doing. He is making it up as he goes," Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., told CNN. "The way he is going about it is disastrous."
But Trump and his top advisers were defiant Monday as they denied that their Syria plans had changed.
"The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria," Trump said in the same tweet, referring to articles on Sunday from numerous publications, including the Times and The Washington Post, that noted the shifting accounts of the military exit. "No different from my original statements."

We wised up about kids and screens

Texto completo: In 2014, when I started to write a book about the need to restrict the amount of time our kids spend on screens, the idea was not a popular one. The research I'd done persuaded me to set a tight policy for my own elementary-school children: No television or playing on tablets on weekdays. But I knew my family's rules were considered draconian. And my plan to keep smartphones out of my kids' hands until they were teenagers was practically bonkers.
But after a year like 2018, I'm feeling a lot less countercultural.
I trace the tech backlash of 2018 to the end of 2017 with the publication of Jean Twenge's Atlantic article "Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?" It spread through the mommy blogosphere like wildfire. You could actually watch as the social media conversation moved from "iPads are just like comic books were 50 years ago" to "Wait, why are those suicide numbers so high?"

But an even broader culture shift began in April when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress. It seemed to finally dawn on our political leaders, and the mothers and fathers watching the hearings, that something was seriously amiss about the business plan -- collecting and selling personal data about us and our children -- of internet giants like Facebook.
Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Zuckerberg whether he would be comfortable telling the committee the name of the hotel he'd stayed at before the hearings, or if he would be comfortable sharing the names of the people he had messaged that week.
When Zuckerberg declined, Durbin followed up: "I think that may be what this is all about. Your right to privacy. The limits of your right to privacy. And how much you" -- he meant all of us -- "give away in modern America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world."
The most obvious data point that "America Is Falling Out of Love With Silicon Valley," as one Bloomberg headline put it, is probably the tumbling stock prices of tech companies. The big five -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google -- lost about a trillion dollars in the fourth quarter. In October came another signal, the release of a study of 4,500 children ages 8 to 11 published in the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health medical journal, which found that limiting kids' screen time was linked to better cognition.
Still, the cultural signs -- not the economic and scientific ones -- will make the biggest difference. Anyone paying even a little attention last year could have run into news about how tech executives themselves were working hard to keep their own kids off screens. An employee of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative -- the nonprofit started by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, to "leverage technology" for good -- told the New York Times "the devil lives in our phones and is wreaking havoc on our children." The former editor of Wired compared screens to "crack cocaine."
There's even bipartisan agreement on the issue. According to an Axios survey, from November 2017 to November 2018, the portion of Democrats who believed social media was hurting democracy and free speech went from 37% to 48%, and the percentage of Republicans from 52% to 69%.
The consensus about kids and screens showed up in poll data too. A Pew Research Center survey from August found: 65% of parents say their kids spend too much time on devices. The kids agree -- 54% of teens say they spend too much time on their cellphones, and 41% say they spend too much time on social media. And more than half of teens "associate the absence of their cellphone with at least one of these three emotions: loneliness, being upset or feeling anxious."
All of this should make it easier for parents to take action, and I've seen signs that they have. The group Wait Until 8th, which advocates that parents put off giving their kids a smartphone until at least eighth grade, saw a big bump in the number of families who signed their pledge last year, from 10,000 to 17,000.
And yet, according to that Pew survey in August, even though parents see the dangers and more than half of teens say they have tried to reduce their screen time, only 57% of parents report setting any restrictions on their kids' use of screens.
That number should rise. Parents who want to reduce their kids' screen time now have the culture on their side when it comes to making the right call: less time with the phone or gaming system and more face-to-face interaction, more time outside, more physical activity, more family dinners, more book reading, more board games. The zeitgeist is shifting, take advantage of it.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
I am humbly honored to have been featured in "Slandering the Unborn" ("A Woman's Rights" editorial series, nytimes.com, Dec. 28). As one of the mothers who suffered during the 1990s crack epidemic, I want to thank The New York Times for its apology for how it demonized mothers like me and for its brilliant journalism. The apology is welcomed, and it gives me hope.
I want to apologize as well -- to society, the media, my family and my children. My child welfare case happened because of my drug use, which was due to untreated trauma in my childhood. Without my using drugs, my son would not have been born with drugs in his system, and my parental rights to both my daughter and son would not have been terminated.
The broken entity that is child welfare system and the racism that is so embedded in this society had prominent roles in how my child welfare case played out. Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility of not having raised my children rests with me.
This country's war on drugs was intended to be a system of social control. Yet the war on drugs has instead become a system of social chaos. American citizens, including drug users, have rights. My rights were violated numerous times during my child welfare case, and my family was wrongfully torn apart. When families are wrongfully torn apart, the results are devastating. When the fundamental relationship of every human being -- the relationship of a child with his or her mother -- is severed, the effects can be irreversible.
I had been sober for over two years at the time I was coerced to sign away my parental rights, despite numerous accomplishments and evidence of a rehabilitated life. Being black was used against me. Yet there were other factors that compounded the racism and unjust treatment, including my being a woman who was poor, with an unstable living situation, unmarried and, of course, a drug user.
More important than the demonization of me is the victimization of my son. My son was taken from me at birth, with the only basis for removal being a single drug test. A single drug test is not an indicator of the type of mother a woman will be toward her child.
Authorities made forceful efforts to intrude into the lives of families during the 1990s "war on drugs." Unjust laws like the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 were signed. This act needs to be repealed. The year that it was passed was the year that I entered a 90-day inpatient drug treatment facility, and I have been sober ever since.
Today, I am a productive member of society. I am a homeowner. I hold five academic degrees, three of which are master's degrees. I am the founder and executive director of a nonprofit organization, Families Organizing for Child Welfare Justice. I am president and chief executive of S.D. Sellers Consulting. I have had an 18-year career as a procurement professional. I speak nationally and sit on committees and work groups for child welfare and prison reform. I list my accomplishments not to "toot my own horn" but to show that people can and do recover from drug addiction.
More important, I am a loving mother. Both my daughter and my son sought a relationship with me when they each turned 18, in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Although we are reunited, the process of rebuilding the relationship has been long and sometimes difficult. Yet I am willing to do whatever it takes to make us a family again.
The termination of parental rights means it is possible that we may never again be a legal family, yet we will always be a blood family. I have never and will never give up being their mother. My parental rights were wrongfully terminated. But they can never terminate the parental love.
In 2019, no longer should weak science, poorly informed crusaders and racist attitudes continue to shape public policy. Legislative initiatives with roots in crack hysteria need to be repealed.
Not only does the science around pregnancy need to be approached with humility and humanity, but all science -- and all social norms -- need to be approached with humility and humanity. The underlying racism that fueled the demonization of black women during the crack epidemic is an ugly monster that continues to haunt and hurt our society. Enough is enough.

How Much Do Writers Make? Hint: Hang on to That Day Job.

Texto completo: Writing has never been a lucrative career choice, but a recent study by the Authors Guild, a professional organization for book writers, shows that it may not even be a livable one anymore.
According to the survey results, the median pay for full-time writers was $20,300 in 2017, and that number decreased to $6,080 when part-time writers were considered. The latter figure reflects a 42 percent drop since 2009, when the median was $10,500. These findings are the result of an expansive 2018 study of more than 5,000 published book authors, across genres and including both traditional and self-published writers.
"In the 20th century, a good literary writer could earn a middle-class living just writing," said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of the Authors Guild, citing William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Cheever. Now, most writers need to supplement their income with speaking engagements or teaching. Strictly book-related income -- which is to say royalties and advances -- are also down, almost 30 percent for full-time writers since 2009.
Writing for magazines and newspapers was once a solid source of additional income for professional writers, but the decline in freelance journalism and pay has meant less opportunity for authors to write for pay. Many print publications, which offered the highest rate, have been shuttered altogether.
The decline in earnings is also largely because of Amazon's lion's share of the self-publishing, e-book and resale market, Ms. Rasenberger said. The conglomerate charges commission and marketing fees to publishers that Ms. Rasenberger said essentially prevent their books from being buried on the site. Small and independent publishers, which have fewer resources and bargaining power, have been particularly hard hit. Book publishing companies are passing these losses along to writers in the form of lower royalties and advances, and authors also lose out on income from books resold on the platform.
In some ways, these changes are in line with a general shift toward a gig economy or "hustling," in which people juggle an assortment of jobs to make up for the lack of a stable income. But the writing industry as a whole has always eluded standardization in pay. In a conversation with Manjula Martin in the book "Scratch: Writers, Money, and the Art of Making a Living," edited by Ms. Martin, Cheryl Strayed said, "There's no other job in the world where you get your master's degree in that field and you're like, 'Well, I might make zero or I might make $5 million!"'
In a recent call, Ms. Martin said that "the people who are able to practice the trade of authoring are people who have other sources of income," adding that this creates barriers of entry and limits the types of stories that reach a wide audience. There is also, she added, a devaluation of writing in which it is often viewed as a hobby as opposed to a valuable vocation.
"Everyone thinks they can write, because everybody writes," Ms. Rasenberger said, referring to the proliferation of casual texting, emailing and tweeting. But she distinguishes these from professional writers "who have been working on their craft and art of writing for years."
"What a professional writer can convey in written word is far superior to what the rest of us can do," Ms. Rasenberger said. "As a society we need that, because it's a way to crystallize ideas, make us see things in a new way and create understanding of who we are as a people, where we are today and where we're going."

U.S. jobs report highlights economy's recent strength

Texto completo: For weeks, markets have lurched over fears of an incipient economic downturn. But Friday, a blockbuster jobs report and reassuring comments from the Federal Reserve chairman reminded investors to relish, at least for now, the economy's undeniable strengths.
Employers delivered one of the strongest months of job gains in the last decade, adding 312,000 to payrolls in December, the Labor Department reported. Wages, which had been lagging until recently, showed impressive gains.
"It's an unequivocally phenomenal report all the way around," said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. "Anyone that finds something negative in this report is simply cherry picking."
Economists offered raves that could appear on a movie poster or a book jacket - "Extraordinary!" "Blowout," "Wow!" The figures, they said, offer a resounding response to the question of whether a recession is imminent: "Never mind!" said David Berson, chief economist of Nationwide. "The fears of the economy tipping into a recession now have clearly been overstated."
President Donald Trump took to Twitter to proclaim, "GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!"
But the latest report comes in the context of flashing yellow lights elsewhere. There is an unresolved trade war with China, a nation already contending with an economic downturn that could dampen global demand. In the United States, there is a slowdown in the housing sector, with hints that the auto industry could be next.
And on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management released a survey showing the biggest drop in manufacturing activity since 2008. Many manufacturers blamed rising costs related to tariffs. (The index reading of 54.1 still showed an economy in expansion.) Measures of consumer confidence have also weakened recently.
Economists insist that there is more to celebrate than to fret over. The unemployment rate hovers near a 50-year nadir. (The jobless rate rose last month, to 3.9 percent, but largely because new workers barreled into the labor force, a sign that companies are luring back stragglers.) Job openings are at record highs, and a growing number of workers are quitting, indicating confidence in their ability to find jobs.
Wages, which for months only inched up, have begun to pick up more quickly. December's year-over-year increase hit 3.2 percent, tying October for the biggest surge since 2009. The recovery has gone on for so long that it has finally begun to benefit the lowest-paid workers, who have seen the biggest gains, and African-Americans, whose jobless rate has reached record lows.
"2018 was a banner year for the labor market," said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the employment site ZipRecruiter.
The 99-month streak of job gains could get even longer. There are still Americans who do not have jobs or are not clocking as many hours as they would like. The share of people who have part-time positions but would prefer to work full time is higher today than it was in 2007.
And a far smaller share of the U.S. population is working today than before the recession. That decline is partly because of the aging of the baby boom generation. But even among people in their prime working years, employment is down from before the recession and far below its peak at the height of the dot-com boom.
"We are not yet at maximum employment," Pollak said.
Overall, employers added more jobs in 2018 than they did in 2017, at a monthly average of 220,000. But last year was unique, because Congress passed a big corporate tax cut that essentially bathed a sizzling economy in lighter fluid.
"People got used to these eye-popping job-growth numbers," said Martha Gimbel, director of research for the job-search site Indeed. Even if hiring slows in the coming months, she said, "it doesn't mean that anything's wrong, it just means we are heading back to normal."

TSA agents call in sick as closure drags on

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Texto completo: Last month, when Julián Castro filed the requisite paperwork to run for president, he had to add an accent over the a in Julián by hand. The Federal Election Commission apparently hadn't planned for a candidate with a Spanish name.
It's one of the many ways his candidacy as the only (so far) Latino in the Democratic 2020 field will make the country contemplate its future. Mr. Castro knows that he is the longest of long shots, but he is nothing if not a product of his hometown, San Antonio -- an often underestimated, predominantly Hispanic, American microcosm.
In recent years, some commentators on the right have expressed fear about what a "majority minority" country would look like. The answer is that it would most likely look a lot like San Antonio, where 64 percent of the city's 1.4 million residents are Hispanic and unemployment is below the national average.
After serving as mayor of San Antonio from 2009 to 2014, Mr. Castro, 44, became the secretary of housing and urban development under Barack Obama. But his strongest selling point as an antidote to President Trump and his immigrant bashing might be his runty, but wildly successful, experiment of a hometown.
"At this time when the nation feels so polarized, I saw exactly the opposite in my community," Mr. Castro told me. "A place where people of different backgrounds generally got along very well together."
San Antonio, 150 miles north of the Mexican border and 80 miles south of Austin, is a petri dish of the country's future. It's a place where wage growth has surpassed the national average, housing is 13 percent cheaper than the national average and those who earn the median household income of $56,774 can get a single-family home, access to a good public education and tickets to the occasional Spurs game.
The low cost of living and the healthy economy, bolstered by jobs in tech and cybersecurity, have made San Antonio the fastest-growing city in the country for the past several years, and given it the nation's second-fastest-growing population of millennials, according to the Brookings Institution. The number of residents is expected to double in the next 20 years, with 66 people added daily, according to census data.
Julián and his twin brother, Joaquin, who is a Democratic congressman representing the 20th District of Texas, graduated from San Antonio's public schools several years before I did. Tales of the overachieving twins were local folklore. Their images are painted on the walls of the Pico de Gallo Tex-Mex restaurant and in a mural at Mi Tierra Cafe y Panaderia, along with that of the slain Tejano singer Selena.
We share the same scrappy underdog attitude that comes with being from San Antonio, a working-class city flanked by military bases and overshadowed by Austin, its ritzier and (in my unpopular opinion) insufferable neighbor. The seventh-largest city in the country by population, San Antonio sprawls across 465 square miles of craggy terrain of mesquite trees and cactuses, giving it an unpretentious, small-town feel.
New Yorkers mostly know it as being the home of the Alamo. Sometimes they'll say to me, "Oh, isn't there a river there?" To which, I usually joke that, yes, as a matter of fact, it is the Venice of Texas. (It is nothing like Venice.) Even when the Spurs racked up national N.B.A. championships, the coastal sports media dismissed them as boring. (Luckily, another local hero, Coach Gregg Popovich, is around to belittle said national media.)
"We're not Houston or Dallas, we don't boast," said Leticia Van de Putte, a San Antonio native and former state senator who ran for lieutenant governor of Texas in 2014. "We never give ourselves the 'atta boys' or 'atta girls,' it's not in our nature."
If you spend enough time in San Antonio, it's hard not to run into one of the Castro brothers. ("Half the time they think I'm my brother," Julián Castro said). When we were both back home, Mr. Castro and I usually caught up over tacos, so, just before Christmas, when he was in New York, I met him at La Esquina, a taqueria in Midtown.
"Not as good as Texas, but not bad," Mr. Castro said, a cautious politician's verdict on the $4.99 barbacoa tacos that we both knew would have been fluffier and cost 99 cents in San Antonio.
We spent the first few minutes catching up on local gossip -- a mutual friend; The San Antonio Express-News holding a grudge because he didn't give it an exclusive about his plans to run. ("They put my story in the Metro section!")
When asked by reporters why he was running, given that he hardly registers in the national polls, Mr. Castro talked about his hometown. "I said, 'Go to my neighborhood that I grew up in -- nobody was the front-runner there,"' he recalled. Mr. Castro will base his campaign in San Antonio, starting with a kickoff rally next Saturday.
Until recently, San Antonio was reliably red, but like much of the Southwest, it has been transformed into a battleground by its young and Latino population, bad news for Republicans fearing an increasingly purple Texas. In the midterms, every major statewide candidate, including Senator Ted Cruz and his Democratic opponent, Beto O'Rourke, poured resources into winning San Antonio.
"Julián's rising to the national stage is really symbolic of San Antonio's trajectory" -- and, by extension, the country's, said Jenna Saucedo-Herrera, president and chief executive of the San Antonio Economic Development Foundation.
Part of Mr. Castro's candidacy will be educating voters about what it means to be an acculturated Mexican-American, identifying not with Mexico or "los gringos," but as a uniquely American, comfortably hyphenated blend of the two.
After writing in the accent on his F.E.C. paperwork, Mr. Castro talked briefly with local reporters in the little yellow living room of his house on San Antonio's Northwest Side. The political press jumped on the painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe that hung behind Mr. Castro -- a sign he would be appealing to Latino voters! -- but Mr. Castro just calls that his living room.
It infuriates Mr. Castro that Republicans knock him for not speaking fluent Spanish. "There's a stinging irony in that these people were saying you weren't good enough before because you didn't speak English well enough, and today, somehow you're not good enough because you don't speak Spanish well enough?" he said.
In 1922, Mr. Castro's maternal grandmother emigrated from Coahuila, Mexico, to Eagle Pass, Tex., and worked as a maid. Like many children of immigrants, his mother, Rosie Castro, a civil rights activist and single mom, raised her own children to speak English.
For all its growth, San Antonio remains starkly divided by income. Mr. Castro's wife, Erica Lira Castro, works in the Harlandale Independent School District on the city's South Side, where one in five people live below the poverty line and where she grew up.
Mr. Castro went from Jefferson High School, with a 95 percent Hispanic student body, to degrees from Stanford and Harvard Law. But we both are sometimes snubbed back home for not having attended Alamo Heights High School, the public school on the city's wealthier side of town. It's become this running joke.
In December, I asked Mr. Castro if he thought the joke would stick, now that he is preparing to run for president, and ready to make the case that San Antonio should be this country's future. He has accomplished so much already, we both laughed, without Alamo Heights.
"Oh, well," he said. "Imagine what I could've been."

Giving Scott Joplin help he was denied

Texto completo: The themes that composer Scott Joplin was exploring in his masterwork "Treemonisha" - feminism and black aspiration - struck Leah-Simone Bowen as so ahead of their time that the opportunity to give them a new context for 21st-century audiences struck her as impossible to pass up.
"That it's essentially a conversation within an African community," the playwright said. "That it's about a black woman leading - and that she's chosen to lead? It's really subversive."
And that these ideas were planted in a musical piece 108 years ago by an African American composer who never saw it blossom made the challenge for the Canadian writer and colleagues in the United States all the more irresistible.
As a result, arts institutions from across the continent and the Atlantic - among them, Washington Performing Arts - have invested in an endeavor that Bowen and like-minded artists are now developing: an expansively reimagined "Treemonisha," for which only a piano and vocal score exists, in the Library of Congress. Although the work finally reached the stage in 1972 and is occasionally revived with its schematic original story, no one has tried, the creative team says, to significantly alter its narrative infrastructure in hopes of reaching a wider audience.
That's the mission originally staked out by the Toronto theater company Volcano, with a goal of unveiling the revised "Treemonisha" next year in San Francisco and then taking it on tour to other cities, including a production hosted by Washington Performing Arts in fall 2020.
"I wanted to stick closely to Joplin and create an entirely new story that furthers those themes that resonate with today," said Ross Manson, Volcano's artistic director. "As far as I can find, the libretto has never been touched. We're just giving Joplin the help he was denied."
The next step in "Treemonisha's" binational evolution comes in a 12-day workshop beginning Jan. 14 in Toronto, where 15 singers and a full orchestra will reveal the progress in the three-act work, which Joplin called an opera but Volcano's leaders say defies easy categorization. The group's big-umbrella ethos affirms that notion.
"I define theater as, well, anything," Manson said.
"This is a very unique opera," added Jannina Norpoth, who, with Jessie Montgomery, is arranging the jazz, blues, barbershop and gospel-inflected score, and interpolating into it other Joplin songs. "It lies outside the classical realm, even though it's classical music."
However you define the outcome, this ambitious overhaul, with commissions from WPA, London's South Bank Centre, Canada's National Arts Centre, and arts organizations in California and Alberta, signals an upgrade in efforts to underline African American accomplishments in the fine arts. Joplin, who died penniless in 1917 at age 48, made his reputation as a composer of rag, but his forays into other musical forms went underappreciated. His fame faded as he lapsed into illness and dementia, and it wasn't until a new popularization of his rag compositions, such as "The Entertainer," featured in the 1973 Oscar-winning movie "The Sting," that a major Joplin resurgence occurred.
Manson got the idea for the "Treemonisha" project after seeing it in a Toronto concert hall. "The music was unlike anything I've heard," he said. "As a document, it's visionary. He was putting into classical form an American folk form."
It tells the story of a foundling named Treemonisha, discovered under a tree by a former slave on the Texas-Arkansas border in the late 1800s. She grows up to lead a black community living on a plantation, espousing education as a means to achieve. Joplin's forte, however, was not narrative structure. "As an opera, it is naive, with a libretto virtually devoid of tension or literary ability," New York Times classical music critic Harold C. Shonberg wrote, after the premiere in Atlanta in 1972. "Joplin thought naturally in small forms, and his opera is a collection of set pieces rather than a work with any kind of thread running through it."
Bowen, Norpoth and Montgomery, aided by stage director Weyni Mengesha, have set about inventing a story with a stronger spine to support the music, while retaining Joplin's vision. A critical pivot in their version presents "Treemonisha" as the tale of a fractured community of former slaves, half of whom stayed after the abolition of slavery and turned to the land and their Christianity. The others fled into the forests, embracing what Volcano describes as an "ancient spirituality." It becomes Treemonisha's crusade to bring the two communities together - to move forward together in a reconciliation with the past.
This has required not only a meticulous rewriting of the text, but also a sifting through Joplin's other compositions to bolster the integration of song and story.
"Jessie was the one who said [Joplin] had written dozens of marches," Bowen recalled. "And all of these marches lend themselves to all this drama, more of a tense feel." One of the pieces, "The Great Crush Collision March," about a staged train crash in Crush, Tex., in the 1890s, was adapted for the new "Treemonisha." Norpoth and Montgomery also added African instruments to incorporate more traditional sounds.
The next step, in what has become a painstaking reclamation process, is the Toronto workshop, to hear how these elements have coalesced and how firmly they fulfill Joplin's artistic blueprint.
"Joplin never had his day with his opera," Norpoth said. "It really was his life's work."
"In a way, we are resurrecting it," Bowen added. "But he was the orchestrator, 100 years ago."

A Pentagon-haunting monster was listed in an encyclopedia. Was it folklore, or ... ?

Texto completo: Pentagon officials have better things to do, I'm sure, than reply to strange questions from civilians about monsters, but I got a response to mine the morning after I sent it. It came from Jon Hoffman, the deputy chief historian of the Office of the Secretary of Defense at the time: "I've never heard of it," he emailed.
What Hoffman had never heard of is one of three examples of creatures from American folklore listed under "monsters and imaginary beasts" in the Columbia Encyclopedia, the gold standard of one-volume encyclopedias: "the glitch of the Pentagon," described only as "responsible for general chaos."
When I first read the entry in the encyclopedia's online iteration three years ago, I had the same thought you probably just had: How have I never heard of the chaos monster that stalks the halls of the Pentagon? Of course I Googled it - but no luck. Search for a combination of "glitch" and "Pentagon," and you get news stories about temporarily lost 9/11 photos or the maligned F-35 fighter plane, but no Pentagon monster.
I was able to determine that the entry first appeared in the Columbia Encyclopedia's fourth edition, published in 1975 as the New Columbia Encyclopedia (NCE) and greeted with acclaim. "Making a one-volume encyclopedia is like taking the broth of the universe and condensing it into a bouillon cube," the New York Times wrote at the time. "Unfazed by the mass of ingredients, the Columbia University Press has just produced 10
1/2
•bs. of nutrients called The New Columbia Encyclopedia. It has more than 50,000 articles and about 6.6 million words in 3,052 pages."
I knew that reference books sometimes insert fake entries as a "copyright trap" to deter other publishers from plagiarizing their content. In researching the glitch, I learned about one considered the gem of the genre. Meet:
Mountweazel, Lillian Virginia, 1942-73, American photographer, b. Bangs, Ohio. Turning from fountain design to photography in 1963, Mountweazel produced her celebrated portraits of the South Sierra Miwok in 1964. She was awarded government grants to make a series of photo-essays of unusual subject matter, including New York City buses, the cemeteries of Paris and rural American mailboxes. The last group was exhibited extensively abroad and published as Flags Up! (1972). Mountweazel died at 31 in an explosion while on assignment for Combustibles magazine. Combustibles magazine! The entry is pitch-perfect in its simultaneous silliness and exact mimicry of encyclopedia-speak - so perfect that "mountweazel" has become a term for fake reference entries. As it turned out, Ms. Mountweazel was also introduced to the world in the NCE. Was the glitch another fake entry?
I contacted Paul Lagasse, the editor of the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia - the reference work is now online-only - to ask. He told me he was aware of the entries created for copyright protection. "As the one on Ms. Mountweazel shows, the writers and editors on the fourth edition were a literate and somewhat fun bunch," he said, "but perhaps a little too bored with the faux Civil War generals that I was told once provided protection against cribbing." However, no one had ever informed him that the glitch was a mountweazel.
Over subsequent months, I made dozens of inquiries about the glitch, but no one - not folklorists or linguists or authors of books about the Pentagon - had ever heard of it. I scoured the NCE masthead for an editor or contributor who might have written the entry. Months went by without success. More than 40 years had passed, and many names were too common or had changed. Some people had died.
But then a breakthrough: I came upon Agnes McKirdy - listed in the Times's NCE article as a senior editor in the humanities - in an author bio for the late horror novelist Ken Greenhall. The bio described Greenhall as a "former editor of reference books" and named McKirdy as his wife. I found an Agnes Greenhall with a New York phone number and called. When she answered, I said that I hoped I was reaching the right Agnes Greenhall.
"There's only one and it's me," she said. (I didn't tell her about the other listing in Utah.) She was curious as to how I'd found her, and I told her what I just told you, before getting to the even more complicated reason I was calling. After I fumbled through all the context, the fake entries started to come back to her. She named two off the top of her head: Lillian Mountweazel and another that, as far as I can tell, has never been revealed before:
Dayton, Robert, 1939-, American artist, b. Pasadena, Calif. Blinded in an accident in 1968, Dayton has experimented since then with odor-emitting gases that resemble pungent body odors. His work, called Aroma-Art, is presented in a sealed chamber where an audience inhales scented air. A literate and fun bunch, indeed. I asked if the "glitch of the Pentagon" rang a bell. "Yes, it does, vaguely, but I can't remember who actually wrote it," she said. I asked if it was real, but she said she couldn't talk right then. I was reluctant to get off the line without an answer, but we scheduled a call for the next day. When we reconnected, Greenhall acknowledged that she had edited the entry. And then, with one word, confirmed the hunch that had launched an obsessive quest. Was the glitch another fake entry?
"Yes."
She asked if I would like to be put in contact with the author. She thought it was Karen Tweedy-Holmes - who, she informed me, was also the creator of Lillian Virginia Mountweazel.
Tweedy-Holmes is now a professional photographer, and portions of her website bio read a bit like a mountweazel: "Her images of the male nude were exhibited extensively to critical acclaim in the 1970s and are among the first art photographs of this subject by an American woman."
Before we got to the big questions, I asked if she knew what fake encyclopedia entries are sometimes called now, and she said she didn't. "They're called mountweazels," I said.
"I had no idea. I haven't thought about Lillian in a very long time," she replied. She told me that she had worked on the NCE as a junior humanities editor with a specialty in art history. When it was decided to include some fake entries, the task of composing one fell to her. "Virginia" was her mother's name, and "mountweazel" was a nonsense word she and her cousin used. "When I decided to do that article, I thought that was a perfect last name for her. Then I started making up the tales about her life," she said. "I'm a photographer, so she became a photographer."
She told me everything she remembered about creating Lillian and working on the NCE. But when I asked about the glitch, she said she'd never heard of it. I read her the entire entry, but nothing.
Here the trail went cold: I was unable to get back in touch with Greenhall. Her number was disconnected and my letter went unanswered.
And then the glitch itself disappeared. A few months after I spoke to Lagasse, he confirmed that, after being unable to verify it himself, he had removed the glitch of the Pentagon from the entry where it had lurked, among the other monsters and imaginary beasts, for nearly half a century.

Texto completo: The 2017 tax cut has received pretty bad press, and rightly so. Its proponents made big promises about soaring investment and wages, and also assured everyone that it would pay for itself; none of that has happened.
Yet coverage actually hasn't been negative enough. The story you mostly read runs something like this: The tax cut has caused corporations to bring some money home, but they've used it for stock buybacks rather than to raise wages, and the boost to growth has been modest. That doesn't sound great, but it's still better than the reality: No money has, in fact, been brought home, and the tax cut has probably reduced national income. Indeed, at least 90 percent of Americans will end up poorer thanks to that cut.
Let me explain each point in turn.
First, when people say that U.S. corporations have "brought money home" they're referring to dividends that overseas subsidiaries have paid to their parent corporations. These did indeed surge briefly in 2018, as the tax law made it advantageous to transfer some assets from the books of those subsidiaries to the home companies; these transactions also showed up as a reduction in the measured stake of the parents in the subsidiaries, i.e., as negative direct investment.
But these transactions are simply rearrangements of companies' books for tax purposes. Suppose that Multinational Megacorp USA decides to have its subsidiary, Multinational Mega Ireland, transfer some assets to the home company. This will produce simultaneous and opposite movement in dividends and direct investment. But the company's overall balance sheet - which always included the assets of MM Ireland - hasn't changed at all. If you want to know whether investable funds are really being transferred to the U.S., you need to look at the overall balance on financial account - or, what should be the same (and is more accurately measured), the inverse of the balance on current account.
So the tax cut induced some accounting maneuvers, but did nothing to promote capital flows to America. The tax cut did, however, have one important international effect: We're now paying more money to foreigners.
Bear in mind that the one clear, overwhelming result of the tax cut is a big break for corporations: Federal tax receipts on corporate income have plunged.
The key point to realize is that in today's globalized corporate system, a lot of any country's corporate sector is actually owned by foreigners, either directly because corporations here are foreign subsidiaries, or indirectly because foreigners own U.S. stocks. Indeed, roughly a third of U.S. corporate profits basically flow to foreign nationals - which means that a third of the tax cut flowed abroad, rather than staying at home. This probably outweighs any positive effect on GDP growth. So the tax cut probably made America poorer, not richer.
And it certainly made most Americans poorer. While two-thirds of the corporate tax cut may have gone to U.S. residents, 84 percent of stocks are held by the wealthiest 10 percent of the population. 
Meanwhile, since the tax cut isn't paying for itself, it will eventually have to be paid for some other way - either by raising other taxes or by cutting spending on programs that people value. The cost of these hikes or cuts will be much less concentrated on the top 10 percent than the benefit of the original tax cut. So it's a near-certainty that the vast majority of Americans will be worse off thanks to Donald Trump's only major legislative success.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets of the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
U.S. News and World Report has released its annual rankings of the Best Diets for 2019, revealing the Mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.
Each diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on U.S. News and World Report rankings. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions this year.
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.1/5 Weight Loss | 1.5/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.7/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 3.0/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.4/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy
A healthy diet doesn't require a complete life change. Instead, make smarter choices more often when shopping, cooking and eating.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- This article is a collaboration between ProPublica and The New York Times.
A year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the Education Department plans to investigate their accusations that the Wolf Point School District in Montana discriminates against Native American students.
In a Dec. 28 letter, sent hours after The New York Times and ProPublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the district, the department's Office for Civil Rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in eastern Montana that it would look into the complaint. The board includes members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Native American and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of Wolf Point's enrollment.
According to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services.
The department said it would also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent's accusations that a Native student was racially harassed. The student was not identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter.
"Tribal children have suffered unfairly for years in the Wolf Point School District," said Melina Healey, the lawyer representing the tribal executive board. She called for a "swift and thorough investigation that leads to much-needed reforms."
The Office for Civil Rights is already looking into a complaint by Louella Contreras that the Wolf Point district failed to provide her granddaughter Ruth Fourstar with special education services. The department's decision to look into the tribal leaders' broader accusations bucks the Education Department's policy under Secretary Betsy DeVos of pulling back from investigating complaints of systemic discrimination by schools and colleges, and concentrating on mistreatment of individuals.
ProPublica reported in June that under Ms. DeVos, the department had scuttled more than 1,200 civil rights investigations that began under the Obama administration and lasted at least six months.
Nationwide, more than 90 percent of Native students attend integrated public schools, near or on reservations, that have historically restricted tribal influence over curriculum, funding and staffing. Native American students have some of the worst academic outcomes in public schools: They score lower than nearly all other demographic groups on national tests, and less than three-fourths of Native students graduate from high school.
In June 2017, the tribal executive board filed a 46-page complaint that described dozens of instances where Wolf Point schools provided limited academic opportunities and social support to Native students. ProPublica and The Times found that Native students in Wolf Point are twice as likely to receive at least one suspension compared with their white peers, and white students are more than 10 times as likely to take at least one advanced placement course as Native students, according to an analysis of federal education data.
In interviews, students, staff and parents said Wolf Point's schools push Native children into a poorly funded, understaffed program for remedial and truant students. Native students said they were dropped from sports teams after giving birth, while a white student was not.
The Times-ProPublica investigation also found that some Native students have turned to self-harm and suicide. Three months before the tribal executive board's complaint, a Wolf Point High School junior killed himself after a public rebuke from the principal for poor attendance, two students said. He was the second student at the high school in seven years to take his own life after being chided by district administrators.
Jeana Lervick, a lawyer representing the school district, said on Wednesday that the district is closed for the holidays and is unable to comment on the federal investigation.
"Wolf Point Schools works constantly to address the challenges facing our students and, in particular, our Indigenous students," Ms. Lervick said in an earlier statement. "Our district is aware of historical issues in our nation and as educators do everything in our power to address them."
The district's superintendent and the high school principal did not respond to emailed questions.
Should civil rights investigators identify violations of federal law, the school district could lose federal funding. Typically, before investigators recommend sanctions, school districts voluntarily enter into an agreement with the Education Department to remedy any wrongdoing. Federal civil rights investigations can take up to several years to resolve.
"Instead of providing a safe learning environment, the Wolf Point School District adds to the long history of educational abuses of our tribal communities," said Roxanne Gourneau, a former member of the Fort Peck tribal executive board, who has worked to overhaul Wolf Point schools since her son killed himself after being disciplined at the high school. "The school district has done more to fuel Native students' trauma than to support their education. Change is long overdue."

Texto completo: The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights will investigate allegations that a public school system in Montana discriminated against Native American students, according to a letter sent by the department to attorneys representing the students.
The students, from the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, filed a complaint with the federal government in June 2017 alleging the Wolf Point School District "deprives them of basic rights to which they are entitled in school." The discrimination included dozens of instances of bullying, racial slurs and disproportionate discipline of students who are not white, according to the complaint.
In its Dec. 28 letter, the department said it would investigate issues raised in the complaint, including charges that Native American students were subject to more severe discipline than white students, that Native American students were not properly evaluated for special-education services and that the school system failed to respond to complaints of racial harassment.
Melina Healey, an attorney for the tribes, said in an interview she was optimistic about the department's decision to investigate "persistent discrimination and mistreatment" of Native American students in Wolf Point schools.
"I hope it will lead to necessary resolution and much-needed reforms in the district," she said.
Healey said the Education Department has authority to instruct the school system to revise its policies to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws and, if the district fails to do so, can refer the case to the Justice Department for follow-up.
Education Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill confirmed the Office for Civil Rights has three open investigations into Wolf Point and two additional cases under evaluation. She declined further comment because the investigations are ongoing.
The department's letter announcing the investigation arrived shortly after publication last month of a lengthy article by the New York Times and ProPublica detailing the allegations and their impact on Native American students on the reservation.
Jeana Lervick, an attorney with the firm representing the Wolf Point School District, said in an email the system had been notified by the Education Department about the investigation and would cooperate. Wolf Point schools, she wrote, "work exceptionally hard to ensure that all students receive an excellent education, and we are extremely concerned about the allegations."
Wolf Point Schools Superintendent Rob Osborne did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation.
Wolf Point, the largest town on the Fort Peck reservation, has a population of 2,600 and is 57 percent Native American. Although they are a majority, tribe members do not control the school board and, according to the original complaint, the native representatives on the board are often overruled on issues that affect native students.
"Non-Native domination of the District has created a culturally unwelcoming school environment for Native students," the complaint reads. "It undermines Native students' sense that they can be future teachers and school leaders, further perpetuating their under-representation."
Healey, the attorney for the tribes, said Friday that she was not aware of any changes made by the school system to address charges made in the original complaint.
"We hope the school district will start to listen to and include the native families and students that they've mistreated and discriminated against for years," she said. That process, she said, would include investment in Native American cultural competency for teachers and staff, reducing suspensions and expulsions of native students, and adding native faculty and staff.
For Roxanne Gourneau, a tribe member whose children and grandchildren attended school in the system, the announcement of an investigation signaled a solution could be in sight.
"The school district has done more to fuel Native students' trauma than to support their education," she said in a statement Friday. "Change is long overdue. I am hopeful that this investigation by the DOE may finally bring that change."

Texto completo: "Aquaman" * 1/2
PG-13, 2:23, action
The DC Comics superhero Aquaman takes center stage, on land and under the sea, in "Aquaman." Jason Momoa ("Game of Thrones") is surly and charismatic, with eyebrows that suggest all sorts of fun. Screenwriters David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall stumble all over the place trying to set up simple origin-story exposition - how Arthur Curry, the lighthouse keeper's son, was born to Queen Atlanna of Atlantis, and how he must prevent war waged by Orm and associates, while aquamanning up to claim a leadership role down where the fishies go. The film's just sincere enough where it counts to float this soggy mediocrity for a global audience. - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Mary Poppins Returns" ** 1/2
PG, 2:11, family
"Mary Poppins Return" is director Rob Marshall's hectic sequel to the 1964 Disney musical cherished by millions. Emily Blunt's incarnation of the magical, gently fearsome nanny suggests a hint of the imperious sparkle Julie Andrews brought to Mary Poppins. Then, Blunt adds streaks of witty, sly playfulness that are more her thing. "Mary Poppins Returns" takes place 24 years after "Mary Poppins." The effects of the global economic downturn feed into screenwriter David Magee's misery-adjacent storyline concerning the grown-up Banks children. The original "Mary Poppins" was exuberant. "Mary Poppins Returns" is often just pushy. - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Bumblebee" ** 1/2
PG-13, 1:53, action
Downsizing was the only answer for the "Transformers" franchise after 2017's epic, sprawling "Transformers: The Last Knight." Paramount decided to pare back to an origin story and getting at what makes this franchise tick: the friendly yellow Transformer known as Bumblebee. Hailee Steinfeld stars as Charlie. All she wants is her own set of wheels, so when a dusty yellow VW Beetle shows up at the junkyard, she finagles a way to take it home. You'll come away with a newfound sense of affection for the most lovable alien vehicle in the universe. - Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" *** 1/2
PG, 2:00, action
The animated "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" gives ensemble superheroism a good name while giving audiences a really good time. It derives most of its story from the character of Miles Morales, an Afro-Latino Brooklyn teenager whose father is a vigilante-hating cop. Exploring the subway tunnels with his uncle Aaron, Miles is bitten by a genetically altered problem spider. Soon he learns that he, like Peter Parker, has been chosen to take on the Spidey mantle. The second half's a bit of a letdown, but by the end, we're back where we need to be: captured, happily, by Miles' story and the "Spider-Verse" notion of the mask being for everyone up to the task. - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"The Mule" * 1/2
R, 1:56, action
Producer, director and star Clint Eastwood's latest film, "The Mule," takes its inspiration from Sam Dolnick's 2014 New York Times Magazine feature on Leo Sharp. Sharp was a World War II Bronze Star veteran, a horticulturist and day lily "hybridizer" of some renown. When his business stumbled with the rise of online commerce, he tried running drugs for the Sinaloa cartel headed by Joaquin Guzman, better known as El Chapo. "The Mule" retells it as if terrified of giving the main character a strong point of view, or viewing him through a stimulating clash of perspectives. The movie's version of Sharp is Earl Stone. "The Mule" struggles to find a rhythm. - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune

Texto completo: WHAT IT'S ABOUT James Watson - former director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Laurel Hollow - codiscovered the double helix structure of the DNA molecule with Francis Crick (who died in 2004), based in part on research by Rosalind Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer who died in 1958 (Crick and Watson would later be awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery). This "American Masters" portrait by Mark Mannucci has already been accorded rare media attention, notably a Jan. 1 story in The New York Times, which picked up on Watson's comments here about race and intelligence. Watson first told a British journalist in 2007 that blacks have lower intelligence than whites on average because of genetic differences. He restates that position in interviews conducted last year for "Decoding Watson." Watson, 90, is recovering from injuries suffered in a car accident on Bungtown Road near the lab in October.
MY SAY The question, or elephant in the room, arrives late in "Becoming Watson," when a voice off-screen asks, "have your views on the relationship between race and intelligence changed?"
 Cue to Watson, who pounces immediately: "No, not at all. I would like for them to change since there'd be new knowledge which says that your nurture is much more important than your nature, but I haven't seen any knowledge. There's a difference on the average between blacks and whites on IQ tests and the difference is ..."
 At this point, the grand old man of the double helix appears to lose track of what he's about to say - either that or weighs the irreparable damage he's about to inflict on his legacy - then blurts out, "it's genetics."
 If this all sounds like the mad, muddled maunderings of senescence, then it's important to know who the maunderer is here. "Decoding Watson" explains: Watson is one of the most important scientists of the 20th century, but his racist views have since threatened to overshadow his singular accomplishments and may have now, ineradicably, superseded them. This program didn't set out to deracinate Watson -- no "American Masters" ever does of its subject. Instead, Watson manages to do all the work himself:
"Given my desire to never stay away from messy problems," he says, "I was bound to [hurt] myself sometimes, and that's what I did."
And does. And how.
 What's so tragic and melancholic about this portrait are both the man and accomplishment. Along with Crick, and a vitally important assist from Franklin - who gets her due here, if not quite the posthumous Nobel she almost certainly deserves - Watson discovered one of the most elegantly perfect structures in the known universe. He rebuilt Cold Spring Harbor Lab into a world-class research facility. He supported scientists and science - real science - for decades. Then the foot went in the mouth, and there it has remained.
Lest any viewer be left with an impression that there's a valid debate within the scientific community about race-based genetics as it relates to intelligence, "Decoding Watson" quickly settles the matter: No, there isn't, not remotely, or as Joseph Graves Jr., an evolutionary biologist and critic of Watson's race-based views, puts it, "there is absolutely no evidence that favors intelligence in any subpopulation of human beings, none whatsoever."
 There are plenty of Watson admirers in this portrait, but you can easily read the pain and confusion in their faces as they try to reconcile the man - or at least his repugnant views - with his accomplishments. Graves gets the takeaway line, if not quite the epitaph: "Racism suspends all rational judgment [and] takes people who are otherwise brilliant people and gets them down roads that are intellectually unsupportable."
BOTTOM LINE Comprehensive, fair and ultimately damni

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U. S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
SEN. JOHN KENNEDY: Don't trample on the Second Amendment
Even with Democrats taking power in the House on Thursday, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
►More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns, and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat.
It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3. 4 per 100,000.
►Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
►Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt “red flag” laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person’s firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end.

Texto completo: TV Q&A

I watch "The Honeymooners" all the time. One of the episodes is "Mama Loves Mambo." It's about a mambo instructor who moves into the building. Can you tell me the actor's name?

Charles Korvin played Carlos the mambo instructor. He was an actor who "made a career playing gentleman thieves and philandering husbands," the New York Times said after Korvin died in 1998 at the age of 90. Born in Hungary, and educated in France, he was also a documentary maker and had a steady movie-acting career from 1945 until about 1951, costarring with Merle Oberon in three movies, before he was caught up in the Hollywood blacklist. He then worked in TV, including on "The Honeymooners" and on "Zorro," returning to the big screen in 1965.

What happened to the Australian actor who played Jack the Mountie on "When Calls the Heart"?

Daniel Lissing left the series when his contract ended, with Jack killed off on the series. (That may sound familiar to "Blue Bloods" fans, who were shocked when Linda Reagan died off-camera, between seasons, following Amy Carlson's departure from the series after her contract ended.)

Lissing said after the Jack's death episode aired that the decision to leave was "for reasons that are very personal to me," -- but did not elaborate, as ETonline.com noted. He remains friendly with the cast, telling ET in November he still talks almost daily with costar Erin Krakow. But he has been taking on other projects, such as the recent Hallmark movie "Christmas in Love," where he co-starred with Brooke D'Orsay.

Is "Orange is the New Black" coming back with a new season? There are plenty of loose ends that could be tied up.

The Netflix series will be back in summer 2019 for a seventh season, which will also be its last. The end of the sixth season saw central character Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling) getting early release from prison and the seventh will include a look at her life on the outside. Executive producer Tara Herrman told the Hollywood Reporter her release will be in contrast to what nonwhite, less privileged inmates on the series will experience.

Q: It's not fair that OWN cancelled "Love Is --" because of the executive producer. His wife is the producer! Please explain. It's not fair to the actors.

As you know, executive producer Salim Akil has been accused of assaulting actress Amber Dixon Brenner along with the claim they had a long affair; Akil is married to Mara Brock Akil, producer on "Love Is." Salim Akil reportedly called Brenner's accusations "totally untrue" while acknowledging a past relationship with Brenner. Still, OWN decided not to go ahead with a previous plan for a second season of the show. The announcement of the cancellation noted that the series was "inspired by the real-life love story" of the Akils, which made some observers believe that the off-camera events tainted how people would view the characters on the show. As for the actors, Ebony.com noted that "cast and producers will still be paid for Season 2 due to contractual obligations established during the show's initial renewal."

Finally, a little Christmas flashback, to solve a holiday mystery.

Freeform aired "The Santa Clause" and "The Santa Clause 3," but not "The Santa Clause 2." Was the movie banned for some reason? I can't recall seeing "Santa Clause 2" on any channel this season.

This is a question that has popped up from time to time for years, both about Freeform and its earlier incarnation, ABC Family. The short answer is the channel does not have the rights to the second film, and it has aired instead on other channels. This year, for instance, it was on AMC.

There's inequity in how we view men, women, and likability

Texto completo: On Monday, two things happened. Elizabeth Warren announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee. And Tiffany Haddish failed to be funny on stage in Florida.
In both cases, the narrative became less about these women doing their jobs, and more about their likability. Because when you are a girl or a woman, it's all about being liked.
Within hours of Warren's announcement, Politico was picking apart her chances of escaping the stigmas that plagued Hillary Clinton, “written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground."
And Haddish, known for her catchphrase “She Ready," became a #shenotready hashtag.
She bombed her New Year's Eve set at the James L. Knight Center in Miami. She was hungover and flubbed. Paying customers have the right to be disappointed over a bad show. They deserve a refund. The comedian herself admitted she flopped, tweeting, “I wish it was better Miami. I prayed on it and I have a strong feeling this will never happened (sic) again."
But people piled on with delight over her failure. The schadenfreude was real. A video of a man in the audience heckling her performance has been viewed more than 2.6 million times and has 11,000 likes.
In comments under her pictures on Instagram and all over Twitter, Haddish has been called trash. And then came a debate about liking her and whether disliking her meant you hate black women — a debate that has plagued her career, as she is often sadly critiqued for being “loud and ghetto."
Sigh. How is this not the story of one bad night? Comedians bomb sometimes. Dave Chappelle got booed off stage in Detroit in 2015 and went on to stage a major critically acclaimed comeback.
Haddish partied too hard, got it wrong, and people are enjoying her fall.
“Saturday Night Live" comic Pete Davidson, playing sets in Medford and Boston on Monday, told his fans he'd taken weed and shrooms before the show. The New York Times described Davidson's performance as “rough and raucous stand-up" that started off “slow and discursive" before he eventually found his stride. Davidson has a high-profile struggle with depression and online trolling. This time, his audience gave him the grace to get it together. He deserved it.
Haddish was fed to the online wolves.
Women are defined based on whether they please the people. We should talk about Elizabeth Warren's policies. We should talk about her powerhouse fund-raising. We should talk about her populism. We should talk about her problematic DNA test.
But are we really going to talk about whether a second-term senator is likable enough to be president? Not her diplomacy, but her aloofness?
Her achievements might be the very root of the backlash.
“When women are successful in male-dominated fields, they are deemed less likable," says Sarah Sobieraj, associate professor of sociology at Tufts University. “The very fact that they are successful or knowledgable is what makes them less likable."
On Wednesday morning, Jess McIntosh, former Hillary Clinton outreach coordinator, told CNN the likability narrative is a sexist practice.
“In the very beginning, as we just start to see women candidates coming through, I want to be cautious that we don't fall into the sexist trap of talking about their likability exclusively," she said. “It's not about running for prom queen, it's about running for president, and we need to make sure we are treating the women in the race the same as the men."
There's inequity in how we view men, women, and likability when President Trump is trying to bully the nation into building a wall by shutting down the government and Louis C.K. is still performing.
“Women are expected to be sweet and nurturing and considerate of others," Sobieraj says. “So when women act or behave in a competitive or assertive or authoritative way, it is read as deviant."
Maybe our need to define women by how cool or nice or pleasant they are is why Warren felt the need to chug a beer on Instagram Monday night. “It's one more way to be able just to invite people into your home," she said. But critics called her desperate.
Author and feminist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie had it right in her 2017 book, “Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions."
“Teach her to reject likability," Adichie wrote. “Her job is not to make herself likeable, her job is to be her full self, a self that is honest and aware of the equal humanity of other people."
Like it or not, women are letting go of the likability politics and stepping into their power.

Trump blasts Mattis' work as Pentagon chief: 'Not too good'

Texto completo: President Donald Trump criticized former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' performance Wednesday, as acting Pentagon chief Patrick Shanahan stepped into his new job and the U.S. military sought to make sense of the president's murky plans for the war in Syria.
Trump questioned how well Mattis had served as Pentagon chief, and pointed out that the retired Marine general had been removed early by the Obama administration from his last position as chief of U.S. Central Command over policy disagreements.
"What's he done for me? How had he done in Afghanistan? Not too good," Trump said. "As you know President Obama fired him, and essentially so did I."
Trump's comments came as the Pentagon attempted to show stability in the wake of Mattis' departure, who is beloved by many in Trump's political base. Mattis resigned Dec. 20 citing policy disagreements with Trump, but had said he would stay on through the end of February. Days later, Trump forced him out.
Shanahan said Wednesday in a statement that he has tapped David Norquist, an undersecretary of defense who serves as comptroller, to perform the duties of the deputy defense secretary while Shanahan moves up from that position to serve as acting defense secretary. Norquist has served since June 2017 as the Defense Department's chief financial officer, and has "insight into virtually every tenet of this department," Shanahan said.
Shanahan took over for Mattis on New Year's Day after Trump removed Mattis from his position in an abrupt Dec. 23 decision.
On his first working day as acting defense secretary, Shanahan made clear that his focus is on China.
The former Boeing executive gathered civilian leaders of the military services and other top civilian officials at the Defense Department on Wednesday, telling them that he is focused on the strategy as developed and put in place under Mattis. It emphasizes the importance of great power competition with Russia and China, after America's many years of fighting insurgent wars in the Middle East.
In that context, Shanahan said the Pentagon leaders should remember, "China, China, China," according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss internal defense meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.
With Mattis gone, another planned move -- bringing in Marine Maj. Gen. Burke Whitman to serve as a new senior spokesman -- will not happen. Whitman was expected to brief the media in 2019 alongside chief Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who abruptly resigned on New Year's Eve as Mattis left the Pentagon. White is under investigation by the Defense Department inspector general amid accusations that she had subordinate staff members carry out menial tasks for her in violation of Pentagon rules.
The changes came as the Pentagon grapples with Trump's desire to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria and cut down the 14,000 that are in Afghanistan. Trump issued withdrawal orders for Syria on Dec. 19, and also directed the Pentagon to draw up plans to roughly reduce the number of service members in Afghanistan by half, U.S. officials have said.
Trump initially wanted all of the U.S. troops out of Syria within 30 days, triggering Mattis' resignation and concerns from Republicans and Democrats that the decision would create new chaos in the region. The president, in a video posted on his Twitter account Dec. 19, said that U.S. troops were "all coming back" from Syria, "and they're coming back now."
Trump has agreed to give the military four months to depart Syria, according to three U.S. officials. That development was first reported by The New York Times.
Pentagon officials, who rarely discuss troop movements before they occur, have declined to say how long a withdrawal will take.
"We are focused on a deliberate and controlled withdrawal of forces, taking all measures possible to ensure our troops' safety as they continue in their mission of an enduring defeat of ISIS," said Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman. "Out of concern for operational security, we are not going to discuss operational details."

Texto completo: In the 1940s, the great pediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott became a regular at a small London bookshop. Biographies were his chief interest. It didn't matter whose; he read them all -- books about soldiers, scientists, actors. Amazed, the bookseller once asked him how he kept up such a pace.
"Oh, I'm only interested up to the age of 5," Winnicott reportedly replied.
Childhood, and its contusions, are also the governing preoccupations of the Argentine writer Samanta Schweblin. Her stories are obsessed with notions of purity and danger; with the ways people can be deformed, very early on, in the name of tenderness, teaching and care.
All this without a whisper of sentimentality. Schweblin is among the most acclaimed Spanish-language writers of her generation. She has said her love of literature came from American writers like John Cheever and Raymond Carver. (You might also detect the influence of her contemporaries Kelly Link and Jesse Ball.) But, to me, her true ancestor could only be David Lynch; her tales are woven out of dread, doubles and confident loose ends.
"Mouthful of Birds," a collection of 20 stories, has just been published in English. It follows the success of "Fever Dream" (2017) (both seamlessly translated by Megan McDowell), a dialogue between a poisoned woman and a young boy who has information about what is killing her. It's a mournful, terrifying book -- classic horror meets eco-thriller, a story about the ferocity of maternal love and its inadequacies in the face of a world we have destroyed. The original title of the novel was "Distancia de Rescate" -- "Rescue Distance" -- after the dying woman's term for how far she would allow her child to roam.
The new collection is impressive, but it lacks the finish of "Fever Dream." It contains three perfect stories ("Headlights," "Mouthful of Birds," "Toward Happy Civilization"), three stinkers and a handful of exploratory sketches. There's a feeling of peeking into Schweblin's notebook, of watching her early experiments with technique (this book was originally published before the novel). She can be oblique, as in "Slowing Down," a story about aging (I think?), then blunt, as in "Heads Against Concrete," with its opening line: "If you pound a person's head against concrete -- even if you're doing it only so they'll come to their senses -- you will very likely end up hurting them."
These stories spiral into their own circles of madness, but they all belong to the same universe. Odd plot points repeat: mysterious holes in the ground, violence to animals, violence to children, violence to children disguised as animals. They begin in barren landscapes, on empty plains and steppes, on interrupted journeys. There are grotesque parodies of family life (a pair of kidnappers treat their prisoners with the loving pride of parents), parodies of work (a woman's job requires her to lie facedown on a table and have her leg hair ritually plucked away by six beauticians). The desperate desire to bear children recurs but so too does ambivalence, even revulsion. One woman decides she does not want to be pregnant and wills her belly to shrink and shrink until she finally spits out the baby -- "the size of an almond" -- into a jar, to wait for the future. Maybe.
The clearest line of continuity is in the dialogue, in how the characters communicate -- or don't, rather. There are strains of Beckett and Pinter in the way Schweblin's people use so many words to say so little. They have a fondness for digging holes in the ground, to hide in, and they use language to the same effect.
This is to say nothing of the perverse ways people speak to themselves. In the title story, a man discovers that his teenage daughter has taken to eating live pet birds. He is repulsed when he catches her at it for the first time, when he hears the bird scream and sees her bloodstained mouth smiling in shy apology. But he quickly begins explaining it away to himself: "I thought about how, considering there are people who eat people, eating live birds wasn't so bad. Also, from a natural point of view it was healthier than drugs, and from a social one, it was easier to hide than a pregnancy at 13." Schweblin's characters constantly talk themselves out of their perceptions, out of reality.
Schweblin herself stopped talking when she was 12 years old. She has said she was overwhelmed by the gulf between what she wanted to say and what she thought people could understand. The school principal required a doctor's note testifying that she was normal in order for her to continue with classes. A psychotherapist complied, stating that she was extremely normal but had a "complete disinterest" in the world around her.
That diagnosis of aristocratic disdain must have been a gift to a precocious 12-year-old. What makes Schweblin so startling as a writer, however, what makes her rare and important, is that she is impelled not by mere talent or ambition but by vision, and that vision emerges from intense concern with the world, with the hidden cruelties in our relationships with all that is vulnerable -- children, rivers, language, one another.
Look again at any of her stories -- about these bizarre rituals and stupid jobs, the baroque torture of animals, the asphyxiation of children -- strip away all that seems fantastic, keep only that mirror-smooth prose, and what do you see? Schweblin's dark farces just might awaken you to some of your own.

Black voters are ready to be heard

Texto completo: BALTIMORE - The first "Amen!" rang out after a couple of minutes, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, speaking to an almost all-Black audience at Morgan State University's winter commencement, described how America has "systematically discriminated against Black people."
Heads nodded as she mentioned "redlining," the discriminatory practice of denying mortgages, usually in poor and nonwhite areas. There was applause when the Massachusetts Democrat declared the country has "two sets of rules: one for white families and one for everybody else."
Still, if her speech at the historically Black college in Baltimore was a preview of a presidential campaign, she did better at opening the door than at closing the sale. "She didn't sugarcoat anything, but my question is: Will she keep Black issues on the forefront?" asked Kerrianne Largie, 39, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the last Democratic primary.
The first votes of the Democratic presidential primary season remain more than a year away, but Black voters are keenly aware of the prominent role they will play in choosing the next nominee. In 2016, Sanders' "political revolution" flamed out with Black voters, and Hillary Clinton fell short of the robust Black turnout she needed to defeat Donald Trump.
This time around, Democrats are weighing how to reach out to the Black community in the primaries without losing the ability to appeal to the suburban and working class whites who propelled Trump to victory. As the party searches for a candidate who can combine those messages - from a field likely to include several racial minorities - many Black voters want to be engaged in a manner that reflects their electoral power and not passed over in favor of a strategy that prioritizes Trump's heavily white coalition.
With that in mind, potential Democratic candidates interested in the 2020 nomination have begun reaching out to Black leaders and are testing messages for Black voter outreach. This courting is particularly critical for white, liberal Democrats like Warren, Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and lesser-known figures like Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon.
Largie warned against white politicians who "talk about their Black friends" when around Black audiences and then "move on." Her friend Dianna McFarlane, 43, said she looks for a politician "who stays true to their message of equality" even around white voters.
"As people of color, we already know what we go through," said another Morgan State graduate, an engineering student named Tesleem Lawal. "But it's important to hear white politicians talk about that and acknowledge that."
Some of the early Black outreach efforts so far have been public, like Warren's three recent speeches at historically Black colleges or O'Rourke's appearance on "Pod Save the People," the podcast led by racial justice activist DeRay Mckesson.
Other overtures were made in private. O'Rourke has held calls with the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader, and made repeated contact with senior members of the NAACP. In recent months, Merkley and Texas Democrat Julián Castro have reached out to Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the progressive civil rights advocacy group that has positioned itself as a go-to sounding board for prospective candidates.
Warren has stood out in her aggressive wooing of Black leaders, according to several people who have spoken with members of her team. During a trip to New York City, she arranged a sit-down meeting with Robinson to discuss issues popular with social justice activists, including the elimination of cash bail and sweeping criminal justice reform.
Robinson, the head of Color of Change, said candidates seeking to run in 2020 are not asking for endorsements or statements of support at this time. He said his meeting with Warren and others was more about discussing policy issues, rather than campaign strategy. The meetings come as several possible presidential campaigns, including that of Sanders, have made hiring a more diverse campaign staff a top priority.
"I think some of the candidates don't get that they're going to have to actually come with a bold agenda," Robinson said. "If candidates think that this is just about who can beat Trump, they're going to have a rude awakening. People can hate Trump and not love the opposition. It actually has to be about putting out something that allows people to feel like they are connected and their community's issues are being addressed."
The behind-the-scenes activity signals just how different this upcoming primary season stands to be for Democrats. Not only are multiple Black candidates expected to run, including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, but several white candidates are confident they can successfully compete for minority votes.
This includes people like Warren and Merkley, but also Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, who also is said to be mulling a presidential run. Landrieu burst onto the national stage with a well-received speech about institutional racism and the Confederate monuments in 2017.
Brown, the Ohio Democrat also considering a presidential campaign, said it's important that Democratic progressives make a distinction between Trump's "phony populism" and a true populist message, which does not divide on racial or religious lines.
"I never talked about the 'white working class' - I talk about workers," Brown said. "If we talk about the minimum wage increase, or if we fight against tax cuts for the rich or if we passed better trade policy - that will help Black workers every bit as much as it will help white workers. And in many cases, it will probably help them more."
"My message is never to segment white workers and Black workers except when talking about discrimination against Black workers," he said.
The road forward will not be easy. In 2016, even as Cl inton enjoyed widespread support from Black political leaders and won an overwhelming share of Black votes in the primary and general elections, she was plagued by accusations that her political persona was inauthentic.
Images of Clinton performing hip-hop dances like the Whip and the Nae Nae on national television or talking about her love of hot sauce remain punch lines for many Black voters, some of whom took such instances as evidence Clinton was "pandering" for minority votes. (Clinton does, in fact, love hot sauce.)
In 2020, progressives need to do a better job of tailoring their message to older Black voters, said Yvette Simpson, incoming head of Democracy for America, the progressive political group that backed Sanders in 2016. These are the voters - particularly in the South and the urban Midwest - who dictate the party's agenda and candidate, she said.
"Black and Brown voters are done with you showing up at my church right before the elections," Simpson said. The candidates who will be successful with Black voters, she said, are the "ones who have strong local presences, who are setting up offices and hiring local people in those offices. It will be the ones constantly asking, 'What can we do?' and showing a commitment to come back and do that work over and over again."
Simpson said she has not heard from any prospective candidates and fears too many are taking advice from the wrong voices.
"You can't just have the one or two Black or Brown validators as your only connection to the community." - (The New York Times)
