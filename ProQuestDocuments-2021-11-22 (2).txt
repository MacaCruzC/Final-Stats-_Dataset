Texto completo: Andrew Yang began his closing statement at the last Democratic debate with a charming bit of self-deprecation: “I know what you’re thinking, America. How am I still on this stage with them?”
Yang has never been elected to any office. He is a businessman who has never run a major company. Even so, he is one of the Democratic Party’s seven leading candidates for an election that everybody agrees is desperately important. The other six on the debate stage included another businessman who has never held office and a mayor who has never won an election with more than 10,991 votes.
As funny as Yang’s line may have been, he was highlighting a real problem: Our process for selecting presidential nominees is badly flawed.
It is, as Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja recently wrote in The Atlantic, “a spectacle that would have struck earlier generations as ludicrous.” It has come to resemble a reality television show, in which a pseudo-scientific process (polls plus donor numbers) winnows the field. The winner is then chosen by a distorted series of primaries and caucuses: The same few states always get outsize influence, and a crude, unranked voting system can produce a nominee whom most people don’t want.
No wonder the current president is a reality-television star, not to mention the most unfit occupant of the office in our country’s history. “The victory of Donald Trump in 2016 is best understood as a failure of the process,” political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has written, “and a failure of the Republican Party to prevent an outsider from taking its presidential nomination — the most important thing that U.S. political parties have.”
The current system may seem as if it’s simply an expression of democracy, but it’s not. It’s one version of democracy. And it’s one that virtually no other country uses. In other democracies, political parties have more sway in selecting the nominee, and voters then choose among the major nominees. Until recently, the United States also gave party leaders a larger role in selecting nominees.
Today’s leaders have abdicated this job, afraid to do anything that might appear elitist because it substitutes the judgment of experts for that of ordinary citizens. The irony is that the new process may actually do a poorer job of picking nominees whom ordinary citizens like, as research by Dennis Spies and André Kaiser, looking across countries, suggests.
How could this be? When voters are given the dominant role in choosing a nominee — as with primaries here — only an unrepresentative subset tends to participate, which skews the process. Party leaders, on the other hand, have a big incentive to choose a broadly liked candidate. Just think about American history: Nominees chosen by party leaders have included Abraham Lincoln, both Roosevelts and Dwight Eisenhower.
I’m not suggesting we return to the smoke-filled rooms of the past. But the current process puts a higher priority on the appearance of democracy than the reality of it. We’re left with candidates fighting to do well enough in early polls to get into the debates and then to win 30% of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire, which can launch them toward the nomination.
A better approach would balance snapshots of popular opinion with rules more likely to produce strong, qualified nominees.
The first change should be to the debates. The candidates’ electoral history and qualifications currently count for nothing. The 2020 Democratic field, for example, has included four two-term governors, all of whom have been excluded from debates despite a track record of winning votes and governing successfully. In their place have been candidates, like Yang, who managed to crack 4% in a few polls.
It makes more sense for only the true polling leaders to be guaranteed debate slots. Beyond them, the party could set aside at least one spot for a governor and perhaps one for a senator from a large state or swing state.
A second set of changes would involve the primaries themselves. More states should adopt ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to list their second and third choices. Memphis, Minneapolis, New York City, San Francisco and the state of Maine, among other places, have adopted this system for some elections.
Ranked choice can prevent the Trump phenomenon during the 2016 Republican primaries. Trump may have solid Republican support today, but he didn’t back then. Even though most Republican voters opposed him, his dedicated base let him emerge from a large field.
It’s also past time to end the special treatment that Iowa and New Hampshire receive, by always voting first. They are two overwhelmingly white, disproportionately baby boomer states (and the fact that Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008 doesn’t give it a permanent pass). The primary calendar should instead rotate every four years, with the first states always including a mix of states: big and small, young and old, urban and rural, coastal and heartland.
The seven candidates who made the last Democratic debate stage all have their strengths, but as a group, they offer an indictment of the nomination process. There are three candidates in their 70s — and no African American or Latino. There are two people who have never won an election — and zero who have ever run a state.
Of course, the biggest sign that the process is broken isn’t any of those seven. It is the man in the Oval Office.

Texto completo: Trials of all kinds - civil, criminal, impeachment - are supposed to try to get at the truth of the matter at hand. Despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s effort to convert the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump into a mere test of party loyalty, new revelations since the House voted to impeach Trump call for a real trial, including witness testimony and documentary evidence.
The House voted Dec. 18 to impeach on two counts, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Facts supporting both counts are clear. Trump withheld congressionally approved military aide for Ukraine and an official state visit for new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while insisting that Zelensky announce an investigation of a Trump political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Then, Trump clearly hindered Congress as it attempted to carry out its constitutional duty to investigate the president’s conduct.
In the ensuing weeks, The Washington Post and The New York Times, using emails among key administration officials, have reconstructed Trump’s decision to withhold the aid against the advice of the Pentagon, the State Department and national security advisers, and the scramble in the White House to concoct a rationale for that decision after it was revealed by a whistleblower.
More so than ever, it would be sham for McConnell to attempt to conduct a trial without testimony from former National Security Adviser John Bolton and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should continue to refrain from sending the passed articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial until Mc-Connell agrees to a real trial. And, given the results of the newspapers’ inquiries, Pelosi should continue the House investigations so that the public will know what happened, regardless of whether McConnell continues to promote a charade.

Susan Collins Becomes Second GOP Senator to Question McConnell Over Impeachment Trial; With only a four-vote Senate majority, a small bloc of Republican senators could upend majority leader's efforts

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Maine Sen. Susan Collins has become the second Republican to question the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's approach to the impeachment trial of President Trump, underscoring how a few GOP defections could upset Mr. McConnell's control of the highly charged proceedings.
In an interview with Maine Public Radio, Ms. Collins said she was "open to witnesses" while the Republican leader from Kentucky wants a quick trial without witnesses.
Ms. Collins also criticized Mr. McConnell for saying that he was coordinating with the White House as it defends Mr. Trump against House-approved charges that he should be removed from office for abusing his power and obstructing Congress.
"I've heard the Senate majority leader saying that he's taking his cues from the White House," Ms. Collins said in the Monday interview. "There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging this in an impartial way."
The comments came days after Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) said she was disturbed by Mr. McConnell's promise of total coordination with the White House.
Republicans control the Senate with a narrow majority, holding 53 of 100 seats. That means that just four Republican senators breaking ranks could upend Mr. McConnell's strategy for the trial , assuming Democrats remain united behind Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). Mr. Schumer has called for hearing from four witnesses and for subpoenaing documents.
This is because Senate impeachment trials don't unfold according to any particular set of procedures. Instead, a simple majority of 51 votes would be needed to determine almost every step of the process, from witness testimony to the timing of a final vote.
The Democratic-controlled House last month voted to impeach Mr. Trump on charges that he abused power by pressuring Ukraine to initiate investigations that would help him politically, including one into former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2020. The House also charged the president with obstructing Congress by blocking witnesses from testifying and subpoenaed documents. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
One sign that Democrats in the Senate may stick with Mr. Schumer is that Sen. Doug Jones (D., Ala.), who is up for re-election next year in a deep-red state, wrote an op-ed published Monday in the Washington Post that backed Mr. Schumer's call to hear from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and a top aide, Robert Blair, along with former national security adviser John Bolton and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.
Mr. Schumer on Monday repeated his calls for the four witnesses to testify, citing a New York Times story that detailed some of their actions as Mr. Trump moved to withhold nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine without telling Congress.
"This new reporting shows that there were serious concerns raised by Trump administration officials about the propriety and legality of what the president was doing," Mr. Schumer said on Monday at a news conference in New York.
Messrs. Schumer and McConnell have remained deadlocked over the format of the trial. Mr. McConnell wants to open the trial first, and hold votes for witnesses after opening arguments—the same procedure as followed during the 1999 impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. McConnell's office and the White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in hearing from witnesses, suggesting the trial would be used to unmask the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the inquiry and undermine others who view his dealings with Ukraine as highly improper.
Mr. Schumer wants to lock in an agreement to bring in witnesses and subpoena documents, including communications between administration officials about the withholding of military assistance for Ukraine and requests for Ukraine to publicly commit to open investigations.

Congress thwarted Obama from transferring detainees to U.S.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden is usually first to bring up the record of the Obama administration in his 2020 presidential campaign. But at the Democratic debate in Los Angeles, Biden had to defend an area where the administration failed.
Obama left office without closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.
The facility remains open under President Donald Trump, housing about 40 detainees at an annual cost of about $540 million.
Biden said that the Obama administration tried to close Guantanamo. But it was missing one thing.
“You have to have congressional authority to do it,” Biden answered Dec. 19.
One way Obama wanted to close the facility was by moving detainees to U.S. facilities, which Congress blocked through legislation. Some have argued that Obama did have other options to close Guantanamo, but they were unpopular even within his own party, and it’s not at all clear they would have been successful. We’ll recap the history.
On Jan. 22, 2009, Obama issued an executive order calling for Guantanamo’s closure within one year. That year was Obama’s best chance to close Gitmo since he held large majorities in the House and Senate.
But Obama angered lawmakers after he transferred a detainee to New York, announced a plan to bring the terrorists responsible for 9/11 to the United States, and planned to purchase a facility in Illinois for detainees.
Obama’s moves led Congress to repeatedly bar the use of funds to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States.
Obama officials discussed the possibility of using executive authority to close the detention camp, but ultimately ruled that out.
Obama was forced to “choose between two politically unsavory options: Invoke executive power to relocate the remaining detainees in defiance of a statute, or allow history to say he never fulfilled his promise to shutter the prison,” wrote New York Times reporter Charlie Savage in November 2015.
Obama’s Office of Legal Counsel never bought the argument that these the congressional restrictions were unconstitutional, said Avril Haines, a legal adviser for the National Security Council during the Obama administration. (She was part of efforts to try to close Gitmo but not within the Office of Legal Counsel.)
Legal experts were divided about whether the restrictions Congress imposed were constitutional.
While some during the Obama administration argued that the congressional ban on transfers prevented Guantanamo from closing, Gregory B. Craig, White House counsel in 2009, and Cliff Sloan, special envoy for Guantanamo closure in 2013 and 2014, wrote a Washington Post op-ed in November 2015 arguing that Obama did have authority to close the facility.
“Under Article II of the Constitution, the president has exclusive authority to determine the facilities in which military detainees are held,” they wrote. “Obama has the authority to move forward. He should use it.”
Their op-ed set off a debate among legal scholars and political experts.
Obama did decide on one approach for removing Gitmo prisoners: transferring them to other countries. But he ran out of time.
During the final days of his administration, Obama announced the four final transfers to other countries bringing the total number of international transfers from Guantanamo under Obama to about 200.
On Jan. 19, 2017, Obama wrote a letter to Congress stating that the restrictions “make no sense” given the lack of escapes at supermax and military prisons.
The next day Trump was sworn into office. He has kept his promise to keep Guantanamo open.
Our ruling
Asked why the Obama administration didn’t close Guantanamo, Biden said, “You have to have congressional authority to do it.”
Congress made it hard for Obama to fulfill his promise, blocking Obama from transferring detainees to U.S. prisons. Obama was allowed to transfer detainees to other countries, and did transfer many of them. But he ran out of time at the end of his presidency, keeping the prison open with 41 detainees.
Some legal experts said Obama had the legal right to close Guantanamo but lacked the political willpower. Others questioned if he truly had that power. Ultimately the Obama administration didn’t take that tack, so we’ll never know. Certainly what Congress did made the task much harder.
We rate this statement Mostly True.

A great love remembered at designer Toledo's memorial

Texto completo: New York's creative communities met Dec. 16 in Hell's Kitchen at the Baryshnikov Arts Center. There were writers and dancers, actors and musicians, from uptown and downtown, all drawn together by the memory of one woman: designer Isabel Toledo, who died in August of breast cancer.
She was as close to an artist as fashion had - even if she was best known for designing Michelle Obama's first inaugural parade dress and coat.
On a darkened stage illuminated by a white glow from a sewing machine and hanging ivory gown in one corner there came not only speeches (from journalist Wendy Goodman; Kim Hastreiter, the Paper magazine co-founder and curator; and writer Michaela Angela Davis, among others), but also performances.
The dancer Jillian Davis, of Complexions Contemporary Ballet, extended her limbs in elegy accompanied by a violin played by Ezinma (late of Beychella). Caridad de la Luz, the spoken word poet known as La Bruja, unscrolled a river of paper on which she had scrawled, in looping black pen, her paean. Basil Twist, the puppeteer, flew a marionette like a fluttering spirit. Joey Arias, the performance artist, belted out a love song.
Many of the speakers wore Toledo's designs.
And in the end, Whoopi Goldberg read a letter of skin and blood from Toledo's husband, artist and illustrator Ruben Toledo, to his wife.
The visceral emotion in the letter was reflective of the tenor of the event, because as much as the afternoon was an homage to Toledo and her work, the gathered throng was also there to acknowledge one of fashion's greatest love stories.
Ruben and Isabel Toledo were legend in an industry where individual ego and ambition often seem the norm and the relationships that are known tend to be fraught and soap-opera dramatic. Rarely, if ever, seen apart, the Toledos were each other's muses, with an almost symbiotic need to create.
They were beyond, said curator and retailer Katharina Sand, who met the Toledos when she was a very young journalist, "Yoko and John, Morticia and Gomez."
She realized "he was her missing link," Goodman said.
James Kaliardos, a makeup artist, talked about a dream he had in which he couldn't tell where Ruben stopped and Isabel began.
"He was the fabric, she was the needle, and they stitched it all together," said Aria.
Hastreiter, who knew the couple before they were married, said that Toledo had often painted his wife, and she had raised the possibility of doing an exhibition of his portraits. She guessed, Hastreiter recalled, that he probably had about 1,000. He corrected her.
"More like 10,000 Isabels," he said.
And as guests like Agnes Gund, the philanthropist, and Sandy Schreier, whose wardrobe has just gone on-show at the Met; Cuban American designer Narciso Rodriguez and Simon Doonan, the writer and former Barneys window dresser; Linda Fargo of Bergdorf Goodman and Ikram Goldman from Ikram in Chicago, lined up to hug Ruben Toledo, who had been hovering in the shadows, the image that lingered was the last still from the final film of the afternoon (because there was film, too). It was a moment caught as Ruben and Isabel were dancing - they loved to dance - arm in arm in the loft where they lived.
Her dark hair was flying out behind her, and they were eye to eye, laughing.

Texto completo: A volunteer member of a security team who is running for county commissioner is being hailed for saving lives by quickly ending a shooting Sunday at a North Texas church.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton described parishioner Jack Wilson as a onetime reserve sheriff's deputy with extensive training who has taught shooting at his own range.
Wilson was one of two congregants who confronted a gunman during an attack that killed two people at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town of about 17,000 people near Fort Worth. Paxton said Wilson was the one who brought down the suspect with a single shot.
"He's not just responsible for his actions, which ultimately saved the lives of maybe hundreds of people, but he's also responsible for training hundreds in that church," Paxton said at a news conference Monday.
Texas church murders and New York Hanukkah stabbings: Hate, yes, but are they acts of domestic terrorism?
The Texas Department of Public Safety identified the victims as Anton "Tony'' Wallace, 64, of Fort Worth and Richard White, 67, of River Oaks.
The gunman was identified as Keith Thomas Kinnunen, 43. His motive is under investigation.
Investigators searched Kinnunen’s home in River Oaks, a small nearby city where police said his department’s only contact with the suspect came from a couple of traffic citations. “He didn’t exist until yesterday,” Deputy Police Chief Charles Stewart said.
However, Tarrant County records show Kinnunen was arrested in 2009 on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in Fort Worth and in 2013 for theft. He also had a 2016 brush with the law in New Jersey.
Wilson said he went on high alert when he noticed the suspect walking in wearing a hat, long coat and wig, and he and White — a fellow security volunteer — were reaching for their guns when Kinnunen approached Wallace, who was serving Communion.
The attacker shot White and Wallace, sending parishioners scrambling for cover, before Wilson could get a clear line of fire.
“I didn’t have a clear window because I had members that were jumping, going chaotic,” Wilson, 71, said from his home in nearby Granbury. "They were standing up. I had to wait about half a second, a second, to get my shot. I fired one round. The subject went down. ”
Wilson, who is running for commissioner in Hood County, said in a posting on his campaign's Facebook page that he's thankful to be able to serve as the church's head of security.
He added that Sunday's events "put me in a position that I would hope no one would have to be in, but evil exists. ''
Texas officials lauded a state law that took effect in September allowing weapons in places of worship unless the facility bans them. Paxton said the church’s security team was formally organized once the measure was enacted.
Licensed handgun owners can legally carry loaded weapons into Texas churches that do not have posted signs banning weapons. Church security became a major issue in the state after a gunman walked into a church in Sutherland Springs two years ago and fatally shot 26 people and wounded 20 others.
President Donald Trump offered prayers to the "families of the victims and the congregation" on Monday night, more than 30 hours after the shooting, and praised the actions of "brave" parishioners via Twitter.
He added, "Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!"
Church officials held a closed meeting and prayer vigil just for church members Monday evening. Britt Farmer, the church's senior minister, told the crowd he had encountered Kinnunen in the past.
“I had seen him. I had visited with him. I had given him food,” Farmer said.
FBI Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said Kinnunen had roots in the area but is “relatively transient. " DeSarno also said the suspect has been arrested several times but did not specify on which charges.
Parishioner Isabel Arreola told the Star-Telegram that she sat near the gunman and that she’d never seen him before Sunday’s service. She said he appeared to be wearing a disguise, perhaps a fake beard, and that he made her uncomfortable.
Then she saw him take out a shotgun, start firing and get shot himself.
“I was so surprised because I did not know that so many in the church were armed,” she said.
Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that immediate reaction was crucial.
“This team responded quickly, and within six seconds the shooting was over,'' Patrick said. "Two of the parishioners who were volunteers of the security force drew their weapons and took out the killer immediately, saving untold number of lives. ''

There were more than 240 parishioners in the church at the time of the shooting, authorities said, and the service was being livestreamed to countless homes.
Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement of condemnation for the "evil act of violence" at a place of worship.
"I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life," Abbott said. "Cecilia and I ask all Texans to join us in praying for the White Settlement community and for all those affected by this horrible tragedy. "

Texto completo: Images and videos of child sexual abuse don't only exist in the dark corners of the internet. They are hiding in plain sight across New Mexico. From January through Nov. 1, there were 977 investigations in the state into reports of adults creating, possessing or distributing images of child sex crimes, and committing other sex crimes against children, over the internet. That number, experts say, is more than double the number from last year. And while every viewing of those images is a crime, prosecutors say it also is a sign that a person might plan to - or already has - sexually abused a child.
"These are individuals that, generally speaking, are extremely dangerous, and a lot of times, there's this misnomer that these are just images," said state Deputy Attorney General Clara Moran.
Moran and other prosecutors do not like the commonly used term "child pornography" because it likens images of abuse to the legal, somewhat regulated industry of adult pornographic content, she said. Moran makes it plain: Many of these images are of children being raped.
While some people tend to believe such images involve children in faraway places, the reality is much different. Almost 90 percent involve children in the U.S., including New Mexico, said Anthony Maez, special agent and commander of the state attorney general's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
The task force has reviewed about 1,400 cyber-tips received from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, peer-to-peer networks and individuals, Maez said. Of the five types of crimes investigated by the group, the number involving images of child sexual abuse is by far the largest.
Not every tip leads to an investigation.
In 2019, the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force has received 592 documented complaints about possession of images of child sexual abuse, 304 about distribution of such images and 63 about creation of images, according to data provided by Maez.
"The number of tips that we see coming in, the volume is very high," he said, "and unfortunately there isn't enough law enforcement officers around the state to work these types of tips."
State law enforcement agencies have ratcheted up their battle against internet crimes against children. About 276 agents across 90 local, state, military and tribal agencies investigate these crimes. Together, they have received 76 documented complaints of child enticement, 21 complaints of a person traveling to meet a child with intentions of abuse, 52 complaints of adults directing obscenities to a minor and 14 complaints of sex trafficking of children, according to data collected by the task force.
An exploding problem
Maez points to the ever-evolving world of social media and apps that make it easier to exploit children.
A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed many predators connect with children through gaming or social media platforms and chatrooms - venues that weren't as accessible five to 10 years ago. In 2008, the newspaper reported, 3,000 images of child sexual abuse had been reported. In 2018, there were more than 18 million.
Each new app, Maez said, is a new opportunity for child exploitation.
Criminal complaints, grand jury indictments and affidavits for search warrants filed in New Mexico's First Judicial District Court show how prevalent the use of social media and electronic devices is when it comes to the exploitation of children.
One such affidavit, filed Nov. 18, says blogging sites Tumblr and Reddit reported a 24-year-old man from Chimayó had uploaded images of child sexual abuse. A search of online court records shows he has not yet been charged with a crime. Another affidavit, filed in 2017, goes into graphic detail about a series of videos of girls ages 7 to 10 that authorities believe were shared by a Santa Fe man on a peer-to-peer website.
Española police Detective Ernest Saucedo wrote in a Dec. 3 affidavit that he received three tips from the attorney general's internet crimes task force accusing a 21-year-old man of uploading images of child sexual abuse online using three Yahoo email addresses. The man, Austin Martinez, has been charged with one count of possession of a visual medium of sexual exploitation of a child under 13.
There is no overarching profile of a person who views graphic images of children being sexually abused. Offenders live in both rural and urban areas, and while they tend to be male, they can be of any age.
A growing fight
Each month, the task force receives about 110 tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for all reports made to the cyber-tip line, as well as reports from social media companies, which monitor their sites for potential illegal activity.
Of those 110 reports in New Mexico, Maez said about 63 percent originated from a person who saw an image on Facebook and reported it or from the company's detection software.
Facebook's latest transparency report says the company removed 11.6 million child abuse images worldwide from its social network from July through September of this year. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 512,000 images.
"Each time it is shared is a revictimization of that child victim," said Matt Baca, a spokesman for the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. "It is important for people to recognize that the sharing and individual viewing is a reoffense."
Concerns over the spread of images of child sexual abuse on the internet has prompted smaller police departments to become more aggressive. Roger Jimenez, interim chief of the Española Police Department, said his agency recently began working with the task force.
"It definitely does hit closer to home for some of the officers that actually live in a community where they're investigating these specific crimes," he said.
Often, officers will already know victims or the accused, Jimenez said, and that added level of familiarity makes the cases more difficult to handle.
Finding perpetrators
Task force members say the long road to success in prosecuting internet crimes against children is similar to other kinds of sensitive investigations: Extensive interviews and researching a suspect's past are key before executing a search warrant.
You get one shot to find evidence in these types of cases, New Mexico State Police Agent Jessie Whittaker said, because once a suspect knows what investigators are looking for, they often will try to destroy or hide devices containing images - or any trace that they created or distributed them.
He could go into a house armed with a search warrant but minimal information and "get a little bit of evidence for the case - maybe nothing," Whittaker said, and then realize later that he missed something key to prosecuting the case.
"What's the chance it's going to be there that next time coming back?" he asked.
Whittaker said he seizes cellphones or other devices while executing search warrants and takes them to the FBI's Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory in Albuquerque. He either gives the agency the materials to review or reviews the evidence himself.
The internet crimes task force also operates a mobile forensics lab, as well as labs across the state, Maez said, to avoid a bottleneck of cases.
"You can't arrest someone until forensics is completed," he said.
Moran said prosecutors typically will seek detention of a suspect after criminal charges are filed. But they are not always successful. In the case of Martinez, state District Judge Jason Lidyard rejected Assistant District Attorney Ihsan Ahmed's motion seeking a detention until trial, ruling the state did not prove Martinez is a danger to the community.
Such decisions frustrate investigators and prosecutors.
"What you get a lot from the defense is that these are just images, they're just images - and that's just not true," Moran said.
Investigators say they believe people who view graphic photos and videos of child sexual abuse could be - and are likely to be - sexually attracted to children and might physically abuse a child.
"If someone is sexually attracted to children, it is not something that goes away," Moran said.
According to experts quoted in the New York Times investigation on the psychology of pedophiles, one study of 127 online offenders who had been arrested showed that less than 5 percent admitted to having molested a child. During in-depth interviews and polygraph tests, however, another 53 percent admitted to having touched a child.
Moran said this holds true for New Mexico.
"Sometimes prosecutors can ask for a polygraph, and what we find is that these offenders oftentimes disclose ... they have been hands-on abusers and just haven't been caught or that they are planning to put hands on a child," she said.
Prosecutors and investigators say a law passed this year by the Legislature - the Electronic Communications Privacy Act - makes it more difficult to prosecute crimes against children.
The law requires law enforcement to obtain warrants including the specific information they are seeking on electronic devices, as well as the specific person or account targeted. It also requires that any evidence collected under a search warrant that does not fall under the specifications of the warrant be destroyed within 30 days.
That timeline sometimes does not allow for adequate development of a case involving images of child sexual abuse, Moran said.
"It's essential to these types of cases for law enforcement officers to be able to comb through all of the images," she said. In some cases, there can be terabytes of information to sift through.
Whittaker said the tight timelines also can make it difficult to retain exculpatory evidence, which can help establish a person's innocence if the suspect is arrested and his or her case goes to trial.
Privacy concerns and data breaches also have pushed social media platforms and apps to use end-to-end encryption, which makes conversations between a sender and recipient private and unable to be seen by a third party. In March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to introduce the technology on Facebook Messenger.
"If Facebook decides to encrypt everything and not [see] who is doing what on the site or have that available, the tips will go down, but the exploitation is taking place out there," Maez said.
Awareness of these crimes, though distasteful, is critical, Maez said. While the majority of investigations by the internet crimes task force involve cases in which a child has been abused previously, Maez said the group also pursues local tips to stop such abuse from ever occurring.
Each year, the task force runs a public service announcement advertising the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's cyber-tip line. Maez also holds bimonthly training on investigatory techniques, such as how to mimic a person who is posting or responding to online ads for child exploitation, dark web surveillance and the use of cryptocurrency like bitcoin to purchase images of child sexual abuse.
"We are trying to cover every possible place where an individual may exploit a child," he said.

Predators pose threat to kids via gaming

Texto completo: If there's a teenager in your house, there's a good chance that a gift related to video gaming was part of your Christmas giving.
According to Pew Research Center, nearly every teenage boy - 97% - participates in gaming, as well as about 83% of girls.
The hugely popular Fortnite has roughly 250 million users. PlayStation has nearly 100 million monthly active users.
In 2020, the video games market is expected to be a $90 billion industry in the U.S.
And most teens know way more about all things gamer than their parents do. That's why, no doubt, parents of gamers take the time to review tutorials about parental controls and talk with teens about the dangers of gaming, right?
Maybe, maybe not. Even if parents do talk to kids, that conversation usually is related to limiting screen time and avoiding games with graphic violence. The discussion that parents and kids might not have is warning kids that gaming worlds have become hunting grounds for predators.
A New York Times series this month reported shocking stories of teenagers lured into conversations with predators through multiplayer video games and chat apps. Once the relationship is established, predators - often posing as children themselves - detail a story of hardship, building trust with their victims.
Over time, they are able to dupe children into sharing semi-explicit photos and videos of themselves. Then, the predators have leverage. Threats to send out the photos to friends and family members is the typical bait used to garner more explicit photos - and even photos of other children, in many cases.
The Times combed through court and police records and found reports of abuse skyrocketing, with some predators grooming hundreds and even thousands of teens and children. Multiplayer games were the most frequent target, though similar ploys are happening on social media apps like Instagram.
Like a lot of issues that teens and parents face, addressing this one is complicated, but it usually begins with a conversation. Online safety experts say parents need to know what games their children are playing, and kids need to know the tools available to them - like blocking users, shutting off chat functions and telling an adult if a user asks anything that makes the child uncomfortable.
For most teenagers, gaming will be a part of life. But families need to be aware of the real dangers lurking in the virtual world.
To report online child sexual abuse or find resources for those in need of help, contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-843-5678.
Editorials reflect the consensus of the Telegraph Herald Editorial Board.
Where we stand
Parents and kids should be aware of the increase in predators connecting with kids through gaming.

Texto completo: Economic forecasters got the 2010s wrong. What will the next decade bring?
After the turn of the millennium, the United States suffered its weakest decade of economic growth in the post-World War II era, and served as ground zero of the global financial crisis. Forecasters predicted a long American decline. Instead, over the course of the 2010s, the United States staged a comeback as an economic superpower and, even more, as a financial superpower.
The United States economy grew faster than other rich countries and navigated the decade without suffering a single recession -- a first since records began in the 1850s. Defying the declinists, the United States was one of only two major countries, alongside China, to expand its share of the global economy in the 2010s.
With central banks, consumers and investors around the world increasingly eager to hold dollars, the greenback ruled global money flows as never before. The American stock market rose 200 percent in the 2010s while the rest of the world's stock markets, including those of China and Germany, registered meager gains. Today, seven of the world's 10 largest companies by stock market value are American, up from three in late 2009.
But if history is a guide, the 2020s will be anything but another American decade. Economic trends that define one decade rarely define the next. This cycle has repeated itself throughout the postwar era.
America was the hottest story in the world economy and markets in the 1960s, but gave way to emerging nations in the 1970s and Japan in the 1980s before rising again in the 1990s. After the turn of the millennium, emerging nations made another strong run, and by 2010 forecasters were predicting that emerging markets would be the story of the next century.
Excluding China, emerging countries as a group saw their share of the global economy shrink during the 2010s. The average annual gain for emerging stock markets was close to zero, their worst decade since the 1930s.
Why does this cycle play out in such a predictable way? The answer is straightforward. After a good run national leaders grow complacent and start spending irresponsibly; businesses and consumers run up debts; investors end up overpaying for stocks; and the dominant companies get lethargic and fall back into the pack.
The United States at the dawn of the 2020s is a complacent land with a rising government deficit, spreading corporate debts and swollen prices not only for the stock of megacorporations like Amazon and Alphabet but also for financial assets of all kinds.
Meanwhile, many other countries, particularly in the emerging world, were forced by pressing financial circumstances to spend the last decade reducing deficits and debt, and enacting reforms that should put their economies in a position to grow more rapidly. Quietly, global economic forces are shifting in ways that could set the stage for a comeback by smaller nations and businesses in the 2020s.
As the United States and China battle to contain each other, their titanic struggle is scaring off trade and investment that is instead shifting to smaller countries, including Vietnam, Taiwan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Ireland. To insulate themselves from the superpower trade war, nations like Brazil and Japan are signing regional and bilateral trade deals.
The big American tech companies, in contrast, face a global regulatory backlash against their monopolistic power. These giants have bought out smaller rivals and driven many out of business. But they also enable many others because their platforms allow millions of entrepreneurs to reach wide audiences, often catering to specific national or regional tastes.
It used to be that big companies competed for limited shelf space in retail stores by winning consumer trust in multiyear, multibillion-dollar TV ad campaigns. Now, internet platforms allow small companies to bypass stores, win public trust instantly through consumer reviews, and build a brand on cheap internet ads, even free YouTube videos.
Globalization is thus gradually giving way to localization, which makes this a promising time for countries with domestic markets large enough to support significant expansion in local businesses. That's especially true of countries where the population is still relatively young and fast growing, like Indonesia, the Philippines, Egypt and Mexico.
Though stock markets worldwide are still dominated by "mega caps" -- companies with a market value or "capitalization" above $ 200 billion -- they face an emerging challenge from companies below that threshold. In finance, the hottest companies are digital payment apps and the small banks that back them. In insurance, the hot subsector is mobile internet insurance services -- "insurtech."
The fastest-growing American food and beverage manufacturers are small ones. Search "ketchup," an American staple once virtually synonymous with a single brand, and you will find more than 680 results including local purveyors selling flavors such as bacon. Driven by apps that serve as gateways to food delivery services, a similar rise of the solo chef is underway worldwide.
Many internet platforms also provide cloud computing, which allows entrepreneurs to build back-office operations like customer relations and bill collection much more quickly and cheaply. Barriers to entry are falling, particularly since many of the hottest internet companies own few physical assets. Uber, the world's largest taxi company, owns no taxis -- but that means future rivals won't have to buy them either.
At the same time, the rise of populist nationalism is injecting patriotic fervor into "buy local" movements. In an October survey, Chinese consumers cited "national loyalty" as the main reason they would "rethink U.S. brands." An ad from an Indian food company urged customers to "perform your patriotic duties" and "boycott products made in China, U.S.A., U.K. and Europe."
These forces conspire to unseat the global giants, which are mainly American. The United States market accounts for well over half of the global value of stock markets, and has never been more expensive relative to other national markets. But remember, churn is the norm. Among the world's 10 largest companies today, only one (Microsoft) was on the top 10 list in December 2009.
If the usual pattern holds, it's likely that America will peak and smaller nations and companies will make a comeback. If the 2010s were a golden age for the world's largest economy and its megacorporations, the 2020s are likely to be remembered as the decade when smaller was beautiful again.

Texto completo: President Trump's national security advisers intervened in an attempt to get the president to release a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine but were not successful in their endeavor.
A Sunday report from the New York Times outlined the nearly 90 days after Trump initially put a hold on the aid to the country, during which his national security team tried to convince him that releasing the aid was in the best interest of the United States.
Former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly met with the president at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office in August — less than a month after the July 25 phone call in which he asked the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
“This is in America’s interest,” Bolton said of releasing the aid at the time.
Esper added that most of the money was being spent on military equipment made in the U.S., saying, “This defense relationship, we have gotten some really good benefits from it."
“Ukraine is a corrupt country,” Trump brushed off their concerns. “We are pissing away our money.”
By late summer, top lawyers at the Office of Management and Budget were developing a proposed legal justification for the hold. However, House Democrats soon caught wind of a whistleblower report alleging that Trump was withholding the aid in exchange for the requested investigation into Biden. After three House committees announced investigations into the matter, the freeze on the aid was suddenly lifted.
The president has maintained that no quid pro quo with Ukraine occurred as the aid was released, and the Biden investigations didn't happen. However, he was impeached by the House earlier this month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress relating to the scandal. Although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to hand over the articles of impeachment to the Senate, Trump's trial is expected to begin next month.

Mike Tinius , un feligrés que estaba en la iglesia, declaró a The New York Times que la víctima mortal es un guardia de seguridad del templo que respondió al autor de los disparos.
“Estaba tratando de hacer lo que tenía que hacer para protegernos al resto de nosotros”, declaró el hombre, quien prefirió no identificar a la víctima.
Las autoridades desconocen hasta el momento las motivaciones del autor del ataqu e, que tampoco ha sido identificado.
Macara Trusty, portavoz del MedStar Mobile Healthcare , señaló que una persona sufrió un paro respiratorio mientras era traslada a un hospital, pero lograron revivirla antes de ser llevada a cirugía.
En un comunicado, el gobernador Greg Abbott calificó el hecho como un “diabólico acto de violencia”.
“Los lugares de culto están destinados a ser sagrados, y estoy agradecido por los miembros de la iglesia que actuaron rápidamente para abatir al tirador y ayudar a prevenir una mayor pérdida de vidas”, agregó.
El tiroteo ocurre casi doce horas después de que un hombre fuera detenido en Nueva York tras apuñalar a cinco personas en la residencia de un rabino al norte de la ciudad el sábado, en lo que las autoridades han descrito hoy como “terrorismo doméstico”.

Nonprofit boards and your personal liability

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyoneFollowing the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

Victimized Billionaires

Texto completo: In 2010, banks foreclosed on a more than a million homes. The jobless rate for the year hovered just under 10%. But billionaire investor Stephen Schwarzman knew who the real injured party was: the wealthy.
When the Obama administration proposed closing the carried interest loophole, a tax break exploited by those in private equity, Schwarzman couldn’t contain himself any longer. “It’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939,” he claimed at a New York City gathering.
This wasn’t the tea party, hiding its elite funders under the cover of representing the common man or woman. This was one of the wealthiest men in the United States stepping forward to loudly, proudly and angrily claim he’d been done wrong.
Schwarzman quickly apologized. But if we want to understand how the Great Recession led not to an economic overhaul but to record-breaking inequality and the election of Donald Trump - a-to-the-manor-born serial con artist and practitioner of the 1% whine nonpareil - it’s helpful to remember Schwarzman, who turned out to be patient zero for what might just be the decade’s ultimate grift: the rise of millionaires and billionaires as victims.
The Great Recession was supposed to embarrass the wealthy into slinking away embarrassed, grateful they didn’t land in jail or worse. “There’s an angry mob with pitchforks assembling, and they want to see some heads on pikes,” Fortune opined in 2009. But as the stock and real estate markets recovered, so did the self-regard of the most moneyed among us. Shame? That was so Dow 7,550. It’s now over 28,000.
Schwarzman has many a compatriot. Elite gatherings such as the Milken Institute’s Global Conference and the annual World Economic Forum in Davos have become all but encounter sessions for misunderstood multimillionaires and billionaires to agree with one another in the face of calls that they pay their fair share. There’s private equity mogul Leon Cooperman, who actually began to cry on CNBC when complaining about Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposed wealth tax on fortunes in excess of $50 million. “I don’t need Elizabeth Warren telling me that I’m a deadbeat and that billionaires are deadbeats,” he said.
The rich victims are all around us. Craig Hall, the real-estate tycoon owner of the now infamous ostentatious Northern California wine cave where Pete Buttigieg held a high-dollar fundraiser? He told The New York Times about the criticisms, “It’s just not fair.” Jacqueline Sackler, wife of a Purdue Pharma heir, the company in part responsible for the opioid epidemic that’s taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans? The Wall Street Journal got a hold of an email in which she complained of what she calls the “situation” is “destroying” the family’s reputation, and “dooms” her children.
And no one is more practiced at the art of billionaire self-pity than our president. He’s the victim of a Democratic “witch hunt.” Impeachment? “More due process was accorded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.” Yet he signed into law a tax plan so favorable to billionaires in general, and real-estate interests in particular, it might as well have been tailored precisely for him.
But according to Republicans, the obscene gains of the wealthy aren’t the problem. In 2012, GOP presidential nominee and multimillionaire Mitt Romney, speaking to a group of big-money donors, referred to 47% of Americans who didn’t pay federal taxes and needed government benefits to get by as “takers,” adding, they believe “they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name it.” (Entitled to food! Imagine that.)
The Trump administration, which boasts the wealthiest presidential Cabinet ever assembled, has spent almost three years attempting to make it harder for people to receive Medicaid, food assistance and even a free lunch at school. They are aided by self-appointed watchdogs, too, such as Minnesota retiree Rob Undersander, who outed himself as a millionaire so he could publicize the supposedly pressing issue of people who have six- and seven-figure net worth receiving food stamps because their income is below eligibility thresholds. (In fact, survey research shows such households account for about 3% of households receiving assistance via the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).
Meanwhile, of course, the wealthy make out. Studies show, not surprisingly, that their opinions carry much more weight with politicians than those of more ordinary voters. But the claim of victimization is one way they seek to protect themselves from some popular anger and the financial consequences they might otherwise face, ensuring their power, wealth and privilege remains intact while they can continue to promote their self-perceived unique virtue and smarts. Here’s one telling example: Despite Trump’s campaign promises, the carried interest loophole remains a part of the federal tax code. Steve Schwarzman, your infamy was not in vain.

Texto completo: The editor-in-chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli, wrote an editorial calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
In my view, this editorial only serves to confirm one of the sadder realizations of my life: that religious conviction guarantees neither moral clarity nor common sense.
The gist of the editorial - and of most religious and conservative opposition to Mr. Trump - is that any good the president has done is dwarfed by his character defects.
This is an amoral view that says more about Mr. Galli than it does about the president. He and the people who share his opinion are making the following statement: No matter how much good this president does, it is less important than his character flaws.
Why is this wrong?
First, because it devalues policies that benefit millions of people.
And second, because it is a simplistic view of character.
I do not know how to assess a person's character - including my own - outside of how one's actions affect others. Because I agree with almost all of Mr. Trump's actions as president and believe they have positively affected millions of people, I have to conclude that as president, Mr. Trump thus far has been a man of particularly good character.
Of course, if you think his policies have harmed millions of people, you will assess his character negatively. But that is not what never-Trump conservatives or Christians such as the Christianity Today editor-in-chief argue. They argue that his policies have indeed helped America (and even the world), but this fact is far less significant than his character.
In the words of Mr. Galli: "(I)t's time to call a spade a spade, to say that no matter how many hands we win in this political poker game, we are playing with a stacked deck of gross immorality and ethical incompetence."
This rhetorical sleight of hand reflects poorly on Mr. Galli's intellectual and moral honesty.
Mr. Galli and every other Christian and conservative opponent of the president believe their concerns are moral, and that the president's Christian and other conservative supporters are political.
This is simply wrong.
I and every other supporter of the president I know support him for moral reasons, not to win a "political poker game." Mr. Galli's view is purely self-serving; he's saying, "We Christian and other conservative opponents of the president think in moral terms, while Christian and other conservative supporters of the president think in political terms."
So, permit me to inform Mr. Galli and all the other people who consider themselves conservative and/or Christian that our support for the president is entirely moral.
* To us, putting pressure on the Iranian regime - one of the most evil and dangerous regimes on Earth - by getting out of the Iran nuclear deal made by former President Barack Obama is a moral issue. Even New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, who loathes Mr. Trump, has written how important the president's rejection of the Obama-Iran agreement has been.
* To us, enabling millions of black Americans to find work - resulting in the lowest black unemployment rate ever recorded - is a moral issue.
* To us, more Americans than ever being employed and almost 4 million Americans freed from reliance on food stamps is a moral issue.
* To us, appointing more conservative judges than any president in history - over the same period of time - is a moral issue. That whether the courts, including the Supreme Court, are dominated by the left or by conservatives is dismissed by Mr. Galli as "political poker" makes one question not only Galli's moral thinking but also his moral theology.
* To us, moving the American embassy to Israel's capital city, Jerusalem - something promised by almost every presidential candidate - is a moral issue, not to mention profoundly courageous. And courage is a moral virtue.
* To us, increasing the U.S. military budget - after the severe cuts of the previous eight years - is a moral issue. As conservatives see it, the American military is the world's greatest guarantor of world peace.
Yet, none of these things matter to Mr. Galli and other misguided Christians and conservatives. What matters more to them is Mr. Trump's occasional crude language and intemperate tweets, what he said about women in a private conversation and his having committed adultery.
Regarding adultery, that sin is for spouses and God to judge. There is no connection between marital sexual fidelity and moral leadership. I wish there were. And as regards the "Access Hollywood" tape, every religious person, indeed every thinking person, should understand that there is no connection between what people say privately and their ability to be a moral leader. That's why I wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal 20 years ago defending Hillary Clinton when she was charged with having privately expressed anti-Semitic sentiments.
That the editor of Christianity Today thinks the president's personal flaws, whatever they might be, are more important than all the good he has done for conservatives, for Christians, for Jews, for blacks and for America tells us a lot ... about Mr. Galli and the decline of Christian moral thought.

Texto completo: Investigators hope to link DNA detected on the clothes worn by Ms. Majors, a Barnard student, to the three teenage suspects.
Investigators are focusing on DNA evidence in their efforts to build a case in the killing of Tessa Majors, the Barnard College student who was stabbed during a park mugging in Manhattan early this month, officials said on Friday.
The push for conclusive evidence comes a day after detectives detained and then released a 14-year-old believed to have wielded the knife that killed Ms. Majors.
An official with knowledge of the investigation said the police were banking on pending DNA results they hoped would allow prosecutors to charge all three of the minors suspected of attacking Ms. Majors on Dec. 11 in Morningside Park, near the Columbia University campus.
Investigators have tested Ms. Majors's mouth and the clothes she was wearing the night she was killed, as well as pieces of clothing they managed to recover from the suspects, who are ages 13 and 14, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The New York Police Department's chief of detectives, Rodney Harrison, said on Friday that a Manhattan judge had issued an order to obtain forensic evidence from the 14-year-old who was detained on Thursday. He would not say whether that evidence would include a DNA sample.
Chief Harrison said he expected to get results from the forensic evidence testing in three to seven days. Investigators are monitoring the teenagers, he added.
The police charged a 13-year-old with second-degree felony murder the day after the killing and tried to interview one of the two 14-year-olds. But the 14-year-old -- who is not the teenager who the police believe stabbed Ms. Majors -- requested a lawyer and declined to give a statement, officials said.
The 13-year-old, whom The New York Times is not naming because he is not being charged as an adult, will be prosecuted in family court on the felony murder charge, meaning he is accused of taking part in the attack and not of stabbing Ms. Majors.
On Thursday, the police announced a break in the case, saying they had found the second 14-year-old at a family member's home in the Bronx. But a few hours later, he was released. He had been questioned in the presence of a lawyer, the police said.
The authorities believed that the teenager's family was shielding him until a mark on his hand fully healed. An official described the mark as consistent with a bite.
Ms. Majors, who had moved to New York from Virginia to attend Barnard months earlier, was walking in Morningside Park the night of Dec. 11 when at least three teenagers tried to rob her, the police said. She stumbled out of the park and, investigators said, collapsed on a sidewalk near West 116th Street and Morningside Drive. Sometime later, a campus security guard found her bleeding to death.
The next day, the police arrested the 13-year-old. In an interview with detectives, the teenager implicated himself and two 14-year-old middle school classmates in the attack, the police said.
The 13-year-old told the police that his classmates grabbed Ms. Majors from behind, according to two detectives who have testified during court hearings. During a struggle, the 13-year-old said, the 14-year-old wielding a knife stabbed her so forcibly that feathers from her winter coat flew into the air.
Ms. Majors's killing struck a chord in a city experiencing record-low violent crime rates and evoked an era when many people avoided going into parks after sunset.
The shadow of the April 1989 attack on a jogger in Central Park has also loomed over the murder investigation. Thirty years ago, the police and prosecutors relied on tough interrogation techniques to obtain confessions from five teenagers accused of the attack. The confessions were later proven to be false.
From the beginning, police officials have said they have taken extra steps to safeguard the teenagers' legal rights in Ms. Majors's case. All three teenagers, police officials said, have answered questions in the presence of a guardian or lawyer.

Texto completo: When the holidays end, it's tempting to just dump all of your decorations into a box. Don't. Take as much care putting them away as you did putting them up. Everything will last longer, and you'll have an easier time setting it all up again next year. Think of the extra work to do it right as a gift to Future You. Thom Dunn
MAKE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS LAST. You can buy reels or spools to wrap lights, but Jason Woodward from Christmas Designers advises against it. Woodward suggests simply wrapping the lights on their own, without using any kind of mold or guide, and then tying them off in the middle with a twist tie or rubber band. He also recommends that you don't keep them in uninsulated spaces (attics, basements), because extreme temperatures and humidity can reduce the lights' life span.
USE A STORAGE BAG FOR AN ARTIFICIAL TREE. Disassemble the tree carefully, folding the branch tips back toward the trunk to make it compact for storage, and making sure the small branches don't get bent in the wrong direction. Invest in a dedicated storage bag, such as the Elf Stor Premium Christmas Bag, which will help keep your tree safe from dust, moisture or other elements that could wear down its pristine plastic pines. Some companies sell rolling duffel bags, which may be easier to move.
LEAVE YOURSELF CLUES FOR NEXT YEAR'S SETUP. Before putting everything away, keep track of how you installed things and what worked (or didn't). "Before taking down your lights and decorations, take pictures and make notes as to how everything should be reinstalled and how you have the power cords running," says Woodward. "Be sure and attach a label clearly detailing where it was removed from."

Blackface at the ballet highlights a racial divide

Texto completo: Blackface at the ballet highlights a racial divide
Earlier this month, Misty Copeland posted a photo to her 1.8 million followers on Instagram. "This is the reality of the ballet world," wrote Copeland, the first African-American female principal at American Ballet Theater.
The image was from a rehearsal at the Bolshoi in Moscow, one of the world's leading ballet companies. It showed two women, smiling wide, in full dress for "La Bayadere," a 19th-century ballet set in India.
The dancers were in blackface.
Copeland's post, and her later comments on Twitter ("Until we can call people out and make people uncomfortable, change can't happen," she wrote), have led to weeks of debate among ballet fans, highlighting a growing geographic divide on questions of race and representation.
In the United States the use of dark makeup evokes the painful legacy of racism and minstrel shows, in which performers darkened their skin with burnt cork to play characters that perpetuated racist stereotypes about African Americans. But while the practice is increasingly rare in North America - notwithstanding several recent instances in which politicians in the United States and Canada apologized for wearing blackface or dark makeup long after it was widely seen as offensive - it persists in parts of Europe and Russia.
"I've smeared my face and body with a stain a thousand times," Anna Okuneva, a dancer at the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko company in Moscow, wrote on Instagram. "This is my creative work, and this is not racism."
Some African-American dancers disagree. Calvin Royal III, a soloist at the American Ballet Theater, said in a telephone interview that his immediate reaction on seeing the image was to cringe and ask, "How is it we're heading into 2020 and this is a reality in some places?"
Dana Nichols, a dancer with the Philadanco company in Philadelphia, said that, as a child, she had been made to wear dark makeup by another leading Russian ballet company, the Mariinsky, despite being Black. "It's easy to be trapped into doing things like this in the name of an art form you love," she said of the Bolshoi photo. "But you also have to be a citizen of the world and know this is stereotyping and degrading."
In June, Anna Netrebko, a Russian opera singer, caused a stir by posting a picture on Instagram with her skin darkened for a performance of Verdi's "Aida," in which she was singing the title role, an Ethiopian princess. "Beautiful singing! But is the blackface really necessary?" one commenter wrote.
Maxim Matusevich, a professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, who studies cultural exchange between Russia and Africa, said in a telephone interview that blackface was not widespread in Russia, but neither was it taboo. "There Is no symbolic baggage with it," he said, and that allows Russians to consider the makeup as simply part of a theatrical tradition. There are also few people of color there to complain of its use, he added.
In Soviet times, racism was seen as an American problem, said Nikolay Zakharov, the author of a book on racism In Russia, in a telephone interview: "They said that it's America who has the racism, segregation and lynching. We don't have this, so we're anti-racist."
Over the past five years, there has been a conservative turn in Russia's arts world that means people defend politically incorrect actions like blackface more firmly, Zakharov added. And there remains a dislike of being told what to do by the West, he said. "People say It's just scapegoating of Russia, and it's absurd."
These points echoed some comments on Copeland's Instagram post, and in Russian news media. "Russian ballet should not be guided by what an artist wrote on the other side of the world," Nikolai Tsiskaridze, who danced at the Bolshoi for more than 20 years, said in an interview with Izvestia, a Russian newspaper. "This is our culture," he added.
Vladimir Urin, the Bolshoi's general director, said in a statement that the Bolshoi "will not comment on the absurd allegation" of racism. A spokeswoman for the company declined an interview request.
Benjamin Millepied, the a-tistic director of the Los Angeles Dance Project, said in a telephone interview that, when he was the director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet, he heard similar arguments that blackface In ballet was a tradition and shouldn't be considered offensive.
In 2015, he faced strong opposition when he announced he would change a scene in the company's production of "La Bayadere," that included children In blackface, so they did not wear makeup. He also wanted to change the playbill so the children were listed as "enfants" rather than "négrillons," or "little negroes."
"You don't understand, this is tradition," Millepied recalled being told by the head of the ballet's union. Millepied, who danced for years at New York City Ballet, had the "bewildering" experience of having to call a meeting of the entire company to explain why the blackface was wrong, he said.
"I told them to think of a black family walking into the opera, and seeing themselves shown onstage in this grotesque fashion," Millepied said.
His arguments won out and the changes were made, but Millepied resigned from the Paris Opera Ballet in 2016, citing the struggle over "La Bayadere" as one reason for leaving. The Opera, where staff are currently on strike, did not respond to an interview request.
Awareness of racist stereotypes in ballet productions has been growing among companies in the United States, too. In 2017, the New York City Ballet altered the choreography, costumes and makeup in "The Nutcracker" to remove racial stereotypes about Chinese people. The male dancer in one segment traditionally wore a Fu Manchu-style mustache.
Despite these efforts, the ballet world has been Insular, Millepied said, and "not open to looking at some of these issues staring them in the eye."
He referred to an article in The Guardian in November, in which Jean-Christophe Maillot, the director of Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo, discussed the idea that an ensemble of dancers, or corps de ballet, should look identical onstage. "If you ask me if a traditional 'Swan Lake' at the Mariinsky can have a Black girl in the corps de ballet, I can tell you, honestly, that I don't have the answer," Maillot said. "But I feel like telling you no."
Such comments were upsetting, Millepied said, and showed a lack of empathy and understanding about what dance should be, which is a celebration of human diversity and movement.
In the debate about the Bolshoi's production of "La Bayadere," not all dancers of color have criticized the Russian company. Rasta Thomas, a former member of the Dance Theater of Harlem who described himself as multiracial, said in a telephone interview that we should judge historical and contemporary productions by different criteria.
"It is up to the new artists to make the changes they so desire, not to complain about past traditions, and art being preserved in their original forms," he said.
The complaints about the Bolshoi were "a bit ridiculous," he wrote later in a text message. "No one would be talking about the art form had the Russians not given us these great ballets," he said, adding that anyone "who is not European, performing classic ballets, is guilty of cultural appropriation."
Not all Russians have taken the Bolshoi's side. Alexei Ratmansky, a former director of the company, now an artist in residence at American Ballet Theater, wrote on Facebook that it was time to drop blackface.
"What is the artistic value in black makeup, under which you can't even recognize an artist?" he wrote. "Why provoke?"

'Stonewall': From the Civil War Battlefield to Impeachment Skirmishes; After the First Battle of Bull Run, the term leaped to Australian cricket pitches before entering modern American political lingo

Texto completo: PHOTO: Robert Neubecker
One article of impeachment drafted by House Democrats against President Trump outlines a charge officially known as "obstruction of Congress," but politicians and pundits alike often favor giving it a snappier one-word label: "stonewalling."
The impeachment resolution passed by the House alleges that Mr. Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine's president to announce investigations that would benefit him politically and that he obstructed Congress by preventing officials from testifying and blocking the release of related records.
As House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler put it during the impeachment debate on Dec. 18, "President Trump stonewalled Congress's investigation to cover up his misconduct." Mr. Nadler's counterpart on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, echoed the phrasing, saying that Republicans had "made their choice, despite this president and the White House stonewalling every subpoena, every request for witnesses and testimony from this coequal branch of government." (The Trump administration has said it is essentially boycotting an episode of partisan overreach.)
The "stone wall" metaphor might seem straightforward to describe obstructive or uncooperative procedural tactics. But the historical route of "stonewalling" into U.S. politics has been circuitous.
The immovable metaphor is most famously associated with Thomas Jonathan Jackson, a Confederate general in the Civil War who stubbornly held his ground at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. As the story goes, an officer yelled out, "There stands Jackson like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians!" The "Stonewall" nickname stuck as his military exploits grew legendary.
Yet Stonewall Jackson was never described as "stonewalling." Australian cricketers turned the word into a verb of obstruction. As used in cricket slang Down Under, "stonewalling" in the late 19th century described a batter playing defensively by continually blocking balls rather than trying to score.
That obstinacy was transferred to Australia's political arena, with "stonewalling" used to refer to obstructive parliamentary tactics. In 1875, when liberal leader Graham Berry lost his power as premier in the state of Victoria, his backers became known as " stonewallers " thanks to their dogged opposition to the conservative government.
"Stonewalling" remained rarely used in the U.S. through much of the 20th century. A New York Times columnist wrote in 1958 that Dwight Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, was "stonewalling for time in order to close the missile gap" with the Soviet Union. But it was Richard Nixon's administration that turned "stonewalling" into a regular item in the political lexicon. William Safire, who worked as a speechwriter for Nixon, recalled first hearing the term in late 1969 from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who complained that "the North Vietnamese are stonewalling us."
The Watergate tapes offer a glimpse of how the usage spread within the White House. On one tape from February 1973, White House counsel John Dean told the president, "We are stonewalling totally." Nixon picked up on the term a month later, telling his associates, "I want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up, or anything else." That led Congress to draft a charge of obstruction of justice as one of Nixon's articles of impeachment.
Many political scholars see Mr. Trump's resistance as going further. Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman observed in a Bloomberg opinion column that "no other president has ever stonewalled Congress entirely when it comes to impeachment," since even Nixon "allowed some executive branch witnesses to testify and provided some documents to Congress." Time, and a Senate trial, will tell whether cracks may emerge in Trump's stone wall.

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around midday. By 3 p.m., the House had named its impeachment managers and physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk anymore about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer’s hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell’s and Trump’s urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without concessions from McConnell, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely, because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial.
I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party’s reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe’s idea took off in some circles of the Democratic left. His column was published on Monday morning, and by Wednesday night Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories — at least they seem to be crazy theories — have emerged.
Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump’s head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats aren’t saying. But one plausible notion came from The Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard. There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It’s not clear precisely how that would work, because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations.
Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big — basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair — might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly.
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible.

Texto completo: You won't hear young Democrats deride Bernie Sanders with the "OK, boomer" dig. At 78, he's actually too old for the cohort, but that's not why he won't get dinged. He's the most popular Democrat among the under-35 crowd, and judging by recent polling, he's the second-most popular Democrat overall. Sanders has raised nearly twice as much money as the frontrunner, Joe Biden, and seems to have scooped up support from a declining Elizabeth Warren in the past 60 days. Despite a heart attack that sidelined him for a week, he marches on, now buoyed by a poll showing that in a head-to-head matchup against Donald Trump, he would do better than Biden -- though within the margin of error.
Sanders' appeal, the experts explain, is founded on "authenticity." Is he humorless, repetitive, cloying and rigid? Sure. But these are signs that he really believes something! He's not a packaged, blow-dried (no argument there), insincere pol cooked up in a political laboratory. He's the real deal.
Let's concede that Sanders is sincere, and that he is, with some small hypocrisies -- did you know he was a millionaire? -- honest. But what people actually believe is kind of important, and Sanders professes and sells a series of prejudices that do him no credit.
Sanders claims to be a democratic socialist in the European mold, an admirer of Sweden and Denmark. Yet his career is pockmarked with praise for regimes considerably to the left of those Scandinavian models. He has praised Cuba for "making enormous progress in improving the lives of poor and working people." In his memoir, he bragged about attending a 1985 parade celebrating the Sandinistas' seizure of power six years before. "Believe it or not," he wrote, "I was the highest ranking American official there." At the time, the Sandinista regime had already allied with Cuba and begun a large military buildup, courtesy of the Soviet Union. The Sandinistas, Sanders had every reason to know, had censored independent news outlets, nationalized half of the nation's industry, forcibly displaced the Miskito Indians and formed "neighborhood watch" committees on the Cuban model. Sandinista forces, like those in East Germany and other communist countries, regularly opened fire on those attempting to flee the country. None of that appears to have dampened Sanders' enthusiasm. The then-mayor of Burlington, Vermont, gushed that under his leadership, "Vermont could set an example to the rest of the nation similar to the type of example Nicaragua is setting for the rest of Latin America."
Sanders was impatient with those who found fault with the Nicaraguan regime:
"Is (the Sandinistas') crime that they have built new health clinics, schools, and distributed land to the peasants? Is their crime that they have given equal rights to women? Or that they are moving forward to wipe out illiteracy? No, their crime in Mr. Reagan's eyes and the eyes of corporations and billionaires that determine American foreign policy is that they have refused to be a puppet and banana republic to American corporate interests."
Sanders now calls for a revolution in this country, and we're all expected to nod knowingly. Of course, he means a peaceful, democratic revolution. It would be outrageous to suggest anything else. Well, it would not be possible for Sanders to usher in a revolution in the U.S., but his sympathy for the real thing is notable. As Michael Moynihan reported, in the case of the Sandinistas, he was willing to justify press censorship and even bread lines. The regime's crackdown on the largest independent newspaper, La Prensa, "makes sense to me" Sanders explained, because the country was besieged by counterrevolutionary forces funded by the United States. As for bread lines, which soon appeared in Nicaragua, as they would decades later in Venezuela, Sanders scoffed: "It's funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is, that people are lining up for food. That is a good thing! In other countries people don't line up for food. The rich get the food, and the poor starve to death."
Sanders stopped learning about economics and politics about the age of 17. He still believes that corporate "greed" is responsible for human poverty, and that the world is a zero-sum pie. The more billionaires there are, the less there is for everyone else. "I don't think billionaires should exist," he told The New York Times. So in the Bernie ideal world, we non-billionaires would be deprived of Amazon, personal computers, smartphones, fracking (which reduces greenhouse gases), Uber, Walmart, "Star Wars" movies and very possibly our jobs. Millions of children would be deprived of school scholarships, while the arts, medical research and poverty programs would be that much poorer. Billionaires are not heroes, but by making them boogeymen, Sanders betrays his economic infantilism along with a large dose of demagoguery.

Texto completo: If you are GOP supporters sending donations to the Republican National Committee or you are taxpayers, beware. Why? Your money is being used to enrich Trump and his family. So how is this happening?
Recently Trump Jr. authored a book and the RNC spent $100,000 of donated money to buy thousands of copies, making the book a New York Times bestseller. When asked about this, they lied until confronted with evidence. One wonders what other products are being purchased to funnel donations into the Trump family coffers.
The RNC has spent millions to host official party functions at Trump hotels, resorts and golf courses instead of investing donations to finance the GOP agenda, unless making the wealthy wealthier is their real agenda.
Most individual donations come from people of modest means wanting improved economic conditions and traditional conservative values. Tariffs, tax cuts for the rich, exploding debt, disrespect for truth, the law and the Constitution are hardly what the GOP advocated for decades.
Security for Trumps family who conduct business worldwide, government and military personnel staying at Trump properties, tax reform discriminating against people in blue states because of limits on property tax deductions, farm subsidy dollars unequally dispersed, payments to rich donors who own for-profit detention centers and prisons, upgrades at Camp David making it a posh retreat for Republicans and Barrs legal representation and investigations for Trumps personal benefit waste billions of our tax dollars.
Isnt it time to become independent voters and pledge loyalty to America and stop being Trump chumps?

World News: U.S. Weighs Cut to West Africa Forces

Texto completo: The Pentagon is considering a reduction in the number of U.S. troops in Western Africa as part of a long-term strategy of shifting the focus of forces, ships and air squadrons toward potential threats from Russia and China, defense officials said Tuesday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper is considering the shift as an early step in a proposed realignment of U.S. troop posture around the world, as spelled out in Trump administration policy documents on national security and defense, the officials said. There are approximately 7,000 American troops now deployed across Africa.
During the fall, Mr. Esper requested that officials with U.S. Africa Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations on the continent, provide an assessment of their resource needs, one defense official said, a first step in the potential shift.
Mr. Esper has since approached all other Pentagon regional commanders with similar requests, encompassing Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Western Hemisphere, the official said.
The defense chief asked for the assessments to better align troop and resource deployments with the Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition, especially from Russia and China, over counterterrorism operations in places like Africa and the Middle East, the official said.
However, the U.S. has repeatedly confronted pressing needs in the Middle East, and has had difficulty following through on the strategy of refocusing security resources, officials have said.
The U.S. military first withdrew forces as part of its realignment last year when it removed roughly 700 troops, largely from West Africa.
U.S. troops in Western Africa conduct a range of counterterrorism operations against militant groups, including Boko Haram. But some policy makers question whether such groups pose a threat to the U.S. itself, which has been the criteria used for justifying such deployments in the past.
The U.S. began increasing its forces as part of a global contingent led by France following extremist gains in 2012.
The defense officials said there is no timeline for specific decisions or determinations of troop levels. Any final decision is likely to further shrink the U.S. footprint, although the Pentagon instead could decide to consolidate forces in Western Africa, the officials said.
Major changes to the number of U.S. forces in other parts of Africa are unlikely, they said. The New York Times reported on a possible shift in troops in Western Africa.
Significantly reducing U.S. troops on the continent likely would draw the ire of allies, particularly France, which still has thousands of troops deployed. Critics of the U.S. force posture have noted that both Russian and Chinese influence has expanded throughout Africa as both of those nations have funded weapons purchases, built installations or invested in local infrastructure.
The relatively small U.S. presence, together with European and local forces, has yet to contain threats from al Qaeda and a burgeoning Islamic State.
This month in Niger, which has been in a state of emergency since 2017 because of the threats from extremist groups, militants attacked a military base and killed 71 Nigerien soldiers. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Saturday, during a visit to the Ivory Coast, French President Emmanuel Macron said France's troops had killed 33 militants during a raid in Mali and said the coming weeks would represent a "turning point" in the war against terrorism in the area.
In addition to West Africa, the administration is considering a troop reduction in Afghanistan, as part of peace talks between the U.S. and the insurgent Taliban movement. There are about 13,000 U.S. troops currently assigned to Afghanistan.
The Pentagon also has approximately 5,200 troops in Iraq, some of which could be withdrawn following the defeat of Islamic State units there.
After Mr. Esper completes his assessments, the responsibility for carrying out any changes in the U.S. posture would fall to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,the officials said.

Texto completo: Washington's knives are out for Attorney General William Barr, and the stabbing has intensified since he delivered a November address at the Federalist Society. Predecessor Eric Holder -- who while serving in the Obama administration described himself as "the president's wingman" -- accused Mr. Barr of championing "essentially unbridled executive power." In the same Washington Post op-ed, Mr. Holder added that Mr. Barr's "nakedly partisan" remarks rendered him a pawn of President Trump and "unfit to lead the Justice Department" -- an utterly unhinged claim.
In the New York Times, William Webster, who directed both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, chastised Mr. Barr for criticizing FBI bias. Meanwhile, the Never Trump group Checks and Balances accused Mr. Barr of advancing an "autocratic vision of executive power" that is "unchecked" by Congress and the courts.
Some of the attacks are mere symptoms of Trump derangement syndrome, but others reflect by a deep-seated resistance to the Constitution's separation of powers and the threat that its enforcement poses to the unaccountable administrative state. In either case, they're wrong. Far from calling for executive supremacy, Mr. Barr has vigorously advocated the Framers' vision of the Constitution's separation-of-powers architecture, featuring the three governmental branches -- Congress, the president and the judiciary -- each exercising its distinctive authorities while checking the others. In his Federalist Society address, Mr. Barr, quoting Justice Antonin Scalia, explained that the Constitution gives the president and Congress "many 'clubs with which to beat' each other."
Mr. Barr's extolling of the "unitary executive" is hardly revolutionary -- nor, as critics imagine, is it a call for dictatorship. It posits only that the president, being responsible for execution of the law, must be able to control his subordinates. This was the rule across the government until Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. (1935), in which the Supreme Court carved out an exception for members of certain "independent" regulatory agencies, whom the president can fire only for "good cause."
The Framers had good reason to favor a strong presidency. The early republic's weak civilian executive leadership almost lost the Revolutionary War, shifting nearly the entire burden to Gen. George Washington. Postwar government under the Articles of Confederation was a ruinous shambles, unable to assert any sort of national leadership. To be sure, the Framers also feared legislative overreaching. They resolved all these problems by creating a coequal executive who could act, in Mr. Barr's words, with "energy, consistency and decisiveness."
Humphrey's Executor was only the beginning of the attack on the constitutional design. Congress whittled away at executive power, depriving the president of the authority and duty to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." The courts not only approved those usurpations, but themselves meddled in disputes between the political branches and seized broad swaths of executive discretion.
Numerous lawmakers, most of the media and much of the political class now claim -- at least during a Republican administration -- that even core executive-branch activities, such as diplomacy and law enforcement, must be substantially free from presidential control. Hence the steady drumbeat of criticism directed at Mr. Trump for overseeing and making policy for the Justice Department, the FBI and the intelligence community as a whole.
The result isn't a strong Congress but the supplantation of the Constitution's checks and balances with a worst-of-all-worlds muddle. Leaders of independent agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exercise executive power free from accountability to the president or voters and subject only to the partisan whims of Congress. The bureaucratic "resistance," spurred on by its allies in Congress, openly defies presidential decisions, undermining the principle of democratic control even in core areas of presidential responsibility like foreign policy. For their part, the courts increasingly police ordinary separation-of-powers disputes between Congress and the executive, destroying the possibility of compromise through political means.
These deviations from the Framers' blueprint explain much of the government's current dysfunction. Congress avoids politically dangerous decisions by palming tough choices off on agencies and the courts. The legal and political limbo of the so-called Dreamers is a ready example. Ceaseless congressional investigations nearly incapacitate the White House and are designed to achieve precisely that result. Executive agencies find their every action -- even those involving inherently discretionary matters -- subject to judicial scrutiny and nationwide injunctions imposed by judges whose jurisdiction is supposed to be limited to a state or district. Whereas the separation of powers fostered practical compromise, today's judicial supremacy reduces everything to winner-take-all litigation.
Mr. Barr warned in his address that we must "take special care not to allow the passions of the moment to cause us to permanently disfigure the genius of our Constitutional structure." Too often, previous attorneys general regarded the elements of separation of powers opportunistically, as cudgels to be employed in particular disputes. Mr. Barr's vision and goals are broader. He's concerned not only with the conflicts of the day but the structure necessary for the federal government to work. It's a bold vision, but it's the opposite of a partisan one.
If Mr. Barr achieves even a fraction of his agenda to restore the Framers' vision of a strong, independent executive, he will go down as Mr. Trump's most consequential executive appointment.

Texto completo: Often described as an equal partner to the singers he performed with, he preferred to be called simply a pianist.
Dalton Baldwin, an American pianist and recording artist who was acclaimed for nearly six decades as a recital accompanist to major singers, including Elly Ameling, Jessye Norman and especially the French baritone Gérard Souzay, died on Dec. 12 in Kunming, in the Yunnan Province of China. He was 87.
His death, a week before his 88th birthday, was announced by Ben Turman, the vice consul of the United States Consulate in Chengdu. Mr. Baldwin had recently completed three weeks of performances and coaching sessions with students in Japan and was returning from a short trip to Myanmar to visit Buddhist temples when he collapsed on a flight to Tokyo. The plane made an emergency landing in Kunming, where he was taken to a hospital and died.
He had performed on five continents and made more than 100 recordings over his career.
Although Mr. Baldwin was an eminence among accompanists, he was not fond of that word. Like many of his colleagues, he preferred to be called simply a pianist.
Critics affirmed that he was no mere accompanist. While consistently praising the refinement, sensitivity and technical command of his playing, they routinely described him as an equal partner to the singers he performed with.
In a review of a 1978 recital by Ms. Ameling at Alice Tully Hall, John Rockwell of The New York Times wrote that Mr. Baldwin "was worthy of a review all his own." This was "piano playing of a lyrical and dramatic sympathy and a rhythmic energy that superbly partnered the singer," Mr. Rockwell concluded.
Writing about a 1968 recording of songs by Francois Poulenc, featuring Mr. Souzay and Mr. Baldwin, the Times critic Allen Hughes observed that "the two performers work together so superbly that their interpretations are almost inseparable into individual elements."
Mr. Baldwin was 22 when he met and first worked with Mr. Souzay, who was 13 years older and already an admired interpreter of song. Their professional relationship grew into a personal one, though they remained discreet about it; they built a home together in Antibes, on the Riviera, where Mr. Souzay died in 2004 at 85.
The important singers with whom Mr. Baldwin partnered on concert tours inevitably attracted more attention than he did, as he wryly noted in a 1983 interview with The Times. Speaking of a recital at the Salzburg Festival with Ms. Ameling, Mr. Baldwin said that his name was as large as hers on the poster, which gave him "a good feeling" -- though, he added, "of course, I didn't get anything like her fee."
"Accompanists are underrated in every respect -- financially, acclaim," he said. Once, he said, a critic even referred to him in a review as someone else: Gerald Moore, the distinguished British accompanist.
In another Times article, from 1996, Mr. Baldwin was quoted as explaining that being an accompanist required not just musical talent but also a flair for ad hoc psychiatry, because "singers are such vulnerable people." Mr. Baldwin clearly handled this element of the relationship sensitively; some of the major singers of his era were tenaciously loyal to him.
Dalton Baldwin was born on Dec. 19, 1931, in Summit, N.J., to Dalton Graf Baldwin, who worked in the insurance business, and Helen (Cahill) Baldwin. He is survived by a sister, Martha Baldwin Nelson. Another sister, Anne Baldwin Kurtosi, died before him.
Mr. Baldwin was drawn to music early. As a high school student, he attended a recital in Morristown, N.J., by the great English contralto Kathleen Ferrier that proved pivotal.
"You know immediately when a singer has a personal message," he said in the 1996 interview. Ferrier "had lovely rosy cheeks and an enchanting way, and there again was a message, introducing me to the world of song."
After studying at the Juilliard School, he attended the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio, where he received a bachelor of music degree. In Paris he studied with the renowned pedagogue Nadia Boulanger, began his association with Mr. Souzay and was coached by several composers, including Poulenc and Frank Martin.
Mr. Baldwin is best known for his performances and recordings of French art songs. His extensive discography includes the complete songs of Poulenc, Debussy, Faure and Ravel. He also won high praise for his performances of Schubert and Schumann. And he introduced a number of new works, including, with Mr. Souzay, the 1969 premiere in Washington of Ned Rorem's "War Scenes," a cycle of five songs with texts from Walt Whitman's "Specimen Days," dedicated by the composer to "those who died in Vietnam, both sides."
The illustrious singers he worked with also included Marilyn Horne, Nicolai Gedda, Jennie Tourel, Frederica von Stade and José van Dam. He began his long association with Ms. Ameling in 1970 and, a few years later, began working with Jessye Norman (who died in September).
Mr. Baldwin was a teacher and coach to young pianists and singers and regularly gave master classes at the Salzburg Mozarteum, the national conservatories of Paris and Madrid, a summer academy in Nice and elsewhere. In recent years he taught at Westminster Choir College of Rider University in Princeton, N.J., and had a home near the campus.
Though he also performed with leading instrumentalists like the violinist Henryk Szeryng and the cellist Pierre Fournier, Mr. Baldwin said he liked working with singers best.
"I worship the human voice," he said in 1996. "There's nothing like singing; it's a romance when you share the music and the poem. The voice is God's instrument. I want them to enjoy music making. That's what it should be about: la joie."

Paul Krugman: Trump isn’t like Scrooge. He’s much worse.

Texto completo: By Trump-era standards, Ebenezer Scrooge was a nice guy.
It’s common, especially around this time of year, to describe conservative politicians who cut off aid to the poor as Scrooges; I’ve done it myself. But if you think about it, this is deeply unfair to Scrooge.
For while Dickens portrays Scrooge as a miser, he’s notably lacking in malice. True, he’s heartless until he’s visited by various ghosts. But his heartlessness consists merely of unwillingness to help those in need. He’s never shown taking pleasure in others’ suffering, or spending money to make the lives of the poor worse.
These are things you can’t say about the modern American right. In fact, many conservative politicians only pretend to be Scrooges, when they’re actually much worse — not mere misers, but actively cruel. This was true long before Donald Trump moved into the White House. What’s new about the Trump era is that the cruelty is more open, not just on Trump’s part, but throughout his party.
Now, the conventional wisdom about today’s Republicans is indeed that they are Scrooge-like. That is, the story is that they want to serve the interests of the rich (which is true), and that the reason they want to slash aid to the poor is to free up money for plutocrat-friendly tax cuts.
But is that really why the right is so determined to cut programs like food stamps and unemployment benefits?
After all, the explosion of the budget deficit under Trump shows that Republican claims to care about fiscal responsibility were always humbug, that they’re perfectly willing to slash taxes on the rich without offsetting spending cuts. Furthermore, because America spends relatively little money helping the poor, even harsh cuts — like the Trump administration’s new rules on food stamps, which will hurt hundreds of thousands — will at best save only tiny amounts compared with the cost of tax cuts.
And in important cases, the right is so eager to hurt low-income Americans that it’s willing to do so even if there are no budget savings at all.
Consider the case of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which a 2012 Supreme Court decision made optional: States could choose not to participate.
Why would any state make that choice? After all, the federal government will pay 90% of the cost, and experience shows that expanding Medicaid produces indirect cost savings — for example, by letting states reduce aid to hospitals for uncompensated costs.
Furthermore, the federal funds brought in by Medicaid expansion boost a state’s economy, which raises tax revenues. So expansion is, from a state fiscal point of view, neutral or even net positive. Why would any state turn it down?
Yet 14 Republican-controlled states, many among the nation’s poorest, are still refusing to expand Medicaid.
At the same time, a number of states are trying to limit access to Medicaid by imposing stringent work requirements. This may sound like a cost-saving measure, but it isn’t — trying to enforce work requirements, it turns out, costs a lot of money.
The point is that these state governments are only pretending to be penny pinchers. In reality, they’re actively trying to make peoples’ lives worse, and they’re willing to lose money to accomplish that goal. But why?
In 2018, The Atlantic published a memorable essay by Adam Serwer titled “The Cruelty Is the Point,” about the political importance of shared pleasure from other people’s suffering. Serwer was inspired to write that essay by photos of lynchings, which show groups of white men obviously enjoying the show. Indeed, in America, gratuitous cruelty has often been directed at people of color.
But as Serwer also noted, it’s not just about race. There are more people than we like to imagine who rejoice in the suffering of anyone they see as unlike themselves, especially anyone they perceive as weak.
In fact, I suspect that this mentality is part of the explanation for the seeming paradox of strong Republican support in places like eastern Kentucky where large numbers of poor whites depend on programs like food stamps: Those who aren’t receiving aid actually want to see their poorer neighbors hurt.
What Trump has brought to his party is a new willingness to be openly vicious.
I’m not saying that he’s honest about his motivations. He and his aides still go through the motions of pretending that actions like denying aid to storm-ravaged Puerto Ricans or cutting off food stamps for hundreds of thousands are about fighting corruption or enforcing fiscal responsibility.
But their attempts to justify cruelty as being somehow in the national interest are low energy, especially compared with the enthusiastic nastiness Trump exhibits at political rallies. Trump has celebrated and reportedly wants to campaign with servicemen he pardoned after our own military convicted them of or charged them with war crimes, clearly because he likes the idea of indiscriminate killing — and so do some of his supporters.
So I’m going to stop calling today’s Republicans Scrooges. We’d be in much better shape if Trump and company were merely heartless misers. What they really are is much, much worse.

Methane Regulations Need Tightening

Texto completo: The ongoing growth of the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and nationally has helped to reduce carbon emissions by more than 10% since 2007, even though carbon output spiked by about 3.4% in 2018, according to the Rhodium Group, a private sector research firm that used data from the Energy Information Administration and several other sources.
Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas but it is less potent than methane - the natural gas that is being used to supplant coal for power production.
It takes far less methane than carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere to worsen atmospheric warming. But as the gas industry grows it is clear that state and federal regulators do not have a good handle on just how much methane leaks during gas extraction, processing and transportation.
The New York Times reported Monday that a new satellite, the first designed to detect from space methane emissions on the ground, had recorded a record methane release from a well blowout in eastern Ohio that was more than twice as large as the driller’s estimate. Dutch and American scientists analyzed data from the February 2018 blowout and said it had released more than 120 metric tons of methane an hour for the 20 days that it took to plug the well.
That blowout was atypical. But if the driller and regulators did not know how much methane such a major event produced, that raises the question of how much methane escapes undetected during routine operations.
To help answer it, the Wolf administration has proposed a rule to tighten the state’s methane regulation. It would end an exemption for methane monitoring and repairs on low-producing wells, and would require regular inspections of production facilities regardless of the results of previous inspections.
It makes little sense to press natural gas as a partial answer to carbon pollution if regulators cannot restrict methane, which is more damaging to the atmosphere. Several major producers have agreed to the proposed rule. The administration should implement it quickly.

GOP rebels targeting supporters of Trump

Texto completo: Several veterans of past Republican campaigns, including the former head of New Hampshire's GOP, have created a committee aimed at defeating President Trump in 2020 and congressional Republicans who have supported him.
Dubbed the Lincoln Project, the group has Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine as one of its biggest potential targets. Collins already faces a Democratic challenger and growing scrutiny from all corners as the Senate prepares for an expected Trump impeachment trial.
“It is my great hope, as this impeachment process unfolds, that she will have the courage to do what is right, to stand up and put the country over party, to be a voice for the people over Donald Trump," said Jennifer Horn, a former head of New Hampshire's Republican Party and a cofounder of the Lincoln Project.
“If that doesn't happen," Horn said, “then, yes, unfortunately, Senator Collins becomes part of this," a Lincoln Project target.
The project is one of several small, but vocal, rebellions against Trump, who has taken over the national Republican Party apparatus and rarely experiences pushback from its members in Congress.
Collins, who has walked a tightrope through roiling partisan politics, has said little about how she intends to vote in the Senate's expected impeachment trial of Trump. Long known as an independent thinker, Collins infuriated members of her party when she helped kill the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But she faced criticism from Democrats when she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Collins, in a statement, offered few clues about how she might vote in an impeachment trial. “I intend to make my decision on whether or not to convict President Trump on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial," she said. “Threats from both the left and the right will have zero influence on that decision."
Trump has remained steadily popular among Republicans across the country, despite his overall low approval ratings and his impeachment last week by the House, all of which makes the Lincoln Project's effort an uphill battle.
When the House voted to impeach Trump for trying to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — a potential Trump challenger in 2020 — not a single Republican joined the Democratic majority. In some states, the GOP has maneuvered to keep Trump's primary challengers off the 2020 ballot altogether.
Nonetheless, the Lincoln Project, unveiled in a New York Times op-ed the day before the House impeached Trump, describes the president as a “bogus prophet," whose actions threaten the Constitution and American way of life.
“We do not undertake this task lightly, nor from ideological preference," said the op-ed authors and Lincoln Project cofounders, who include George T. Conway III, an attorney known as an outspoken Trump critic and husband of presidential adviser Kelleyanne Conway.
“Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort," they wrote.
They envision persuading enough disaffected conservatives, Republicans, and Republican-leaning independents in swing states and districts to vote against Trump and his supporters “even if that means Democratic control of the Senate and an expanded Democratic majority in the House."
Joshua Tardy, a Maine attorney who served as honorary chairman for Collins's last Senate campaign, dismissed the project's goals and chances of success. “There will be a lot of noise makers on both sides and this super PAC will just be another noise maker in a noisy election," Tardy said. (Such political action committees can raise funds from individuals, corporations, unions, and other groups without any limit on donation size or expenditure.)
Collins recently announced she will run for reelection. And while she hasn't said whether she will endorse Trump, the president this week indicated his support for her — via Twitter. When Senator Lindsey Graham encouraged voters to support Collins's reelection, Trump responded: “I agree 100%."
Horn, from the Lincoln Project, said her group raised over $500,000 in the two days after it was announced.
The group's day-to-day activities will be overseen by Horn, who twice ran for Congress from New Hampshire, and by Reed Galen, a longtime Republican strategist. Other members include two former strategists for the late Senator John McCain, Steve Schmidt and John Weaver.
Maine is considered a battleground state in 2020. That's partly because its electorate is divided and unpredictable: The state has a Republican senator, an independent senator, and two Democratic members of the House. The current Democratic governor followed a provocative Republican. Maine is also a key electoral state because it is one of just two (the other is Nebraska) that does not use the traditional winner-take-all method of allocating Electoral College votes. Trump won one of the state's four votes in 2016, the first time a Republican took any of Maine's votes in decades.
Tardy is not worried.
“At the end of the day, Donald Trump and Susan Collins enjoy enormous support by their Republican base," he said.
The Lincoln Project is also focusing on candidates in other states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, and Arizona.
Former Massachusetts governor William F. Weld, who is challenging Trump for the presidential nomination, said he is focused on beating Trump, but not on targeting other Republicans.
He said, however, that he agreed with the project's mission of defeating Trump.
“I am delighted to see a little hardball on the side of the nice guys," Weld said.
He draws parallels to 1973, when, he said, he was an ambitious young lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee and was advised by others in the Republican Party to steer clear of the impeachment process because of Richard Nixon's popularity, despite the Watergate break-in.
Nixon ultimately resigned in 1974 before the House voted on impeachment, as evidence against him mounted and support from loyal congressional defenders dissolved. Weld believes those who stand by Trump in a Senate trial will suffer politically.
“If the Republicans in the Senate walk the plank silently for Mr. Trump, all of those who are up next year in the 2020 election will lose their seats," he said.
Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman who ended his long-shot campaign for the Republican nomination against Trump last month, had not heard of the Lincoln Project. But Sanford, a fiscal conservative, said he wished the founders well. “I think we need to have a conversation as Republicans as to what it means to be a Republican," Sanford said. “We have lost our way . . . based on a temporary political amnesia that will fade."

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

Ross Douthat: The world that Christmas made

Texto completo: In early November, a study published in the journal Science claimed to trace the whole social course of modernity — the decline of clan and tribe, the turn to nuclear families, the rise of individualism — back to Roman Catholicism’s opposition to incest.
The medieval church’s sweeping ban on cousin-marriage, the researchers argued, broke up traditional kinship networks and gave rise to new family patterns and eventually a new psychology — a less conformist, more individualist, very clearly modern mindset that according to their research is much more common in regions that had sustained exposure to Catholicism before 1500.
“Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence,” runs a famous line from John Maynard Keynes, “are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” This goes for practical modern people and deceased theologians as well: You may think you don’t want to marry your cousin for sound reasons of genetic hygiene, but in fact you’re just following injunctions laid down by French ecclesiastics in the sixth century after Christ.
The Science study naturally provoked a certain discomfort among people disinclined to credit Western Christendom for anything save stained glass and inquisitions. The more interesting question, though, is what actual believing Christians should make of it, and of the larger genre to which it belongs: Historical accounts that emphasize our religion’s essential role in the making of the modern world, even as that same modernity has obviously been a time of dissolution for many people’s faith.
This is a good Christmas season question, for the time of year when the threads still binding us to the old-time religion shine red and green and silver, and it’s sharpened by an example of the genre that would make a good last-minute Christmas gift: The British historian Tom Holland’s new book “Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World ,” a galloping tour of Christianity’s influence across the last 2,000 years, with vivid vignettes scattered across the centuries, and a concluding argument that the Christian faith, “the most influential framework for making sense of human existence that has ever existed,” still shapes the way that even the most secular modern people think about the world.
Assume for the sake of argument that Holland’s account is largely true. Does that get actual Christian belief anywhere in contemporary debates? Is anyone persuaded to take up a faith, or consider it anew, because ideas they value are historically and intellectually dependent on its premises?
I think there are historical moments when this can happen: The little renaissance in Christian thought in the aftermath of World War II, for instance, clearly owed something to a desire to get back to the West’s religious roots, after Auschwitz and Hiroshima made a certain kind of secular optimism seem foolish.
But it took a uniquely horrifying moment to produce that impulse — like a person turning to a priest in the aftermath of a literal demonic visitation. In our own era Christians still fear the possibility of a post-Christian totalitarianism, but nonbelievers fear elements of conservative Christianity rather more, and often share the hope expressed in my New Haven, Connecticut, neighbor Samuel Moyn’s review of Holland — that a secular, social-justice left can preserve the best of the Christian ethical inheritance while leaving the metaphysics and a considerable part of the morality behind.
In the long run I am not sure this hope is warranted: Human movements have a drive toward coherence in their world-pictures, and one reason secular utopianism unmoored from Christianity has become radical and murderous so often is that a coherent atheist materialism will tend to exclude as mere sentiment the ideas about inherent human dignity and the “thou shalt nots” that the Christian revolution introduced.
But societies can also live with ideological inconsistency for quite some time before that drive manifests itself — and in the between-time, I don’t expect many secular readers to leap into religious faith because a newspaper columnist complains about their system’s incoherence.
Which is no doubt why the scriptures that inspire this holiday season contain more simple miracles than they do clever arguments about consistent world-pictures. Indeed if I am honest, the key difference between a regretful doubter like Holland, convinced of Christianity’s moral power but unable in his book’s conclusion to quite make the leap of faith, and a fumbling believer like myself, may be as simple as this: I grew up around mystical and supernatural-seeming happenings, which primed me to permanently doubt the reasonableness of materialism in all its forms, both confident and sorrowful.
So as much I enjoy arguing about modernity’s debt to Christianity, what most often sustains faith in a secular age are the surprising answers given to different people every day, with God only knows what patterns and purposes, to W.H. Auden’s Advent prayer:
Nothing can save us that is possible: We who must die demand a miracle.
There’s no harm in asking for yourself, this week. Merry Christmas.

John Ortved: Dreading your kids’ annoying Christmas gifts? You need a Grinch.

Texto completo: I’m a good uncle. I help my older niece with her reading. I go to my nephew’s football games (it’s flag football; calm down). I play dress-up and house with my younger niece.
And, around Christmas time, I sneak into their home and steal some of their favorite toys.
Some background: I am not a competent singer. Nor is anyone in my family. We can’t sing Broadway or Beatles tunes or even “Baa Baa Black Sheep.” And yet both my sister and I can perfectly vocalize a torturous song from Sesame Street’s Pop-Up Pals baby toy. A toddler pushes a button, and Elmo sings:
“This is the song; la la la la; Elmo’s song!”
We can do it in tune.
“This is the song; la la la la; Elmo’s song!”
On key. Every note.
Last December, a careless, tasteless or downright mean relative gifted the musical toy to my younger niece. She loved it. She played it morning, noon and night. Endlessly. Until one winter weekend when I crept into their house and disappeared it.
Not only do I steal from children; I steal from the children I love most. And I highly recommend it.
I do it when there’s no one home, and my sister and I never discuss it. She never asks me to do it. She wouldn’t. But I know when there’s something she especially hates. And then, it’s gone. That’s the only way it works: If her child, her innocent, sweet little girl, asks her, “Mommy, where is the Elmo toy?” My sister can look her in the eye and reply, truthfully: “I don’t know. We can’t find it. Do you want to do drawing?”
Kids have terrible taste. They love the worst stuff: food, games, outfits — the more garish, the better. Like every parent, my sister has to choose every day which of her kids’ magnificently awful desires will be satisfied, but the challenge presented by Christmas and contemporary consumerism is just too overwhelming for any one person. So she has me.
It all began a few years ago, with a book, “Angelina Ballerina,” which had been given to her elder daughter. It’s a pink-hued tale that follows a wee mouse named Angelina in her desire to become a prima ballerina. My sister is not especially concerned with gender politics, but she does care about literature, and this book was, in her words, “sucky” beyond belief.
Of course, her daughter loved it, and insisted that it be read to her at every opportunity. My sister works hard. She treasures the opportunity to read to the kids before bed. Moreover, she’s a devoted parent and a gentle, caring person. So, when she told me, “John, I want to kick Angelina Ballerina in her head” (and I’m leaving out some words here), I had to help. Soon, Angelina jeté-d herself over to Housing Works. Elmo and his pals were next. And others have followed.
I told a friend who is a parent about my illicit activities, and his answer was telling: “Can you come over and do my house?” He went further: “I know people who would pay for this.” At the same time, when he told his family what I do, they were horrified. “My mom thinks you’re a monster,” he said.
So be it. When I’ve told others about my Grinchiness, the most common question that follows is, “Don’t the kids miss their toys?” And they answer is “Yes.” For about five minutes. And then neither my sister nor anyone else hears about them again. The kids look for it, they can’t find it, they move on.
I take no pleasure in it. Well, I take some pleasure, in that it makes my sister’s and her husband’s lives easier and improves the quality of the kids’ playtime. For every disappeared musical Sesame Street toy, there is more drawing; for every bedtime story without Angelina there is one with Wild Things or Eloise. These are not my decisions to make, except they are. Even without my sister’s tacit approval and thanks, this is what uncles do. We help out, often in ways parents cannot.
Christmas is exhausting for parents. My sister has to deal with shopping and Santa and the big dinner and transport and family. So why wouldn’t I help out where I can? At the end of the day, if I cannot spare my sister the song-and-dance of Christmas, at least I can spare her that particular song.
Ultimately, it is less an issue of taste than one of excess, something our culture has a problem with. Kids’ toys are cheap. Christmas is an orgy of plastic, pink, lost pieces and paper. It’s not good — for the kids, for the parents, for the gift givers, for the environment.
My Grinchy model, or his creator, Dr. Seuss, summed it up nicely: “What if Christmas, he thought, doesn’t come from a store. What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more.”
Which is why I know I’m a good uncle. But I’m a better brother.

Texto completo: Sin sorpresa para muchos, Nueva York ha sido calificada de lejos como la ciudad con la gente menos amable en todo el país , según una nuevo sondeo realizado por Business Insider.
34.3% de los encuestados dijeron que los neoyorquinos eran los más rudos del país, casi el doble que el segundo clasificado, Los Ángeles (19.7%).
Los resultados se basaron en dos encuestas en línea realizadas en octubre y noviembre de 2019. A más de 2 mil adultos estadounidenses se les pidió elegir las cinco ciudades menos amables de una lista de las 50 áreas metropolitanas más grandes de la nación.
La noticia no es una sorpresa para muchos. En 2011 el historiador de la ciudad de Manhattan, Michael Miscione, dijo a The New York Times que los neoyorquinos han sido considerados groseros desde finales del siglo XVIII.
“No he visto a un verdadero caballero, un hombre bien educado, desde que vine a la ciudad”, dijo el ex presidente John Adams sobre NYC en 1774: “En sus entretenimientos no hay conversación que sea agradable; no hay modestia, no hay atención el uno al otro. Hablan muy alto, muy rápido y en conjunto . Si le hacen una pregunta, antes de que pueda pronunciar tres palabras de su respuesta, se lanzarán sobre usted nuevamente y hablarán”.
Nueva York es además la ciudad más cara del país y la que recibe más turistas.
Detrás de NYC y Los Ángeles, las siguientes ciudades más rudas fueron Washington D.C. (18.9%), Chicago (18.6%) y Boston (14.9%).
Los detalles de la encuesta pueden verse aquí.

Texto completo: Washington's knives are out for Attorney General William Barr, and the stabbing has intensified since he delivered a November address at the Federalist Society. Predecessor Eric Holder—who while serving in the Obama administration described himself as "the president's wingman"—accused Mr. Barr of championing "essentially unbridled executive power." In the same Washington Post op-ed , Mr. Holder added that Mr. Barr's "nakedly partisan" remarks rendered him a pawn of President Trump and "unfit to lead the Justice Department"—an utterly unhinged claim.
In the New York Times, William Webster, who directed both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, chastised Mr. Barr for criticizing FBI bias. Meanwhile, the Never Trump group Checks and Balances accused Mr. Barr of advancing an "autocratic vision of executive power" that is "unchecked" by Congress and the courts.
Some of the attacks are mere symptoms of Trump derangement syndrome, but others reflect by a deep-seated resistance to the Constitution's separation of powers and the threat that its enforcement poses to the unaccountable administrative state. In either case, they're wrong. Far from calling for executive supremacy, Mr. Barr has vigorously advocated the Framers' vision of the Constitution's separation-of-powers architecture, featuring the three governmental branches—Congress, the president and the judiciary—each exercising its distinctive authorities while checking the others. In his Federalist Society address , Mr. Barr, quoting Justice Antonin Scalia, explained that the Constitution gives the president and Congress "many 'clubs with which to beat' each other."
Mr. Barr's extolling of the "unitary executive" is hardly revolutionary—nor, as critics imagine, is it a call for dictatorship. It posits only that the president, being responsible for execution of the law, must be able to control his subordinates. This was the rule across the government until Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. (1935), in which the Supreme Court carved out an exception for members of certain "independent" regulatory agencies, whom the president can fire only for "good cause."
The Framers had good reason to favor a strong presidency. The early republic's weak civilian executive leadership almost lost the Revolutionary War, shifting nearly the entire burden to Gen. George Washington. Postwar government under the Articles of Confederation was a ruinous shambles, unable to assert any sort of national leadership. To be sure, the Framers also feared legislative overreaching. They resolved all these problems by creating a coequal executive who could act, in Mr. Barr's words, with "energy, consistency and decisiveness."
Humphrey's Executor was only the beginning of the attack on the constitutional design. Congress whittled away at executive power, depriving the president of the authority and duty to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." The courts not only approved those usurpations, but themselves meddled in disputes between the political branches and seized broad swaths of executive discretion.
Numerous lawmakers, most of the media and much of the political class now claim—at least during a Republican administration—that even core executive-branch activities, such as diplomacy and law enforcement, must be substantially free from presidential control. Hence the steady drumbeat of criticism directed at Mr. Trump for overseeing and making policy for the Justice Department, the FBI and the intelligence community as a whole.
The result isn't a strong Congress but the supplantation of the Constitution's checks and balances with a worst-of-all-worlds muddle. Leaders of independent agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exercise executive power free from accountability to the president or voters and subject only to the partisan whims of Congress. The bureaucratic "resistance," spurred on by its allies in Congress, openly defies presidential decisions, undermining the principle of democratic control even in core areas of presidential responsibility like foreign policy. For their part, the courts increasingly police ordinary separation-of-powers disputes between Congress and the executive, destroying the possibility of compromise through political means.
These deviations from the Framers' blueprint explain much of the government's current dysfunction. Congress avoids politically dangerous decisions by palming tough choices off on agencies and the courts. The legal and political limbo of the so-called Dreamers is a ready example. Ceaseless congressional investigations nearly incapacitate the White House and are designed to achieve precisely that result. Executive agencies find their every action—even those involving inherently discretionary matters—subject to judicial scrutiny and nationwide injunctions imposed by judges whose jurisdiction is supposed to be limited to a state or district. Whereas the separation of powers fostered practical compromise, today's judicial supremacy reduces everything to winner-take-all litigation.
Mr. Barr warned in his address that we must "take special care not to allow the passions of the moment to cause us to permanently disfigure the genius of our Constitutional structure." Too often, previous attorneys general regarded the elements of separation of powers opportunistically, as cudgels to be employed in particular disputes. Mr. Barr's vision and goals are broader. He's concerned not only with the conflicts of the day but the structure necessary for the federal government to work. It's a bold vision, but it's the opposite of a partisan one.
If Mr. Barr achieves even a fraction of his agenda to restore the Framers' vision of a strong, independent executive, he will go down as Mr. Trump's most consequential executive appointment.

Texto completo: A 6-year-old found the note in London while writing Christmas cards to her classmates. "Forced to work against our will," the message read.
A 6-year-old girl in London preparing Christmas cards for her classmates found a message said to be from prisoners forced into labor in China, prompting the Tesco grocery chain to suspend ties with a supplier.
Florence Widdicombe was going through cards her mother purchased about a week ago at a Tesco supermarket when she saw one card had writing in it, her father, Ben Widdicombe, told the BBC.
"We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu Prison China," the handwritten note read. "Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization."
The New York Times could not independently authenticate the note, which also suggested that the recipient contact Peter Humphrey, a British journalist who was a prisoner at Qingpu from 2013 to 2015. Mr. Humphrey, who was jailed on corruption charges he says were bogus while working as a fraud investigator, first wrote about the note in The Sunday Times.
Tesco said in a statement that it would stop selling the cards while it investigates. The supplier was independently audited in November and "no evidence was found to suggest they had broken our rule banning the use of prison labor," the company said.
"We abhor the use of prison labor and would never allow it in our supply chain," the company said. "We were shocked by these allegations and immediately suspended the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation."
But the supplier, Zhejiang Yunguang Printing, said that it had not heard from Tesco and that it became aware of the accusations only after being contacted by foreign news outlets, according to state-run media.
"We have never done such a thing," Zhejiang Yunguang Printing told The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid owned by the Communist Party.
China has a poor human rights record -- it has come under criticism for, among other things, its treatment of the Muslim minority in Xinjiang, surveillance of its own citizens and detentions of journalists -- but the printing company insisted that it had "never had any connection with any prison" and suggested that the story was manufactured for political reasons.
Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, mocked Mr. Humphrey and dismissed allegations that prisoners were subjected to forced labor when asked about the reports at a regularly scheduled news conference.
"His latest plot sounds all too familiar," Mr. Geng said in remarks posted on the Foreign Ministry's website. "My advice to him: If you want to grab more eyeballs, at least come up with some new tricks."
"I can tell you that after verifying with relevant departments, we know for sure that there is no forced labor of foreign prisoners in Qingpu Prison in Shanghai," Mr. Geng added.
Tesco is among the international companies that have publicly vowed to stamp out prison labor. Britain requires large companies to describe the actions they have taken each year to keep modern slavery out of their supply chains.
Former inmates have described brutal abuse in China's labor camps, including beatings, sleep deprivation and untreated illnesses. Finding a note hidden inside packaging tends to attract worldwide attention, though the claims are difficult to verify and are often suspected of being activist hoaxes.
Still, there have been times when former inmates confirmed they had surreptitiously sneaked out notes. In 2013, a former inmate at the Masanjia labor camp said he wrote 20 letters that he hid in packaging that seemed headed toward the West. One of them was found by a mother of two in Oregon inside a package of Halloween decorations.
Mr. Humphrey, the journalist and former inmate, told the BBC he believed the note was "written as a collective message" from the prisoners. He said he believed he knew who wrote the note but would not reveal the person's identity.
He said there were about 250 foreigners kept in Qingpu "living a very bleak daily life." The cells held 12 prisoners apiece, with rusty iron bunk beds and mattresses about a centimeter thick, he said.
When he was there, manual labor work was voluntary, with inmates earning pennies they could spend on soap, toothpaste and cookies, he said.
"What has happened in the last year or so is work has become compulsory," he said.
Mr. Widdicombe said he felt he had a responsibility to pass along the note to Mr. Humphrey.
"The first thought was it must be some sort of prank, but on reflection we realized it was actually potentially quite a serious thing," Mr. Widdicombe told the BBC.

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

Implement Proposed Methane Rule

Texto completo: The ongoing growth of the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and nationally has helped to reduce carbon emissions by more than 10% since 2007, even though carbon output spiked by about 3.4% in 2018, according to the Rhodium Group, a private sector research firm that used data from the Energy Information Administration and several other sources.
Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas but it is less potent than methane - the natural gas that is being used to supplant coal for power production.
It takes far less methane than carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere to worsen atmospheric warming. But as the gas industry grows it is clear that state and federal regulators do not have a good handle on just how much methane leaks during gas extraction, processing and transportation.
Last Monday, The New York Times reported that a new satellite, the first designed to detect from space methane emissions on the ground, had recorded a record methane release from a well blowout in eastern Ohio that was more than twice as large as the driller’s estimate. Dutch and American scientists analyzed data from the February 2018 blowout and said it had released more than 120 metric tons of methane an hour for the 20 days that it took to plug the well.
That blowout was atypical. But if the driller and regulators did not know how much methane such a major event produced, that raises the question of how much methane escapes undetected during routine operations.
To help answer it, the Wolf administration has proposed a rule to tighten the state’s methane regulation. It would end an exemption for methane monitoring and repairs on low-producing wells, and would require regular inspections of production facilities regardless of the results of previous inspections.
It makes little sense to press natural gas as a partial answer to carbon pollution if regulators cannot restrict methane, which is more damaging to the atmosphere. Several major producers have agreed to the proposed rule. The administration should implement it quickly.

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.
In August 1971, the White House asked the FBI to find dirt on CBS News correspondent Daniel Schorr, but the bureau mistakenly thought the president wanted to appoint Schorr to a federal job and conducted a background-check interview. When Schorr complained, the White House put him on the list for IRS harassment, and the House later put that in the second article of impeachment.
In September 1971, the White House “Plumbers” (plumbers stop leaks) broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist to try to find the confidential notes he had refused to give the FBI.
In early 1972, G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt pitched a plan to Attorney General John Mitchell for a $1 million program of counterdemonstrations, bugging and break-ins at the headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee for president, the convention hotel in Miami, and the DNC headquarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. Mitchell told the finance chair of the Nixon re-election campaign to give them $250,000.
The Watergate burglars were caught in June 1972. When the FBI began to trace the money found in the burglars’ hotel rooms, President Nixon ordered the CIA to mislead the FBI into thinking the Watergate break-in was a CIA operation. Hush money was paid to the burglars from the White House’s secret $350,000 political fund.
In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

Texto completo: Vianden, Luxembourg
A rock quarried in Virginia now sits on a plateau in Luxembourg. It's part of a new arch-like monument to the U.S. 80th Infantry Division and its role in the Battle of the Bulge.
The monument also includes stones from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The 80th Division, in its original configuration, drew men from these three states for service in France during the First World War.
The 80th Division - the "Blue Ridge" - was back at it in Europe during the Second World War and abruptly found itself in Luxembourg as part of the U.S. Third Army's efforts to break the sudden, last, great German offensive on the western front.
It was a bad, cold, horrible, wretched business.
"The Battle of the Bulge was the largest battle ever fought by the United States Army," says the National WWII Museum in New Orleans. More than "83,000 Americans were casualties during the battle which lasted from Dec. 16, 1944 until Jan. 25, 1945, and as a result, the battle occupies a prominent place in our collective minds."
Probably more prominently in some minds than others, judging from the sentiments expressed in the small village of Nocher on Tuesday, site of the new monument's dedication.
The people of Luxembourg have obviously not forgotten a thing. A hard memory - virtually every village in this region was destroyed by the fighting - has been passed forward through the generations and it often gets expressed in our direction as undiluted appreciation.
By one count, there were 15 American veterans on hand for the 75th anniversary ceremony held on Monday at Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial. Think about it. That's remarkable. These are all men well into their nineties and they resolved to be here.
Luxembourg wanted them to be here, too.
"The veterans know how very, very grateful we are," said Benoit Lutgen, mayor of Bastogne. "This gratitude is now anchored in a common history, woven by friendship, by meetings with families and by cultural and economic exchanges."
"Far from fading away," the mayor said, "the link has developed over the generations to become a fruitful partnership."
That's no exaggeration. It takes some shared effort and some especially dedicated souls to make something like the Nocher monument happen.
Bill Black of Papillion, Nebraska, got on this project in 2012. He wanted the monument installed on behalf of the 80th Division Veterans Association he leads.
He also wanted it for his dad, William Black, a 34-year-old staff sergeant in 1944, serving in the 319th Infantry Regiment. Sgt. Black, a squad leader, had his elbow shattered by artillery shrapnel on Jan. 23, 1945, in the immediate area of the monument's location.
Initially, there was no one to help the sergeant. Dripping blood across the snow for a mile, Black found a medic, got help and got home. He lived to 92, making his living as a house painter with his one good arm.
A local organization, the Cercle d'Études sur la Bataille des Ardennes (CIBA), commissioned a Luxembourg artist to design and build the monument. Local student historians prepared text for a "reader board."
You find these reader boards scattered about Luxembourg. That's a relatively new development and it makes a difference. "It's important that people understand what took place here," Bill Black Jr. told me.
Yes, it is.
The arch of the monument symbolizes a meeting of the Blue Ridge Mountains with the Ardennes forests. There are some similarities, though the terrain here is more severe. Standing there, looking over toward Germany, you can well appreciate the difficulties of the fighting.
When the locals, during the dedication, began singing "The Star-Spangled Banner," it got a little difficult in another way. Reining in your emotions becomes a challenge. You feel proud of your country.
Of course, as I wrote this on Wednesday evening, the president of the United States was being impeached.
"Mr. Trump, in his divisiveness, is the manifestation of a nation fracturing into warring camps and trying to define what America is about all over again," wrote veteran New York Times reporter Peter Baker.
I know Peter. Smart guy. He covered Virginia politics for The Washington Post 30 years ago.
And how many times did this subject - our president, his fate, all of it - emerge over the past week in Luxembourg? Not once.
Over here, they know exactly what America is - and they have not lost faith in us. If it's time to start defining America again, start here.

Is Anyone Happy Anymore?

Texto completo: We've lost our ability to take comfort in small things.
Recently I have been forced to think a bit about happiness. It's not something I've done before. I have been too busy living. But when an interview with me appeared in The Sunday Times under the headline "Why 'This Is Happiness' Author Niall Williams Is Happily Out of Step," I began to realize that it was not just me but the idea of happiness itself that was out of step with the times, and that it required some mental adjusting, not to say daring, to say aloud the title of my novel.
"How can you be happy now?" the book seems to ask, and it has a point. The catastrophe of climate neglect, the toxic politics, the tangible sense of so many things worsening in your own lifetime, along with a sense of your obscure or outright complicity, all combined to make the idea of any possible happiness seem at best childish, at worse willfully blind. "This Is Unhappiness" seemed a truer epitaph for the times, a sentiment echoed by the recent No. 1 movie in the world, "Joker," which includes the line, "I haven't been happy one minute of my life," with an expletive thrown in for good measure.
Now, some element of being happily out-of-step may come from the fact that for nearly 35 years, my wife, Christine, and I have been living, writing and trying to grow a garden on the outermost edge of Europe, in Kiltumper, on the west coast of Ireland. I don't mean to suggest that from this green vantage we are impervious to what is going on; we are not. In general, thanks largely to a superb national broadcaster, I find that Irish people are very well-informed.
So, being out-of-step is not from ignorance, nor is Kiltumper an idyll. Then again, no one who has reached their 60s can avoid the gathering evidence of their own mortality. And for the past four years we have been in and out of the cool, spirit-crushing corridors of an oncology ward, since Christine was first diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer.
So, happiness? Really?
A first defense might come from the wonderful Wendell Berry, who in "Think Little," a canonical essay from nearly 50 years ago, wrote, "A person who is growing a garden, if he is growing it organically, is improving a piece of the world." So, in sometimes coming close to despairing of the earth with a capital E, we have focused on the portion with a small e that we are charged with minding, the piece, literally, within our bounds.
All gardens are asking for attention all the time, and the return for that attention is to gift you an essential now, the present moment, where you are face to face with the nature of things. Lest that sound too grand, or abstract, what I mean is the very opposite. There is nothing abstract about the heavy clay growing heavier in the blown rain of Kiltumper, and nothing too grand in "Niall, we need to de-caterpillar the kale now."
But there is a kind of happiness.
I can appreciate that at the beginning of a country -- and one as vast and empty as America was -- the idea of pursuit, both chase and hunt, of happiness had an invigorating appeal to the founding fathers. (I'm not sure the founding mothers would have phrased it the same way.) But the truth is that the longer I have lived, and the shorter my future, the less pursuing I have done. Some of this may come from a peculiarly Irish positive pessimism -- be happy, things will get worse -- more of it from the history of disappointment all artists know and the rest from a remnant Catholic guilt that says you don't deserve happiness anyway. The point is, in my case, happiness seemed a thing that could not be pursued, only realized and chosen.
I found some echo of this in Stephanie Burt's recent essay in The New Yorker about Seamus Heaney, where she writes of his becoming the happiest poet of his generation. Having been a poet of earth and water in his early career, later he "became a poet of air: one who wanted to share with his readers" the feeling of "lightness, the ability to stay pleased." And from the poem "The Gravel Walks," she quotes the line that has been inscribed on his headstone: "Walk on air against your better judgment."
I love the daring and defiance in that, the wonder and the gravity balanced. It is not coincidence that it comes from a collection called "The Spirit Level." With a clear eye, your better judgment sees the world as it is today, and yet chooses to be, as I am literally these days, lightheaded.
The final defense of happiness comes from Michael Dooley.
When I came to write the new novel, I remembered a moment from our early days in Clare. We had left commuter Monday-to-Friday lives in New York to come to a rural farming community, seeking a simpler life that was truer to our natures, not yet knowing what exactly that was. Christine's grandfather had grown up in Kiltumper and left it 70 years earlier to go to New York, so there was a root buried there. In those first heady days, we were welcomed in particular by the older people, and by trial and error were taught the lessons of how to live here.
One of those first welcomers was Michael Dooley, a silver-haired farmer, turf cutter, man of the land of the old kind, who into his 80s, pedaled his big bicycle into the village.
Because Michael seemed to be working on the land all day every day, into the fall of darkness and beyond, and never complained, I once asked him if he ever took a holiday.
"A holiday?" He looked at me like the innocent I was.
"I mean, what do you do to be happy?"
The question was a novelty to him and he considered it from all sides before answering.
"When I want a holiday," he said at last, "I go over the road as far as the meadow. I go in there, take off my jacket, and lay down on it. I watch the world turning for a bit, with me still in it."
He smiled then, and held me in his blue Atlantic eyes, full of the ordinary wisdom of a well-lived life, a wisdom that saw the many failings of the world but our still breathing and dreaming in it, and with a conclusive nod that defeated all arguments said, "That's happiness."
Niall Williams is the author, most recently, of the novel "This Is Happiness."

Texto completo: An agreement between college counselors and the Justice Department should free up colleges to woo early-decision applicants with financial aid.
WASHINGTON -- The financial aid stranglehold on students who commit to colleges may be broken.
In a proposed agreement announced this month to answer Justice Department antitrust accusations, the National Association for College Admission Counseling said it would allow its member college and university counselors to recruit students even after they have committed to another school and would permit members to encourage students to transfer after they have already enrolled.
Colleges and universities have been heavily criticized for encouraging potential students to enter into agreements, particularly for early admissions, with the understanding that an accepted applicant could not then turn to another school. That understanding, which was not legally binding but was widely followed, prevented universities from competing for applicants by offering more enticing financial aid packages.
Now, colleges will be free to offer perks, like special scholarships or priority in course selection, to early-decision applicants, students who are less likely to need tuition assistance and use the process to secure a spot at their first-choice schools. For many selective colleges, more than half of an incoming freshman class will have been accepted through early admission.
Institutions will also be able to continue recruiting students beyond a widely applied May 1 deadline that is typically imposed for students who have applied through a regular decision process and are considering offers based, at least in part, on financial aid packages.
The changes stand to shake up the admissions process in the next year, affecting some colleges' ability to predict the size of their freshman classes while allowing some students to benefit from competitive financial aid packages, or even bargain for assistance right up until they walk onto a campus.
The agreement brings to a close a two-year investigation into the association's code of ethics by the Justice Department's antitrust division, which enforces laws governing fair consumer and competitive market practices. In a complaint, the Justice Department maintained that the organization's recruitment standards violated antitrust laws because they "substantially reduced competition among colleges for college applicants and potential transfer students and deprived these consumers of the benefits."
The department began investigating shortly after the National Association for College Admission Counseling adopted new recruitment rules in 2017, which sought to protect students and families from undue pressure and aggressive tactics that could be construed as coercive. The rules were part of a broad set of voluntary professional standards that the 82-year organization writes for its members, more than 15,000 high school and college admissions counselors.
The Justice Department took issue with three provisions: Schools should not offer incentives, like prime housing, to persuade students to apply early decision; colleges should not knowingly recruit or offer enrollment incentives to students who are already enrolled, registered or have submitted their deposits to other institutions; and members must not initiate contact with students to lure them into transferring.
In September, the organization preemptively voted to strike the provisions from its ethics code to avoid a costly legal fight with the Justice Department, saying such litigation would have "dire consequences on the association's finances and ability to operate in the future."
The association "continues to believe that the now deleted provisions provided substantial aid and protection to students in their process of choosing and moving from high school to college," the organization said in a statement. "However, the association understands its obligations under the decree and intends to strictly implement and abide by its provisions."
In a statement, Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general who leads the antitrust division, called the settlement "a victory for all college applicants and students across the United States who will benefit from vigorous competition among colleges for their enrollment."
"While trade associations and standards-setting organizations can and often do promote rules and standards that benefit the market as a whole, they cannot do so at the cost of competition," he said.
In the early 1990s, the antitrust division investigated the eight colleges and universities in the Ivy League, which used "overlap meetings" to share information and collaborate on financial aid offers.
Last year, the Justice Department began investigating whether colleges and universities were violating antitrust laws by exchanging information about prospective students who make early decision commitments.
Higher education experts anticipate that the changes will be mostly felt by smaller or less- selective institutions, many of which are already forecasting enrollment losses because of a looming "demographic cliff" from falling birthrates and diminishing interest from foreign students. Institutions may also have a harder time predicting their fall enrollment, and that uncertainty could affect their ability to pull from waiting lists or project how many students they lose over the summer.
Jon Boeckenstedt, the vice provost of enrollment management at Oregon State University, anticipated that the changes would prompt colleges and universities to lower costs for some prospective students.
"If there is anything good that comes out of this, it might be that colleges looking to fill their last slots might go and find some low-income students who are extremely price sensitive and would be thrilled to take a slot for a discounted price," he said.
Brian C. Rosenberg, the president of Macalester College, in St. Paul, Minn., said he did not believe there would be enough slots for those students. Affluent students will still disproportionately apply for early decision, Mr. Rosenberg said, and with the increased competition, colleges will rush to recruit tuition-paying students to secure their revenue early.
"It results in more benefit to the people who already benefit," Mr. Rosenberg said. "The problem that it creates, and the problem that's most endemic in our higher education system, is the students that stand to be most harmed are the ones already disadvantaged."

What pundits said about Klobuchar

Texto completo: Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar "struck a forceful tone" at Thursday's Democratic primary debate, tangling with rival Pete Buttigieg as she sought to once again make the case that a Midwestern moderate will have the best shot at defeating President Donald Trump next November.
The stakes for Klobuchar, trailing the top tier in fifth place in the polls with just six weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses, were higher than ever.
So how'd she do? The Star Tribune's Patrick Condon reports that the debate in Los Angeles marked "her most confident debate performance to date." It also garnered some of her best reviews so far.
Here's what political journalists and pundits are saying about the Minnesota Democrat's time on the stage:
Rankings published by several major outlets, including USA Today, put Klobuchar in the "winners" column.
"Klobuchar strategically acted as a peacekeeper a few times Thursday, touting her Midwestern roots by stopping a few word-battles between other candidates on stage with a, 'come on, you guys.' She then seamlessly dovetailed into her own stance on the issue."
CNN's Chris Cillizza called it an "excellent debate performance when Klobuchar really needed one."
"The Minnesota senator benefited the most from the smaller number of candidates on stage. She got to talk a LOT more than in past debates and used that time very, very well," Cillizza wrote. "Time and time again in answer after answer, Klobuchar drove home her basic message: I'm from the Midwest. I'm a woman. I get things done."
At Fox News, analyst Mary Anne Marsh wrote that Klobuchar "delivered another solid performance with her signature lines, sharp points, and humor … that will help her with some voters."
"While Klobuchar has been making slow, steady point by point progress in the polls but with just 45 days to go until the Iowa Caucuses it's not enough to get her in the top tier. But, she was a substantial presence in the debate on Thursday night," Marsh wrote.
Klobuchar also scored 7.1 out of 10 -- tying Sen. Bernie Sanders for the highest score of any candidate -- in a ranking by New York Times Opinion writers, though the individual reviews were mixed:
"Virtually flawless debate. She attacked effectively and came off as confident, experienced and presidential -- and, yes, likable, something we're told isn't possible for female candidates but that she proved actually is." -- Liz Mair
"She's getting better, but still sounds too much like a senator and not a president. She doesn't need to mention all that legislation. Stay big." -- David Leonhardt
"Effectively presented herself as a unifier who can win elections, jousting with good cheer and optimism." -- Nicholas Kristof
"She relied on platitudes and has yet to appear presidential in the slightest." -- Bianca Vivion Brooks
Politico called the performance her "best yet," concluding it "appeared that Amy Klobuchar might have a chance."
"For months, the Minnesota senator has languished in public opinion polls outside of the top tier -- an ineffectual moderate alternative to Joe Biden. But in one night, she was commanding a second look, and marking a late, sharp-elbowed turn in her campaign."

Kamala Harris: Will McConnell Let the Senate Hold a Fair Impeachment Trial?

Texto completo: By Kamala D. Harris
U.S. Senator (D-CA)
United States Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)
Sometime early in the new year I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead, regardless of party or ideology. Every one of my colleagues will be required to do the same.
As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Having worked my whole life serving the people, I know that any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.
But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appears more interested in covering up the president’s misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He is already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.
Let’s be clear: Mr. McConnell doesn’t want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.
Fortunately, Mr. McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed. Though in just the past year, Mr. McConnell has used his position to unilaterally block legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, lower the prices of prescription drugs and address the gun violence epidemic, he cannot wield the same authority in a Senate impeachment trial.
In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors.
Every one of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify and ultimately serve as both court and jury. Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make. We will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.
The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, has made a reasonable request to hear from four additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president’s misconduct and to review documents that shed light on why the administration initially decided to cut off military aid to Ukraine.
We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump’s bribery scheme on live television, and from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Mr. Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress.
Every senator should want to hear from anyone who can speak directly to the president’s misconduct related to the articles of impeachment.
Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators. But Mr. Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.
Senators must be allowed to subpoena relevant witnesses and submit questions to them directly. The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that Mr. Schumer has requested.
I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. No court would allow a trial to proceed this way, and neither should any member of the Senate.
Ensuring the integrity of this trial is a solemn responsibility for every senator, with consequences that extend far beyond any one presidency. My colleagues and I have a duty to use our voice and our vote to insist on a fair trial, rooted in the pursuit of truth. We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there are not two sets of rules, one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else. We must conduct the Senate impeachment trial in a way that is fair and that reflects impartial justice.
History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I’ll be fighting for justice and accountability, and my colleagues should too.
Kamala D. Harris is a Democratic senator from California.

‘It’s just not fair’: Billionaire wine cave owner hits back

Texto completo: The billionaire owner of a wine cave that recently hosted a fundraiser for Pete Buttigieg was upset with the attacks that came at his industry after Elizabeth Warren called it out.
During Thursday night’s PBS/Politico debate, Warren, 70, attacked Buttigieg, 37, for having a closed-door fundraiser, saying, “Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States.”
This exchange triggered a flurry of “wine cave” jabs between the Democratic candidates for the remainder of the evening. Craig Hall, the owner of Hall Wines, was upset that the Democratic candidates chose to bash wine caves instead of focusing on policy issues.
“I’m just a pawn here,” Hall, 69, told the New York Times. “They’re making me out to be something that’s not true. And they picked the wrong pawn. It’s just not fair.”
Hall and his wife, Kathryn Walt Hall, have given Democratic causes more than $2.4 million since the 1980s, including donations to candidates like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi. The couple found it offensive that candidates like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders have spoken down about the party’s billionaire donors.
“These people don’t know who they’re talking about when they throw me in the class that they did,” he explained. “As much as it’s frustrating, it’s more disappointing to me that Democrats are fighting with each other when we have a common goal, which is to get back to the White House.”
The businessman claimed that he would struggle to vote for a Democratic candidate if it ended up being Warren or Sanders.
“I hope I don’t face that question,” Hall explained. “It may be difficult. But I really want to support whoever the nominee is, and I plan to, but there may be some holding my nose.”
Hall noted that Buttigieg was his personal front-runner despite not having completely settled on a candidate to support in the presidential primary.
Although wine caves have had a lot of negative press in the last week, many have noted that caves are essential for the aging process of wine because of the low temperatures and high humidity. The Halls were not alone in their defense of the wine industry. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also condemned the candidates for attacking wine caves, saying, “It’s one of America’s great exports. It’s my business. It’s how I started.”

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Seven candidates took the debate stage Thursday night, hoping to make a splash at the last debate before the new year.
While the Democratic field has grown and shrunk repeatedly in the past few weeks, the stage held only seven candidates — the fewest of any debate so far this cycle.
Here's a look at the winners and losers:
Winners Joe Biden Former Vice President Joe Biden looked stronger and more relaxed Thursday night than he has in previous debates.
When asked about how to return to "normal" after a President Donald Trump administration, Biden pushed back against the notion of just returning to business as usual, stating, "Look, I didn't say return to normal. Normal is not enough. Normal, in fact, we would have to move beyond normal, whether health care, the environment, whatever it is."
He continued to expand on working with his Republican counterparts, and that he refuses "to accept the notion, as some on this stage do, that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that's the case, we're dead as a country."
"If anyone has reason to be angry with Republicans and not want to cooperate, it's me. They have attacked me, my son, my family," he said, addressing the GOP's unfounded claims that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into an Ukrainian energy company company tied to his son, Hunter Biden.
"We have to be able to get things done, and if we can't convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election, in red states and in purple states," he declared
When asked about Obama's comments that there would be "significant improvement across the board" if countries were led by women, and that "old men" needed to get "out of the way," Biden joked that he is "going to guess he wasn't talking about me either," earning laughter from the audience.
But Biden did differentiate himself from the former president by stating he disagreed with Obama's surge of troops in Afghanistan, and firmly quipped that he was the "guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan, period. We should not have done it. And I argued against it constantly."
Biden displayed himself to be the strong, experienced and leveled politician his campaign has been trying to present.
"Joe Biden tonight looked like a frontrunner, he fought like a frontrunner, he sounded like a frontrunner, and he deserves the credit," CNN analyst Van Jones said after the debate.
Andrew Yang Businessman Andrew Yang jokingly asked, "I know what you're thinking, America: How am I still on this stage with them?"
While Yang hasn't missed a debate thus far, he had more airtime than previous debates, and was able to expand on his answers with fewer candidates to compete with.
Yang had a forceful answer on a question related to people with disabilities, saying "Special needs children are going to become special needs adults ... . We have to stop confusing economic value and human value... We have to say 'Kyle, you have intrinsic value because you are a human being.'"
Yang also answered firmly on needing more women in leadership and declared, "Our country is deeply misogynist ... money and men are tied together. The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders."
He also got some chuckles after saying, "if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for awhile, we kind of become morons."
Amy Klobuchar Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar strategically acted as a peacekeeper a few times Thursday, touting her Midwestern roots by stopping a few word-battles between candidates with a "come on, you guys." She then seamlessly dovetailed into her own stance on the issue.
She then hit Mayor Pete Buttigieg on his lack of experience, accusing him of "denigrating" the experience of the senators on stage.
"We should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talked about from moderate republicans and independents, as well as a fired-up democratic base," Klobuchar said. "And not just done it once – I have done it three times."
Losers Health care Despite dominating the first half of the past several debates, health care took two hours to even be talked about at Thursday's debate.
A November report by the New York Times found that health care had dominated the debates so far, with 95.4 minutes were spent on the issue, besting the second-most mentioned issue of foreign policy by over 22 minutes.
The topic was brought up at the tailend of the debate, but did not bring forth any new debate.
Julián Castro and Tulsi Gabbard Two Democratic presidential candidates who weren't on stage Thursday night didn't even get name checked.
Castro and Gabbard, who didn't qualify for December's debate, will likely struggle to gain traction and grow their base without the national audience a debate brings. Gabbard campaigned in Manchester, New Hampshire, during the debate, while Castro on Twitter answered what his responses to the debate questions would have been.
Sen. Cory Booker, who also didn't make the stage, was at least mentioned by entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
"I miss Kamala (Harris), I miss Cory (Booker), though I think Cory will be back," Yang said when asked about the lack of people of color on the stage. Castro is the only Latino candidate in the 2020 presidential election. Tulsi Gabbard is Samoan American.
Gabbard is at 1.7% nationally, according to an average of polling by Real Clear Politics. Castro's polling average is at 1.3%.
What about Mayor Pete? Buttigieg is polling ahead of the pack in multiple early states, and came out nearly unscathed during November's match up.
That was not the case Thursday.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized Buttigieg on his recent fundraiser in a wine cave.
"Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States," she said.
But Buttigieg responded that he was the only one on the debate stage in Los Angeles who's not a millionaire or billionaire. He then was hit by Klobuchar for lack of experience.
"If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80% of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence's Indiana," Buttigieg said to Klobuchar.
But it's unclear whether the mayor will see boost from his performance, and whether the jabs from other candidates will hurt.

'OK Boomer': A Defining Generation Becomes a Label for Irrelevance; After decades of outsize influence, baby boomers are getting taunted by a younger cohort in a bit of sly intergenerational warfare

As 2019 ends, various dictionary publishers are choosing their "Word of the Year," a term they believe has surged the most in usage and importance. The originator of this practice, the American Dialect Society , makes its choice on Jan. 3, and this time the gathering of scholars will also pick a "Word of the Decade."
Full disclosure: As chair of the society's New Words Committee, I'll be overseeing the selections. Earlier this week, I visited my son's eighth-grade class at his Jersey City middle school to give a talk about the process, and I asked the students what their nomination would be for 2019. Several piped up with "boomer" and "OK boomer."
My Generation Z audience then proceeded to break down the significance of an epithet that has indeed made a big impact over the past year. For millennials and especially post-millennials, "OK boomer" has become a sly linguistic weapon of intergenerational warfare.
In its current use as a put-down, "boomer" has strayed from its original meaning referring to members of the baby boom generation born after World War II—and long known, partly thanks to their outsize numbers, as powerful trendsetters for the culture as a whole. Members of the postwar generation began to be called "baby boomers" as early as 1963 and simply "boomers" by 1974 .
But in Generation Z parlance, "boomer" can be applied to anyone older who has a condescending or out-of-touch attitude toward young people and their concerns. As my Gen Z son puts it, "It's not an age group—it's a mind-set." (Confusion over what exactly "boomer" means now is reflected in "what is a boomer" being one of Google's top searches in 2019.)
The full phrase "OK boomer" has been embraced as a handy retort to mock anyone stodgily complaining about kids today, with the kids themselves spreading the expression in viral fashion on video-sharing platforms like TikTok. The phrase was mostly percolating under the radar until it garnered major media attention in late October, in widely shared articles from NBC News and the New York Times .
Pretty soon "OK boomer" was everywhere, and the backlash from the older side of the generational divide was swift. Conservative radio host Bob Lonsberry, in a now-deleted tweet, went so far as to declare that "boomer" is now "the n-word of ageism." Myrna Blyth, editorial director of AARP Media, told Axios , "OK, millennials. But we're the people that actually have the money." Others have tried out " OK zoomer " as a comeback to the comeback, using "zoomer" as a snarky label for Generation Z.
The phrase next made international news: Chlöe Swarbrick, a 25-year-old member of New Zealand's Parliament, became an online sensation when she used "OK boomer" to respond to heckling of a climate-change speech she was giving. In U.S. politics, meanwhile, targets of the jibe have included 77-year-old former vice president Joe Biden (born before the baby boom generation, whose members now range from 55 to 73). As I mentioned in a previous column , one Iowa voter reacting to Mr. Biden's old-fashioned campaign slogan "No Malarkey" told Politico, "I'm afraid he's going to be disregarded as, 'OK boomer.'"
"Boomer" talk has even crossed linguistic boundaries. This week, Van Dale, a dictionary publisher in the Netherlands, announced "boomer" as the Dutch Word of the Year after an online vote of more than 17,000 people. In New Zealand , thanks to Ms. Swarbrick, "OK boomer" topped a "Word of the Year" poll held by media commentator Russell Brown. Will the American Dialect Society similarly honor "OK boomer"? If it loses out, I can guess what the terse response from those eighth-graders is going to be.

Texto completo: Headnote IMPEACHMENT
Speaker Nancy Pelosi deploying new strategy: to delay transmitting articles of impeachment
WASHINGTON - The day after the House cast historic votes to impeach President Donald Trump, Democrats grappled Thursday with when to send the charges to the Republican-led Senate, hoping to gain leverage in a bicameral clash over the contours of an election-year trial.
With some leading Democrats pushing to delay transmittal of the articles and others advocating that they be withheld altogether, it appeared increasingly likely that the limbo could persist until the newyear. The House is poised to leave town Friday for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, possibly without taking the votes that would be required to start the process in the Senate.
"We are ready," said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said Wednesday night that she was reluctant to send the charges or name the lawmakers who would prosecute the case against Trump until she was certain of a fair process for a Senate trial. "When we see what they have, we will know who and how many we will send over."
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, has complicated the picture for Democrats by asserting that he has no intention of acting as an impartial juror in a Senate trial of Trump but would instead do everything in his power, working in concert with the White House, to quickly acquit the president.
But if Pelosi was angling for an upper hand in negotiations about how the trial would proceed, McConnell quickly squashed the notion Thursday in a scathing speech in which he denounced her and Democrats for impeaching Trump.
"The vote did not reflect what had been proven; it only reflects how they feel about the president," McConnell said from the Senate floor. "The Senate must put this right. We must rise to this occasion. There is only one outcome that is suited to the paucity of evidence, the failed inquiry, the slapdash case."
And in comments that underscored the risks Pelosi faces in withholding the articles, McConnell effectively argued that the delay reflected a weak case against Trump, a blink by the Democrats in their standoff with the president.
"The prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country and second-guessing whether they even want to go to trial," McConnell said. "They said impeachment was so urgent that it could not even wait for due process, but now they're content to sit on their hands. This is comical."
Trump, echoing McConnell's remarks, took to Twitter to attack what he called a "pathetic" case.
"Pelosi feels her phony impeachment HOAX is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the Senate, which can set a date and put this whole SCAM into default if they refuse to show up!" Trump wrote. "The Do Nothings are so bad for our Country!"
The angry tone of the comments reflected what people close to the president have said is a keen desire by Trump to be publicly vindicated in a Senate trial, a prospect that Pelosi now appears to be placing in jeopardy.
Nerves were raw on both sides of the aisle the morning after the House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his campaign to pressure Ukraine to smear Democratic rivals, making him only the third president to be impeached.
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the Democratic leader, called McConnell's speech a "30-minute partisan screed." Later, he met with Pelosi behind closed doors to plan strategy.
In the House, Pelosi shot back at McConnell: "I don't think anybody expected that we would have a rogue president and a rogue leader in the Senate at the same time."
And even as the next step in the process remained murky, she said Democrats had been receiving accolades from people across the country who were buoyed by the House action to charge Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors.
"Seems like people have a spring in their step because the president was held accountable for his reckless behavior," Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. "No one is above the law, and the president has been held accountable."
But the conflict in Congress over how to proceed made clear that rather than rise above the partisan vitriol that permeated the House's impeachment inquiry and its vote Wednesday, the Senate - traditionally the cooler-headed chamber - may replicate it. It did not bode well for negotiations between the two Senate leaders, who were expected to meet later Thursday to discuss the parameters of a trial.
Some leading Democrats have cast doubt on whether a Senate trial will happen at all.
On Thursday morning, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., the No. 3 House Democrat, said he was willing to wait "as long as it takes" to transmit the two impeachment articles approved Wednesday night.
"Until we can get some assurances from the majority leader that he is going to allow for a fair and impartial trial to take place, we would be crazy to walk in there knowing he has set up a kangaroo court," Clyburn said Thursday morning on CNN.
Pressed on whether Democrats should withhold the articles permanently, pulling the plug on a Senate trial, Clyburn said his personal preference would be to do so unless McConnell relents.
"If it were me, yes, that is what I am saying; I have no idea what the speaker would do," Clyburn said. "If you have a preordained outcome that is negative to your actions, why walk into it? I would much rather not take that chance."
In her own news conference in the House Thursday, Pelosi played down the delay over pressing charges in the Senate but declined repeatedly to offer a timeline for when the House might file its case. Pelosi has indicated she will work with House chairmen and Schumer to determine when the articles should be submitted and what meets her standard for fairness.
Schumer has already set forth his own detailed plan for a trial. In a letter sent Sunday night to McConnell, Schumer proposed a trial beginning Jan. 7 that would give each side a fixed amount of time to present its case, and called for four top White House officials who have not testified - including Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff; and John Bolton, the president's former national security adviser - to appear as witnesses.
McConnell quickly rejected the plan.
"Is the president's case so weak that none of the president's men can defend him under oath?" Schumer asked in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning.
Schumer said that Democrats wanted a "fair and speedy trial" and that he had proposed a "very reasonable structure."
"I have yet to hear one good argument why less evidence is better than more evidence, particularly in such a serious moment," he added.
In her news conference after Wednesday night's vote, Pelosi did not indicate that she was contemplating holding the articles forever.
And while she did not say explicitly what she believes would constitute a fair trial, she indicated she would support the plan laid out by Schumer.
"We'd like to see a trial where it's up to the senators to make their own decisions and working together, hopefully, in recognition of witnesses that the president withheld from us, the documents that president withheld from us," Pelosi said.
A top ally of Trump's, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called the possibility that the House could hold back the articles a "constitutional extortion mechanism that is dangerous for the country."
Graham, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he spoke Thursday morning with Trump, who asked him, "What's happening?"
"He's puzzled," Graham said. "I tried the best I could to explain it. I'm puzzled, too."

Texto completo: First came "alternative facts." Now, the Congress and the nation are split into alternative universes, as Rep. Alcee Hastings described our constitutional crisis this week.
Two universes, with irreconcilable views of what is true and false and what is right and wrong.
The universe in which facts are facts and no one is above the law prevailed Wednesday when the House voted, for only the third time in our history, to impeach a president.
If what President Donald Trump did wasn't impeachable, nothing would be.
He abused the power of his office, withholding money Congress had appropriated, in a scheme to coerce a foreign nation into helping him in our ensuing election. That emboldened Russia to maintain its lethal aggression against Ukraine, putting our own security at risk. Caught in the act, Trump openly invited Chinese assistance for his campaign and used all the muscle of his office to thwart the investigation that the House was duty-bound to make.
In that other universe, the one that lost the debate Wednesday, right and wrong depend entirely on who holds political power. Power is a virtue. Nothing else matters.
It is regrettable that the House vote was almost entirely partisan, with no Republicans honoring their oaths to protect the Constitution from "all enemies, foreign and domestic."
To say that an issue is partisan, however, has less to do with the merits of an issue than with the motives of those debating it.
The Senate Republicans, sad to say, seem mired in that same dark-side universe where might is right and power determines what is true or false.
As they're in the majority, the prospects of a fair trial on whether to remove Trump seem dismal. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has virtually promised Trump's acquittal and is not consenting - yet - to calling for the administration witnesses and documents the president wrongfully denied to the House.
That explains why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn't saying when - or even whether - she will send the two articles of impeachment to the Senate. Political reality dictates that at some point she must do that, but at the moment, it's the only strategy she has to force McConnell to give the American people a fair trial.
The people are on her side about that. According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll published this week, 70% - including nearly two-thirds of Republicans - think Trump should allow his top aides to testify.
For now, however, it's appropriate to celebrate the courageous leadership of Pelosi and of Adam Schiff and Jerrold Nadler, chairs of the Intelligence and Judiciary committees, who compiled what even the Republicans should have recognized as an ironclad case.
Twenty-eight Democratic freshmen earned their own profiles in courage by resisting fearsome pressure from the other side. Having been elected from districts Trump won in 2016, they were targeted in advertising blitzes. Only two others voted against both articles. Had just 13 of the 28 folded, Trump would have won.
Florida's delegation voted entirely with their parties, as expected, though it was still disappointing to find Republicans Francis Rooney of Naples, who is retiring, and Mario Diaz-Balart on the wrong side of history.
For Broward and Palm Beach voters, however, now is a good time to write or call Reps. Hastings, Lois Frankel, Ted Deutch, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Frederica Wilson to say "thank you." Voting to impeach a president is difficult, no matter how well-deserved, and Trump's voters won't be forgiving.
What has happened to the Republicans' view of political morality since they impeached Bill Clinton for lying about an affair with an intern? His offenses did not endanger our security or threaten to establish a dictatorship. Trump's do.
Current events seem to fulfill Lord Acton's famous maxim that "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
Yet people can resist that. Many do.
"Politics doesn't corrupt people. People corrupt politics," said U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson Berman on Tuesday while sentencing Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign aide whose cooperation helped convict others in crimes uncovered during the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
That is certainly true of Trump, who has turned the Republican Party into his personal cult and who puts himself above all else. That sad fact was evident in the six typewritten pages of self-pitying, self-serving rant he sent to Pelosi on Tuesday. He papered the Senate with copies.
Misrepresentations, falsehoods and outright lies have become so common in Trump's bizarre presidency that the letter was remarkable only in two respects.
One was that it packed so many of them into a single document. The New York Times annotated 19 and The Washington Post 21. He attributed to his adversaries every offense against the Constitution that he has committed, a defensive trait that psychologists call projection.
It also laid bare the utter hollowness of his character.
"Even worse than offending the Founding Fathers," he wrote to Pelosi, "you are offending Americans of faith by continually saying, 'I pray for the President,' when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense. It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I."
Why is it so difficult for Trump, who claims to share the Christian faith, to believe that Pelosi would consider it her Christian duty to pray for his enlightenment?
The only part of the letter on which both universes might agree is that he wrote it "for the purpose of history, and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record."
In that record, historians will be astonished by his claim that "more due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials."
Twenty people were put to death in Salem before that madness subsided, convicted by "evidence" that was allowed to include dreams and hallucinations.
Only in a truly perverse alternative universe could that be called "due process."

Trump Ally Will Not Seek Re-election

Texto completo: Representative Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina, announced that he would not seek re-election at the end of his term.
WASHINGTON -- One of President Trump's most loyal supporters, Representative Mark Meadows, announced on Thursday that he would leave Congress at the end of his term in January 2021.
"For everything there is a season. After prayerful consideration and discussion with family, today I'm announcing that my time serving Western North Carolina in Congress will come to a close at the end of this term," Mr. Meadows said in a statement. "My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning."
"This was a decision I struggled with greatly," he said.
Mr. Meadows is now the 25th House Republican to leave before the next Congress, citing retirement or ambitions for another political post, an exodus that has been fueled in part by frustration at being deprived of power in the minority and term limits on leadership positions.
First elected in 2012, Mr. Meadows co-founded the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and served as a consistent thorn in the sides of two successive Republican speakers, John A. Boehner and Paul D. Ryan. But he found his most powerful perch as one of Mr. Trump's top allies on Capitol Hill -- and last year was considered for the position of the president's chief of staff.
Mr. Meadows did not elaborate further in a brief interview on Thursday about what his continued work with Mr. Trump might entail.
"There's a number of options, but I'll certainly be helping the president and hopefully helping him get re-elected," he said.
Mr. Meadows added he would miss being able to help his constituents in North Carolina and the "intellectual bantering back and forth" on the House floor.
"I don't mind the combat," he said.
As House Democrats began their impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump over his pressure campaign against Ukraine, Mr. Meadows emerged as one of the president's leading defenders, and was frequently spotted huddling with the president at the White House, proximity that fueled his political power even as Republicans held little power in the House.
Asked by a North Carolina newspaper if the Freedom Caucus was still relevant in a Democratic-controlled House, Mr. Meadows smiled. "Oh, more relevant than you might imagine," he said.
His role as a critical supporter of the president came as a departure for Mr. Meadows, who built a reputation on his hunger to challenge the Republican establishment and its leaders. In an escalation of the bad blood simmering between the right flank of the Republican conference represented by Mr. Meadows and the more centrist leadership, in 2015 Mr. Meadows attempted to overthrow Mr. Boehner, ultimately influencing the then-House speaker's decision to retire early.
Under Mr. Ryan's tenure as speaker, the House Freedom Caucus, led by Mr. Meadows, continued to flex its muscles as the most powerful group of lawmakers in Congress.
While praising his conservative record, Republican lawmakers also underscored another, more unusual aspect of Mr. Meadows' congressional career: his ability to build friendships across the aisle.
"Not only is Mark a top-notch conservative, he's an upstanding individual, who looks to build friendships with all of his colleagues," Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, the current chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said in a statement. "In a growing partisan climate, Mark's example is a breath of fresh air and one that we all should strive to emulate."
In one of the more improbable alliances in Congress, Mr. Meadows counted as a close friend the late Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who served as the chairman of the powerful Oversight Committee. The two worked together on prescription drug legislation, and when Mr. Cummings died in October, Mr. Meadows delivered an emotional eulogy.
As Mr. Meadows eyes his next job, it is not immediately clear who his successor might be. Friday is the deadline to file for re-election in his heavily Republican congressional district -- a short turnaround time for any potential candidate.
Mr. Meadows is the third Republican from North Carolina to announce his decision to leave Congress; he made no mention of the newly redrawn districts in his state in his statement. Mr. Meadows was still expected to keep his seat, despite what was expected to be a more challenging re-election campaign.
His announcement comes a day after he voted against two articles of impeachment against the president. Ultimately the Democrats won the vote and impeached Mr. Trump, making him the third president to be impeached in the country's history.
After the vote on Wednesday, Mr. Meadows wrote in a Twitter post, "Today will be remembered as the day your House Democrat majority voted to impeach President @realDonaldTrump for a crime they couldn't find and a case they couldn't prove. You won't forget. And neither will we."

JPMorgan Chief Is Asked
About Racism at Bank
Democratic lawmakers, five from the Senate and two from the House of Representatives, asked Jamie Dimon, right, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, to list steps the bank is taking to combat discrimination against black customers and employees after a New York Times report about racism at some of the bank's branches in Arizona.
In two letters to Mr. Dimon on Thursday, copies of which were also sent to regulators, the lawmakers asked whether the bank planned to change its hiring, lending and other practices to ensure it is treating minorities fairly.
The letter from the Senate was signed by Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. The letter from the House was signed by Representatives Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri and Al Green of Texas.
The senators asked Mr. Dimon to provide a list of cases in which regulators have penalized the bank for violating fair lending and employment laws over the last decade. Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Green asked for a breakdown of how many black financial advisors Chase employed in each of its branches.
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said the bank had not yet seen copies the letters, both of which were reviewed by The New York Times, as of Thursday afternoon.
"We're happy to continue the dialogue," said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler.
On Dec. 11, The Times published an article about recordings that a Phoenix-based employee and a customer made of other JPMorgan employees. One employee explained to a black customer why he was not receiving a service he expected from Chase: "You're bigger than the average person, period. And you're also an African-American," he said. Another employee described a different black customer as coming "from Section 8," adding that she did not "respect" her money.
On Dec. 13, Mr. Dimon wrote to the bank's employees that the Arizona incidents did not reflect "who we are as a company and how we serve our clients and communities every day." EMILY FLITTER

Senate Passes Bill
To Hinder Robocalls
The Senate approved a bill Thursday to crack down on robocalls, sending to President Trump a measure meant to combat a persistent and costly problem for Americans.
The bill, which Mr. Trump is expected to sign, would stiffen enforcement and require that phone companies offer free consumer tools to identify and block scam calls. It also calls for tougher fines when individuals intentionally violate the law.
It echoes and builds on preventive measures that the Federal Communications Commission and state attorneys general have pushed for. It potentially speeds up steps the telecom industry is already taking to protect Americans from the billions of scam calls made each month.
Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst for Consumer Reports, said the measure was an important step, though "robocalls are not going to disappear overnight."
Robocalls have flooded Americans' phones because technology makes it cheap and easy to call people. Enforcement is difficult, with many scammers overseas. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Andrew Yang doesn't know why he's the only minority onstage, but the answer is clear

Texto completo: Businessman Andrew Yang asked at the Democratic primary debate, "Why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage?"
Yang was the only racial minority onstage Thursday night because he was the only one who got enough support in polls from Democratic primary voters. Kamala Harris dropped out already. Cory Booker didn't meet the requirements. Neither did Julian Castro.
None of that is because the deck was stacked against them for racial reasons. It's because even black and Latino Democratic voters didn't support the minority candidates in the field. They were demonstrably and overwhelmingly for the old white guys, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
Yang might even know that. As detailed in my forthcoming book, Privileged Victims: How America's Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, accusations of racism, genderism, and any other -ism are how you fight in politics today.
It's not obvious to me why black voters don't back Booker over Biden or why Latino voters don't back Castro over Sanders, but that's the math. Yang made the case that it had something to do with "disposable income" and how much those particular voters have to contribute to political action committees, but that's not it.
The other minority candidates can't get sufficient support to win, and that's it.

Texto completo: Several years ago, Laurence Silberman, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and a man widely admired by conservatives for his wisdom and rectitude, spoke of his experience in the mid-1970s looking into the secret files of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.
“Accompanied by only one FBI official, I read virtually all these files in three weekends,” Silberman, who was then President Gerald Ford’s deputy attorney general, recalled in a speech to a judicial conference. “It was the single worst experience of my long governmental service.”
He continued:
“I intend to take to my grave nasty bits of information on various political figures — some still active. As bad as the dirt collection business was, perhaps even worse was the evidence that (Hoover) had allowed — even offered — the bureau to be used by presidents for nakedly political purposes. I have always thought that the most heinous act in which a democratic government can engage is to use its law enforcement machinery for political ends.” (My emphasis.)
I’ve been thinking about Silberman’s speech in two connections this week, the first regarding the FBI, the second impeachment. They are related.
On Tuesday, Rosemary Collyer, presiding judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, issued a stinging rebuke to the bureau for its handling of the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russia ties.
“The frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable,” Collyer wrote.
Collyer’s decision should put paid to the notion that this month’s report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general, is some kind of ringing vindication of the Russia investigation. Republicans like Devin Nunes were more right about the conduct of the investigation than many of its supporters, including me, care to admit, even if the investigation itself was warranted. And Carter Page is owed an apology by anyone, including me, who cares for the presumption of innocence and objects to trial by media.
But now to impeachment: If conservatives are right to object to the abuse of power by FBI agents, shouldn’t they be far more alarmed at the abuse of investigatory and other powers for political ends by the president of the United States?
According to the public transcript of Donald Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine, Trump said: “The server, they say Ukraine has it. ... I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.”
Trump also said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
Here is a textbook case of Silberman’s “most heinous act in which a democratic government can engage.” The president is unambiguously proposing to employ his chief law enforcement officer to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory that Trump hopes will burnish his political legitimacy. And he also proposes to use the attorney general in an attempt to investigate a political opponent for undeniably political ends.
That Trump didn’t get away with it is a relief, not an exoneration. That he continues to insist the call was “perfect,” as he did Tuesday in his letter to Nancy Pelosi, means that he is likely to do it again. That he attempted to subvert the will of Congress by impounding congressional funds for his political ends threatens the separation of powers in ways that will haunt a future Republican Congress. That he was prepared to endanger an ally and benefit an enemy is not treason, as the Constitution defines treason, but it is a travesty, as any American ought to understand travesty. That Republican leaders are cheering him only serves to define deviancy down and debase our political norms in ways that will surely haunt a future Republican Congress. That conservative pundits claim to be outraged at the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign — or the smearing of Carter Page — while being indifferent to Trump’s attempt investigate Joe Biden — and the smearing of Hunter Biden — marks a fresh low in rhetorical sophistry.
There are people who believe that law, morality, traditions and institutions are at least as important to the preservation of freedom as the will of the people. Such people are called conservative. What Republicans are now doing with their lockstep opposition to impeachment — and with their indifference to the behavior that brought impeachment about — is not conservative. It is the abdication of principle to power.
I might think differently about impeachment if Trump had shown any sense of contrition. Or if Republicans had shown any inclination to censure him. But Trump hasn’t, and they haven’t. Whatever the political ramifications of impeachment now, history will judge members of this Congress harshly if they fail to state their revulsion at the president’s behavior in the strongest terms they can. Impeach and convict.

Texto completo: Former Olympic equestrian Michael Barisone, arrested in August after a shooting incident on his Washington Township farm in Morris County, was indicted Wednesday on two counts of attempted murder.
Barisone, 54, a former Sportsman International Horseman of the Year, shot a woman employed and residing at the 53-acre Barisone Dressage Farm in the Long Valley section on Aug. 7, authorities said.
After what police described as a landlord-tenant dispute, Barisone shot Lauren Kanarek twice in the chest with a handgun, records show.
During the incident, Morris County Prosecutor Fredric Knapp said, Barisone also opened fire on a man who was with Kanarek. He missed the man, later identified as Kanarek's fiancé, Robert Goodwin, who tackled Barisone and restrained him until police arrived, according to a source at the scene.
Authorities said Kanarek called 911 at 2:13 p.m. that day and told police, "Michael Barisone shot me."
The indictment includes two counts of first-degree attempted murder and two second-degree counts of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. First-degree attempted murder carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
Kanarek recovered from her critical wounds and is suing Barisone and his company, Sweetgrass Farms. She told The New York Times in October that since the incident, she has been harassed on social media by supporters of Barisone who claim she harassed him and he was acting in self-defense.
Kanarek's lawsuit accuses Barisone and his associates of harassing her and her fiancé repeatedly before their final confrontation.
Kanarek, who was living at the farm with her fiancé, said Barisone, Sweetgrass and barn manager Ruth Cox put her in danger by allowing firearms on the property. The suit seeks unspecified damages for emotional and physical distress.
Kanarek accuses Cox and 10 unnamed possible owners of the black-and-pink 9-millimeter Ruger pistol used in the shooting of failing to prevent her former trainer from getting hold of the weapon.
Barisone was a reserve rider on the 2008 U.S. Olympic dressage team in Beijing. One of his students, Alison Bock, won a bronze medal in the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.
He remains in custody at the Morris County Correctional Facility. Passaic attorney Jeffrey Simms, who represented Barisone at his indictment, said he is no longer representing him. Barisone's current attorney could not be reached.
Anyone with information related to the investigation is asked to call the Morris County Prosecutor's Office Major Crimes Unit at 973-285-6200, or the Washington Township Police Department at 908-876-3232.

North Carolina books to the rescue this holidays

Texto completo: Are there new North Carolina books that would be good holiday presents for hard-to-give-to people on my list? I get that question every year about this time. Answering it gives me a chance to spread the word about the work of our state's diverse authors.
Here are some ideas:
First, consider two books that are battling each other for the top position on The New York Times best-selling fiction list: "Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owens and "The Guardians" by John Grisham. Owens set her book in North Carolina, and although Grisham lives in Charlottesville, Virginia, he spends lots of time here "doing the grandfather thing" with family in Raleigh and Chapel Hill. Because both Owens and Grisham are great storytellers, their books would be good choices for almost any reader.
If the prospective gift recipient is a Grisham fan but has already read "The Guardians," consider "The Substitution Order" by Martin Clark. His complicated literary thriller is built on a multi-million-dollar insurance scam and the broken life of a once highly respected lawyer.
Don't forget our state's master literary fiction authors, Ron Rash and Charles Frazier. Rash's "The Risen" and Frazier's "Varina" gained widespread praise throughout this year for their beautiful language and rich storytelling.
For readers who miss the late Pat Conroy's booming fiction, consider Cassandra King Conroy's "Tell Me a Story: My Life with Pat Conroy."
Two debut authors gained my admiration this year: "A Woman Is No Man" by Etaf Rum and "In West Mills" by De'Shawn Charles Winslow. Rum lives in Rocky Mount, but writes about the Palestinian American community in Brooklyn, New York. Winslow grew up near Elizabeth City and writes about people in a nearby fictional African American community.
For speculative fiction fans, "The Crossing" by Columbus County native Jason Mott takes readers to a future troubled America and the travels of teenaged twins, a sister who remembers everything and her brother who remembers almost nothing.
There is also a wealth of nonfiction related to North Carolina.
"The Secret Token: Myth, Obsession, and the Search for the Lost Colony of Roanoke" by Andrew Lawler is a comprehensive and entertaining review of our state's founding myth and the 350-year-old search for clues about what happened to those lost colonists.
"A Delicious Country: Rediscovering the Carolinas along the Route of John Lawson's 1700 Expedition" by Scott Huler and "The Tuscarora War: Indians, Settlers, and the Fight for the Carolina Colonies" by David La Vere take readers back to the struggles between the early colonists and the natives they displaced.
For a worried supporter of the UNC System, "Fire and Stone: The Making of the University of North Carolina under Presidents Edward Kidder Graham and Harry Woodburn Chase" by Howard Covington shows how UNC struggled to gain support from state government in the early days of the last century.
Finally, a surefire gift for North Carolinians who love their mothers, "Mothers and Strangers: Essays on Motherhood from the New South" edited by Lee Smith and Samia Serageldin.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A group of conservative critics of President Donald Trump – including the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, George Conway – have launched a political action committee aimed at stopping his reelection.
The group includes conservative attorney Conway; former adviser to Sen. John McCain Steve Schmidt; former Ohio Gov. John Kasich adviser John Weaver; former New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn; and conservative pundit Rick Wilson.
"Patriotism and the survival of our nation in the face of the crimes, corruption and corrosive nature of Donald Trump are a higher calling than mere politics," Conway, Schmidt, Weaver and Wilson wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times that ran Tuesday. "As Americans, we must stem the damage he and his followers are doing to the rule of law, the Constitution and the American character. "
In the op-ed, they announced the founding of the Lincoln Project, a super PAC that "will be dedicated to defeating President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box and to elect those patriots who will hold the line.
"We do not undertake this task lightly, nor from ideological preference. We have been, and remain, broadly conservative (or classically liberal) in our politics and outlooks. Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort. "
A filing with the Federal Election Commission showed the form to launch a super PAC called Rough Riders for America was filed on Nov. 5. A month later, an amendment was filed to change the group's name to the Lincoln Project.
Though many conservatives have spoken out against Trump since his 2016 victory, few have taken their opposition beyond critical editorials or social media attacks.

Political strategist Reed Galen, who is listed as the group's treasurer, told the Associated Press that the launch of the Lincoln Project represented a "shift from talk into action. " He called it a "big turning point for the political season and for the president’s reelection. "
Weaver told AP that the group plans to focus on winning over Republicans who are wary of Trump in battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina. They also plan to work against Senate Republicans who have supported Trump, such as Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona.
The group said Trump's "actions are possible only with the craven acquiescence of congressional Republicans" who they say have "embraced and copied Mr. Trump’s cruelty and defended and even adopted his corruption. "
The Lincoln Project's target voters represent a relatively small segment of the electorate. Trump has enjoyed solid support from Republicans since taking office. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll published Sunday found the president had an 87% favorability rating among registered Republicans voters.
But the Republicans and former GOP members behind the super PAC say Trump's supporters in the party have "abandoned conservatism and longstanding Republican principles and replaced it with Trumpism, an empty faith led by a bogus prophet. "
"Mr. Trump and his fellow travelers daily undermine the proposition we as a people have a responsibility and an obligation to continually bend the arc of history toward justice," they said. "They mock our belief in America as something more meaningful than lines on a map.
"Our peril far outstrips any past differences: It has arrived at our collective doorstep, and we believe there is no other choice. "

Texto completo: Thanks for memories
of Maryland nuclear
missile base
Thanks to reporter Jon Kelvey on his report on the Nike base in Maryland ("Nukes in the neighborhood: Restoration of Nike missile site near Carroll County continues, years after closure," Dec. 8).
I was stationed in Porter, Indiana (near Chicago and on Lake Michigan) from 1967 to 1970. I was a sentry dog handler and trainer. It brought back a lot of memories.
We used to call the men who worked down underground pit rats. It was a friendly term. We were a close-knit group. B-1-60 was our unit. There were two batteries in Indiana and one right in Chicago.

Misinformation not unique to Trump
or Fox News
David Zurawik's column, "In the age of Trump misinformational chaos" (Dec. 10), places all the blame for misinformation on President Donald Trump, Republicans and Fox News. According to Mr. Zurawik, the only sources of reliable, credible and truthful information are The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, inferring they never lie.
Misinformation in the press and politics is contagious, and no one source of information is immune. So whom do we believe? The answer is subjective which means even David Zurawik is entitled to his opinion, regardless of whether it's true.

Greta is a hero
When did it begin, this naming of generations? Do we thank Tom Brokaw who first labeled the honorable working class and dutiful warriors of the World War II era as "The Greatest Generation?" It's hard to say, but since then we've galvanized "Gen X," "Boomers," "Millenials" and the rest, herding contemporaries into a part of their existence that apparently deserves a label. Luckily, there are breakout examples, rogue members of their ranks who whip up a frenzy for the good of humankind, who deliberately choose to rise above and, with their tireless efforts, typically succeed. Driven by passion and duty, they determine their destiny and often ours as well. Compelled by a need larger than their own, they are the types who refuse the yoke of labels and strive to make us all a part of the whole.
Greta Thunberg is such a rogue ("As Greta says, we should listen to the scientists and push for a zero-carbon economy," Sept. 25).
And thank goodness for that. In a time when political positions are fortified by the Wheaties of divisive language, when atonement for misdeeds becomes subterfuge and, as the adage goes, "a lie travels the world while the truth laces up its shoes," there is Greta facing down the Boomers and everyone else with a world-resonating "How dare you?" While she peers up through the cesspool of trash left behind by those who came before her, she calls for action not attention. And, true to her convictions, she is an example of what she dares to say traveling inconveniently, eating consciously ever mindful of the impact of her actions and her words.
Youth and wisdom are seldom swirled into one cocktail. But Greta shows us this possibility, and then she boldly asks us to drink up like thirsty sailors. And, by God, we should. Sometimes from small voices come huge requests. Adjusting our focus to truly see the world beyond our noses is a big ask now made by a young person carrying the yoke of those her age who recognize this need. It may be unfair to brand generations, but it isn't unfair to brand Greta as the hero that she is.

Adam Jones should be
in Baltimore, not Japan
I think it is a shame that Adam Jones had to go to Japan ("Former Orioles star Adam Jones announces move to Japan: 'It's now time to move on to my next chapter in life,'" Dec. 10). The Orioles should have brought him back. He played hard, did things for the community and was a very good ball player.
While the Orioles are wasting about $15 million a season on Chris Davis, they could have had Adam Jones for about $4 million a year. He would have been like a player-coach for the young players. I guess they are holding it against him for not agreeing to be traded near the end of the 2017 season.
Speaking of Orioles issues, when are they going to lower prices to the games and for MASN, since they will once again be one of the worst teams in the league? Attendance might even drop below 1 million. I fear that the Angelos family will be like Bob Irsay and threaten to move the team due to poor support like Irsay did our Colts after he ruined them and chased away a great fan base. I was a season ticket holder when they left.

Texto completo: "Bombshell" exploded into the awards race last week, leading the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations with four nods, including best ensemble, actress (Charlize Theron) and supporting actress (Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman).
The drama (in theaters now) goes behind the scenes at Fox News in 2016. It chronicles the efforts of a group of women – including on-the-outs host Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and star anchor Megyn Kelly – to expose a culture of misogyny, leading to the ouster of Machiavellian CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women.
Fox News spokesperson Caley Cronin declined to comment on the film to USA TODAY beyond confirming that "Bombshell" producers "never reached out to Fox News during any part of the production. ”
The film was directed by Jay Roach ("Trumbo") and written by Charles Randolph ("The Big Short"), who breaks down what's fact, fiction and somewhere in between.
Is Margot Robbie's character a real person?
Robbie plays an ambitious, wide-eyed staffer named Kayla Pospisil. A lifelong Fox News fanatic and young evangelical ("I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space," she says), Kayla soon catches the eye of Ailes, who promises to promote her to on-air talent in exchange for sexual favors.
Although Kayla is a fictional character, her experiences of harassment are drawn from interviews Randolph and Roach conducted with ex-Fox News staffers (some of whom violated their non-disclosure agreements to speak with filmmakers).
"What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to," Randolph says. The rest is pulled from Randolph's evangelical upbringing. "Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life. "

Is Kate McKinnon's character fictional, too?
The "Saturday Night Live" favorite is a scene-stealer as Kayla's savvy co-worker Jess Carr, a closeted lesbian and liberal who has complicated feelings about working at a network that preaches against her values and lifestyle.
Jess was "all made up," Randolph says. "I wanted to show the bystander narrative. Megyn's story is the story of someone who comes to discover she is complicit by virtue of the institutional norms and her ability to manipulate them in the predation of a younger generation of women. Likewise with Kayla: Her willingness to look the other way creates this dynamic, and she realizes at the end that it affects herself. "
'You could do worse, right?' Megyn Kelly approves of Charlize Theron's 'Bombshell' casting

Did someone actually poison Megyn Kelly?
The film begins with an anxious but steely Megyn en route to moderate the first debate of the Republican primary campaign. She accepts a cup of coffee offered by her driver, only to fall violently ill before the debate is about to begin. Rattled, she later relays the incident to Roger, wondering aloud whether it was nerves or if the man tampered with her drink.
The scene is lifted directly from Kelly's 2016 memoir "Settle for More," although the journalist refuted inferences by the New York Times and others that she was poisoned, tweeting that she contracted a "stomach virus" before the debate. But "Bombshell" leaves the circumstances around her mystery illness intentionally vague.
"Roger said, 'How dare you have a cup of coffee from a guy you don't know. What are you, crazy?' " Randolph says. "Megyn has a good ear for absurdist details. "
Did Roger Ailes consult Rudy Giuliani for legal advice?
"Bombshell" is a who's who of famous faces, including Malcolm McDowell ("A Clockwork Orange") as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal counsel Susan Estrich, and Connie Britton ("Nashville") as Ailes' wife, Beth. Then there's "Mad About You" star Richard Kind, who portrays Ailes' longtime friend and confidante Rudy Giuliani. The embattled Ailes asks the politician/attorney how to handle the fallout of his sexual harassment allegations.
"Ailes had three different lawyers who we let Giuliani stand in for," Randolph says. "It shows the degree in which Roger was one of the drivers of the Republican establishment. If you wanted to be a Republican public intellectual, all avenues went through Roger Ailes' office, and that mattered in terms of his ability to prey on young people who had aspirations. "
Was Ailes really known as 'the legs man'?
The film shows a competitive work environment at Fox News for female anchors and producers, many of whom rarely spoke or befriended each other. (Kelly and Carlson, for instance, only share the screen once in passing in an elevator – true to real life, where they worked different shifts and "almost never interacted," Randolph says. )
"Bombshell" also illustrates Ailes' predatory behavior: asking women to spin in front of him during meetings, and demanding that on-air talent wear short skirts to show off their legs. Such scenes were drawn from Kelly's book, as well as Gabriel Sherman's 2014 Ailes biography "The Loudest Voice in the Room" and Sarah Ellison's 2016 expose for Vanity Fair, Randolph says.
"All the women who filed complaints about him who have gone public have been really brave in articulating specifically what happened to them," Randolph says.
The film's most chilling scene is a private meeting between Ailes and Kayla when he pressures her to lift her skirt. The camera lingers on Kayla, near tears, as he orders her to inch it higher and higher, revealing her underwear. By letting the abuse play out in real time, Randolph hopes male viewers, in particular, will feel uncomfortable but also feel greater empathy for victims.
"When you're in the room and you appreciate the intonations and context of it, you can see how it could be utterly life-changing and maddening and complicated for a young woman,' " Randolph says.

Texto completo: PORT CLINTON – A Catawba Island beagle named Oscar is one of the dogs featured in the book "Doctor Dogs" by New York Times bestselling author Maria Goodavage
The book highlights medical alert dogs from around the world. Oscar was abandoned by his previous owner before Deanne "DeeDee" Kramer and her late husband, Bill, adopted him as a walking companion. But Oscar did more than become a walking buddy. He saved their lives.
Bill was struggling with complications from diabetes, which kept sending him to the emergency room several times a month. Finally, his doctor told him he needed to get a dog to help him become more active.
"We couldn't handle a lab," DeeDee said. "And then we heard about Oscar."
Oscar's first rescue came before he had any training. When Bill collapsed from a heart attack, Oscar, barking, ran to DeeDee to let her know. The incident exposed Oscar's intelligence and potential, and the Kramers decided to see if he could be trained as a diabetic alert dog to alert Bill when his blood sugar levels changed. Their search for a trainer eventually brought them to Nick and Tammy Blackford of North Coast K-9, who have offices in Sandusky and Monroeville. Nick, who has been training dogs since 1974, has trained many of the area's police dogs.
Oscar excelled through 500 hours of training, which included Canine Good Citizen, therapy dog, and public access training. His training to detect blood sugar level changes was intensive.
"He had to pass three tests before he could even start scent training," DeeDee said. "It's no different than training a drug dog, because it's all about smell."
To prepare for the training, Bill spit on cotton balls when his sugar was high and when his sugar was low. Nick placed those cotton balls, along with other cotton balls, in containers around the training facility. When Oscar found the right cotton ball, he was rewarded.
As a result, Oscar was able to detect when Bill's sugar changed. If it was high, he pawed on Bill's knees. If it was low, he pushed his nose into Bill's face.
"He was 10 minutes faster than the meter," DeeDee said. "After Oscar got trained, Bill had zero emergency room visits."
After Bill died, DeeDee's mourning kept her from caring for herself the way she normally did, and her hypoglycemia began to worsen. Now, Oscar alerts her when her blood sugar reaches dangerous levels.
"If I'm driving, he'll come from the back of the car and make me pull over," DeeDee said.
Dogs can be trained to respond to medical emergencies in a variety of ways that suit their owners' needs.
"Some are trained to bark so if the person is in another room with the door shut, the dog can still alert them," Nick said.
In addition to helping the Kramers, Oscar detected cancer in DeeDee's friend. The story of that miraculous rescue is recorded in "Doctor Dogs."
"He wasn't even trained for that," DeeDee said.
Oscar also accompanies DeeDee when she volunteers at the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky each week. He not only spreads love while he's there, but he also detects blood sugar levels in the veterans he visits.
DeeDee said it's not unusual for beagles to be trained as alert dogs because their ability to smell is so acute.
"Basset hounds are good, too," she said. "But if you want a diabetic alert dog, go to trainer, and they will find one suited to you. Don't just go out and get a puppy."

While Oscar's big eyes can melt hearts, his nose can save lives. Even though he was trained as a diabetic alert dog, he detected cancer in his owner's friend.

The '1619 Project' Gets Schooled

Texto completo: 'So wrong in so many ways" is how Gordon Wood, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the American Revolution, characterized the New York Times's "1619 Project." James McPherson, dean of Civil War historians and another Pulitzer winner, said the Times presented an "unbalanced, one-sided account" that "left most of the history out." Even more surprising than the criticism from these generally liberal historians was where the interviews appeared: on the World Socialist Web Site, run by the Trotskyist Socialist Equality Party.
The "1619 Project" was launched in August with a 100-page spread in the Times's Sunday magazine. It intends to "reframe the country's history" by crossing out 1776 as America's founding date and substituting 1619, the year 20 or so African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Va. The project has been celebrated up and down the liberal establishment, praised by Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
A September essay for the World Socialist Web Site called the project a "racialist falsification" of history. That didn't get much attention, but in November the interviews with the historians went viral. "I wish my books would have this kind of reaction," Mr. Wood says in an email. "It still strikes me as amazing why the NY Times would put its authority behind a project that has such weak scholarly support." He adds that fellow historians have privately expressed their agreement. Mr. McPherson coolly describes the project's "implicit position that there have never been any good white people, thereby ignoring white radicals and even liberals who have supported racial equality."
The project's creator, Nikole Hannah-Jones, is proud that it "decenters whiteness" and disdains its critics as "old, white male historians." She tweeted of Mr. McPherson: "Who considers him preeminent? I don't." Her own qualifications are an undergraduate degree in history and African-American studies and a master's in journalism. She says the project goes beyond Mr. McPherson's expertise, the Civil War. "For the most part," she writes in its lead essay, "black Americans fought back alone" against racism. No wonder she'd rather not talk about the Civil War.
To the Trotskyists, Ms. Hannah-Jones writes: "You all have truly revealed yourselves for the anti-black folks you really are." She calls them "white men claiming to be socialists." Perhaps they're guilty of being white men, but they're definitely socialists. Their faction, called the Workers League until 1995, was "one of the most strident and rigid Marxist groups in America" during the Cold War, says Harvey Klehr, a leading historian of American communism.
"Ours is not a patriotic, flag-waving kind of perspective," says Thomas Mackaman, the World Socialist Web Site's interviewer and a history professor at King's College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. He simply recognizes that the arrival of 20 slaves in 1619 wasn't a "world-altering event." Slavery had existed across the world for millennia, and there were already slaves elsewhere in what would become the U.S. before 1619.
But "even if you want to make slavery the central story of American history," he says, the Times gets it backward. The American Revolution didn't found a "slavocracy," as Ms. Hannah-Jones puts it. Instead, in Mr. Mackaman's telling, it "brought slavery in for questioning in a way that had never been done before" by "raising universal human equality as a fundamental principle." Nor was protecting slavery "one of the primary reasons" the colonists declared independence, as Ms. Hannah-Jones claims. It's no coincidence the abolitionists rapidly won votes to end slavery in five of the original 13 states, along with Vermont and the new states of the Midwest.
Ms. Hannah-Jones insists "anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country." Mr. Mackaman calls that claim "anti-historical." Proving it requires her to belittle the most progressive declaration of modern history: "that all men are created equal." Ms. Hannah-Jones calls this a "lie" and claims its drafters didn't even believe it. The abolitionists disagreed. So did Martin Luther King Jr: He saw it as a "promissory note."
Mr. Mackaman also protests Ms. Hannah-Jones's "cherry-picking" of quotes to present Lincoln as a "garden-variety racist." He attributes the misleading picture to her "totally racialist interpretation." If whites and blacks are supposed to be "diametrically opposed to each other," he says, "then you have to disregard all the history that runs contrary to that -- and there's an awful lot."
Other "1619 Project" essays are similarly tendentious. Sociologist Matthew Desmond marshals substantially discredited research to tar the whole of American capitalism as a legacy of slavery. Legal activist Bryan Stevenson presents the war on drugs and broken-windows policing as successors to lynching, the Black Codes and other white "strategies of racial control." Times columnist Jamelle Bouie claims Republican opposition to raising the debt ceiling in 2011 was of a piece with Southern defenses of slavery and Jim Crow.
Joseph Kishore, the Socialist Equality Party's national secretary, says the "1619 Project" is aimed at legitimizing the politics of the Democratic Party and at "dividing workers" by race. "The interests of a black worker on the line in an auto plant and a white worker," he says, "are fundamentally the same, and a million miles from the interests of an Oprah Winfrey or a Hillary Clinton." He rejects the "pseudo-left politics" of identity, which "fight out conflicts within the top 10% or so over access to positions of power and privilege" through diversity programs, then "denounce white workers for being supposedly privileged even as they suffer from a decline in life expectancy and horrific social conditions." Nobody is better at deflating the pretensions of progressives than the Left Opposition.
To be sure, the Trotskyists have wild ideas of their own: The World Socialist Web Site's September essay claims "the event that had the greatest impact on the social condition of African-Americans" was the Russian Revolution. But the Times's equally extreme ideas are being feted by the intelligentsia and turned into lesson plans for schoolteachers. "A re-education is necessary," the "1619 Project" webpage warns. Even communists now tell the Times to cool it.

Alexander: What if the Raiders had gotten first shot at L.A.?

Texto completo: The thought first occurred to me five weeks ago, while watching the Oakland Raiders’ pass rush treat Philip Rivers like one of those inflatable pop-up dolls – you know, you keep knocking it down, and it keeps bouncing right back up – on the field at whatever they’re calling the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum these days.
It continued to nag at me during all of these weeks the Chargers have been on the road. It kept coming to mind Sunday, when they returned home to play before what would be conservatively estimated as 70 percent Minnesota Vikings fans, at the same time the Raiders were making their own melancholy farewell appearance in Oakland.
Today then, a few days before the Raiders and a chunk of their immense SoCal fan base play the Chargers in Carson, it’s time for some alternate history.
What would have happened, at that fateful NFL league meeting in January 2016 when Stan Kroenke’s fellow owners approved the Rams’ move to L.A. and his Inglewood stadium project, if those owners had given the Raiders the first option to become Kroenke’s tenant, rather than the Chargers?
We start this musing with an opinion that I’d maintained throughout the two decades of the league’s absence from L.A., when the city was no more than a stalking horse for other owners seeking stadium deals in their own cities: If and when a team finally set up shop here, it would have to deal with that huge segment of fans who refused to abandon the Silver and Black even after Al Davis moved the Raiders back to their ancestral home in 1995.
Those are the people you’ve seen in the Southwest Airlines terminals of area airports on Saturdays (or Sunday mornings) of Raiders home game weekends the last 25 seasons, flying up to the games and flying back afterward. Some are clad in their Black Hole costumes, and I’m guessing TSA employees have to remind themselves: These aren’t security risks, these are Raider fans.
(Feel free to insert your own one-liner here.)
Their commutes will be shorter beginning next season when the Raiders move into the $2 billion Allegiant Stadium near the Las Vegas strip.
But stay with me here: What if the Raiders had wound up in L.A. … and the Chargers had wound up in Vegas, a virgin territory with no previous NFL allegiances beyond monetary ones? It’s not that far-fetched.
From the Raiders’ standpoint, I’m guessing they would have found an immediate home somewhere in SoCal. Probably not the Coliseum, likely not the Rose Bowl, but possibly Dodger or Angel Stadium as a short-term abode. They would have had no trouble filling it with their own loyal (and eccentrically costumed) fans, while the Rams would still have been able to rebuild their SoCal fan base in much the same manner they have. There would be less snark about L.A. as an NFL town, and when the Inglewood stadium was ready the new occupants would be on relatively equal footing.
(You think the Raiders aren’t still strong here? There are still Raider Image stores at Universal Citywalk and in Moreno Valley, and the team’s fan club directory lists nine different booster clubs in SoCal, from Fillmore to Hesperia and including two in San Diego.)
But what of the Chargers?
Before I continue, I am fully aware that this column will likely draw a call or a text from the Chargers’ sharp vice president of public relations, Josh Rupprecht, asking what his franchise did to deserve this, and is it really a bad thing that the Chargers are here? We realize this is considered a long-term project to build a fan base. But three years in, you have to wonder if this market – the most diverse, and fickle, in North America – just might be too tough to crack.
Certainly, people in the NFL offices in New York are noticing. And the reports of friction between the Chargers and Rams involving the new stadium, now a $5 billion (and rising) project, don’t help the optics.
The Las Vegas component will not thrill our friends in San Diego, but consider the history of these moves.
When Mark Davis and the Raiders romanced Las Vegas early in 2016, no more than a couple of weeks after (a) their joint project with the Chargers on a new Carson stadium was shot down and (b) the Chargers got the first option to join Kroenke’s project with a year to exercise it, the man who arranged the Raiders-Vegas talks was Mark Fabiani. That is the same Fabiani who is still listed in the Chargers’ organizational chart as a special counsel to controlling owner Dean Spanos, and the same Fabiani who was in charge of the team’s stadium quest in San Diego.
Also, in many eyes – including these two – it’s the same Fabiani who torpedoed any chance of cooperation between Spanos’ organization and the politicians of San Diego with an uncompromising, hardball negotiating style that ultimately led to a total breakdown of relationships with city officials and the fans themselves. The moment the Chargers began openly seeking other alternatives was the moment the San Diego public began to turn away from Spanos and his team.
Fabiani later signed on as an advisor to Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and it was through that relationship that Mark Davis was introduced to Adelson and the wheels began to turn toward the Raiders’ move to Nevada.
So, in our alternate history, it is entirely reasonable that having been shut out of L.A., Spanos turns his attention north on I-15, with Fabiani smoothing the way for the Chargers in the same way he made things happen for the Raiders.
Those bridge years might still have been spent in San Diego, and it’s possible the composition of crowds in that city would resemble what they are now in Carson. But Las Vegas would ultimately have been a far more hospitable destination for the Chargers, as a one-team town hungry for football. Spanos would have been a hero, rather than an interloper (as he’s considered by many in L.A.) or villain (in San Diego).
Plus it’s a lot closer than London, where reports earlier this season had the Chargers ultimately landing followed by Spanos’ vehement denial.
Instead, back in the real world, this is what we have: Minnesota Vikings fans dominating Dignity Health Sports Park this past Sunday, just like Green Bay Packers fans before them, and Pittsburgh Steelers fans, Denver Broncos fans, Houston Texans fans and Indianapolis Colts fans before that in 2019. It has to be discouraging for players and coaches who never get to play before a true home crowd.
The move to the bigger SoFi Stadium will not be a panacea – it’s more seats available for opposition fans, if anything – and while there will be an attempt to put the teams on equal footing in the shared stadium, it will be hard to forget that Kroenke is the owner and Spanos is the renter.
Meanwhile, SoCal Raiders fans will continue to flock to LAX, Burbank, Ontario, Long Beach and John Wayne airports to catch flights for their favorite team’s home games, or else will make the drive up I-15. As colleague Mark Whicker once observed, it’ll be like eight more championship fights a year in ‘Vegas.
An example: The New York Times quoted Ruben Maya, a law enforcement officer from Riverside who paid $12,000 for two personal seat licenses and $3,000 for 2020 season tickets for Raiders games in Vegas: “I live a six-hour drive from Oakland, but it’s only a 3-1/2 hour drive to Las Vegas. I’m going to come to every home game the first season.”
And, as has been the case for years, the Raiders’ ninth home game will come on the Chargers’ home field. There will be a preview Sunday afternoon.

Texto completo: Washington • It was, all in all, a fine week for Donald Trump.
Sure, he’s getting impeached. And he is agitated about that, judging by his fandango of self-pitying tweets. And he did lose out to a 16-year-old girl for Time’s Person of the Year, which made him so jealous he couldn’t resist mocking her, amplifying just how big a loser he is.
But on a scale of one to prison, it wasn’t a bad week. His disheveled pal, Boris Johnson, won in a landslide over an unappetizing liberal, which many took as a good harbinger for Trump in 2020.
On the Hill, the party of Faust stuck together and vociferously defended their Apollyon. The most twisted defense was offered by Ken Buck, a Colorado Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, who said that it doesn’t make sense to impeach the president for obstructing Congress because “we were sent here to obstruct this Congress.” It was “a campaign promise.”
Even as Democrats declaimed that their hearings were momentous, many deemed them monotonous. The evening news broadcasts demoted impeachment to their No. 4 story, and no one seemed to move a scintilla in either direction.
I’ve often wondered if Trump was even worthy of impeachment. And now it seems as if he is degrading this process just as he degrades everything else.
As Carl Hulse wrote in The New York Times, “fears are mounting that presidential impeachment might, like the filibuster, become a regular feature of America’s weaponized politics.”
Trump is pretending that his pressure on Ukraine’s president was about fighting corruption when we all know that he fosters corruption. He sins in the saintliest areas. It was just announced that he had to pay $2 million to eight charities after admitting that he diverted funds from his foundation to his campaign and to cover business debts.
We see a constant parade of Washington pooh-bahs like James Comey, Andrew McCabe and John Brennan on cable, sounding the alarm and presenting themselves as the white hats to Trump’s black hat. Retired generals grimace at the president’s impetuous, ego-driven foreign policy.
The left keens that the president is destroying our sacred institutions and jeopardizing our national security. But for many Americans, the events of the last week prove that Trump is right to be cynical about a rigged system and deep-state elites.
The inspector general’s report about the FBI’s Russia investigation offered a hideous Dorian Gray portrait of the once-vaunted law enforcement agency. As Charlie Savage wrote in the Times, the report uncovered “a staggeringly dysfunctional and error-ridden process.” The FBI run by Comey and McCabe was sloppy, deceitful and cherry-picking — relying on nonsense spread by Christopher Steele.
With the stunning and sad “Afghanistan Papers,” The Washington Post revealed what we knew in our hearts: We have spent 18 years and $1 trillion in Afghanistan with generals lying and hiding evidence that the war was unwinnable, just as the generals did in Vietnam. As one general conceded, they did not understand Afghanistan and didn’t have “the foggiest notion” of what they were doing.
Even as President Barack Obama escalated the war, poured in more billions and promised to crack down on corruption, the Post said, the United States looked away and let its allies — the Afghan president, warlords, drug traffickers and defense contractors — wallow in fraud, corruption and dark money.
Then there’s “The Report,” streaming on Amazon: the heroic saga of Daniel Jones, played by Adam Driver. Jones is working for Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Intelligence Committee and spends years compiling a report documenting the CIA’s use of waterboarding and other forms of torture in secret prisons — a barbaric, un-American and ineffective system designed by two creepy psychologists who were paid about $81 million by the CIA.
The movie is not kind to Obama and Denis McDonough, suggesting that they protected the CIA and tried to bury grisly details from the report to fend off criticism that Obama was weak on terrorism. It is also a harsh portrayal of Brennan, MSNBC’s Voice of Morality, who, as CIA director, fought the Senate inquiry so hard that his operatives even clandestinely hacked into the computer network of committee staff members to figure out how they were getting their information.
If this weren’t enough institutional perfidy for one week, we had the Boeing hearing in Congress: A Federal Aviation Administration analysis done after the first deadly crash off the coast of Indonesia showed that the agency knew that if it did not act, the Boeing 737 Max was likely to crash 15 times in the 45 years it was expected to fly, theoretically killing more than 2,900 people. But that wasn’t enough to immediately ground it. The government is supposed to protect us from greedy capitalists, not the other way around.
Unfortunately, this climate of confusion and cynicism allows Trump to prosper. He did not come to Washington to clean up the tainted system; he came to bathe in it.

Own skin in the game

Texto completo: Ben Hanson eagerly got his basement studio ready for one of his weekly gaming podcasts with his friends.
He checked the microphones and the lights, switched on the retro Nintendo 64 so Pokmon battle scenes could play in the background, and made sure the fake fireplace was ablaze to look like some sort of PlayStation shrine complete with a golden controller and mini cartoon figurines along its mantle.
Hanson, along with other former employees who recently left the popular Game Informer magazine, have recently launched their own website, MinnMax. The website, which is completely crowdfunded, offers weekly video podcasts on game industry news, reviews and guest interviews providing an entertaining outlet for serious -- and sometimes not so serious -- discussion of the gaming industry.
"We love games," Hanson said simply, last week after MinnMax hosted its first community meetup.
Hanson, 32, had worked at Game Informer since 2010 as a video producer and helped create videos and podcasts including "The Game Informer Show," for which Hanson was able to travel the world to interview game developers and report on other industry news.
Game Informer, which launched in 1991, has more than 6.5 million paid monthly subscribers and has grown to become the fifth largest consumer print publication in the United States and the largest digital publication in the world, according to its official website. In comparison, the New York Times recently reached paid digital and print subscriptions of 4.7 million.
But in August, as part of parent company GameStop's restructuring, 120 employees across the video game retailer's offices were laid off, including seven of the 38 employed at Minneapolis-based Game Informer. Dallas-area-based GameStop, which has seen its stock drop nearly 70% this year, said in a statement that the changes "were necessary to reduce costs and better align the organization with our efforts to optimize the business."
Andy McNamara, the Game Informer editor-in-chief who has been with the magazine since it launched, wrote in an online post, "I'm saddened by yesterday's news; the Game Informer team means the world to me. You, our readers who have supported us over the years -- mean the world to us. I can't thank them or you enough."
While Hanson avoided the ax, some of his friends and co-workers, including Kyle Hilliard, Jeff Marchiafava, and Suriel Vazquez, weren't as lucky.
"It was very abrupt," Hanson said. "It was a lighting strike out of the blue. … I left because of the manner of which they were laid off."
Hanson, who had helped build Game Informer's studio, said he thought he could build a similar studio on a budget in the basement of the duplex he rents in northeast Minneapolis. He spent the last few months slowly buying microphones, cameras and other technology he needed to equip a spare room in his basement.
He officially left Game Informer and launched MinnMax in late October.
To finance MinnMax, a reference to the gaming term "Min Max" that means to optimize your improvement and get better in the most efficient way possible, Hanson went straight to the gaming community and asked for support on the crowdfunding site Patreon.
Hanson said he estimated that if MinnMax could earn about $4,000 a month it would be sustainable and he could work as the website's full-time video producer and pay his former co-workers and other contributors as contractors.
After launching Oct. 24, MinnMax has attracted more than 1,800 patrons or monthly paid subscribers who contribute close to $10,500 total per month. Donor tiers range from $2 a month -- to be able to submit questions to the MinnMax Show podcast and get access to other exclusives -- to $750 a month for plugs of the donor's or company's name with a message. There's even a tier to allow for an hour of online game play with a MinnMax contributor.
"The community just blew me away with the level of support," Hanson said.
"Thanks for taking the courage to quit Game Informer and start this thing, Ben! I'm sure it's scary, but it's awesome. To hear the four of y'all again is the best," one supporter posted on one of Hanson's Patreon posts. "This feels like being reunited with old friends," another commenter said. "I was shocked to hear that Hanson was leaving the [Game Informer] Show but this is probably the best outcome I could imagine," another wrote.
In the future, MinnMax could consider having corporate sponsors, though the funding being decentralized has allowed MinnMax contributors to enjoy a lot of freedom in what they create, Hanson said. More money would allow Hanson to travel to interview game developers and improve the studio.
MinnMax has a regular weekly lineup of videos including Q&As with interesting figures throughout the gaming industry, gameplay streams and walk-throughs, the flagship MinnMax Show, bonus videos such as reactions to games and, recently launched as an idea from members, MinnSnax, a food review show that will include discussions on Twin Cities eateries. Besides video games, contributors also have begun to discuss traditional board games.
MinnMax helps showcase the gaming industry that exists in Minnesota, which is home to several video and tabletop gaming companies and professional e-sports teams and is the birthplace of one of the most well-known computer games, Oregon Trail, Hanson said.
"There's a lot of really talented voices in the area; we just need somebody to pull them in," Hanson said.
Emily Reese, who has her own podcast about video game music and also hosts a morning show on Jazz 88 FM, has been a guest on MinnMax.
"It's just nice to have that highlight here [in Minnesota]," Reese said. "I think it's cool. Super cool."
Vazquez said he is happy to be involved in MinnMax after he lost his job at Game Informer.
"It's nice to have that outlet to be able to have a voice in the conversation about games and stuff. … It was inspiring to have people say, 'Hey, we miss you on the show,' " he said.
Since being let go, Vazquez, 27, has been doing contract work as well as writing reviews and features and search-engine optimization consultation.
Last week, MinnMax had its first event, a Super Smash Bros. tournament it hosted at Minneapolis brewery Bauhaus Brew Labs. MinnMax also collected toys for children hospitalized at HCMC. About 70 people attended and MinnMax was also able to collect about $3,400 online so far for toys.
To Hanson, the support of the community and the freedom to lead his own website has been amazing.
Hanson, who grew up in New London, Minn., graduated in 2009 from the University of Minnesota with a double major in cinema and media culture and cultural studies and comparative literature with a minor in art before he worked for a community television station and Game Informer.
"Having complete freedom … being able to steer this ship is so refreshing," he said.

The '1619 Project' Gets Schooled; The New York Times tries to rewrite U.S. history, but its falsehoods are exposed by surprising sources.

Texto completo: 'So wrong in so many ways" is how Gordon Wood, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the American Revolution, characterized the New York Times's "1619 Project." James McPherson, dean of Civil War historians and another Pulitzer winner, said the Times presented an "unbalanced, one-sided account" that "left most of the history out." Even more surprising than the criticism from these generally liberal historians was where the interviews appeared: on the World Socialist Web Site, run by the Trotskyist Socialist Equality Party.
The "1619 Project" was launched in August with a 100-page spread in the Times's Sunday magazine. It intends to "reframe the country's history" by crossing out 1776 as America's founding date and substituting 1619, the year 20 or so African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Va. The project has been celebrated up and down the liberal establishment, praised by Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
A September essay for the World Socialist Web Site called the project a "racialist falsification" of history. That didn't get much attention, but in November the interviews with the historians went viral. "I wish my books would have this kind of reaction," Mr. Wood says in an email. "It still strikes me as amazing why the NY Times would put its authority behind a project that has such weak scholarly support." He adds that fellow historians have privately expressed their agreement. Mr. McPherson coolly describes the project's "implicit position that there have never been any good white people, thereby ignoring white radicals and even liberals who have supported racial equality."
The project's creator, Nikole Hannah-Jones, is proud that it "decenters whiteness" and disdains its critics as "old, white male historians." She tweeted of Mr. McPherson: "Who considers him preeminent? I don't." Her own qualifications are an undergraduate degree in history and African-American studies and a master's in journalism. She says the project goes beyond Mr. McPherson's expertise, the Civil War. "For the most part," she writes in its lead essay, "black Americans fought back alone" against racism. No wonder she'd rather not talk about the Civil War.
To the Trotskyists, Ms. Hannah-Jones writes: "You all have truly revealed yourselves for the anti-black folks you really are." She calls them "white men claiming to be socialists." Perhaps they're guilty of being white men, but they're definitely socialists. Their faction, called the Workers League until 1995, was "one of the most strident and rigid Marxist groups in America" during the Cold War, says Harvey Klehr, a leading historian of American communism.
"Ours is not a patriotic, flag-waving kind of perspective," says Thomas Mackaman, the World Socialist Web Site's interviewer and a history professor at King's College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. He simply recognizes that the arrival of 20 slaves in 1619 wasn't a "world-altering event." Slavery had existed across the world for millennia, and there were already slaves elsewhere in what would become the U.S. before 1619.
But "even if you want to make slavery the central story of American history," he says, the Times gets it backward. The American Revolution didn't found a "slavocracy," as Ms. Hannah-Jones puts it. Instead, in Mr. Mackaman's telling, it "brought slavery in for questioning in a way that had never been done before" by "raising universal human equality as a fundamental principle." Nor was protecting slavery "one of the primary reasons" the colonists declared independence, as Ms. Hannah-Jones claims. It's no coincidence the abolitionists rapidly won votes to end slavery in five of the original 13 states, along with Vermont and the new states of the Midwest.
Ms. Hannah-Jones insists "anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country." Mr. Mackaman calls that claim "anti-historical." Proving it requires her to belittle the most progressive declaration of modern history: "that all men are created equal." Ms. Hannah-Jones calls this a "lie" and claims its drafters didn't even believe it. The abolitionists disagreed. So did Martin Luther King Jr: He saw it as a "promissory note."
Mr. Mackaman also protests Ms. Hannah-Jones's "cherry-picking" of quotes to present Lincoln as a "garden-variety racist." He attributes the misleading picture to her "totally racialist interpretation." If whites and blacks are supposed to be "diametrically opposed to each other," he says, "then you have to disregard all the history that runs contrary to that—and there's an awful lot."
Other "1619 Project" essays are similarly tendentious. Sociologist Matthew Desmond marshals substantially discredited research to tar the whole of American capitalism as a legacy of slavery. Legal activist Bryan Stevenson presents the war on drugs and broken-windows policing as successors to lynching, the Black Codes and other white "strategies of racial control." Times columnist Jamelle Bouie claims Republican opposition to raising the debt ceiling in 2011 was of a piece with Southern defenses of slavery and Jim Crow.
Joseph Kishore, the Socialist Equality Party's national secretary, says the "1619 Project" is aimed at legitimizing the politics of the Democratic Party and at "dividing workers" by race. "The interests of a black worker on the line in an auto plant and a white worker," he says, "are fundamentally the same, and a million miles from the interests of an Oprah Winfrey or a Hillary Clinton." He rejects the "pseudo-left politics" of identity, which "fight out conflicts within the top 10% or so over access to positions of power and privilege" through diversity programs, then "denounce white workers for being supposedly privileged even as they suffer from a decline in life expectancy and horrific social conditions." Nobody is better at deflating the pretensions of progressives than the Left Opposition.
To be sure, the Trotskyists have wild ideas of their own: The World Socialist Web Site's September essay claims "the event that had the greatest impact on the social condition of African-Americans" was the Russian Revolution. But the Times's equally extreme ideas are being feted by the intelligentsia and turned into lesson plans for schoolteachers. "A re-education is necessary," the "1619 Project" webpage warns. Even communists now tell the Times to cool it.

Texto completo: "There's a boatload of legislators who are all outraged right now who sure advocated the crap out of me for the last four years, including some of the loudest ones."
Matt Bevin Former governor
A defiant Matt Bevin says he would welcome a federal investigation into the controversial last-minute pardons and commutations he issued before leaving the governor's office last week, adding he is convinced that some he pardoned of crimes, including brutal murder, rape and child abuse, are innocent.
"This is going to be very cathartic," Bevin told The Courier Journal Saturday night.
"There's nothing more antiseptic than the truth. And the truth is something that needs to be shined into some corners of the criminal justice system, in this state and in this country."
Bevin even suggested that some of the county prosecutors who are the fiercest critics of his pardons may end up as the ones investigated and prosecuted if federal investigators get involved.
"You will see people subpoenaed, you will see people deposed, you will see people convicted," he predicted.
"If the truth comes out, there will be people involved in this process on the other side of the equation that have very good reason to be very concerned right now. And some of them are the loudest people right now, and for good reason."
Squarely in Bevin's sights are state legislators and prosecutors — including Republican Senate President Robert Stivers — who have called on commonwealth and federal law enforcement to investigate some of his more controversial pardons and commutations.
In his interview with The Courier Journal, the one-term Republican governor insinuated his critics are grandstanding for political gain.
"There's a boatload of legislators who are all outraged right now who sure advocated the crap out of me for the last four years, including some of the loudest ones," Bevin said. "Political opportunism is an interesting thing."
The Courier Journal was the first to reveal the political connections related to one of Bevin's most controversial decisions: Pardoning Patrick Baker two years into his 19-year sentence for killing Donald Mills in a Knox County home invasion and robbery.
In the weekend interview, Bevin initially claimed several times that he didn't know and couldn't remember ever meeting or speaking to Patrick Baker's brother, Eric, who held a campaign fundraiser for Bevin at his Corbin home last year that raised $21,500, state public records show.
The Courier Journal last week reported on Bevin's attendance at the July 26, 2018, fundraiser — including publishing a front-page photo of Bevin and Eric Baker talking at Baker's home. The Courier Journal story included a first-hand account from the publisher of the Corbin newspaper of Bevin having a private meeting with the Baker family.
Asked about the fundraiser again, the former governor then conceded he had spoken to Eric Baker before, "But I don't know if I've spoken to him about this."
Bevin added that he could not remember ever being at the Bakers' home.
The former governor also insisted Baker is an innocent man — despite the outcry over Patrick Baker's pardon from Mills' family, the local prosecutor in the case and those questioning if the political donations played a role.
The real killer, Bevin said, hasn't been fully brought to justice.
"I looked at (the Patrick Baker case) for months and months," said Bevin, adding he had "a lot of conversations" with people about the circumstances of Mills' murder and Baker's trial.
"If you truly care about the truth of that story, among others, stay with it, stay on it, ask a lot of questions," Bevin said. "You'll find a lot of people both inside and outside of Kentucky are very aware of that case."
Bevin questioned testimony in the case from Mills' family members who witnessed the murder, saying the testimony suggested the killer had specific physical characteristics different than that of Patrick Baker.
"The way in which these things have gone down has been a remarkable miscarriage of justice," Bevin said.
"There is little that can be done given the existing criminal justice system to undo that which is wrong. There is an appeals process, but it is almost impossible — not just in Kentucky, but in America — for an innocent person, ever, no matter how existent exonerating information is, to get anybody to overturn something that's incorrect."
Defending other pardons Bevin also defended his pardon of Micah Schoettle, who was convicted of raping a 9-year-old in Kenton County last year and sentenced to 23 years.
Bevin claimed Schoettle is completely innocent because there is no physical, medical or eyewitness evidence against him, adding that "not everything that you are told is true, including in a courtroom."
"Go sit down, talk to (Schoettle), talk to the other people involved, talk to the mother of the daughter, who was involved in the accusation," Bevin said. "You dig into that thing and find out what did or didn't happen."
The mother of the victim in the Schoettle case recounted to the New York Times her outrage when learning about the pardon, saying her family had only recently begun to recover from the trial and "it scares me to think that he knows he got away with it."
Bevin's pardon order for Schoettle stated the case "was investigated and prosecuted in a manner that was sloppy at best."
However, Bevin repeatedly disputed that he cited prosecutorial misconduct in this pardon or any of the other hundreds he issued in his final days, saying "that's something either you're making up or someone's making up."
Bevin responds to Stivers Shortly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday called Bevin's pardons "completely inappropriate," Stivers, the Republican president of the state Senate, called for a federal investigation of Bevin's pardons.
"From what we know of former Gov. Bevin's extreme pardons and commutations, the Senate Republican Majority condemns his actions as a travesty and perversion of justice," Stivers said in a press release.
"Our citizens, and especially the crime victims and their families, deserve better."
Asked about the comments from McConnell and Stivers, Bevin said his two Republican critics did not provide any specifics about what wrongdoing he was guilty of, adding that such "broad categorizations make for good press releases, make for good tabloid fodder."
"People like that, they'll never give you specifics," Bevin said. "He'll express outrage, but over what? Specifically, what is the outrage based on?"
Asked about Bevin's comments, Stivers on Sunday stood by his concerns and call for a federal investigation, particularly the circumstances surrounding the pardon of Patrick Baker.
"It has an appearance that calls for individuals to look into the case," said Stivers, citing the overwhelming evidence in the case, "the photos you've seen" of Bevin and Patrick Baker at the campaign fundraiser and "the inconsistencies in the pardons of one but not all three," as two accomplices in the crime are still in jail.
Bevin strongly denied that families of inmates who got meetings or special access to the former governor got preferential treatment.
"People can agree with me, disagree with me, like me, not like me," Bevin said. "I have never in four years done anything based on a political or financial calculation. Never. It's just not how I operate."
Bevin's pardon process In the Courier Journal interview, Bevin said he alone went through all of the pardon and commutation applications and made the determinations of who was worthy of one, writing all of the orders himself.
He added he would also ask for feedback on certain cases from public advocates and officials in the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet.
The former governor said he would listen to cases for pardons made by anyone, including legislators, people on this team and "people who might come up to me at a Lincoln Day dinner and say, 'Hey, you know, what about this, that or the other person.'"
"I'll listen to anybody," Bevin said. "Believe me, I talked to people out the wazoo. I'll take anyone's opinion on something."
Bevin also said he had "absolute confidence" that everyone he pardoned would not have a serious future run-in with the law.
"I can't predict the future, but... I'm as confident about these folks as I am about you or me or somebody that passes me on the street next," he said.

Texto completo: Award-winning New York Times bestselling author Karen Abbott adds to her popular lineup of historical nonfiction with "The Ghosts of Eden Park" – a surprising memoir of the life and times of George Remus, the 1920s teetotaling opportunist whose skyrocketing rise to "King of the Bootleggers" during Prohibition would end in tragedy.
An instant New York Times bestseller, Indie Next pick, Amazon best book of August, and a top fall title for both Newsweek and Publishers Weekly, the book is as important for its historical worth (many of the characters in this real-life saga have been practically wiped off the historical map of America's past) as for its entertainment value.
Abbott's work has also appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Smithsonian Magazine, and other publications. Her previous books include "Sin in the Second City," "American Rose," and "Liar Temptress Soldier Spy."
A native of Philadelphia, she now lives in New York.
Tell me how you first learned about George Remus's true story, and why it caught your attention and inspired you to write "Ghosts of Eden Park."
I usually get my ideas by perusing old archives and out-of-print books, but this one came through television – specifically the show "Boardwalk Empire," which aired on HBO for five seasons. There was a minor character named George Remus. He spoke of himself in the third person and stole every scene he was in. I wondered if Remus was a real person, and indeed he was! His real story was much more dramatic than the show's portrayal, with a sordid love triangle, a devastating betrayal, a murder, and a sensational trial.
The real Remus also spoke of himself in the third person: "This is going to be a hell of a Christmas for Remus"; "Remus has been betrayed by everyone he had trusted"; and my favorite: "Remus's brain exploded."
In all my years of researching history, I have never come across a more interesting, bizarre, and brazenly outlandish character. He was an impoverished, abused German immigrant kid who, through determination and savvy, became the most successful bootlegger in American history. Within a year of launching his operation, he owned 35 percent of all the liquor in the United States – an astonishing figure. Newspapers at the time compared him to Vanderbilt and Rockefeller.
At the height of Prohibition, Remus lived an "outrageous" lifestyle on many levels, using his background as both pharmacist and lawyer to game the system. Can you give us an example about Remus's story that you would say proves the old saying that "truth is stranger than fiction?"
Remus is said to be a real-life inspiration for Jay Gatsby, mainly because of his lavish parties. The most famous was his 1921 New Year's Eve party, when he unveiled his brand-new Greco-Roman bath, built for $175,000. At one end stood a variety of Turkish and Swedish needle baths, a style and pressure for every taste, and even electric baths – an early version of a tanning bed, heated by incandescent lights and said to make the user "frisky." Remus's glamorous wife, Imogene, put on a daring one-piece and executed a perfect dive. Remus handed out party favors: diamond stickpins and watches for the men, 1922 cars for the women, and a $1,000 bill tucked under everyone's plate. In a gesture emblematic of the times, one what would be remembered in awe decades later, Remus lit guests' cigars with $100 bills. All this in an era when the average annual salary was about $1,200.
Mabel Walker Willebrandt has been called "the most powerful woman in the country" at the time when she became the assistant attorney general of the United States in 1921 and took on the challenging task of enforcing the National Prohibition Act, which prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. Tell us about her role in this story.
When President Warren Harding appointed Willebrandt to be the assistant attorney general of the United States, she, along with all other adult female citizens, had only had the right to vote for nine months. She was 32 years old, only five years out of law school, and had never prosecuted a single criminal case – and yet suddenly she was in charge of the thousands of Prohibition cases that began piling up in the courts, including cases against Remus.
To add to the pressure of her job, she had a serious hearing problem, and spent an hour every morning styling her hair to conceal her hearing aids. She was almost inhumanly tough and thick-skinned, qualities that were reinforced by the ice-cold bath she took every morning. Her favorite saying was: "Life has few petted darlings" – and she didn't consider herself one of them. Her formative childhood event: She once bit a pet cat's ear. To teach her a lesson, her father bit her ear back. During her time, she was the most powerful and the most famous woman in the country, and I couldn't believe she'd be so lost to history.
Your astounding research for this book made it possible for you to complete it with "no invented dialogue," thanks to government files, archives, diaries, letters, newspaper articles, books and hearing and trial transcripts, as you listed in your Author's Note. Tell me about this extraordinary investigation and why this level of accuracy of detail was so important to you.
A confession: I have never had so much fun researching a book. When I discovered that the Yale University Law Library possessed a 5,500-page trial transcript, I immediately set out for New Haven. Nearly every page was a treasure trove – all of the details I would need to recreate conversations and craft scenes. I found incredibly intimate details about Remus. For example, he didn't like to wear underwear, which in the 1920s was considered evidence of an unsound mind. It took me four months to go through the trial transcript and compose an outline, which amounted to 85,000 words – nearly as long as the finished book itself.
George Remus's wife, Imogene, fell in love with Franklin Dodge, the very Prohibition agent who put her husband in jail. Who was Imogene, and was she truly in love with Agent Dodge?
Imogene Remus was a classic villain: greedy, conniving, duplicitous – qualities for which she was roundly denigrated and punished. As awful as she was, a man who'd engaged in similar misdeeds likely would have gotten away with them. I think she was aware of this double standard and that it fueled her rebellion. She was the epitome of what the New York Times called the "middle-aged flapper," defined as one who yearns to escape from a monotonous routine and seeks independent adventures.
When Imogene met Remus, she was going through a nasty divorce, supporting herself and her young daughter by working as a "dust girl" in Remus's law office. She'd had a difficult life, and here was this brilliant, doting man who was poised to make millions as a bootlegger.
She was full partners with Remus before she turned on him, and she used all that knowledge to fortify her relationship with Dodge. Trial witnesses testified about Imogene and Dodge's flirtatious phone calls, about their afternoon rendezvous in speakeasys, and about their plans to hire a hitman to kill Remus.
I don't know if Imogene and Dodge were truly in love, but they definitely shared a common goal: to steal Remus's fortune and ruin his life.

Tonight, Let It Be Tsingtao; Trump reduces his trade taxes, China says it will discourage IP theft and coercion.

Texto completo: Time will tell whether the Chinese government honors its new trade agreement with the U.S. But today's news of lower taxes on commerce and commitments to reduce theft of U.S. inventions may be reason enough to crack open a cold Tsingtao.
William Mauldin, Lingling Wei and Alex Leary report in the Journal:
U.S. and Chinese officials announced a limited agreement to halt the trade war between the countries, with President Trump removing the threat of new tariffs on China and Beijing agreeing to purchases of American farm goods and other products.
As part of the "phase one" deal, the U.S. canceled plans to impose fresh tariffs on $156 billion in annual imports of Chinese-made goods—including smartphones, toys and consumer electronics—that were set to go into effect Sunday. The U.S. will also slash the tariff rate in half on roughly $120 billion of goods, to 7.5% from 15%.
Beijing has a history of non-compliance and Chinese strongman Xi Jinping is still a communist. This column also understands that the tariff burden isn't the principal reason you're not drinking Tsingtao. But today marks potential progress on the most important issues at stake and perhaps optimism and a willingness to experiment are in order.
The Journal reports that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer "said China made specific commitments on intellectual property, including counterfeiting, patent and trademark issues and pharmaceutical rights. The intellectual-property commitments will be announced in the future, he said."
The Journal adds:
Mr. Lighthizer said China has agreed, through enforceable provisions in the pact, to end the practice of forcing companies to transfer their technology as a condition of entering the Chinese market.
CNBC reports on its interview with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow:
"Regarding intellectual property rights, there's a section in that chapter that would prevent the kind of counterfeiting among tradable goods that has been going on for years. that is clearly an unfair trading practice," Kudlow said.
Mr. Kudlow added, "We will see if the Chinese stay with their word." A report in the South China Morning Post (owned by Chinese tech giant Alibaba) quotes Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen:
Wang said the nations have had in-depth discussions about intellectual property protection, including protecting IP in the pharmaceutical industry, and about cracking down on counterfeiting on e-commerce platforms.
"These measures are in line with our reforms to strengthen IP protection, and this will also help China promote its economic development," Wang said.
Allowing creators to profit from their inventions surely will help China promote its economic development. Here's hoping the regime believes it.

AI Not So Intelligent?
Perhaps people alarmed about the power of facial-recognition technology should instead be concerned about its weakness. Jeff John Roberts writes in Fortune:
Masks and simple photographs are enough to fool some facial recognition technology, highlighting a major shortcoming in what is billed as a more effective security tool.
The test, by artificial intelligence company Kneron, involved visiting public locations and tricking facial recognition terminals into allowing payment or access... More alarming were the tests deployed at transportation hubs. At the self-boarding terminal in Schiphol Airport, the Netherlands' largest airport, the Kneron team tricked the sensor with just a photo on a phone screen. The team also says it was able to gain access in this way to rail stations in China where commuters use facial recognition to pay their fare and board trains.
Other Than That, The Story Was Accurate
"For months, Prime Minister Boris Johnson planned on calling a general election in Britain, figuring he could break the logjam in Parliament by taking his case for Brexit directly to the people. Instead, as he has floundered in the early stages of the campaign, Mr. Johnson has discovered that the people are taking their case to him.
"... in the early stages of the general election, exposed to hostile voices, he has seemed at times unsure, tone deaf and gaffe prone... the charged atmosphere on the campaign trail is a reminder that Brexit has left this country bitter, divided and deeply suspicious of the political establishment. Mr. Johnson and his populist aides set out to exploit those sentiments, framing this election as one of the 'people vs. the Parliament.' Now he is finding that some of that anger is being directed at him."

Texto completo: Since its founding, the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP has largely been associated with one person: litigator David Boies.
Now, the firm Mr. Boies co-founded in the 1990s is implementing a plan to ensure it can survive long past his tenure.
Boies Schiller this week named for the first time managing partners who don't have their names on the door. The two new leaders, New York-based Nicholas Gravante Jr. and London-based Natasha Harrison, have been tapped to guide the firm into its second generation.
The announcement comes after a tumultuous period for Mr. Boies. He was most recently in the news for filing a defamation lawsuit against longtime foe Alan Dershowitz and for his interactions, as reported in the New York Times, with an apparent fraudster who said he had damning materials related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.
He has also come under heat for his representation of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who faces charges of sexual assault, and for his support of defunct blood-testing company Theranos Inc.
The bad press has led some clients to tell partners they are wary of giving new work to the firm, a person familiar with the matter said. The new leaders pushed back against that notion.
The headlines have been "temporary distractions," Mr. Gravante said, but he added that they aren't the driving force behind the transition. Instead, the changes are about preparing the 320-lawyer firm for the eventual retirements of Mr. Boies, 78 years old, and Jonathan Schiller, 73.
"What you need is a willingness from them to hand it over," Ms. Harrison said.
Successfully moving a law firm away from its founders is a challenge that has vexed other partnerships in recent years. Mr. Boies has long been one of the primary sources of revenue for Boies Schiller and his name is well known beyond legal circles.
"I am confident that building on what we as a firm do very well, and learning from our mistakes, mine included, that the next generation of leadership will not only equal but will exceed what we have accomplished to date," Mr. Boies said.
He rose to fame over the decades for assignments, including his successful representation of the Justice Department in an antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp., representing Al Gore in the 2000 Florida presidential election recount and helping win same-sex marriage rights in California. Mr. Boies said he has been working for the past decade on the best way to hand off the litigation firm he founded in 1997.
Mr. Gravante, 59, and Ms. Harrison, 46, said there are no internal calls among the partners to push Mr. Boies aside. Mr. Boies reiterated that point and said he and Mr. Schiller plan to retire over the next several years.

Texto completo: Outside the charred walls of a shrine complex here is ample evidence of the ferocity of a dayslong battle mounted by Iraqi protesters, convinced they were targeting a symbol of Iranian power in Iraq.
Molotov cocktails that failed to explode – their blackened fuses stuffed into bottles of gasoline or spirits – lie scattered amid a carpet of stones, bricks, and broken glass.
They were thrown by men who first stormed and torched the nearby Iranian consulate Nov. 27, chanting “Iran out of Iraq” – the first of three attacks on that building in a week.
Then they moved to the shrine, their anger fueled by rumors of an Iranian intelligence presence at this vast mausoleum, built to deify Ayatollah Mohammad Bakr al-Hakkim, leader of an Iraqi opposition group created by Iran in the 1980s.
“Iran takes all our resources, our funding, our freedom,” charges one protester, explaining why he and others fought at the complex. Beside him, a student, Zain, holds three pieces of metal shot extracted from his bandaged forehead.
“For sure, the protests will help lower this negative Iranian influence,” says Hamed, another young participant.
The protests that have shaken Iraq are first about removing a corrupt, entrenched sectarian system of rule that has failed to provide jobs, services, or hope since the U.S. military removed Saddam Hussein in 2003.
But Iran’s outsize influence has also been a growing target of Iraqis resentful toward what they regard as Iranian arrogance. Tehran’s overt meddling in Iraqi politics is seen as enabling a weak government as well as the rise of dozens of Shiite militias and their parties, which analysts say are corruptly engaged in every aspect of Iraq’s economy.
As a result goodwill toward Iran has been falling from its high of 2014, when Iran’s immediate military assistance and advisers – orchestrated by Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s elite Qods Force – were instrumental in stopping the advance by Islamic State (ISIS) militants.
Portraits of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been defaced and torched. Across southern Iraq, offices of Shiite militias most closely associated with Iran have also been attacked.
Analysts say Iranian   overreach has undermined Tehran’s influence, ambitions, and the popularity of its proxy forces in Iraq. The erosion coincides with another taking place in Lebanon, where veteran fighters of the Shiite organization Hezbollah are questioning their role fighting Iran’s wars in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.
“If I were in Ayatollah Khamenei’s position, I would put Soleimani in jail,” says Hisham al-Hashemi, a Baghdad-based   security analyst with the European Institute of Peace who advises the Iraqi government.
“He failed in the mission. Iraq should be the last front line [of defense] for the Iranians,” says Mr. Hashemi. Iran’s influence in elections last year and General Soleimani brokering the government that resigned in late November under pressure, he says, means that “Iran achieved lots of things in 2018. But all that it won it has lost in 2019.”
The conversion of the Shiite militias, collectively known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, from fighting ISIS to waging political war as parties last year, meant the PMF “didn’t realize it had become part of the corruption.” But ordinary Iraqis saw it.
“They became like the gods of the temple, and see themselves as sacred people,” Mr. Hashemi says of the PMF. “Without Iran, they wouldn’t be so much in control. The problem is not with Iran, but with the proxies. People are attacking Iran because their proxies mistreated them.”
The Trump administration a week ago issued sanctions on three senior Iraqi militia chiefs, saying they acted under Iranian orders when cracking down violently on Iraqi protests.
Iran’s declining numbers Even by 2018, Iraqis’ attitudes toward Iran were shifting, with polls indicating that those holding favorable views had declined from nearly 90% in 2015 to fewer than 50%. Those who view Iran as a threat to Iraqi sovereignty shot up from 25% in 2016 to 58% in 2018.
Those views have been magnified by the publishing last month of 700 Iranian intelligence reports by The Intercept and The New York Times, detailing Iran’s systematic and successful efforts to co-opt Iraqi leaders, cultivate former CIA informants, and infiltrate every aspect of Iraqi life.
Part of the backlash has played itself out in the attacks on Iranian consulates of Najaf and Karbala – cities with close ties to the Islamic Republic that welcome millions of Shiite pilgrims each year, many from Iran, to visit the shrines of Shiite Islam’s two most important seventh-century saints.
“For sure Iran had a positive stance against ISIS, but it came at a cost,” says Ali Hussein Aboud al-Dhuwayhir, a local activist and head of the Al-Rafidaein Society for Human Rights in Najaf.
He cites Iranian officials speaking as if Iraq were an asset of Iran. Among them, in a speech last April, Hassan Abbasi, a strategist and former Revolutionary Guard officer, said that for every dollar Iran had spent in Iraq and Syria fighting ISIS, “it is now returning $1,000” in contracts.
“In the current government we see the influence of Iran, and Soleimani comes and gives orders like we have no sovereignty,” says Mr. Dhuwayhir.
“Let me ask this question: Can we put any picture of Iraqi politicians or religious figures in Iran, or hold the flag of Iraq in Imam Reza’s shrine [in Mashhad, Iran]? No,” he says, referring to the ubiquitous Iranian flags and portraits of Iranian clerics across Shiite areas of Iraq.
“We can see and are sure that Iraq is about to become a suburb of Iran,” says Mr. Dhuwayhir. “All these things have created hatred against Iran and anyone affiliated with them. ... Because of the bloodshed, there is no way back.”
Video of one nighttime battle at the shrine and prayer complex dedicated to Ayatollah Hakkim, head of the Iran-backed Badr Brigade militia, shows the shrine’s defenders firing heavily amid flames, as the protester recording the scene shouts: “They [the gunmen] are coming from the grave of al-Hakkim, the Iranian!”
Another online video shows one man shouting during the battle: “These people killed our sons! We want revenge.”
“Talking and gossip” Fueling the bloodshed in Najaf were rumors about Iranian use of the sprawling Hakkim complex, which includes the vaulted shrine chamber itself, a mammoth marble mosque, and extensive seminary grounds still under construction.
One rumor was that the complex hosted a secret center for Iranian intelligence. Another was that Mr. Soleimani himself was inside. Or, at the very least, protesters say, captured demonstrators had been imprisoned in the basement.
Hassan al-Hakkim, vice president of the Shahid Al-Mihrab Foundation, which runs the complex, dismissed the rumors as “talking and gossip.”
On a tour of the complex a week after the fight, only one assault rifle is evident, the smell of burning still hanging in the air.
Like many political families in Iraq, the Hakkims maintain their own militia. Dozens of young Iraqi men wearing black balaclavas, to mask their identity during a rare visit by a foreigner, sit anxiously on mattresses laid all around the gilt, ornate cage that encloses the ayatollah’s coffin.
There were no Iranians inside during the battles, they say, adding that they were waiting for a new attack by those bent on turning the legitimate grievances of Iraqi protests into an anti-Iran wave.
Mr. Hakkim, speaking by phone from northern Iraq, says the rumors were meant to tarnish the reputation of the center, which is “just a school” that does charity work and feeds 20,000 “people in need.” But local anger has been developing over the project’s scale saying it appears to portray the late ayatollah as on par with the 12 recognized Shiite imams.
“They managed to create this constant irritation for locals, even locals who are close to them,” says one Najaf native in Baghdad whose grandfather’s house is 100 yards from the Najaf complex. “It was an irritation that was created by the Hakkims out of arrogance.”
Noticing corruption He also notes a shift among Iraqis away from sectarianism, such that by 2014 Iraqi Shiites were asking why Shiite-dominated governments had done so little for them.
After ISIS’s defeat, people found corruption and lack of services, and the emergence of a “new class of nouveau riche” that was “heavily associated” with the PMF, says the Najaf man.
“So people are beginning to realize how much corruption is around,” he adds. “This is where the anti-Iranian sentiment mainly comes from.”
Is that a blow to Iran?
“At the politician level, if you drank the Iranian Kool-Aid, then it really doesn’t matter,” says one Iraqi official in Baghdad, who asked not to be named. “But if you’ve got Iraqi nationalism in your blood, and you’re looking to better this country, then, yeah, you would see this as Iranian overreach.”

Balancing the Public Interest and a Family’s Grief

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
Video and audio recorded by government surveillance cameras, cell phones, and police body cameras have emerged as a powerful force in accountability journalism.
ProPublica’s release of an audio tape of wailing children separated from their parents at the border last year was so emotionally wrenching, it prompted President Donald Trump to halt one of his signature policies. Our forensic analysis of videos shot in Charlottesville and elsewhere spurred federal prosecutions of four white supremacists who had brutally beaten counter-protestors. We obtained audio that revealed leaders of a heart transplant unit in Newark, New Jersey had kept a vegetative patient alive for more than a year to avoid a federal review of their survival rates. Our story sparked a federal investigation.
The public interest arguments for publishing such material are unassailable. But the handling of such recordings, which may reveal victims of violence or a person’s most intimate and desperate moments, raise ethical issues that journalism has only begun to grapple with.
We faced such a question last week after Robert Moore, a reporter working for ProPublica, obtained cellblock video of the final hours of Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old Guatemalan migrant who died in a Border Patrol holding cell. The video was unquestionably newsworthy, revealing for the first time that Border Patrol officials had not told the truth about a key aspect of Carlos’ death. (The agency said Carlos had been found “unresponsive” during an early-morning welfare check. The tape showed it was his cellmate who awoke, noticed that Carlos wasn’t moving, and summoned Border Patrol officers.)
An array of news organizations, elected officials, advocacy groups and lawyers for Carlos’ family immediately posted links to the ProPublica video, which had been edited into a visual investigation that walked viewers through not only Carlos’ final hours but the layout of the facility where he was held and the discrepancies in the official Border Patrol account. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued a statement demanding that the Department of Homeland Security release its investigation of the death, saying “the federal government lying about the death of a minor in their custody is unacceptable and requires immediate and further investigations into the personnel involved in these decisions.’’
The day after the story was published, lawyers for the family announced that they were taking down their link to the video investigation and they urged news organizations to remove the video. “Carlos is a beloved child of his family,’’ they wrote. “His life is not just a story or an example of the U.S. government’s abuses.’’
The lawyers said the widespread sharing of the video had deepened the family’s suffering. And they shared a statement from the family: “It’s been really painful for our family to lose Carlos. We thought that not knowing what happened to him in that cell, whether he was all alone when he died, whether it was preventable, that we don’t know if we can hold the people responsible accountable— that that was the worst grief we could have, but having all these people watching him die on the internet is something we couldn’t have imagined in a movie or a nightmare.”
The lawyers acknowledged that “a free press is critical to the functioning of democracy.’’ But they said that everyone involved in circulating the video, themselves included, had “erred in compounding the trauma our government has already inflicted.’’
The finer points of journalism ethics are more oral tradition than clear written guidelines. Over the past several days, I’ve spoken with colleagues at leading news organizations and within the ProPublica newsroom about this case. It is clear there is no consensus on how such issues should be handled.
Editors and reporters at ProPublica spent considerable time before the story appeared weighing how we could limit the pain we might cause the family while also fulfilling our mission to expose abuses of power.
A ProPublica reporter, who speaks Spanish, described the video to Carlos’ father, who lives in Guatemala, and to a close family member, and told them that ProPublica would be publishing it. During a 25-minute phone conversation, the father expressed his hope that the video would bring out the truth about his son’s death. The other relative asked to see the video before we published it and expressed concern about Carlos’ death being broadcast across the internet. We edited the video with that mind, fast-forwarding through the most graphic scenes.
As the family pointed out in its statement, we did not share the video with them in advance. This reflected our practice, embraced by nearly every news organization, that draft stories, which we considered the visual investigation to be, are not provided to outsiders before publication.
There are good reasons for this rule which I agree with. Sharing advance copies of a story with powerful people or government agencies gives them a roadmap for pressuring sources who have agreed to be quoted by name. It can give rise to a “pre-buttal’’ in which sophisticated public figures push out a distorted version of events before a critical story appears.
There is a broad consensus among journalists that one can share some aspects of the reporting with the people they directly concern. Many journalists think it is appropriate to read back quotations to people who have been interviewed for stories. Some refuse to do this because they fear sources might retract or try to soften what was said in earlier conversations.
As editor-in-chief of ProPublica, I come down on the side of allowing reporters to read back quotes and outline relevant portions of stories to experts who might identify factual errors. I did this myself while a reporter at The New York Times, and it saved me more than once from making errors of fact and omission.
“No surprises” — offering subjects of stories a full and fair summary of what’s coming — is a core value of journalism ethics. It allows people we’re writing about a fair chance to explain or put in context their actions. If we can give CEOs a fair summary of what’s coming, we need to do the same for a grieving family.
The statement from Carlos’ family argues that hearing a detailed description of the video was not enough and that they should have been allowed to see it before it was published. From their perspective, words did not convey the experience of seeing it.
I think they have a point. Showing them the footage we intended to use would have given them a chance to truly understand what the world was about to see of Carlos’ final hours. And it would have given us at ProPublica a better opportunity to weigh the competing tensions of privacy and public interest.
It is impossible to say what might have ensued had we done so. Family members could well have asked us to use nothing from the video. Or they might have suggested we delete the painful scenes that make it clear that no one at the Border Patrol station was keeping watch as their child grew desperately ill. What’s unarguable is that we didn’t have that conversation.
Journalists have a duty to weigh the public interest of a story against the pain it might cause a grieving family. We cannot give subjects of stories veto power over what is reported. But in cases like this one, particularly when a child is involved, we need to do everything we can to understand and be sensitive to what is at stake for everyone involved. I regret that we did not do that.
Knowing everything we know now, I still feel that making the video public was the right decision. The chance to see what really happened in that cell, painful as it is, changed the conversation about Carlos and the five other migrants who died in Border Patrol custody in the last year. It galvanized members of Congress and has significantly raised the possibility that there will be a serious investigation. The growing availability of visual and audio evidence is a godsend for investigative journalists, particularly at a time when truth itself seems under assault. But as we at ProPublica work to figure out how to better handle such material, it’s clear that the issues are deeply complex and that we’ve only begun to sort through them.

Sinclair cuts Boris Epshteyn’s program as network shifts focus to investigative reporting

Texto completo: Sinclair Broadcast Group will no longer produce commentary programming, including Boris Epshteyn’s show, to focus on investigative local reporting.
In a statement about the change, Sinclair told its staff that both Epshteyn and former Obama campaign staffer Ameshia Cross would no longer host their political commentary shows for the network to provide time for investigative reporting. Sinclair owns 193 stations across the United States and wanted to allow local reporters time to air their investigative findings.
“We have to shine a light on our value proposition every quarter hour, in every newscast. Therefore, we will be expanding our local investigative journalism footprint in our daily newscasts. We are excited to dedicate more time in our newscasts to report on critical and relevant issues,” the company said in the statement.
It added, “To allot additional airtime for this storytelling, we will be ending the commentary segments this Friday, Dec. 13, featuring Ameshia Cross, and Boris Epshteyn.”
Epshteyn had previously worked as a spokesman for President Trump’s White House before leaving his post in 2017. His commentary on the network has sparked controversy, especially his remark comparing illegal immigration to an “attempted invasion” after highlighting footage of border authorities using tear gas on illegal immigrants.
Sinclair issued a statement after that segment, saying, “We'd like to take a moment and address some concerns regarding a commentary segment by [Epshteyn] that was aired on Sinclair stations this week. The opinions expressed in this segment do not reflect the views of Sinclair Broadcast Group.”Tweet
Epshteyn has remained close to the Trump family since departing the White House, even attending a celebration for Donald Trump Jr. after his book landed on the New York Times bestsellers list.
Sinclair claimed Epshteyn, 37, would be “moving into a sales-focused role” within the network.

Texto completo: It was only January when certain journalists went way out on a limb to give friendly news coverage to the racist and anti-Semitic Black Hebrew Israelites cult. This very odd editorial decision seemed to come in the service of better sticking it to the high school students from Covington Catholic — boys whom Black Hebrew Israelites had taunted on the national mall, inciting what became a famous incident.

So, now that one of the black nationalist cult's former members stands accused of a deadly shoot-out with police, possibly in an act of anti-Semitic terrorism targeting a Kosher grocery market in Jersey City, we are probably not going to hear much talk about the fringe group in the broader context of radicalization and gun violence. That would be a personal and professional embarrassment for a lot of reporters and editors, some of who are currently in the middle of defending against lawsuits by the Covington teens.

The New York Times, for example, published an entire profile on Jan. 23 describing the Black Hebrew Israelites and their tactics in friendly, playful terms, including “gamely engage,” "blunt and sometimes offensive,” and “attention-grabbing,” but all for the purpose of “drawing listeners near.” The profile is even sure to mention that the cult once got a shout-out in a song by a popular rapper.

Earlier, on Jan. 22, the Washington Post published a profile on the Black Hebrew Israelites that likewise mentions the rapper incident. The profile does not, however, take any time to lay out the cult’s well-known history of racism and anti-Semitism. All that the report says is that the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have labeled the Black Hebrew Israelites as a “hate group” for their “inflammatory messages about white, LGBT and Jewish people.” That is all the profile says, and even that tiny piece of important background context is not given until the story’s 22nd paragraph. The Washington Post report said also of the Covington episode that a Black Hebrew Israelite presence at the Lincoln Memorial “was, for the group, quite mundane,” adding further that “Israelite street preaching in parts of D.C., Philadelphia and New York is commonplace, a familiar if odd accent to city life.”

It is still possible Tuesday’s shooting spree inspires a broader conversation about gun violence and the dangers posed by radical hate groups like the Black Hebrew Israelites. But don't hold your breath.

Meanwhile, the Covington teenagers, falsely portrayed as hateful bigots in the pages of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and elsewhere, are not known to have shot anyone — at least not in the last 11 months.

Don't let Harvey Weinstein off the hook

Texto completo: Entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein harassed and assaulted dozens of women over the course of 30 years, and a recently proposed legal settlement might let him get off easy.

After two years of legal back-and-forth, Weinstein and his bankrupt Hollywood studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement with his accusers. The proposal, which has received preliminary approval from all of the major players, would not require Weinstein to admit wrongdoing or pay his victims out of pocket, according to the New York Times.

If it goes through, the proposal would bring an end to nearly every single one of the lawsuits filed by the more than 30 actresses accosted by Weinstein. It must receive court approval, and Weinstein will still face criminal prosecution in January. But the civil claims against Weinstein should not go unnoticed, which is exactly what will happen if this proposal is approved.

Unfortunately, some of Weinstein’s accusers feel as though their hands are tied. Katherine Kendall, one of the actresses who has accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, said she’s disappointed with the terms of the proposal but agreed to it because she doesn’t know how much more they can realistically expect, given the fact that he and his company are staring down financial ruin.

“I don’t love it, but I don’t know how to go after him,” said Kendall, who alleges that Weinstein lured her to his apartment and chased her around it. “I don’t know what I can really do.”
In regard to financial compensation, this proposal might be the best the victims will get, as Genie Harrison, a sexual harassment lawyer representing one of the victims, has said. But Weinstein’s victims deserve more than a monetary consolation; they deserve an apology, an admission, and a criminal conviction.

Weinstein might indeed find himself behind bars come January. But if this deal goes through, he will never need to admit what he’s done or apologize to the women whose lives he destroyed. Instead, he’ll continue to insist that the accusations against him are “patently false,” as he’s done for years.

Weinstein is a coward, and he should be forced to confront the consequences of his sexual predation — in the courtroom and in legal negotiations. His victims deserve that much.

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein, his former associates, insurers and accusers have reached a nearly $47 million tentative settlement of almost all the civil cases pending against him, about $25 million of which will compensate women who have accused the Hollywood producer of sexual misconduct, according to people familiar with the matter.
Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Weinstein and his former associates, including board members of his former studio, didn't admit wrongdoing, the people said. The deal still needs to be approved by a bankruptcy judge and a judge overseeing a proposed class-action lawsuit. The bulk of the settlement money will be paid by insurance policies, including those held by his former studio, Weinstein Co., some of the people said.
The deal resolves all but two of the civil sexual-misconduct lawsuits and other legal claims filed against Mr. Weinstein, the people said.
The tentative settlement won't affect the criminal case brought by Manhattan prosecutors, which is set to go to trial on January 6. Mr. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.
The settlement is the culmination of more than a year of negotiations , which involved lawyers for Mr. Weinstein, his former film studio, the New York attorney general's office, insurers and alleged victims.
The negotiations also included the former associates of Mr. Weinstein who some women claimed had enabled Mr. Weinstein's alleged abuse. It also resolves a suit filed by the New York attorney general that accused his former studio's executives and board of failing to protect women from his alleged misconduct.
Under the terms of the deal, about $6 million will go to women who have filed lawsuits and legal claims and their attorneys, the people said. An additional $18.6 million will be set aside to create a settlement fund for additional alleged victims, including those covered by the attorney general's suit, they said.
About $7 million will go to some creditors of the film studio. About $12 million will cover the costs of lawyers who defended Mr. Weinstein's former associates against the suits.
The tentative deal was reported earlier by the New York Times.

A spokeswoman for the New York attorney general and a spokesman for Mr. Weinstein declined to comment. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the proposed class-action suit didn't respond to a request for comment.
Of the total settlement, $1 million will fund Mr. Weinstein's defense costs to fight the lawsuits against two alleged victims who aren't participating in the settlement, the people said.
Lawyers for those women have portrayed the settlement as unfair. Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for one of those women, said in a statement that he didn't believe the deal was the best possible settlement. "It is shameful that $12 million of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein," he said.
Thomas Giuffra, a lawyer for the second woman who rejected the deal, objected to settlement funds paying the legal bills of Mr. Weinstein's former associates.
"Victims will receive only a small fraction of what the settlement was expected to yield," he said.

Loopholes in Russia's Ban for Doping Frustrate Critics

Texto completo: Critics say the World Anti-Doping Agency's banishment of Russia has too many loopholes.
When the world's top antidoping authority announced this week that Russia would be banned from global sports for four years for continuing violations of its rules, it trumpeted the sanctions as suitably severe.
That opinion was not universal.
To some athletes and antidoping officials, the punishments put forth by the World Anti-Doping Agency appeared overly accommodating and, in certain cases, altogether maddening. So now, after years of being at least mildly polite in their critiques of the organization that held Russia's athletic future in its hands, a few of them are no longer holding back.
"With the level of mockery that has taken place, not only of the rules, but those who abide by and safeguard them, it's hard to understand how this could not have warranted the most serious level of sanctioning, " said Beckie Scott, a Canadian Olympian and the chairwoman of WADA's athlete committee. "Especially when they have the power to do so."
Scott and others in the world of international sports said they were frustrated with WADA because they had pressed for a blanket ban of all Russian athletes at next year's Olympics and at other major competitions. They said that such a punishment would have been fitting because multiple investigations had documented how Russia corrupted international sporting events for years.
That cheating culminated with a scheme to substitute dirty urine samples with clean ones at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games. When that operation was revealed, antidoping officials said, Russia manipulated computer databases it had promised to turn over as a condition of lifting sanctions against the country's antidoping agency.
Instead, Monday's ruling most likely means competitors from Russia will continue to participate in the Olympics impeded only by the inability to wear their country's uniforms or see their country's flag raised if they win.
But the limited reach of the ban left some critics scratching their heads. Russia did not, for example, lose the right to participate next summer in the quadrennial European soccer championships, one of the biggest sporting events in the world, nor the right for Saint Petersburg to host games in the tournament. The championship is a continental championship instead of a world championship, rival nations, athletes and fans were informed, and thus Russia's global antidoping punishments did not apply.
Han Xiao, the chairman of the athletes' advisory council of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said many athletes from the United States initially had opposed a blanket ban on Russian athletes and teams because they felt sympathy for their counterparts who may be clean. But Xiao said it was the repetitive pattern of cheating and punishment dating back half a decade -- with no apparent remorse -- that made him believe a harsher punishment was necessary.
"We need some baseline comfort that we're competing on a level playing field," said Xiao, a former member of the American table tennis team. "But with Russia, after all these years, we're still talking about the same thing, which shows that the behavior doesn't change. So at what point are you going to raise the sanctions so they do really hit them?"
Those seeking harsher action could perhaps look at the way the World Athletics, the governing body for track and field, has handled Russia since a 2015 report first confirmed the true scope of Russia's state-run doping program.
World Athletics, then known as the I.A.A.F., immediately banned Russian athletes from all competitions. At the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro -- where the International Olympic Committee had asked each sporting federation to make its own decision about Russia's participation -- only a single athlete from the country competed in track and field, while close to 70 others were suspended. Russia was well represented in other sports, though, and won 19 gold medals.
But track and field officials also stripped Russia of the right to host the 2016 world race walking championships and 2016 world junior championships. The ban on Russia has continued for four years, with only a handful of Russian athletes allowed to compete at the track and field world championships in 2017 and 2019. Each time, the athletes cleared to take part had to do so in neutral uniforms.
"Doping is already hard enough to prove with athletes who aren't coming from countries with systemic doping programs," Xiao said.
The World Anti-Doping Agency does have supporters, too. Dick Pound, the Canadian lawyer who served as the first chairman of the agency from 1999 to 2007, said the agency should be given more credit for its work battling performance-enhancing drug use.
"There's a budding industry of attacking WADA for not being perfect, usually by people who are themselves imperfect and who have no accountability for anyone," Pound said. "I think if you realistically look at the major international progress against doping in sport, it's really been at the hands of WADA in the last two or three years and really no one else."
And yet, some Russian sports officials have sounded unbothered about the prospect that the nation's name, colors, flag and anthem would be absent at the 2020 Olympics, just as they were at the 2018 Winter Games.
"We have done this before at the last Olympics," Dmitry Svishchev, president of Russia's curling federation, said this week, according to Reuters. "There is nothing horrible about this."
The people most frustrated are those who say they have had to watch the same plot unfold time and again, and who fear the new sanctions will do little to alter Russia's behavior.
"The perception of this being a stiff punishment, it's just that: a perception," said Bruce Baumgartner, the president of U.S.A. Wrestling. "It's not the reality."

Texto completo: Jon Schleuss, a 32-year-old data journalist at the Los Angeles Times, has been elected president of the NewsGuild, unseating 12-year incumbent Bernie Lunzer.
After a rerun of an election held in the spring, Schleuss won by a vote of 1,979 to 1,514, said the guild, which is part of the Communications Workers of America, in a statement. The previous election was recast after complaints over failure to ensure that the ballots reached all eligible voters. In that election, Lunzer won 1,282 to 1,021.
Schleuss played an important role in a historic campaign to secure union representation at The Times after 130 years as a nonunion newsroom. The organizing effort helped to spur an increase in union activity in the publishing industry, which has been buffeted by shifts in advertising and consumption.

"While I have won the office of President of the NewsGuild, the real winners here are the members who organized, mobilized, and claimed the future for their union and for themselves," Schleuss said in the statement. He said he planned to work for stronger contracts, to organize more workers and provide more transparency, and better connection between members and leaders.
Schleuss joined The Times in 2013. Previously he was a manager at the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and worked as a host at the local NPR station.
Schleuss, who starts a four-year term immediately, was also elected as one of the youngest presidents of an international union. Representing some 475 members of its newsroom, the L.A. Times Guild worked on a first collective bargaining agreement for more than a year. It led to pay raises of at least 5% and locked in future increases after years of stagnation in salaries. Other newspapers such as the Arizona Republic and Chicago Tribune also moved to form a union.
The guild represents about 20,000 journalists and other workers in the United States and Canada, including The Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, Reuters, BuzzFeed News and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump and Attorney General William Barr took aim at the FBI on Tuesday, reiterating attacks on former bureau officials and contradicting the agency's director, Christopher Wray, a day after an independent watchdog concluded that agents were justified in opening an investigation into Russia's possible ties with the Trump campaign.
In an early Twitter post, Trump snapped at Wray for not agreeing with his interpretation of the watchdog report's findings.
“I don't know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading, but it sure wasn't the one given to me," Trump wrote on Twitter. “With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI, which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men & women working there!"
Wray had said Monday that he concurred with the Justice Department inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who found that political bias did not influence investigative decisions, directly undercutting the president's yearslong accusations.
Barr went a step further and called the findings about the origins of the inquiry “flimsy." He also repeated a longtime refrain of Trump and his allies, saying the FBI improperly used counterintelligence tools to spy on a presidential campaign.
In an interview with NBC News, Barr said there were “gross abuses" and “inexplicable behavior that is intolerable in the FBI."
In July 2016, the FBI opened the investigation after it learned a Trump campaign aide had bragged that he was told that Russia had information that could damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy. At the same time, stolen Democratic e-mails were being released. This prompted the FBI to open the inquiry, the inspector general found, not the salacious dossier of opposition research on Trump by a former British intelligence official.
Horowitz said the bureau was right to open the inquiry, but he recommended additional supervision in the future.
While there was little expectation that the inspector general's conclusions would settle the partisan debate over the legitimacy of the Russia inquiry, the president's suggestion that he lacked confidence in Wray's ability to “fix" the bureau raised the possibility that he was considering replacing Wray, which would give him his third FBI director since he took office.
The director position has a 10-year term limit devised specifically to prevent political interference.
Trump appointed Wray after he fired the previous director, James Comey, in 2017. By the time Wray became director, a special counsel had been appointed to take over the Russia investigation, and Trump was regularly lashing out at the FBI. During his first two years in office, Trump attacked the bureau, the Justice Department and intelligence agencies 277 times.
Trump and some of his allies saw the dense report as proof that their conspiracy theories were in fact true. The president has claimed for years that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt pursued by “deep state" bureaucrats who did not support him politically. And he has been particularly critical of the FBI, calling former bureau leaders “losers."
“I think our nation was turned on its head for three years based on a completely bogus narrative that was largely fanned and hyped by a completely irresponsible press," Barr said Tuesday.
Wray has sought to avoid confrontation with Trump as he navigates the bureau through one of its most turbulent eras. He and his aides had hoped that with the release of the inspector general report, the FBI could finally move past the toxic politics of the last three years.
Standing in disagreement with the president and the attorney general, Wray will now have to decide how to lead the agency while his bosses promulgate the unsubstantiated narrative that the FBI plotted to sabotage Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.
Barr is overseeing a separate Justice Department criminal investigation into the basis of the Russia inquiry.
A federal prosecutor, John Durham, is leading that investigation and supported the attorney general's assessment of the report.
“Last month, we advised the inspector general that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened," Durham said.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that any foreign interference in American elections is “unacceptable" and warned Russia and others that the Trump administration will protect the integrity of the vote.

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

Rams win big when they stop wasting chances, and roll 7s early

Texto completo: THOUSAND OAKS — The run covered only one yard, but it showed how far the 2019 Rams have come and how much farther they could go.
The Rams had the ball for the first time in their 28-12 victory over the Seattle Seahawks at the Coliseum on Sunday. Passes from Jared Goff to Robert Woods for 18 and 15 yards quickly put them in Seattle territory. This was the kind of early scoring opportunity that a team craves — and that they had been squandering all season.
Then Jared Goff connected with tight end Tyler Higbee for 33 yards to put the Rams at the Seahawks’ goal line, and on the next play Malcolm Brown ran off left tackle for a one-yard touchdown.
It was only the second game this season that the Rams’ first trip across the 50-yard line paid off in seven points. When their next possession also resulted in a touchdown, the night and maybe the season had been transformed.
“It’s just about finishing drives,” Rams coach Sean McVay said Monday.
McVay credited “great individual efforts” by everyone from Goff to receivers Woods, Higbee and Cooper Kupp to running backs Brown and Todd Gurley and left-side linemen Andrew Whitworth and Austin Corbett for what became a three-touchdown first-half burst.
By winning, the Rams (8-5) stayed one game behind the Minnesota Vikings (9-4) in the race for the NFC’s last wildcard playoff berth with three games to play. The Rams face the Dallas Cowboys (6-7) Sunday in Arlington, Texas. The Vikings play the Chargers (5-8) Sunday in Carson.
For their playoff drive to succeed, the Rams have to keep finishing their offensive drives with touchdowns instead of field goals — or nothing at all.
It’s amazing how often this year the Rams have wasted chances to do that and take early control of games.
Before scoring early touchdowns the past two weeks, they entered opposing territory with 13 first-quarter drives and got into the end zone a grand total of once. (That was Woods’ eight-yard carry, the Rams’ only score in the 20-7 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.)
Those drives produced eight field goals, two missed field goals, a punt and an interception. Eight failures to convert downs included four incompletions and a sack in seven passing attempts. Three ill-timed penalties, two of them before the snap, contributed to the problem.
A prime-time example was the Rams’ loss to the Seahawks in Seattle on a Thursday night in October. The Rams crossed the 50-yard line twice in the first quarter, but third-down incomplete passes made them settle for two field goals.
By contrast, in the Rams’ first 13 games on the way to the NFC championship in 2018, they cashed in touchdowns on more than half (12 of 23) of their first-quarter drives across the 50.
Rookie right tackle Bobby Evans blamed penalties for some of the Rams’ stalled drives this season, and said the offensive line seemed “bought-in and focused” Sunday.

— Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) December 9, 2019
“A lot of drives we didn’t finish were because we would get penalties down in the red zone (inside the opponents’ 20),” Evans said. “I think you could just feel it (Sunday), everybody’s on the same page.”
The Rams’ second touchdown, making it 14-3 with 11:28 to go in the second quarter, came on a two-yard pass from Goff on a rollout to Woods, capping a 6 1/2-minute, 85-yard drive on which Goff completed all six passes for 49 yards. Their third, making it 21-3 with 51 seconds left in the half, was a 10-yard pass from Goff to Kupp, at the end of a 72-yard drive on which the quarterback went 5 for 6 for 65 yards.
On the drive to Kupp’s touchdown, Gurley made first-down runs for six, six and seven yards, loosening up the defense for the passing game.
“I think it starts with just being efficient in early downs, staying ahead of the sticks, not getting into second and longs and third and longs,” Kupp said of the first-half efficiency Sunday.
The Rams’ lead forced the Seahawks (10-3) to pass. Knowing what was coming gave the L.A. defense a chance against the elusive Russell Wilson, and it capitalized by sacking the quarterback five times. It was Wilson’s second-worst game of the season; the worst was against the Baltimore Ravens, the NFL’s best team.
“I think the last couple of weeks have really represented playing team football, feeding off one another,” McVay said Monday.
If they’re able to keep it up at Dallas, the signs should be visible early.
Ends and odds
The Rams came out of Sunday’s game without major injuries, although Sean McVay said punt returner Nsimba Webster “got his hip banged up a little bit” while blocking on a kickoff return.
This was the first game for Webster and Darrell Henderson as punt- and kickoff-returner, respectively, since JoJo Natson went on injured reserve with a hamstring pull. McVay said tight end Gerald Everett and tackle Rob Havenstein could return in Dallas from knee injuries. …
Websites that track NFL teams’ likelihood of qualifying for the playoffs said the Rams’ chances climbed above 30% after the win over the Seahawks. Two sites said the Rams’ chances would go above 50% if they beat the Cowboys, other things being equal. As of Monday afternoon, The New York Times had them rising from 34% to 52% with a win in Dallas, and FiveThirtyEight.com had them going from 36% to 54%. …
The Las Vegas point spread for Sunday’s game at Dallas was pick ’em Monday afternoon, with an over-under line of 48 1/2. The Cowboys were three-point favorites Monday morning.

Texto completo: Jesé Milagrosa, líder espiritual de una pequeña iglesia en Bayside (Queens, NYC), ha sido acusado de agredir sexualmente a un pre adolescente en el transcurso de tres años.
Milagrosa (69), líder de la Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Salette en la calle 204, supuestamente usó su posición en la iglesia para participar en actos sexuales con el niño de 12 años entre 2011 y 2014, informó Queens Daily Eagle.
La víctima no identificada es miembro activo de la feligresía y se enfrentó a Milagrosa con respecto al abuso en 2018.
El acusado luego admitió a los detectives que tuvo contacto oral y anal con el niño , dijeron los fiscales.
Los fiscales acusaron a Milagrosa de conducta sexual contra un menor de edad y de actos sexuales criminales. Está detenido con una fianza de $250 mil dólares y debe regresar a la corte el 20 de diciembre. Si es declarado culpable, enfrenta entre 10 años y prisión perpetua.
La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Salette, un templo católica fundado en el año 2000, celebra una misa tradicional en latín al menos seis días a la semana, y muchos de los feligreses son inmigrantes de América del Sur.
A raíz de su arresto, un portavoz de la Diócesis de Brooklyn, que incluye Queens, dijo que Nuestra Señora de LaSalette no es una Iglesia Católica Romana y no es parte de la Diócesis de Brooklyn.
“Si bien imita muchas prácticas católicas, no es una parroquia católica romana, y no está asociada con la Diócesis de Brooklyn”, dijo el portavoz. “De hecho, la diócesis ha notificado a los fieles a lo largo de los años que Nuestra Señora de LaSalette no está en comunión con la diócesis o con el Santo Padre”.
El abogado de Milagrosa, Jeffrey Pittell, dijo que él “es amado por su congregación”.
Según una entrevista en 2007 con The New York Times, “Monseñor Milagrosa” se mudó a NYC desde Venezuela en 1985, “después de crear una orden religiosa independiente, ahora con sede en Liberty, Nueva York, con la esperanza de aumentar las vocaciones entre los jóvenes hispanos”.

Texto completo: The coming new year has been widely heralded as the start of a new decade: the 2020s. But an old timekeeping conundrum has led some to contend we're celebrating too early and that we should actually wait until Jan. 1, 2021.
A decade is a period of 10 years — that isn't disputed. But a glitch in our calendar system creates a problem if you think decades should begin in years ending with a zero. If you continue the pattern back about 2020 years, you run into a major issue.
That's because there is no "year zero" in our calendar system, explained Craig Callender, a professor of philosophy at UC San Diego who has studied the physics and experience of time.
The lack of a year zero means the only consistent way to measure decades — or centuries or millennia — is to start them in years ending in one: That’s the theory presented in explanations of the debate published by the Farmer’s Almanac, timeanddate. com, the New York Times and others.
New Year's life hacks: The smallest resolutions with the biggest payoffs
But because a decade is simply a unit of 10 years, there is no right answer, Callender told USA TODAY.
Here’s the argument explained:
The case for beginning the decade in 2021
The basis of this argument is a single calendar year that happened more than two millennia ago.
At that point in time, our current calendar system pivots from years labeled B. C. — “Before Christ” — to years labeled A. D. — “anno Domini” or “in the year of the Lord. ” It’s an attempt to center the calendar around the birth of Jesus, although the historical accuracy of that date has been called into question.
There is no year zero in the switch, Callender said. The B. C. years count down to 1 B. C. , which is immediately followed by A. D. 1.
You may love holiday lights — But there's a good reason why some people don't, experts say
The lack of a year zero means the first A. D. decade started at year 1 and ran until the end of year 10; the second decade started on year 11.
Follow the pattern for 200 more decades, and here we are — still one year away from the start of the next decade, which will begin on Jan. 1, 2021.
The case for beginning the decade in 2020
People who say we should wait a year to celebrate the new decade have a point, but it's not a very good one, according to Callender.
Marking the beginning of a decade in a year ending in one is out of step with how we think and talk about time, he said.
When we count our children’s ages, we start at zero — not one. When we talk about decades such as the 1960s, we start at years ending with zero — not ending in one.
Celebrating the beginning the decade on Jan. 1, 2020, simply makes things easier in the present day, Callender said. It’s a convention that is “pretty good for everything really, unless you run it all the way back. ”
The widely documented argument between timekeeping purists and the average person is “pretty silly,” he commented. The reality: There's no perfect solution that will please everyone.

Texto completo: Nike Inc. employees staged a protest over the company's treatment of women on the same day the sportswear company reopened a headquarters building named after the disgraced running coach Alberto Salazar.
A flier circulating among employees read, "Join us for a campus walk to celebrate what women bring to sport and to raise awareness of how Nike can support our female athletes and employees."
Employees marched Monday morning at the company's Beaverton, Ore., headquarters in an event not sanctioned by the company. Some held up placards saying, "Empower Women." Several senior executives joined the employees and engaged them in a dialogue, said people familiar with the event.
"We respect and welcome employees' feedback on matters that are important to them," a Nike spokesman said. "The flier prepared by some employees was not officially distributed by Nike."
Buildings on the sprawling Nike headquarters are named after famous athletes with Nike connections, including the golf great Tiger Woods and soccer star Mia Hamm. Mr. Salazar, a track coach whose name is on a large office building, has been suspended from the sport for four years on doping charges. Mr. Salazar has said he planned to appeal the doping ban. He has disputed allegations from some former female athletes that he has mistreated them.
Nike has been dealing with concerns about its workplace culture for more than a year. In early 2018, a group of women circulated a survey to protest inappropriate behavior by men at the sneaker company as well as pay disparity and gender imbalance in the top ranks. Later that year, Nike replaced several senior executives, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker apologized at an all-hands meeting, pledging to improve the workplace culture.
More recently, Mr. Salazar received a four-year suspension for orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct following an investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
The running prodigy Mary Cain told the New York Times recently that during her time with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar's now-defunct elite training group, she missed her period for three years after coaches pressured her to lose weight.

Our Green Energy Challenge

Texto completo: America should be leading the way on clean energy, not falling behind.
Washington is consumed with discussion about the consequences of a rising China, from trade disputes, to their authoritarian surveillance and oppression of Uighurs, to their aggression in the South China Sea. There's comparably little debate about how the United States can shape the environment into which China is rising, let alone the actions we can take at home to ensure our values prevail. We see more focus on tariffs than building wind turbines and solar farms. We should not be spectators in shaping our own future, or the world's. We should pledge that by the end of the next decade, America will surpass China and win the clean energy race.
We aren't winning the clean energy race today. In many ways, we aren't even trying. China is becoming an energy superpower. Earlier this year, the Global Commission on the Geopolitics of the Energy Transformation reported that China became the world's largest producer, exporter and installer of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles, followed by Japan and Germany. The United States ranks fourth.
China surpassed us for the lead in renewable energy technology, too, with 150,000 patents -- making up 30 percent of the world's total. We are second with just over 100,000 patents, while Japan and the European Union follow with about 75,000 each.
In 2015, China surpassed us to become the largest electric vehicle market and is on pace to dominate production for the next 20 years. Chinese electric vehicles account for 60 percent of global sales: 876,000 vehicles were produced last year compared with 361,000 in America.
China is doing things we are afraid to do. They offer citizens large subsidies for purchasing electric vehicles from state-owned companies. Municipalities waive fees for electric vehicle owners. The city of Shenzhen, which has a population of 12.5 million people, runs a 100 percent electric vehicle bus fleet and is, by fiat, converting 22,000 taxis to electric vehicles.
High-speed rail also is integral to China's strategy. It has the largest high-speed railway in the world, with 19,000 miles of track and most major cities connected by the network. The United States has less than 500 miles. Our fastest train takes 19 to 22 hours from New York to Chicago, whereas the same distance in China takes four-and-a-half hours.
Unless we have a strategic plan, China may become the OPEC of the 21st-century energy industry. It's folly to replace a world order too dependent on Middle East oil with one that's too dependent on Chinese technology.
America can mobilize around a national strategy to lead the world in clean technology that will attract bipartisan support from both coasts and the heartland.
How? Just think about the options we could explore. We could expand the electric vehicle tax credit, making it fully refundable at the time of purchase. That means a person wouldn't have to wait a year for their tax refund but would receive money back immediately when buying an electric vehicle. If these credits are tied to domestic manufacturing, private sector jobs will return to auto-industry towns.
We could add two zeros to the end of the budget for ARPA-E, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, taking it from a few hundred million to tens of billions of dollars. We could double the budgets for the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Office of Science. The aggregate current level for those two would increase to around $ 18 billion from about $ 9 billion. Each support renewable energy research and are critical for the type of disruptive innovation necessary to meet the scale and urgency of the climate challenge.
We could use an infrastructure bank to finance a high-speed rail system to relieve congestion, reduce pollution, increase energy efficiency, and provide alternatives to regional air travel. Although the California experience shows how local zoning concerns and cost overruns present challenges, the lessons learned show that we need a clear road map before implementation, rather than an ad hoc approach.
We could match China's annual investment in public-private partnerships. Whereas China spent $ 126 billion on renewable energy investments in 2016, we spent just over $ 40 billion. We need more examples like the Department of Energy working with the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group launched by Richard Branson and 20 other leaders committed to making renewable energy technologies less expensive and more commercially viable. Last month, a Bill Gates-backed start-up achieved a breakthrough using artificial intelligence and mirrors. This new technology harnesses the sun's energy to create heat hot enough for carbon-free industrial processes, like making concrete. Another place for investment is in electric car batteries, which need a range of closer to a thousand miles than a few hundred. Home energy-storage systems and solar cells must also become smaller and more convenient.
Energy is the largest market the world has ever seen. Four to five billion people consume energy today. That figure will increase to nine billion in 30 years. Today we have 2.3 million clean energy jobs. A national strategy focused on winning the clean energy race can create millions of new jobs, considering solar panel installer and wind turbine technician jobs are already expected to grow at around 60 percent over the next decade.
America can claim credit for many of the last century's greatest contributions to humanity. We did not lead simply by opposing great powers, but by setting the standard for scientific and technological advances. Our China strategy should be premised on becoming the undisputed global leader in the new-energy market, and the nation all others seek to emulate in tackling the climate change crisis.

Michelle Goldberg: Please, Democrats, don’t make the impeachment articles too narrow

Texto completo: At Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee hearing on impeachment, the witness called by Republicans, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, gave a disingenuous, hackish performance.
Turley criticized the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump as overly partisan, a concern that didn’t seem to trouble him in 1998, when he supported Bill Clinton’s impeachment. He argued that Democrats shouldn’t accuse Trump of bribery for his Ukraine shakedown unless it meets the statutory definition, even though a 2014 Washington Post op-ed essay by one Jonathan Turley made clear that criminal statutes aren’t controlling in the impeachment process.
“While there’s a high bar for what constitutes grounds for impeachment, an offense does not have to be indictable,” he wrote then, when he was discussing whether there were grounds for impeaching Barack Obama.
So there was no reason for Democrats to take Turley seriously when he argued that the impeachment investigation was too truncated, and that more effort should have been made to coerce testimony from key figures like Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, and John Bolton, his former national security adviser.
Nevertheless, I wish they had. Democrats had little to lose by taking their time excavating the full record of Trump’s wrongdoing before turning impeachment over for trial to the Republican-controlled Senate.
But that debate became moot on Thursday morning, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had instructed House investigators to begin drawing up articles of impeachment. Now the question is what those articles will contain. A central point of contention is whether the articles will include Trump’s obstruction of justice in Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russia’s attack on the 2016 election. It is vitally important that they do.
It is understandable that Democrats from swing districts, whose constituents weren’t persuaded to back impeachment by the Mueller report, don’t want to revisit the murky events of 2016. But to make clear the full gravity of what Trump tried to do in Ukraine, Democrats need to demonstrate that it was part of a pattern.
As the Mueller report showed, the Trump campaign welcomed Russian interference in 2016, expecting that “it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.” Then Trump repeatedly tried to obstruct the federal government’s investigation into what Russia had done. It was only the day after Mueller’s congressional testimony that Trump made his demand of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Part of that demand was that Ukraine help Trump obscure Russia’s role in his election by falsely implicating itself. Once the scheme became public, Trump obstructed Congress’s investigation into his solicitation of foreign election assistance.
Either Mueller’s findings or the Ukraine “drug deal,” as Bolton reportedly called it, would merit impeachment on its own. But the urgency of Democrats’ impeachment process — the subject of much bad-faith caterwauling on the right — is best justified by Trump’s recidivism. Impeachment isn’t just about holding Trump accountable for a discrete scandal. It’s about trying, against the odds, to stop an ongoing campaign to subvert the 2020 election, one that is building on tactics from 2016.
Indeed, even as the Judiciary Committee discussed impeachment, Giuliani was in Ukraine seeking meetings with corrupt former prosecutors who, he apparently hoped, would undercut the Democrats’ case. A day before that, Giuliani had been in Budapest where he met with another disgraced former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, as well as with Andrii V. Artemenko, a pro-Russian former member of Ukraine’s Parliament.
Artemenko’s name might be familiar to those who have followed Trump’s Russia scandal closely. He was the one who reportedly gave Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, a Russia-friendly “peace plan” for Russia and Ukraine, which Cohen transmitted to Michael Flynn, then Trump’s national security adviser. Artemenko, The New York Times reported in 2017, “sees himself as a Trump-style leader of a future Ukraine.” He had claimed to have evidence of corruption by Ukraine’s president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, a pro-Western figure he was trying to oust. “Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides” to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, The Times said.
To understand the sociopathic shamelessness of Giuliani seeking Artemenko’s help with Trump’s current domestic political problems, you have to understand how the Russia scandal and the Ukraine scandal intersect.
Given America’s political polarization, public opinion on impeachment is unlikely to move much no matter what Democrats do. Nevertheless, they would be mad to let centrist trepidation stop them from making the strongest possible case for Trump’s removal. Doing that requires a willingness to put Trump’s Ukraine corruption in context.
Democrats have only one chance to impeach the most corrupt and disloyal president in American history. They say they’re rushing through it because it can’t wait. They have a duty to explain not just why Trump betrayed America when he sought to extort election help from Ukraine, but how we know that he’ll nearly certainly try the same thing again.

Texto completo: The holidays are here, and for many parents, it's all about managing their kids' expectations. They think they need to give their kids the biggest presents, the most presents and the coolest presents. But trust me: Little Sally won't be scarred for life if she doesn't get a pony.
It's OK to want the best for your kids — we all do. But you should never put yourself in a financial bind to make their holiday dreams come true. That's not what Christmas is about. While other parents are shelling out hundreds or even thousands of dollars to give their kids the "perfect" Christmas, you can teach your little ones about contentment.
Contentment isn't a money issue, even though it has a huge impact on your child's future. It's a heart issue. Content people may not have the best of everything, but they make the best of everything.
Without contentment, people often try to fill the void in their hearts by cramming it full of more and more stuff. As a parent, you've got to prepare your children to defend themselves against this threat.
There's lots of research out there showing children are aware of what they have in comparison to what others have at a super-young age. Marketers fight for their attention early on, and by default, they're fighting for your money.
Make sure your kids know the newness of stuff isn't what funds their happiness or their value. Their worth goes far beyond a robo-unicorn, name-brand clothes or the iPhone 73 that everyone else has.
If you have teens, let them know if they pursue material things they're going to be a hamster on a wheel for the rest of their lives. They'll keep going around and around, always thinking the next thing is the one that will make them happy. But, of course, it won't. They'll just run in circles, wasting all their time and energy, and ultimately going nowhere. What God has in store for them is so much bigger than that.
One last reminder: Contentment isn't about age. It's about maturity. I've met 8-year-olds who get this, and 48-year-olds who don't.
Your child can probably tell where your heart is regarding material wants and desires. So, be sure to give yourself a heart-check and show your child what real happiness, joy and contentment look like.
If you or your kids are struggling with contentment this season, I have a whole episode of "The Rachel Cruze Show" with advice on how to have more gratitude over the holidays. Remember, more is caught than taught. When your kids see you acting out of gratitude, it can have a huge impact on how they view things, too!
As a No. 1 New York Times best-selling author and host of The Rachel Cruze Show, Rachel helps people learn the proper ways to handle money and stay out of debt. You can follow Cruze on Twitter and Instagram at @RachelCruze and online at rachelcruze.com.

Texto completo: One word was used to epitomize the entire 20th century.
Was it "progress," to mark the march of civilization from buggies to astronauts and the iPhone?
Maybe "upheaval," to delineate genocides and civic unrest?
No.
Try "jazz," to describe not only music, but the sweep and swing of the quintessential American century, and the cultural flows that invigorated it.
Who gets to decide such weighty, wordy things? The little-known American Dialect Society, or ADS, founded in 1889 and dedicated to the study of the English language in North America.
ADS has been picking a word of the year since 1990, longer than any other entity. Its members selected "jazz" from dozens of possible words in January 2000.
Now fast forward to the first week of 2020, when 300 to 400 of the society's language scholars are expected to meet in New Orleans to determine the word of 2019, as well as the even more consequential word of the decade that ends on New Year's Eve. The word of the previous decade, by the way, was "google," meaning "to search the internet."
Words of the year chosen by the ADS are not necessarily new words; they could be old ones used in new ways, said Marianna Di Paolo, emeritus linguistics professor and ADS member from the University of Utah. One example is "occupy," connected to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest against inequality.
During the last decade, the words of each year have bubbled out of the high-boiling soup of turbulent and tech-conscious times:
"App" in 2010. "Occupy" in 2011. "Hashtag" in 2012. "Because X" (a modern construction illustrated by the example, "Why would men wear capes? Because fashion") in 2013.
"#BlackLivesMatter" in 2014. "They" as a singular pronoun in 2015. "Dumpster fire" (describing election-related "public discourse and preoccupations") in 2016. "Fake news" in 2017. Last year, "tender-age shelter" (a euphemism referencing the facilities in which some immigrant children were separated from their parents). It beat out "the wall" (at the southern border).
The word of the decade won't necessarily be one of the yearly winners, said Ben Zimmer, the internationally known linguist and language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, who once penned the "On Language" column for The New York Times Magazine. The ADS draws up lists of candidates that may not become words of the year, but might still have a shot at being the 2010-19 representative.
Asked what he thinks the word of the decade will be, Zimmer was initially noncommittal.
"I wouldn't be surprised if 'they' as a singular pronoun does very well," he said.

The season of Adam Driver has been a full decade in the making

Texto completo: Watching a scene primarily concerned with the dynamic between a film's protagonist and his romantic rival, a viewer might not expect the random guy in the corner to attract too much attention. And yet as Oscar Isaac and Justin Timberlake's characters in 2013's 'Inside Llewyn Davis' record a novelty song begging President Kennedy not to shoot them into space, it isn't just their harmonizing or the lyrics that make the bizarre tune work, but the manner in which their screenmate Adam Driver punctuates it with comical noises and refrains " 'Outer … space!' " delivered in his trademark baritone.
That's Driver in a nutshell " someone who, in part thanks to his large presence and general way of being, can't help but command the screen. HBO's 'Girls,' on which he broke out as the volatile Adam Sackler, even features a scene in which another character notes that he 'does sort of look like the original man.' The episode aired in 2012, early in a decade that proved to be star-making for the Oscar-nominated actor, and which he has capped with a robust fall slate: He stars as a lead in two films, 'Marriage Story' and 'The Report,' and plays a villain in the upcoming holiday blockbuster 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.'
So how did the season of Adam Driver come to be? There's the aesthetic intrigue mentioned above, which once led the Guardian to ask the lanky actor about 'not being the standard Hollywood McHunk.' He candidly responded, 'I have been told before that I have an unusual face. But my face is my face.' His success is probably due more to how that sense of grounded honesty comes through in his performances. Driver, who trained at Juilliard after serving in the Marines, broadcasts a quiet intensity that can capture a range of feelings, sometimes all at once. In the earlier seasons of 'Girls,' for instance, Adam's mannerisms often display a mixture of pent-up rage and emotional vulnerability.
Driver has already earned accolades for his performance in Noah Baumbach's 'Marriage Story,' released Friday on Netflix; he won the Gotham Award for best actor Monday night, bolstering his stance as a front-runner in the Oscar race. Baumbach cast Driver in three other projects before this one, and it becomes clear while watching 'Marriage Story' that, as was the case with co-star Scarlett Johansson, the character was written with Driver in mind. They play a couple " theater director Charlie Barber and actress Nicole " whose marriage crumbles over misaligned priorities. Charlie's company is in New York, where the Barbers have raised their young son for most of his life. Nicole, who has long indulged Charlie's ego by putting off her dream of returning home to Los Angeles, moves back for work when they separate.
What follows is a meditation on divorce, a compassionate look at how it can liberate two people but still decimate their spirits as they reevaluate their life together. Baumbach infuses his script with comedy, but it's when the tension between Charlie and Nicole climaxes that the actors shine brightest. When an attempt to hash out the details of their divorce without lawyers escalates to a screaming match, Charlie, red-faced with frustration, shouts at Nicole, 'Every day I wake up and wish you were dead.' He immediately bursts into tears, falling to his knees and embracing Nicole's legs.
In a recent Hollywood Reporter interview, Driver said that, with such scenes, 'You don't push for emotion. It either happens or it doesn't.' He credited his ability to so transparently portray clashing feelings like Charlie's to the quality of a script, which rings true " several of his strongest performances are tied to acclaimed writers, including Lena Dunham, Jim Jarmusch, Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese.
The team effort is especially evident with Driver's more understated scenes. His final episode of 'Girls,' given the aptly awkward title 'What Will We Do This Time About Adam?' begins with Adam's desire to prove to his ex-girlfriend Hannah Horvath (Dunham), who he discovers is pregnant, that he has matured into a man who can help raise her child. Following the reunion is a dreamlike sequence that comes crashing down as they sit opposite one another at a diner. Though they continue to discuss the logistics of moving in together " Adam even suggests they get married " it dawns on them that the relationship won't work out. Hannah's eyes well up as Adam smiles wistfully, stuttering until his words come to a halt. They sit in silence for a bit. He comments on the quality of his soup.
Driver's turn as Senate staffer Daniel J. Jones in 'The Report' is similarly internal, this time a relatively restrained depiction of anger as he spends years investigating the CIA's use of torture after 9/11. Driver faces the tough task of anchoring a film that heavily involves sifting through paperwork in a confined space, but he accomplishes it by, as the New York Times put it, expressing that fury 'not in explosive confrontations, but in a gradually hardening resolve to protect and disseminate his findings.'
'With Driver, there's always a sense of something leashed, and his characters seem to be operating on a plane above and beyond everyone else,' reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis continues.
It's true of his Oscar-nominated role in Lee's 'BlacKkKlansman' as Flip Zimmerman, a brooding Jewish cop who goes undercover to take down the Ku Klux Klan. It's also true of his characters in two Jarmusch films: a bus driver devoted to poetry in 'Paterson,' a quiet film about the idyllic rituals of daily life; and a small-town officer in the horror-tinged absurdist comedy 'The Dead Don't Die,' who states from the moment things start to turn upside-down that zombies are to blame. (Or 'ghouls,' as he amusingly deadpans.)
And it's of course true of Kylo Ren, the Force-wielding 'Star Wars' villain who operates on another plane in the most literal sense. 'The Force Awakens' introduced Kylo as a Darth Vader 2.0, the ruthless son of two legends " Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) " who, in his quest for power, struggles to extinguish the light within him. Driver's greatest talent is arguably his ability to keep a character's fiercest emotions brimming beneath the surface, releasing them in bursts both great and small.
He avoids making a cartoonish sci-fi villain of Kylo by approaching him as he would a character in any 'prestige' project. There's a strange sort of kinship between his conflicted performance in 'The Last Jedi,' which allowed for a deeper exploration of Kylo's interiority, and Charlie Barber's reactions to the strain of divorce, or even Adam Sackler's battle with his more primal tendencies. The season of Adam Driver, a compressed display of the actor's talents that will only continue to spark awards buzz through February, has been nearly a decade in the making.

The weak case for impeachment and why it might backfire

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library. A sign next to the letter reads, “Despite the State Department’s many attempts to change it, the President finally demanded that his own personal draft be sent to Brezhnev accompanied by the State Department’s thoughts in a separate document.”
Imagine the news headlines that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s leaky crew could have made from that.
They certainly puffed up the importance of government workers who were never elected by anybody. “NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy,” the Intelligence Committee report states in a section titled, “The President’s Misconduct.” The talking points “included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” which was “a pillar of American foreign policy in the country” going all the way back to “the 1990s” but — cue the dramatic music — “this call would deviate significantly from that script.”
Of course, the president has a perfect right to deviate from the staff’s script and to make changes in the policy, but House Democrats, most of them, contend that Trump was motivated by the desire for personal political advantage.
Here’s what Trump said to the president of Ukraine: “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
And also, “I would like [Rudy Giuliani] to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
And also, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
In all three of those excerpts, Trump is asking Zelensky to work with the attorney general of the United States, William Barr. The AG is heading up an investigation into the suspicious origins of the Trump-Russia story that was used to justify a secret counter-intelligence investigation, then a secret warrant to spy on an American who was an adviser to the Trump campaign and then a two-year investigation by a special prosecutor that ultimately found nothing that linked Trump to Russia.
Barr’s investigation follows a narrower investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG has jurisdiction to investigate current employees of the government, but lacks wider authority. Still, Horowitz’s report is expected to shed light on the actions of FBI employees and others who made questionable decisions to investigate Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The report is set for release on Monday, Dec. 9.
Is it possible that the Democrats’ noisy rush to impeachment is a massive misdirection to neutralize the damage from coming reports about the actions of officials during the Obama administration?
We’ll see. Meanwhile, the signs of political damage are beginning to appear.
On Thursday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a one-hour televised town-hall meeting on CNN. Thirty-four minutes in, she was pleading with the audience, “Could we not have any more questions about impeachment?”
By November, that may be the Democrats’ campaign slogan.

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library. A sign next to the letter reads, “Despite the State Department’s many attempts to change it, the President finally demanded that his own personal draft be sent to Brezhnev accompanied by the State Department’s thoughts in a separate document.”
Imagine the news headlines that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s leaky crew could have made from that.
They certainly puffed up the importance of government workers who were never elected by anybody. “NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy,” the Intelligence Committee report states in a section titled, “The President’s Misconduct.” The talking points “included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” which was “a pillar of American foreign policy in the country” going all the way back to “the 1990s” but — cue the dramatic music — “this call would deviate significantly from that script.”
Of course, the president has a perfect right to deviate from the staff’s script and to make changes in the policy, but House Democrats, most of them, contend that Trump was motivated by the desire for personal political advantage.
Here’s what Trump said to the president of Ukraine: “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
And also, “I would like [Rudy Giuliani] to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
And also, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
In all three of those excerpts, Trump is asking Zelensky to work with the attorney general of the United States, William Barr. The AG is heading up an investigation into the suspicious origins of the Trump-Russia story that was used to justify a secret counter-intelligence investigation, then a secret warrant to spy on an American who was an adviser to the Trump campaign and then a two-year investigation by a special prosecutor that ultimately found nothing that linked Trump to Russia.
Barr’s investigation follows a narrower investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG has jurisdiction to investigate current employees of the government, but lacks wider authority. Still, Horowitz’s report is expected to shed light on the actions of FBI employees and others who made questionable decisions to investigate Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The report is set for release on Monday, Dec. 9.
Is it possible that the Democrats’ noisy rush to impeachment is a massive misdirection to neutralize the damage from coming reports about the actions of officials during the Obama administration?
We’ll see. Meanwhile, the signs of political damage are beginning to appear.
On Thursday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a one-hour televised town-hall meeting on CNN. Thirty-four minutes in, she was pleading with the audience, “Could we not have any more questions about impeachment?”
By November, that may be the Democrats’ campaign slogan.

Texto completo: The American criminal justice system has never been as good about ferreting out truth and justice as most people would like to think. The system relies on the memories and judgments of human beings, which makes it fallible and, worse, subject to manipulation.
A new in-depth look at the career of a single jailhouse informant brings the system’s failings into sharp relief and stands as an irrefutable indictment of capital punishment and the criminal justice system itself.
The article, by investigative reporter Pamela Colloff (published by ProPublica and the New York Times Magazine), follows the life of a two-bit grifter named Paul Skalnik who routinely spun lies about fellow jail inmates - including those facing murder charges - to get special treatment for his own crimes, which included fraud, grand theft and child sexual abuse.
One of the men convicted based on Skalnik’s testimony, James M. Dailey, recently received a reprieve from his scheduled November execution date until Dec. 30 to allow his lawyers time to pursue an appeal based on new evidence that he did not commit murder in 1985.
There was no evidence placing Dailey at the murder scene, and the killer, who initially fingered Dailey, has recanted, saying he acted alone.
That leaves the apparent perjury by Skalnik that Dailey - who says he knew Skalnik was a snitch and refused to talk to him in jail - confessed to the crime.
It would be comforting to say, well, this is an aberration. But it’s not. Skalnik’s testimony helped send dozens of people to prison, and three others besides Dailey to death row.
But it’s not just Skalnik. At least one in five exonerations involve convictions based at least in part on testimony by jailhouse informants. In murder cases, the National Registry of Exonerations reports at least 70% of exonerations involved lying witnesses and official misconduct.
Florida is the nation’s leader in murder exonerations with 29 cases; California has had five convicted murders later exonerated. A study published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences estimated that at least 4% of the 2,500 people on death row nationwide are innocent of the crimes for which they have been condemned.
That’s roughly 100 people.
Statistics can be cold. The story of how Skalnik played the system puts it into a human dimension.
As do the stories of Cameron Todd Willingham, Carlos DeLuna and others put to death despite clear signs of innocence, or, at a minimum, significant doubts as to their guilt.

Surgeons Successfully Transplant a Testicle From One Brother to His Identical Twin

Texto completo: The rare operation has implications for wounded soldiers, accident victims, cancer patients and those undergoing sex reassignment.
A 36-year-old man born without testicles received one transplanted from his identical twin brother in a six-hour operation performed on Tuesday in Belgrade, Serbia, by an international team of surgeons.
The surgery was intended to give the recipient more stable levels of the male hormone testosterone than injections could provide, to make his genitals more natural and more comfortable, and to enable him to father children, said Dr. Dicken Ko, a transplant surgeon and urology professor at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, who flew to Belgrade to help with the procedure.
The operation was only the third known transplant of this type. The first two were performed 40 years ago in St. Louis, also for identical twins, each pair with a brother lacking testicles.
The absence of testicles is an exceedingly rare condition, but doctors say that the surgery may have broader applications for transgender people, accident victims, wounded soldiers and cancer patients. But the procedure raises questions about the ethics of transplants that are not lifesaving, and about the possibility of recipients' someday fathering children with sperm from donors who may not even be related to them.
The surgery was performed at the University Children's Clinic in Tirsova, a section of Belgrade. The Serbian brothers are doing well, doctors said. By Friday, the recipient already had normal testosterone levels.
"He's good, he looks good, his brother looks good," Dr. Ko said in a telephone interview on Friday. The donor, who already has children, should remain as fertile as he was before, despite giving up a testicle.
Dr. Ko said the brothers, who have been sharing a hospital room, were expected to go home this weekend. They preferred not to be identified or interviewed, the doctors said.
Because the patients are identical twins with the same genetic makeup, there is no concern that the recipient's body will reject the transplant, so he does not have to take the immune-suppressing drugs that most transplant patients need.

Surgeons operated on the brothers simultaneously, in adjoining rooms. The procedure was challenging because it required sewing together two arteries and two veins that were less than 2 millimeters wide.
"Once you remove the testicle from the donor, the clock starts ticking very fast," said Dr. Branko Bojovic, an expert in microsurgery at Harvard Medical School and part of the team in Belgrade.
"Within two to four hours, you have to have it re-perfused and working again," Dr. Bojovic said. Without a blood supply, a testicle is viable for only four to six hours.
It can take 30 to 60 minutes to make each of the four blood-vessel connections. But the team managed to complete them all in less than two hours, he said.
The team did not connect a structure called the vas deferens, which carries sperm out of the testicles. The surgeons could not find the tissue in the recipient needed for the connection, which means that for now, he cannot father children in the usual way.
Another operation to make the connection may be possible. Otherwise, if the recipient wants children, he might undergo a procedure to extract sperm from the testicle for in vitro fertilization. Or his twin brother's sperm could be used.
Dr. Ko and Dr. Bojovic were both part of the surgical team that performed the first penis transplant in the United States, in 2016, on a man whose penis had been removed because of cancer.
Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic, who led the team in Belgrade, specializes in urologic reconstruction and sex reassignment surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and at the University of Belgrade. He said the brothers approached him after learning that he had performed a successful uterus transplant between twins sisters, which enabled the recipient to give birth.
Dr. Bojovic said that after the penis transplant, the surgical team received inquiries from people undergoing female-to-male sex reassignment who wondered if they might receive transplants instead of the usual surgery, which creates a penis from the patient's own tissue.
But a transplant from any donor other than an identical twin would require immune-suppressing drugs to prevent rejection. The drugs have side effects that lead some experts to argue that the bar for such transplants must be very high.
"It's becoming more of a popular topic for these patients," Dr. Bojovic said. "They say, 'If immunosuppression is getting safer, I don't want to use a big piece of tissue from my forearm or thigh or back for something that looks like phallus but isn't."'
He added that in patients having male-to-female reassignment surgery, the penis and testicles that were surgically removed are discarded, but in theory could be used for transplants.
The lead surgeon, Dr. Djordjevic, said that he had developed a surgical plan for transplanting a penis onto a body that is anatomically female, and that he hoped to begin performing that surgery within the next year or so.
"We have to do this as soon as possible, to stop putting healthy organs in the garbage," he said.
But he would not transplant testicles as part of transgender surgery, he said. Doing so would open up the thorny possibility that the recipient could have children produced by the donor's sperm. If the idea were extended to deceased organ donors, special permission would be required from them before death, or from their families.
"Then the offspring is technically whose child?" asked Dr. Ko, who is also chief medical officer at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston. "It raises much debate in the literature of medical ethics."
Last year, when surgeons at Johns Hopkins Hospital transplanted a penis, scrotum and other tissue to a young soldier who had been maimed in combat, they deliberately left out the testicles. The idea that he might father children who were genetically someone else's was considered unacceptable.
The first report of a testicle transplant, by Dr. Sherman J. Silber, a fertility specialist in St. Louis, was published in a medical journal in 1978. In that case, the twin brothers were 30 when they consulted Dr. Silber.
The brother without testicles had not reached puberty until he was given testosterone at age 18, which caused a growth spurt that left him four inches taller than his brother. He needed regular testosterone injections to maintain his masculine characteristics, but the hormone levels fluctuated and sometimes caused mood swings.
He spent five years searching for a doctor who could perform a testicle transplant before he found Dr. Silber, after reading a New York Times article about his work published in 1975.
Dr. Silber said that he had performed more than 2,000 kidney transplants in rats, which required microsurgical techniques to sew together minute blood vessels the same size as those in human testicles.
"So doing a testicle transplant was not a big deal," he recalled in an interview on Thursday. "It was like just another kidney transplant in a rat." He said the operation took two hours.
Dr. Silber said that the donor was gay and the recipient straight, and that the brothers told him they wondered if the transplanted testicle might somehow alter the recipient's sexual orientation. There is no scientific reason for such an effect, and none occurred.
The transplant was a success, and the recipient eventually had five children, Dr. Silber said. A year or so later, he performed the surgery again for another pair of identical twin brothers, though he did not write up their case in a journal.
Regarding the operation in Belgrade, Dr. Silber said, "I imagine these surgeons must be pretty good, because most people wouldn't dare to try this."

Texto completo: Results for the latest administration of the Program for International Student Assessment, a key exam given to 15-year-old students worldwide, show poor performance in reading and math among U.S. students, with the Common Core national standards and aligned curriculum a likely significant contributing factor.
The PISA exam tests reading, math, and science. Among the 79 countries where the exam is administered, the top scorers were students in four provinces in China — Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zheijiang.
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which oversees the PISA exam, the Chinese students not only outperformed students in all other countries in math and reading, but “the 10% most disadvantaged in these four provinces showed better reading skills than those of the average student in OECD countries, and performed on par with the 10% most advantaged students in some of them.”
“What makes their achievement even more remarkable,” says the OECD, “is that the level of income in these four Chinese regions is well below the OECD average.”
Such results should be concerning to every American given that Communist China’s goal, according to Liu Mingfu, a retired Chinese army colonel and highly influential professor at China’s National Defense University, “is to surpass the United States in overall national power in terms of the economy as well as science and technology.”
Indeed, in comparison, U.S. students’ math scores were not just below the Chinese scores, but behind many other countries, including Portugal, Slovakia, and Lithuania.
In reading, the United States did slightly better, but still scored far below the Chinese. As the New York Times noted, “The performance of American teenagers in reading and math has been stagnant since 2000.”
And unlike the high performance of disadvantaged students in China, the Times pointed out that the “achievement gap between high and low performers [in the U.S.] is widening.”
According to an OECD official quoted by the Times, about one-fifth of American 15-year-olds scored so low on the PISA test that it appeared they had not mastered the reading skills expected of a 10-year-old.
Those students, said the official, face “pretty grim prospects” on the job market.
The PISA trends mirror the results on the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress exam, America’s so-called report card.
Not only did large majorities of students fail to perform at the proficient level in reading and math on the NAEP exam, but the gap between high-performing and low-performing students widened in places such as California.
In fact, in California, the gap between high and low performing students widened by a full-grade's worth on the eighth-grade NAEP math test.
There is a possibility that Common Core may have something to do with the widening performance gap between high and low achievers. That's because the gap has increased since 2012, which was around the time that Common Core was first implemented.
The Times cited a Harvard education professor, who said that the blame lies partly with states and school districts, which did not effectively carry out Common Core, and recommended that low-income students be provided with social workers.
Please.
First of all, such apologies for Common Core sound like the old discredited leftist refrain that communism has never succeeded because it has never truly been tried and that all communist catastrophes are the result of poor implementation. Second, remember that the most disadvantaged Chinese students performed as well as the most advantaged students in many countries — and it is a sure thing that those Chinese students were not provided social workers to raise their achievement.
Third, it is simply obvious that Common Core is having a negative impact on U.S. student performance.
Ze’ev Wurman, former senior policy adviser at the U.S. Department of Education under President George W. Bush and one of the most informed critics of Common Core, has observed: “In addition to being mediocre in its academic expectations, Common Core dragged in its unscientific and discredited pedagogy,” such as the “de-emphasis of fluency with arithmetic and number manipulation [in math].”
Pacific Research Institute’s 2018 report “An American Education Agenda” recommends that states should repeal their Common Core standards and replace them with proven standards, such as Massachusetts’s previous state standards, and should enact comprehensive school-choice programs to give parents and their children the opportunity to access better schooling alternatives.
The bottom line: We cannot afford to let China eat our education lunch.

Texto completo: The creators of a popular true-crime podcast have signed a deal worth at least $10 million with E.W. Scripps Co.'s Stitcher podcasting unit, according to people familiar with the agreement, signaling the nascent medium's rapid growth.
Stitcher is to provide advertising representation and development funds as well as additional resources to support the overall production of Exactly Right Network, maker of the hit podcast "My Favorite Murder." In the two-year agreement, the companies plan to develop more than a dozen new podcasts.
If the shows reach certain goals for listenership, downloads or other performance metrics, Stitcher could end up paying more than $10 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The deal, one of the largest ever of its kind, comes at the end of a year in which Spotify Technology SA, iHeartMedia Inc., Sirius XM Holdings Inc. and Entercom Communications Corp. made big bets on podcasting.
"The interest and commitment by those companies signal this will be a growing and permanent part of the media landscape," said Stitcher Chief Executive Erik Diehn. "It's been cemented in investors' and advertisers' eyes."
U.S. ad revenue from podcasts climbed 53% to $479 million last year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP projected it to rise to $678.7 million this year and exceed $1 billion by 2021. Among the U.S. population over 12 years old, the share of people who have ever listened to a podcast topped 50% last year, according to Edison Research. An estimated 90 million—or 32% of the population—are monthly podcast listeners, the market research firm found.
Exactly Right's six existing podcasts, including "The Murder Squad" and "This Podcast Will Kill You," are expected to gross nearly $10 million in 2019, according to a person familiar with the matter, and more next year.
Stitcher runs a free podcast listening app and a premium $4.99 monthly service that lets subscribers listen to podcasts ad-free. It also owns podcast networks including Earwolf and Stitcher Podcasts. In partnership with outside networks like the Ringer and the Oprah Winfrey Network, Stitcher distributes some podcasts and sells advertising for them through its Midroll Media advertising unit.
Started by comedian Karen Kilgariff and former television personality Georgia Hardstark in 2016, "My Favorite Murder" is one of the most popular podcasts, with more than 34 million monthly listeners globally. On each weekly episode the hosts discuss a murder, true crime or survivor story in a comedic manner. The podcast has spawned lucrative merchandise and live-performance businesses as well as enthusiastic fans, known as "Murderinos."
Last month the duo hosted a two-day festival at Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara, Calif. Their book, "Stay Sexy & Don't Get Murdered," spent three weeks atop the New York Times best-seller list.
Ms. Kilgariff and Ms. Hardstark created Exactly Right Network in 2018 to produce more podcasts.
"Everyone is starting to understand what the actual business of the business is," said Ms. Kilgariff. "Coming from comedy, podcasting used to just be what you did on the weekend. Now people are seeing it as a business."
Stitcher started helping to sell advertising for "My Favorite Murder" in 2017. Since then, revenue from the podcast has grown dramatically, according to a person familiar with the matter. Under the new deal, Stitcher will aid in production and finance show development across the Exactly Right Network, including paying to hire personnel for positions in marketing, business development, production and advertising representation.
Oren Rosenbaum, an agent representing Mses. Kilgariff and Hardstark, said the deal represents the acceleration in podcasting's growth.
"The audience is there, and advertisers want to be in business with Karen and Georgia," he said.

Spotify, the second-largest podcast platform globally behind Apple Inc., recently acquired a trio of podcasting companies for around $400 million—part of a plan to spend as much as $500 million altogether on such deals this year. In June, Spotify struck a deal with the entertainment-production company started by Barack and Michelle Obama to develop and produce podcasts exclusively for the streaming service. The deal was valued at just under $10 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Spotify has made nearly four dozen deals this year for original and exclusive podcasts.
In October, Walt Disney Co.'s Marvel Entertainment struck a deal to create exclusive podcasts for Sirius XM Holdings Inc.'s satellite radio and streaming services.
Six-figure podcast deals are now commonplace, according to people in the industry, who add that $1 million outlays are now becoming somewhat regular. As money from advertising continues to rise and platforms like Spotify and iHeart rush to serve their audiences with the top podcasts, valuations are pushed even higher.
"There is this content race that allows these creators to benefit," he said.

Lawsuit Objects to a Rule Aimed at Visa Applicants

Texto completo: Visa applicants must disclose their social media user names, a rule that grew out of Trump's vow of "extreme vetting" of foreign visitors. A new lawsuit objects.
WASHINGTON -- A pair of documentary film organizations sued the Trump administration on Thursday over its requirement that foreigners disclose their social media accounts -- including pseudonymous ones -- when they apply for visas.
The lawsuit, which raises novel issues about privacy and surveillance in the social-media era, challenged a rule the State Department put into effect this year. The requirement grew out of President Trump's campaign promise of "extreme vetting" and his early executive orders that barred travel into the United States from several Muslim-majority nations.
In particular, the lawsuit argues, forcing people from authoritarian countries to disclose the pseudonyms they use to discuss politically sensitive matters could endanger them by creating a risk that the information gets back to their own governments. As a result, it said, they will be less likely either to express themselves on social media or to apply for visas.
"Many people use pseudonyms on social media so that they can speak anonymously about sensitive or controversial issues, and so that they can shield themselves or their families or associates from possible reprisals by state or private actors," the plaintiffs wrote. "The registration requirement effectively conditions their eligibility for U.S. visas on their readiness to surrender their online anonymity."
The Trump administration announced the rule in 2018 and started enforcing it this year. The State Department changed its visa application forms to require applicants to disclose all identifiers they have used on any of 20 social media platforms for the past five years, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The rule covers about 14.7 million people who apply for a visa each year.
The complaint, filed in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, challenged both the State Department, which administers visa applications, and the Department of Homeland Security, which it says uses visa application data for other purposes, including administering immigration law.
The Trump administration did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. But in a pair of postings, Twitter expressed opposition to the State Department rule, saying it chilled free speech.
The complaint maintains that administration officials improperly developed the rule -- arguing that they failed to point to evidence that it would be effective and necessary -- and that it violates the Constitution by chilling rights of free speech and association.
Visa applicants "must consider the risk that a U.S. official will misinterpret their speech on social media, impute others' speech to them, or subject them to additional scrutiny or delayed processing because of the views they or their contacts have expressed," the lawsuit said.
Demanding the data also creates the risk that authoritarian and other rights-abusing governments, "including some U.S. allies," may use it to unmask anonymous dissidents, it said.
"Those who use pseudonymous identifiers must take into account that they will have to relinquish their online anonymity to U.S. officials when they submit their visa applications, and they must also consider the risk that U.S. officials will disclose their social media identifiers to foreign governments, reveal the identifiers inadvertently, or fail to protect the identifiers from third parties who might access them unlawfully."
The lawsuit was jointly developed by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. They are representing the two documentary film organizations -- Doc Society, based in Brooklyn, and the International Documentary Association, based in Los Angeles -- that host conferences and workshops that bring foreign filmmakers and social activists to American soil.
While most of the people affected by the new rule are foreigners abroad, who generally do not have constitutional rights, the lawsuit noted that the requirement also covers people with substantial ties to the United States, including people already residing on domestic soil -- like foreign students and foreigners with work permits -- who renew their visas while abroad.
Since the change took effect, visa applicants from abroad have been compelled to disclose to American consular officials all social-media handles or user names they have used on major platforms, 12 of which are based in the United States: Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Myspace, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vine and YouTube.
The forms also ask about a Russian service, VK; a Belgian one, Twoo; a Latvian one, Ask.fm; and five Chinese sites: Douban, QQ, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo and Youku.
The forms do not require applicants to turn over their passwords to see nonpublic information. But the complaint stresses the risk created by forcing people to turn over pseudonymous accounts, citing partners of the plaintiffs who have used them to "conduct sensitive research for a film about Nazis online, including joining discussion groups and contacting members of known Nazis' families" and a member from Syria who "uses pseudonymous accounts as a safety measure against political persecution."
The lawsuit said some partners and members of the plaintiffs are now self-censoring, including deleting old posts that criticized the Trump administration's policies. Others "are no longer applying for U.S. visas -- and are forgoing personal, educational, and professional opportunities" because they fear the consequences of disclosing their social media accounts.
"The government simply has no legitimate interest in collecting this kind of sensitive information on this immense scale, and the First Amendment doesn't permit it to do so," said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight Institute.

Texto completo: As the billionaire's defamation trial in Los Angeles entered its third day, a professor testified that the Twitter message had generated hundreds of articles.
The billionaire Elon Musk's Twitter post calling the cave explorer Vernon Unsworth "pedo guy" led to hundreds of articles online, a Penn State University professor testified on Thursday.
The professor, Jim Jansen, a web analytics researcher, said that according to his research, from July to September 2018, 490 articles from 361 websites representing 33 countries were published in English referring to "pedo guy" and "pedophilia." They represented major companies, such as The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Time, Fox News and Breitbart. Mr. Jansen said that Mr. Musk never referred to Mr. Unsworth as a pedophile but that the word might have appeared in those articles.
The testimony came on the third and final day of the trial over Mr. Unsworth's defamation lawsuit against Mr. Musk in Los Angeles. Jury instructions and final arguments were scheduled to be given on Friday.
The trial has centered on a bitter exchange between Mr. Musk and Mr. Unsworth from summer 2018, as each separately sought to help rescue a group of boys trapped in a cave in Thailand.
As international attention on the trapped children intensified, Mr. Musk, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Tesla, sent a team of engineers to the scene and proposed an unusual rescue strategy: a minisubmarine.
Mr. Unsworth, a veteran cave explorer with experience navigating the very system in which the group was trapped, dismissed the idea as impractical in a CNN interview, saying that Mr. Musk could "stick his submarine where it hurts."
Mr. Musk, who at the time had 22 million followers on Twitter, responded with the "pedo guy" post.
On Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Musk argued that the comment, however impolite, did not cause Mr. Unsworth any reputational damage.
Bill Price, one of Mr. Musk's lawyers, pointed to a photograph of Mr. Unsworth standing next to the British prime minister at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street, as well as a Daily Mail video of a smiling Mr. Unsworth celebrating the cave rescue.
Since the Twitter exchange, the lawyer said, Mr. Unsworth has been approached by a music producer seeking to represent him in book or movie deals and has participated in two documentaries about the rescue. "Nothing Mr. Musk tweeted got in your way," Mr. Price said.
So far, Mr. Musk's defense has rested largely on the claim that "pedo guy" is a generic insult common in his childhood home of South Africa rather than an actual accusation of pedophilia.
"It's quite common in the English-speaking world," Mr. Musk argued from the witness stand on Tuesday, the opening day of the trial. "I'm quite confident if you do a search, it will just say 'creepy old dude."'
Mr. Unsworth and his lawyers dispute that notion, arguing that Mr. Musk was actively trying to damage the explorer's reputation. In an interview, Mr. Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, declined to say how much his client was seeking in damages from Mr. Musk, but added, "We believe the evidence justifies a substantial award."
The final witness on Thursday was Vanessa Unsworth, Mr. Unsworth's wife, who appeared in a recorded deposition. While they are still married, the two separated in 2013 and they have only limited contact. She said Mr. Unsworth might have come across as aggressive during the Thai rescue effort because "he was extremely concerned about getting the kids out" of the cave.
After the jury was excused, the judge said that it could find negligence even without malice.
Mr. Musk deleted the tweets in July 2018, explaining in a subsequent post that he had written them in anger.
Still, Mr. Musk later told a BuzzFeed News reporter in an email that Mr. Unsworth was a "child rapist" who had married a 12-year-old -- claims that Mr. Unsworth vehemently denies.
While the judge supervising the trial, Stephen Wilson, has said the BuzzFeed episode is not the subject of the case, the story has come up repeatedly as a potential window into how Mr. Musk understood the term "pedo guy."
Mr. Musk has had plenty to say. On the stand this week, he lamented the chain of events that his tweets had set in motion. "It should've just been, 'Here's a rescue, and that's great,"' he testified.
"I apologized," he added. "And I apologize again."

Texto completo: A former Playboy model who claims to have had an affair with President Trump prior to his inauguration filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News on Thursday.
The model, Karen McDougal, alleges that network host Tucker Carlson intentionally defamed her on his show on Dec. 10, 2018. Carlson accused the former model of extortion and claimed, in part, that she "approached Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if he doesn't give them money." He also classified her behavior as "a classic case of extortion," however he did not mention her by name during the show, only showing a photo of her.
McDougal's lawsuit, which was filed in New York, seeks damages from Fox for tarnishing her reputation, however, it does not name Carlson as a defendant in it, according to the New York Times. She claimed the network is responsible for his comments because they were verifiable, while her lawyer argued that a reasonable person watching Carlson's show would've thought she was a criminal. McDougal also claimed in the suit that she never threatened Trump.
"FOX News will vigorously defend Tucker Carlson against these meritless claims," a Fox News representative told the Washington Examiner.
McDougal has said that she and Trump met at the Playboy Mansion in 2006, and they began a 10-month affair that ultimately ended when she felt guilty about Trump cheating on his wife. The president has denied the affair.
Prior to the 2016 presidential election, the National Enquirer purchased the rights to McDougal's story for $150,000 and proceeded not to publish it — a practice that's commonly known as "catch and kill." She was restricted from discussing the alleged affair until she came to a settlement agreement with American Media, Inc. in April, 2018.
Trump has denied knowing about the payment from the National Enquirer, however, he caught discussing the story with his then fixer Michael Cohen, but the conversation was revealed through a secret recording made by Cohen.

Re "How Juul Got a Generation Hooked" (front page, Nov. 24):
I was amazed to learn that Juul Labs is now worth more than the Ford Motor Company.
We once had a manufacturing economy, then a service economy and now, it seems, an addiction economy. The big winners are those who can get consumers hooked on their products (opiates, video games, e-cigarettes), never mind the personal and social costs.
For whom is this economy working, exactly?

Trump declines to send lawyers into fray, rejecting precedent of Nixon, Clinton

Texto completo: The showdown had been years in the making, Bill Clinton's personal lawyer confronting the lead investigator pushing for the second-ever impeachment of a sitting president.
'Mr. Starr, good evening,' David Kendall, the presidential attorney, said in November 1998.
'Good evening,' replied Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel investigating Clinton. 'How are you, David?'
'I'm very well, Ken,' Kendall said.
For the next hour, the two legal giants squared off in a prime-time clash exactly a month before the House voted to impeach Clinton for his effort to cover up an affair with a White House intern. They debated the facts of the case and the merits of impeachment, as both Republicans and Democrats barely said a word.
It was the sort of legal battle royal that President Trump would probably love to see from his legal team: one that is feisty and carried live on national cable TV.
But Trump, unlike Clinton and President Richard Nixon in 1974, has opted against having legal advisers present for the House Judiciary Committee's first impeachment hearing Wednesday.
The White House decision, delivered to Democrats on Sunday evening, accused them of a 'complete lack of due process' but left open the possibility that his legal team 'may consider participating' in future hearings if they are deemed a true process.
That move relinquishes Trump's side of the fight to Republicans on the committee, an unusual move for a president who loves to see his own top aides in public sparring with Democrats and the media. Many of those GOP lawmakers are his closest allies, and they plan to vigorously fight Democrats over committee procedures.
Some Republicans have quietly wondered whether this is a mistake, that it leaves out another combatant in the room who would be on Trump's side. Besides, this president's go-for-the-jugular instincts would normally call for putting as many fighters on his side as possible, making for the biggest splash on TV.
But some of his allies believe this is the right strategy, to dismiss these hearings as illegitimate. 'I'm sure his gut instinct was to go in there himself, but no, to me the best advice is to not to " don't give this thing any more credibility than it deserves,' said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).
King, who sat ringside with Trump last month at Madison Square Garden at a mixed-martial arts title fight, does not believe the president's team should only consider participating in the likely Senate trial overseen by the GOP majority there.
Still, King wonders how Trump will respond as the hearings unfold and whether, like a showrunner on an old reality-TV show, the president will want to inject new characters. 'It's his combative nature. I don't know how he will react,' he said.
This week marks the third Judiciary Committee impeachment consideration over the past 45 years, and each is quite different from the others. The Richard Nixon impeachment was a long, slow process starting with the 1972 Watergate break-in and including more than a year of congressional hearings before Nixon's resignation in August 1974.
In the Clinton impeachment, an Arkansas land deal made while he was serving as that state's governor eventually spawned an independent counsel probe. That investigation, expanded after the affair revelation in 1998, led to a fast-breaking impeachment with several weeks of hearings to review Starr's report.
The 2019 investigation was entirely handled by the House Intelligence Committee for two months in closed-door depositions and then public hearings, in which Republicans had equal time to question witnesses.
After Wednesday's hearing with constitutional law professors, the Judiciary Committee will probably hear from the House Intelligence Committee " Daniel S. Goldman, the top counsel for the Democrats, and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) " to present their roughly 300-page report.
For now, it appears there will be no high-profile questioning by the president's lawyer.
That's not what Nixon decided in 1974, when he sent his top defense lawyer, James D. St. Clair, to impeachment proceedings. The highest-profile clash came July-11, when the president's legal team finally got the chance to cross-examine its biggest foe, John Dean, the former Nixon counsel who provided damaging testimony saying Nixon knew of the coverup early on and did nothing to stop it.
One lawmaker told the New York Times that St. Clair's cross-examination was a 'bloodletting' of Dean, while another jokingly asked for a 'sponge' to clean up the mess as Nixon's lawyers punched at inconsistencies in the former aide's timeline.
Twenty-four years later, Clinton sent Kendall into the lion's den of a Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee.
Kendall, a major legal figure at the esteemed firm Williams - Connolly, and Starr, a former federal judge, had already clashed behind closed doors, including at Clinton's grand-jury testimony in August 1998.
But Kendall's cooperation with the Judiciary Committee gave him the chance to pepper his longtime adversary in public. First Starr gave a two-hour summary of his staff's report, followed by questioning from Democrats and Republicans.
Finally, the nighttime exchange went from Kendall asking about details of his investigation to questions about how Starr's inquiry grew into examining an extramarital affair. At times, the attorney cut Starr off when he was filibustering.
'Mr. Starr, I have only 30 minutes,' Kendall said.
When time was up, Republicans agreed to give Kendall an additional 30 minutes, without any objections.
King, who opposed Clinton's impeachment, said that Trump's lawyers would not offer much to this month's hearings if there are no fact witnesses to question, the way Kendall could question Starr.
'Now you just have one politician against another. It's Adam Schiff against Devin Nunes,' he said, referring to the chairman and the ranking Republican of the Intelligence Committee.
And as feisty as the St. Clair and Kendall cross-examinations were, their work did little to stall the momentum for impeachment.
Less than three weeks after the fierce session with Dean, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, who resigned less than two weeks later.
In 1998, as his session with Starr concluded, Kendall pleaded for more time to question his nemesis. 'It's been a long day,' he said. 'I would come back tomorrow if that were appropriate.'
Republicans said no. Two weeks later, Clinton's legal team sent a more good-cop set of lawyers to present the final argument to prevent impeachment, arguing his behavior was personally reprehensible but not a high crime or misdemeanor.
On Dec.-19, 1998, the full House approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton.

New York Times writer says Democrats shouldn't pass USMCA because it would help Trump

Texto completo: House Democrats don't need advice from journalists on how to be ruthlessly partisan, because that's their natural state. But left-wing writer Jamelle Bouie is here to help where he can.
In an opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday, Bouie cautioned Democrats against voting in favor of the Trump administration's new trade deal with Mexico and Canada solely because it would be politically helpful for the president:
Bouie wrote, "Passing a bill only validates Trump’s oft-made claim that he’s an expert deal-maker, and as the presidential election nears, bolstering the president means you’re boosting his party."
Naked partisanship is usually cloaked in some kind of faux outrage or feigned concern about consequences of some particular action. But not this time. Not Bouie. The only thing Democrats need to consider is their prospects in 2020.
This comes, by the way, after most liberals in the media belittled the new trade deal, known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as a slightly tweaked version of NAFTA.
The deal, which is awaiting a vote in Congress while Democrats play around with impeachment, actually makes significant changes to the existing agreement, particularly when it comes to the auto industry, which was crushed by NAFTA.
From the Wall Street Journal:
The USMCA requires a greater portion of cars—75%, up from 62.5% under Nafta—be made in North America to qualify for tariff-free trade. ... The new deal also requires that 40% to 45% of automotive content be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour, a new provision aimed at shifting production from Mexico back to the U.S. and Canada. U.S. officials say Mexican pledges in the deal to boost the power of its labor unions will have a similar effect. The pact also weakens protections for multinationals investing in other countries, a change Trump officials say will discourage outsourcing. It sets de facto quotas on Mexican and Canadian auto exports to the U.S. It requires the countries to conduct regular reviews of the USMCA, including a prospect for termination.
Unlike NAFTA, the USMCA would also penalize governments that manipulate their currency, according to the Wall Street Journal, as China has been known to do.
All of that would be a needed, positive change to trade with our neighboring countries. Every working American would win.
But Democrats don't want to do that, because, as Bouie said, certifying the deal "only validates Trump’s oft-made claim that he’s an expert deal-maker." And they just can't stand to give him the win, even if it's good for the country.

Texto completo: Ronald Reagan got elected President in 1980 by posing a simple question to American voters: "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" The answers doomed incumbent Jimmy Carter, who struggled to address a sagging economy at home and an expanding communist threat abroad. In 1984, U.S. voters answered Reagan's question again by handing him a 49-state landslide re-election victory.
In less than a year, Americans will once again have an opportunity to entrust someone with the job of protecting their security and the liberty that enables their prosperity. Polls show that our current President, Donald Trump, is receiving his typically mediocre approval ratings (essentially unchanged by Washington's impeachment circus). But if there's a sense of optimism around Team Trump about the 2020 campaign, it's probably because their candidate seems prepared to be judged on the Reagan standard.
A new Economist/YouGov poll out today asks Americans the question: "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" Among registered voters, 50% say yes and just 32% say no, while 17% say they're not sure. Even among the President's opponents there is some acknowledgment of progress in the Trump era. While 52% of Democratic primary voters say they are not better off since year seven of the Obama presidency, 26% say they are and 22% say they're not sure. Among self-described moderates, a plurality say they are better off, as do large majorities of conservatives and Republicans. The cautionary note for Mr. Trump is that registered voters are essentially split on the question of whether the country is better off.
Looking at various polls, the President continues to enjoy strong approval ratings when it comes to the economy. Maintaining this strength may depend on some resolution of trade disputes. Dan Clifton of Strategas Research reports today, "Trump's approval rating is positively correlated with a higher probability of a US-China trade deal."
While the results of this and many of Mr. Trump's other foreign policy efforts remain to be determined, he seems to have succeeded in persuading European countries to bolster their defenses. At a lunch today in the United Kingdom, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg directed the following remarks to Mr. Trump, according to the official White House transcript:
...thank you so much for hosting this lunch with nine countries... that are spending 2 percent of GDP on defense... a few years ago, there were only three countries. And so this is actually more than twice as many countries just since a few years ago.
... your leadership on defense spending, Mr. President, is having an impact, because more Allies meet the 2 percent guideline. All Allies have started to increase. The majority of Allies have plans in place to meet the 2 percent guideline by 2024. And the European Allies and Canada have added $130 billion to the defense budget since 2016. And this number will be $400 billion by 2024... This is making NATO stronger.
At a similar point in Reagan's first term, as he prepared for his re-election campaign, America's 40th President could take comfort in an economy which would grow at 4.6% in 1983 and a stunning 7.2% in the year of his landslide re-election. Today the U.S. economy is growing much more slowly, but jobs have never been more plentiful.
As for his foreign policy agenda, President Reagan faced great skepticism. On this date in 1983, a New York Times editorial lambasted Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed system to shoot down Soviet missiles in flight before they could ever reach the United States. The Times opined:
The best time to stop any phase of the arms race is before it begins. Now is the time, therefore, to head off a dangerous, expensive and futile new competition in space. But President Reagan has been struck, like Icarus, by the dream of mastering space. He appears to be pressing the quest for an elaborate Star Wars ''defense'' that might, next century, render Soviet missiles obsolete... The way to stop this madness is to join the Russians in an effective agreement to keep all weapons out of space.
Fortunately for humanity, Reagan ignored the New York Times. Within a decade, after the collapse of the Soviet empire, it became clear to all that the Reagan plan had been critical in persuading the Soviet dictatorship that it could no longer compete with American technology and was better off trying to open its closed society to new ideas.
In 1993 the Washington Post reported that former Soviet officials were acknowledging the importance of the Reagan project:
Speaking at a Princeton University conference on the end of the Cold War, the officials said former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev was convinced any attempt to match Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, which was launched in 1983 to build a space-based defense against missiles, would do irreparable harm to the Soviet economy.

Texto completo: California Sen. Kamala Harris said she is dropping out of the Democratic presidential race, completing a surprising fall for a once-promising contender who drew 20,000 people to her campaign launch early this year.
Ms. Harris decided to exit from the race Monday after a discussion with her family and senior aides and after doing an audit of the campaign's finances, according to a senior aide. She was one of only seven candidates to qualify for the party's December debate, but she still didn't see a path forward.
In an email to supporters that was also posted online , Ms. Harris said she "simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue."
"I'm not a billionaire," she said in the email. "I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can't tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don't believe I do."
Ms. Harris also canceled a major fundraiser in New York City Tuesday. Her campaign burned through millions of dollars more than it raised during the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, her Federal Election Commission reports showed.
Before she launched her campaign, Ms. Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants who was elected to the Senate in 2016, had been seen as a rising star in the party who in a presidential race could bring together the coalition that twice elected former President Obama. She also became well-known for her tough questioning of Trump administration nominees who came before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which Democratic candidate(s) do you think will benefit from Kamala Harris's dropping out of the race, and why? Join the conversation below.
But even after a surge of attention and a fundraising boost stemming from a strong debate performance in June, Ms. Harris struggled to settle on a strategy for where to compete and how to frame her campaign message. She initially focused on speaking truth to power and taking on President Trump, before switching to what she called kitchen-table issues—raising teacher salaries, pay equity between men and women, taxes—during the summer.
She also failed to catch fire with African-American voters and wrestled with how to sell her background as a former prosecutor. As her standing in the race dipped, her campaign grappled with disagreements between powerful figures at the top of her team.
For several weeks she failed to articulate a clear position on health care, the top issue for Democratic primary voters. After signing on as a co-sponsor to Sen. Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All plan, Ms. Harris backtracked. She eventually released her own proposal that sought to appease those who wanted a complete government-provided health system and those who were reluctant to eliminate private insurers.
Once House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, Ms. Harris began to lean on her record as a prosecutor . She had been reluctant to do that earlier in the campaign, after criminal-justice advocates said she hadn't done enough as state attorney general to make California's laws more progressive, especially for minority communities.
"In a race this big, it's really important to have clarity about your strategy and message," said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. "And I'm not sure the Harris campaign was able to do that."
Ms. Harris's campaign also tweaked its strategy regarding which states to compete in, starting out with a plan to invest heavily in South Carolina, given the state's majority black Democratic electorate. But her aides and supporters, according to people familiar with her campaign, were surprised by the resiliency of former Vice President Joe Biden's support among black voters in the state.
Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of the progressive BlackPAC, said Ms. Harris had relatively low name ID among African-Americans despite being the only black woman in the Democratic field. Ms. Shropshire also said that some of those who did know Ms. Harris found her record as a California prosecutor to be "a big deal."
"Her challenge from the beginning really was reaching enough voters so that people know who she is, and that includes black voters," Ms. Shropshire said. "She didn't really have a lot of attention from black voters until she got in but I think she was running out of room in some ways in terms of increasing her support among those voters."
Ms. Harris later diverted resources to Iowa , where her campaign planned to zero in on the first nominating contest, after unexpectedly announcing layoffs and closing offices in New Hampshire. But recent polls in Iowa showed her well behind the likes of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden.
Different campaign power centers—the California Democrat's sister, Maya Harris, served as chairwoman, while she also had longtime consultants and her campaign manager—exacerbated the muddled messaging, according to people familiar with the situation. Other people also said it became hard to hire experienced staffers, who didn't want to report to such a complicated leadership structure.
It even led to a resignation. The New York Times published a resignation letter from a top staffer who left to go work for billionaire Michael Bloomberg's campaign. Kelly Mehlenbacher, the state operations director, criticized the campaign for a lack of strategy and leadership, saying she had "never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly."
Unlike candidates such as Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, and Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, who are relying mostly on small donations, Ms. Harris hadn't been as successful with online fundraising and had to spend time and resources maintaining support among wealthy donors. She was largely absent from the campaign trail between mid-August and mid-September to fundraise.
With a lack of financial resources to air ads, Ms. Harris's team began focusing on creating digital videos with the goal of making them go viral on social media. Some featured her cooking, including one with actress and comedian Mindy Kaling. The campaign tried and failed in recent days to raise enough money to air a video that portrayed her as the "anti-Trump" on TV.
The fundraising crunch became particularly pressing in recent days, when it became clear that Ms. Harris—along with other senators in the race—would likely have to spend time off the campaign trail in Washington for an impeachment trial ahead of the Iowa caucuses and would have to rely on ads to stay in front of voters.
Her inability to go on the airwaves played a role in her decision to drop out, the senior aide said, pointing out that by the end of this week, Mr. Bloomberg's presidential campaign would have spent on advertising about twice what Ms. Harris raised in her entire campaign.
Ms. Harris's exit means December's debate stage could feature no non-white candidates. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are on the bubble for qualifying, while New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker hasn't reached the required polling threshold.

U.S. Program Would Offer Drugs for H.I.V. at No Cost

Texto completo: A new government program will provide donated drugs through major drugstore chains.
With donated drugs and services provided by major pharmacy chains, 200,000 uninsured Americans will gain access to H.I.V.-preventive medicines at no cost, the Trump administration announced on Tuesday.
The announcement, by Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, essentially explained how the government plans to distribute the drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, that were promised in May by the drugmaker Gilead Sciences.
PrEP describes a strategy of preventing infection with H.I.V. by taking a single pill a day, either Truvada or Descovy. Both are made by Gilead. The strategy is 99 percent effective at preventing infection, studies have shown, and is a mainstay of the administration's campaign to end the H.I.V. epidemic.
Some American cities with high H.I.V. rates, such as San Francisco, already have programs that pay the costs of PrEP for the uninsured. Gilead itself offers the drug at no cost to those who cannot afford it, or picks up insurance co-pays for patients who qualify.
But the new program -- called Ready, Set, PrEP -- marks the first time the federal government is supplying PrEP to patients not enrolled in Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration or any other federal health program.
Under the new program, any patient who lacks health insurance, has had a recent negative H.I.V. test and has a prescription for PrEP -- presumably obtained from a doctor -- can call 855-447-8410 or sign onto a new government website, getyourprep.com, to apply for free H.I.V.-prevention drugs.
They can also apply in person, Mr. Azar said, through a participating health care provider, such as a community clinic.
Until March 30, the government will pay Gilead $ 200 per bottle -- each bottle of Truvada contains 30 pills -- to cover the cost of moving donated drugs from factories through the supply chain to patients, Mr. Azar said.
After that, he said, the Walgreens, Rite Aid and CVS chains will donate dispensing services and offer counseling to patients, and the government will seek cheaper ways to get the drugs from Gilead to those chains.
About 1.2 million Americans could benefit from PrEP because they are at high risk of getting H.I.V. from unprotected sex or needle-sharing, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only an estimated 270,000 people are now taking the drugs.
Truvada and Descovy are now mired in billion-dollar patent lawsuits pitting H.H.S. against Gilead. The federal government and the company both claim ownership of patents covering the use of the drugs to prevent H.I.V. infection.
But Mr. Azar said the new program was "not related" to the lawsuits. "That matter will be resolved in the court system," he said.
Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, leader of a team at Massachusetts General Hospital that has analyzed the costs of the H.I.V. plans of the Obama and Trump administrations, said she was "having a hard time understanding why the government is paying $ 200 a month per bottle to dispense these drugs."
Truvada does not need refrigeration or special handling, and it is distributed free in France and Norway. The drug costs patients only $ 96 a year in Australia, $ 384 in Germany and $ 720 in Ireland.
The company has promised to donate enough of the drugs to cover as many as 200,000 people for 11 years in the United States.
Mr. Azar described the $ 200 per bottle payments as a stopgap measure that will enable rolling out the drugs as soon as possible. The amount is what Gilead claimed it pays the pharmacy supply chain to distribute its drugs, he said.
After March 30, Mr. Azar said, with a combination of donated pharmacy costs and competitive bidding for distribution contracts, "I think we'll be able to do better."
Gilead makes no money from the distribution arrangement, said Ryan McKeel, a company spokesman. It will reimburse vendors but not charge the government for the time of any Gilead employees involved.
Any tax deductions the company takes for its donation, he added, will be based on the cost of making the pills, not on their market value or distribution costs.
James Krellenstein, a founder of the advocacy group Prep4All Collaboration, said the government's plan "is poised to repeat the errors of Gilead's own medication
assistance program."
While uninsured patients may get free drugs under the program, he said, they get no help paying for the medical exam and laboratory tests needed to get and keep renewing the prescription, which can cost up to $ 1,000 a year.
Instead of focusing on paying Gilead up to $ 6 million for high pharmaceutical supply chain costs, the government could pay for lab tests for 6,000 patients, Mr. Krellenstein said.

Mr. Azar said that some of those costs are already covered by public clinics, and that his department is seeking $ 291 million this year from Congress to defray other fees in about 50 high-risk areas, beginning with Baltimore; Baton Rouge, La.; DeKalb County, in Georgia; and Cherokee Nation reservations.
To increase awareness of PrEP, Mr. Azar said, Walgreens and Health Mart, a coalition of independent pharmacies, will publicize the program.
In some cities, including New York, posters and billboards encouraging gay men and other people at risk to use PrEP are ubiquitous. But in more conservative parts of the country -- including the rural South, which is now one of the epidemic's hottest zones -- awareness campiagns are uncommon.

President Trump’s reversal on vaping the right call for public health

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

Texto completo: Washington • The Senate on Monday confirmed Dan Brouillette, a former lobbyist for Ford Motor Co., to be President Donald Trump’s second secretary of energy, replacing Rick Perry, who has become embroiled in the impeachment proceedings against Trump.
Senators voted 70-15 in favor of Brouillette’s confirmation. Several Democrats, including Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Tom Udall of New Mexico and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, joined Republicans in approving him.
Since 2017, Brouillette has been Perry’s second in command at the Department of Energy. He has pressed the Trump administration’s policy of “energy dominance,” which includes the rapid expansion oil and gas drilling and a bolstering of U.S. fossil fuel exports.
“I’m proud to have been a small part of the incredible success we have seen in American energy,” Brouillette told lawmakers at his Senate confirmation hearing in November.
While Brouillette sailed through a confirmation vote before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last month, lawmakers on Monday criticized him for not answering questions about Perry’s dealings in Ukraine. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said that Brouillette “failed to provide substantive answers to key questions about Mr. Perry’s dealings.” He called Brouillette’s lack of response a “full-court stonewall.”
Other Democrats came to Brouillette’s defense.
“He’s up to this enormous task. He’s a good man,” Manchin said.
Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said he hoped to see continued funding increases for Energy Department research centers such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in his state. “He understands the important work being done there,” he said.
Brouillette has promised to fight for the Department of Energy’s budget, even though the administration in the past has proposed cutting some agency programs by more than half and eliminating key research and development programs like the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. The bulk of the department’s budget goes to nuclear weapons research, development, maintenance and cleanup.
He also has walked a fine line on climate change. Brouillette has described planetary warming as “something we need to work on” but has questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses a serious threat. He has promoted statistics that show U.S. emissions have fallen 13% since 2005, but he also is a critic of the Paris Agreement, a pledge among nearly every nation to curb emissions that Trump intends to abandon.
Brouillette has argued that reductions of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are being nullified by rising emissions in China.
In replacing Perry, Brouillette becomes the latest lobbyist and seasoned second-in-command to take over for an embattled Cabinet secretary.
Last year Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who worked as the deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Scott Pruitt, took the helm when Pruitt resigned amid ethics scandals. David Bernhardt, an oil and gas lobbyist, served as deputy to Ryan Zinke, Trump’s first secretary of the Interior Department, then assumed the top position when Zinke departed, also facing ethics investigations.
Perry, a former Texas governor who once embraced abolishing the Energy Department, has largely avoided scandal, and Trump has at various times reportedly considered him for other high-profile posts in the administration. Perry has returned the admiration, saying recently that Trump was “ordained by God” to lead the country.
But in recent weeks, Perry has emerged as a player in the impeachment proceedings against Trump, facing scrutiny over his role in promoting energy exports to Ukraine and whether he was involved in the withholding of military aid to the country.
Before becoming deputy energy secretary, Brouillette was chief of staff to the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was assistant secretary of energy for congressional and intergovernmental affairs in the George W. Bush administration. He also worked as an executive at the United Services Automobile Association, a financial services provider to members of the military, and Ford.
Brouillette is a Louisiana native and a graduate of the University of Maryland. He and his wife, Adrienne, are Army veterans and longtime Republican donors. According to OpenSecrets.org, a website that tracks money in politics, Brouillette and his wife gave $30,000 to the Republican National Committee in 2012 and more than $50,000 to Republican candidates, including Perry, between 2005-16.

Trump Bars Bloomberg News From Campaign Events

Texto completo: President Trump's re-election campaign said on Monday that it would bar Bloomberg News journalists from attending its rallies and political events, an attempt to retaliate against the news organization's decision to cease investigating Democratic candidates in the wake of its billionaire owner's entry into the 2020 presidential race.
The Trump campaign broke from years of precedent in 2016 by revoking the press credentials of journalists from outlets like The Washington Post, Politico and BuzzFeed News, an early sign of the efforts to demonize the news media that have become a hallmark of the Trump presidency.
But Bloomberg News is facing a fraught situation, too. After the company's owner, Michael R. Bloomberg, decided last month to pursue the Democratic nomination, editors at the news outlet instructed their reporters to avoid "in-depth investigations" of Mr. Bloomberg or any other Democratic candidate. It was an attempt at fairness that some journalists called stifling.
On Monday, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, called it something else: biased.
"Bloomberg News has declared that they won't investigate their boss or his Democrat competitors, many of whom are current holders of high office, but will continue critical reporting on President Trump," Mr. Parscale wrote in a statement, calling the decision "troubling and wrong."
"Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events," Mr. Parscale wrote. The campaign said it would decide "on a case-by-case basis" whether to respond to inquiries from individual reporters on stories.
The editor in chief of Bloomberg News, John Micklethwait, quickly fired back.
"The accusation of bias couldn't be further from the truth," Mr. Micklethwait wrote in a statement. "We have covered Donald Trump fairly and in an unbiased way since he became a candidate in 2015 and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign."
Howard Wolfson, a top campaign adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, also weighed in, pithily. "One week in and Mike is already under Trump's skin," Mr. Wolfson wrote on Twitter.
Mr. Trump and his senior aides routinely disparage individual reporters and entire news organizations for coverage they deem unfavorable. Press advocacy groups say the president's attacks have contributed to one of the more hostile domestic environments for journalists in recent memory.
Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, criticized the Trump campaign's move in a statement on Monday. "We condemn any action that keeps quality news media from reporting fairly and accurately on the presidency and the leadership of the country," Mr. Baquet wrote.
At the same time, Bloomberg News's approach to covering its owner's candidacy has proved divisive.
Roughly 2,700 journalists work at Bloomberg L.P., the financial data company that is the wellspring of Mr. Bloomberg's fortune, and this is not the first time that Mr. Bloomberg's ambitions have placed his employees in an awkward spot. During Mr. Bloomberg's 12 years as mayor of New York City, coverage of the billionaire's wealth and personal life were considered off limits at Bloomberg News.
In a memo last month, Mr. Micklethwait acknowledged that "there is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy," but added that the newsroom would continue to investigate Mr. Trump's administration "as the government of the day."
On Monday night, Mr. Trump, who had flown to London for a conference, added his own thoughts on the matter, deriding Mr. Bloomberg in a Twitter post as "Mini Mike Bloomberg" and describing Bloomberg News as a "third rate news organization." (He also accused The Times of "hatred & bias.") The president wrote that "It's not O.K.!" for Bloomberg News to skip investigations of Democratic candidates.
While Bloomberg News has pledged to continue covering polls, policies and "who is winning and who is losing" the 2020 race, the prohibition against investigative reporting -- considered among the most valuable forms of campaign journalism -- has caused some uproar.
Megan Murphy, a former Washington bureau chief at Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that it was "staggering" for the news outlet to prevent "an army of unbelievably talented reporters and editors from covering massive, crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time."
Marc Tracy contributed reporting.

Re "A Working Holiday" (Business, Nov. 30): Can't Americans go even one day without shopping? Is it really necessary to have any number of retail stores open every day of the year?
Consumerism is becoming an addiction; let's restrain ourselves, folks, please.

To the Editor:
I worked in broadcast news for 30 years, mostly weekends and holidays. What's the big deal? I didn't feel a sting at all, and I got overtime on holidays. What I didn't get was an article on the front page of the business section written about me and my compadres, nor did we merit one.

Impeachment Was on the Family Table This Thanksgiving; Most admitted they hadn't been paying close attention. Opinions were nevertheless served.

Texto completo: Thanksgiving is over and, predictably, impeachment couldn't be kept off the table. We tried to avoid the dish, we really did. But in my family of Philadelphia-area suburbanites, the very demographic that may decide the 2020 presidential election, the hunger to see where everybody stood couldn't be denied. We are all college-educated, a few of us inclined to wokeness, some members of white-collar unions and therefore left of center, others more concerned with our stock portfolios. Only one beloved aunt was willing to declare her full support for President Trump. The rest had more or less been successfully fed the New York Times' version of events.
There was a widespread belief that the phrase quid pro quo was the name of a type of felony. Roughly the same family members believed this who last Thanksgiving had believed "collusion" was a criminal act. None except the family Trumpist had at all considered how the information they possessed had been packaged for their consumption. Four or five of us were willing to admit that the hearings were "too partisan" and unfair, though the overriding concern wasn't so much devotion to abstract justice as fear that the nation wouldn't swallow the impeachers' conclusions.
Most of my family had concluded from the little they had heard about the impeachment proceedings—even the retirees hadn't watched more than video highlights—that Mr. Trump had done something uniquely bad, even shocking. My family has had little direct experience with politicians. Almost everyone believed that Mr. Trump had tried to pressure the Ukrainian prime minister for his own political gain. No one had read the rough transcript of the call between the two leaders.
We discussed what crime might have been committed, and the most popular option was "extortion." No one present had studied criminal law. Almost everyone thought that Mr. Trump was unpresidential—the epithet "jackass" elicited vigorous nods of agreement—and should be "removed," like a gravy stain from a baby's bib, as soon as possible.
These opinions were asserted with considerable passion, leaving the family Trumpist to stew in her juices. Something approaching rational debate arose only on the question of whether impeachment would benefit the Democrats. No one thought the Democrats had a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump. No one thought the Senate would convict him. Most couldn't comprehend why the hearings so far had failed to move public opinion. The two most woke family members hoped that Mr. Trump would be damaged enough to allow a more radical Democrat to win, but this was generally dismissed as wishful thinking. The moderate Democrats in the family felt that their party's efforts would have been better spent on finding a candidate who didn't want to take away their generous private insurance. No one thought Michael Bloomberg was an appetizing alternative to the current flock of turkeys.
As for me, I had taken the precaution of bringing some decent claret to the festivities, and several of the dishes on the table merited close attention, so I managed to keep my private thoughts to myself—a course of action I have always found to improve digestion after family feasts. Pragmatic soul that I am, when some juvenile inquisitor insists I take sides, demanding, "You're not for Trump, are you?" my standard response is "Compared to whom?" But fortunately the only Manichaean choice imposed on me was between the pecan and spicy pumpkin pie.
I was tempted to opine that if Mr. Trump were impeached and then acquitted by the Senate, he could—and no doubt would—claim loudly during the election to have been exonerated a second time of all wrongdoing, going 2-0 against Democratic "witch hunts." I yielded instead to the safer temptation to lob another scoop of ice cream on my pie. My other unspoken thought was that the Democrats' current impeachment tirade was payback for the Republican's dubious attempt to impeach President Clinton in 1998, and that the Republicans would undoubtedly repeat the whole useless exercise the next time they won the House during a Democratic presidency.
Only one generation of Americans experienced an impeachment proceeding between 1783 and 1973; my generation has witnessed three, and a pattern is beginning to form. One can only hope that the country will eventually learn why regular constitutional order is more productive than engineered political upheavals, or at least that what goes around, comes around. After all, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
Mr. Hankins is professor of history at Harvard University. His book, "Virtue Politics: Soulcraft and Statecraft in Renaissance Italy," will be published next month by Belknap Press.

Texto completo: Kyle Fuller was there when the Bears needed him. In the fourth quarter of a tie game Thursday afternoon in Detroit, the Bears defense faced a defining moment.
On the previous play, safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix had lined up offside, shortening a third-and-5 for the Lions to third-and-inches. When running back J.D. McKissic took a handoff and bounced toward the outside, the Bears appeared to be in big trouble.
McKissic had room. The Bears held their breath.
Fuller had no help, little margin for error and one prevailing thought. "Just get a piece," the Bears cornerback said.
And a piece he got.
With an aggressive burst and a precise dive, Fuller got a piece of McKissic's right knee, then a bit of his right ankle and finally enough of his shoe top to send the running back stumbling for no gain.
Fourth down.
"It happened so fast," Fuller said. "You just shoot your gun and hope to get a piece. And I got enough of him."
Disaster averted.
"Probably the biggest play of the game," Bears coach Matt Nagy said. "An absolute game-changer."
The Lions still scored, using Matt Prater's 24-yard field goal to take a 20-17 lead with 10:47 remaining. But Fuller had proved clutch. And a little while later Mitch Trubisky followed suit, leading a 90-yard touchdown drive for a 24-20 victory.
Trubisky's two longest completions of that drive went to Anthony Miller for 35 and 32 yards, the latter featuring an athletic grab inside the Lions 5.
Nagy saw something in his quarterback. He saw conviction throws. Crisp timing. Confidence.
Nagy also saw something in his young receiver.
"The thing I love about Anthony is he plays with extreme passion," Nagy said. "And he's ultra-talented."
With the game in the balance, with the season's hopes on the line, each big contribution seemed to feed the next. The Bears made a series of game-winning plays, finished off a game-winning touchdown drive and left Ford Field with a jolt of confidence.
"I don't know where this is going to go in the next four weeks," Nagy said. "But if it goes well? You could look to that drive ..."
A narrow victory over a free-falling, last-place Lions team quarterbacked by third-stringer David Blough must be put in proper context and filtered accordingly. One dramatic division win doesn't suddenly revive the Bears' season or awaken a city's dashed Super Bowl dreams.
The Bears remain a middle-of-the-road team with a 6-6 record. And there's enough evidence within their Thanksgiving Day triumph -- blown coverages, dropped passes, foolish penalties, general sloppiness -- to remind everyone why this season is where it is.
Still, the come-from-behind win -- in a short week, on the road, with an extra level of resolve and toughness and togetherness required -- provides something to build on. And that certainly beats the alternative.
The Bears don't belong in the NFC playoff picture, but they at least enter December with a chance to photobomb it. And even the prospect of playing meaningful games during the final month of the regular season should provide players and coaches some added juice. Theoretically, there's still something to chase.
Even though the New York Times' playoff probability tracker gives the Bears just a 3% chance of playing into January, the folks at Halas Hall can use that 3% to adopt the mindset of Lloyd Christmas courting Mary Swanson in "Dumb and Dumber."
So you're telling me there's a chance.
Don't forget, the 2018 Eagles, the team that eliminated the Bears from last season's playoffs, started 4-6 yet found a way to keep grinding.
And that, for Nagy, has been an important part of this season's cleanup process. The Bears understand the mess they made for themselves with a four-game losing streak in October and early November. But they've stayed together and retained an important level of belief.
"I just think it's a credit to our players for battling through," Nagy said. "And that's what I like most about it. That's why last night felt so good in that locker room: because we understand that we're continuing to fight.
"Is it perfect? No. Can we be better? Yes. We know we have our hands full with the coming games. But as long as we just home in on (playing) the Dallas Cowboys at home (Thursday), who knows?"
Nagy has tried to describe what he felt in the Ford Field locker room Thursday. Before the game, he sensed his players' readiness: "I could tell our guys were laser focused."
And after the win? After Fuller's critical tackle and Miller's big catches and Trubisky's final-drive poise and win-sealing splash plays from Roquan Smith and Eddie Jackson? There seemed to be a heightened spirit, an energized fulfillment in the way they had all clawed for that win.
Players danced in Club Dub and exuded a collective pride.
"You could just feel an organic fun," Nagy said.
It's up to the Bears to carry that forward, to recognize the difficulty of their December schedule -- Cowboys, Packers, Chiefs, Vikings -- and embrace the opportunity to attack each game with the proper energy and focus.
The chances of writing a storybook ending to this disappointing season remain slim. But at Halas Hall, anyway, there's a belief that there's still something valuable to squeeze from this season.

Texto completo: At 55, John Leguizamo may technically be a baby boomer, but you won't often find him on the "get off my lawn" side of the generational divide. Take the debate over the gender-neutral identity marker "Latinx." "I love the term Latinx, because it makes me think that being Latin is a superpower," Leguizamo says, even though he didn't use it in the title of his latest one-man show, "Latin History for Morons." "I want Latinx youth to succeed," he says. "They're my target, and they're my protectorship, because they're the most vulnerable. 'Latinx' to me protects young Latin girls from being excluded, because the masculine side of the word does exclude them."
A quest to find Latin heroes Leguizamo brings his "Latin History" tour to Tempe's ASU Gammage on Dec. 7. It's his sixth one-man show, and the fourth that he has taken to Broadway (starting with 1998's "Freak").
A filmed performance has been streaming on Netflix for a year, but Leguizamo continues to add new material to his rapid-fire tour through a historical hall of fame.
The show wasn't inspired so much as provoked by the lack of Latino history in the textbooks his two kids were reading at school, and by his son's experience of being bullied over his ethnic heritage. Leguizamo set out to find the Latin American heroes that had been erased from history — and he found plenty, including the soldiers who fought in every U.S. war since 1776.
"The beautiful thing that happened was I was the one who was empowered and changed by doing all this research," he says.
"We are the sons and daughters of the American Revolution. Why isn't that everywhere, and statues and parades for us? How come we're not in 'Band of Brothers'? It's outrageous how we're marginalized, overlooked, erased. And I've had enough."
'I love identity politics' This kind of in-your-face identity politics will come as no surprise to anyone who has followed Leguizamo's wide-ranging career, and not just his performances in mainstream fare such as "John Wick" or the "Ice Age" movies (as the voice of Sid the giant sloth).
"I love identity politics," he says. "The only thing that I'm not cool with is the term 'people of color,' because at first I thought it was unifying, and now I'm realizing it's become a way of making quotas and further excluding Latin people."
He cites a call he says he made to his hometown newspaper — that would be the New York Times — about the lack of Latinos on its pages.
"And they say, 'Well, we have the largest (representation of) contributors of people of color,'" he says. "I go, 'That's incredible, I'm so happy for you. How many of those are Latin?' Quiet. 'We'll get back to you with those numbers.'"
Crowdfunding a Latin superhero For his next project, Leguizamo is moving on from historical heroes to superheroes. He is in the midst of a crowdfunding campaign to publish a comic book series he's writing titled "PhenomX," about an ex-con trying to clear his name.
"All the money goes to the artists, none to me," he says. "They're all Latinx, some women, some men."
So no, John Leguizamo isn't particularly worried about getting "OK boomered" by younger generations.
"If you're reading and you're talking to them and you're changing as you get older, you're not going to be that 'OK boomer,' " he says. "You're going to be a hip, woke boomer. But if you're not growing and changing and you're stuck in your ways? Goodbye, boomer."

Texto completo: Anger over corruption and Iran's influence on the country has driven weeks of unrest in Iraq's streets. But choosing a successor may be a long, arduous task.
NAJAF, Iraq -- Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq formally submitted his resignation to Parliament on Saturday and asked lawmakers in a televised national address to quickly agree on a successor.
But Mr. Mahdi's resignation may not spell the end of the turmoil that has racked the nation over the past two months. Parliament is scheduled to meet Sunday and will vote on accepting his resignation, but it has yet to agree on an alternative.
"The resignation of the government is a method of peaceful handover of power in democratic systems," Mr. Mahdi said in his brief speech, adding that the government had tried to meet the demands of the country's widening protest movement.
Protests driven by anger over political corruption and Iran's influence over Iraqi politics -- coupled with the government's violent response -- had put Mr. Mahdi under intense pressure to step down. At least 400 people have been killed in the unrest, according to the United Nations and hospital sources.
Assuming Parliament accepts Mr. Mahdi's resignation, the formation of a new government could go quickly, but it will more likely take weeks, if not months. That realization quickly dissolved protesters' initial jubilation over Mr. Mahdi's announcement on Friday that he would step down.
Mr. Mahdi and his ministers would still serve in a caretaker government until President Barham Salih requests that the largest bloc in Parliament name a new prime minister and that person's ministers are then approved by a majority. History shows that agreeing on a prime minister can be a long, arduous process of balancing competing political factions.
It became so protracted in 2018 that Iranian officials helped set up the current government, brokering an agreement that brought in Mr. Mahdi and Mr. Salih as well as the Parliament speaker, Mohammed al-Halbousi.
One significant question is whether Iran will play the same role this time around. Since Iraqis are now openly expressing resentment toward Tehran, its direct involvement might be a liability.
Across the Shiite-dominated south of Iraq, as well as in the capital Baghdad, the chant "Out, Out Iran, Baghdad Remains Free" is part of the daily protests. If one thing is clear, the fact that Iraq is majority Shiite and so is Iran does not mean that Iraqi and Iranian Shiites have shared views.
In Najaf, a city that hosts several million Iranian pilgrims annually at its shrines and where Iranian clerical students train in its religious universities, the resentment of Tehran's insertion into Iraqi affairs is running so high that protesters burned the Iranian Consulate there on Wednesday night.
Three days later, the walls of one office in the complex were still faintly warm from the flames. A wall of file cabinets had been burned to a shell and the papers that had been inside were little more than a pile of ashes. The door had been ripped off a safe.
In the courtyard, the smell of burned wires and rubber drifted in the air as half-blackened documents blew in the autumn breeze and a single, charred sandal lay on its side. A carton of lemons, most of them covered with ash, rolled about on the tiles.
The complex's metal-frame buildings were so warped by the heat and looked so ruined that while they had not burned to the ground, their reconstruction would be a major undertaking.
No one was inside when the complex was set afire because the only two Iranian employees left through the back door when security guards realized they would not be able to hold off the protesters, said Abu Rusol, one of the guards.
Just a few hundred feet away, the shrine of Mohammed Baqr al-Hakim, a cleric assassinated in 2003, was a scene of tension on Saturday, with protesters facing off against Shiite militiamen protecting the site.
Mr. al-Hakim, although an Iraqi, spent years in exile in Iran and was part of the opposition to Saddam Hussein. Now his links to Iran have made his shrine a target of demonstrators.
Skirmishes continued at the shrine late Saturday afternoon. Protesters, who were largely unarmed, were coming into emergency treatment tents with gunshot wounds, said Muahin Yasseen, a fifth-year medical school student who had volunteered to help.
The United States -- though it has sought political reforms in Iraq, especially on corruption -- had wanted Mr. Mahdi to remain in office, worried that his departure could lead to even more extensive bloodshed.
Mr. Mahdi, however, has been unable to control the violence and the pressure on him to step down has built for some time. He resisted until the latest spate of killings and a looming threat of a no-confidence vote in Parliament.
On Friday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, urged Parliament to stop procrastinating or "the country will pay a high price, and everyone will regret it."
It was in the hours after Mr. Sistani's message that Mr. Mahdi announced his intention to resign.

How Devin Nunes media lawsuit threat undermines Donald Trump

Texto completo: The pledge of ranking Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes to sue CNN and the Daily Beast is just the last such threat coming from the White House and its allies. President Donald Trump has publicly called for changing the libel laws, a repeated demand that ignores that the defamation standard rests on constitutional not statutory authority. While such threats may be cathartic and popular, Nunes may be doing greater damage to the White House than the media in declaring his intent to sue.
Nunes is aggrieved by the coverage of a breaking story that he used a congressional trip to meet with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt against the Bidens in 2018. CNN and the Daily Beast cite Lev Parnas' lawyer as the source. Parnas, a former Rudy Guliani associate, was indicted in October for conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations.
Nunes vehemently denied the stories and declared that "we actually caught them" in advancing a false story and a defamation lawsuit will soon follow.
At the outset, it is worth noting that I agree with the White House that there is a great deal of distorted and biased coverage of this president. However, that does not justify the president's reckless attacks on the media as "the enemy of the people" or his desire to roll back protections for the free press. More importantly, in this matter, Nunes proceeded to make statements that could easily be viewed as attacking the defenses raised not only by the White House but Nunes himself.
"This is criminal in nature." Nunes states, "The problem with this week's fake news story is – we actually caught them. And we caught them badly and it also involves criminal activity ... We are going to take both CNN and the Daily Beast likely into federal court, right after Thanksgiving and we hope they cooperate."
One possible meaning is that Nunes is referencing one of the "per se" categories for defamation in asserting that someone is committing a criminal offense. That would be a reference to a member of Congress using a public funds for political purposes. Yet, that is very similar to what Democrats are accusing President Trump of doing in pushing a quid pro quo by withholding aid or other official acts. One defense (raised by acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney) is that such quid pro quos have always been part of foreign policy so, "I have news for everybody: Get over it." If the criminal matter is the intermixing of politics with public-funded work, Nunes could find himself in the unenviable position of rivaling Mulvaney as one of the most quoted Republicans in this scandal.
Nunes stated "It is not OK to work with someone who has been indicted on [a] serious federal crime, to build a media narrative and dirty up a member of Congress."
One can certainly understand the desire to avoid association with Parnas or his equally dubious associate Igor Fruman. Parnas and Fruman bear striking resemblance to Flotsam and Jetsam – the craven and ingratiating henchmen for the sea witch Ursula in The Little Mermaid. Both men were arrested trying to leave the country at the airport shortly after meeting with Giuliani (who makes Ursula look like a public minded citizen).
The problem is that these two alleged felons, to use Ursula's description, were Giuliani's "poor little poopsies" in Ukraine. They worked with Giuliani who was (according to Giuliani and various witnesses) working for President Trump in pursuing matters in Ukraine. If it was untoward to be working with them, Nunes could have a problem in explaining why Giuliani maintained his own association with them in Ukraine.
Moreover, it is bizarre to suggest that the media should not work with accused felons. Many major stories are based on accounts from not just indicted but convicted felons. That is particularly the case when you are covering possible unethical or criminal acts. The association with such individuals is a problem for people like Giuliani, not the media.
This is why the premise of this defamation lawsuit is so potentially damaging to the narrative supporting the president. You cannot allege that it is per se defamatory to associate you with two individuals who have only two degrees of separation from the president himself. Indeed, the president has associated directly with a number of proven felons including his former personal counsel Michael Cohen and his former campaign chair Paul Manafort. They both displayed the same ravenous corrupt appetites in mixing government and private interests.
Nunes has insisted that he will file the lawsuits against CNN and the Daily Beast after Thanksgiving and added "we hope they cooperate." They may be more cooperative than he expects. With such a lawsuit will come depositions and discovery into Nunes' travel, associations and efforts. That could prove a treasure trove for two organizations with diminishing access to Republican sources. Moreover, Nunes will have to satisfy the standard that Trump has repeatedly denounced: the New York Times Company v. Sullivan standard of "actual malice."
That decision imposed a higher standard of proof for lawsuits by public officials based on the First Amendment's protection of free speech and the free press. During the civil rights movement, various southern states were using their defamation laws to hit media companies with huge damage awards to coerce them into silence. The court mandated that officials like Nunes must show that the media was acting with either knowledge of the falsity of their reporting or reckless disregard for the truth.
That standard is designed to be difficult to prove and meant to give protection to the media in publishing allegations against high-ranking officials. What may be easier to prove is that these two individuals are not the types with whom any responsible and reputable official would associate. The problem is that a couple of notable figures did precisely that.

Trolls may be behind that buzz you hear; They're growing in the Philippines -- and could be coming to an election near you.

Texto completo: As public anger mounted last year over delayed plans to shake up the Philippines' outage-plagued telecommunications sector, angry comments and one-star ratings flooded a government-run Facebook page.
When employees suspected online trolls, President Rodrigo Duterte's digital mastermind offered a solution.
"I'll handle this," said Nic Gabunada, the architect of the social media strategy that powered Duterte's 2016 election victory, according to a government employee who managed the Facebook page.

Pro-Duterte comments soon poured onto the page, with users defending the president's handling of the situation or blaming the problems on the previous administration. Many of the new commenters had only basic profile information on their pages, which featured mostly generic posts with religious or pro-government messages.
"It was Nic," said the employee, who was interviewed on condition her name not be used for fear of retribution. "The fact that he had a troll army was known by everyone, but not openly talked about."
In the Philippines, candidates and government officials routinely pay vast cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to smear opponents and prop themselves up.
It's all part of the online propaganda wars shaking politics in the country.
And it could soon be coming to the U.S., according to election officials and disinformation scholars who are watching closely. They warn that the Philippine epidemic probably will spread here, given Filipinos' proficiency in English, facility with social media and the lure of money from campaigns looking for a new way to get an edge over the competition.
Already, U.S. operatives in both parties have made early efforts at using trolls for political gain. Rogue progressives stealthily launched fake social media campaigns against Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, during a 2017 special election. Their campaign aimed to confuse voters into thinking Moore supported banning alcohol and that Russian bots were working on his behalf.
The New York Times revealed the plot, along with an earlier, aborted plan developed by a firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents to engage dozens of paid trolls in swaying delegates to Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP convention. The plan was requested by a senior Trump campaign official but was not carried out.
"The presence of a large for-hire market looking at all the disinformation online that you can buy and people are selling is quite disturbing," Camille Francois, the chief innovation officer of Graphika, a firm that helps tech companies and government investigators find and confront online disinformation, said at a Federal Election Commission symposium in September.
"What these troll farms are reporting is a growth of global business.... What do we do about that?"
Manila alone has hundreds of active troll farms. The shadowy networks act as weapons that, for the right price, can build artificial buzz around a product, a celebrity -- or a political figure.
Those troll techniques "will be used more and more," said Malou N. Tiquia, chief executive of the Manila political strategy consultancy Publicus Asia. "When Facebook said it won't ban political ads, that was already a signal to everyone that anything goes."
U.S. regulators have barely begun to consider the mounting threat, and Silicon Valley has shown itself lacking the tools and will to effectively confront it. Tech firms are making little headway stamping out the scourge where it has emerged, even after Facebook in March removed from its platform 200 pages for "inauthentic" activity and took the rare step of identifying Gabunada's network as the culprit.
The Philippine digital propagandist has denied trafficking in misinformation and did not respond to texts seeking comment about his work for the Duterte administration.
Such moves by Facebook are doing little to slow the trolls.
Filipinos spend so much time online -- they average a staggering 10 hours a day, according to industry data -- and disinformation has spiraled so quickly that Katie Harbath, Facebook public policy director for global elections, during a 2018 talk in Berlin branded it "patient zero in the global disinformation epidemic."
"The propaganda looks really organic and it often doesn't trip any of the flags" that alert tech companies, said Jonathan Ong, a professor of global digital media at University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research has taken him inside Philippine troll farms.
"The best strategists know how not to get caught."
Political campaigns contract out their digital efforts to consultants, who in turn pay up to $1,000 per month to college students and recent graduates who are charged with launching multiple fake Facebook pages designed to look like they were created by actual voters or grass-roots groups.
"It is so easy to be enlisted in these jobs," Ong said. His recent study on the industry includes an interview with one paid troll who fell into the work when the chief of staff of the political campaign she was working on ordered everyone to start creating fake accounts and posting on them.
Others have fleeting loyalties politically but are attracted to the cash. Consultants running troll farms have been known to switch sides in the middle of an election.
"The alliances are very shifty," Ong said. "Strategists will switch in the middle of a campaign to join who they think will be the winner. They will betray their client. It happened in the last election."
Most often, the operations are run through contractors separate from the actual campaigns so the candidate has no fingerprints on the weapon. And the trolls often don't trigger attention from tech platforms because they know how to avoid detection. The algorithms that tech companies use to detect phony accounts tend to focus on dozens of commenters posting the same message around the same time, or users with a stock photo on their profile page. The trolls don't do these things.
"You can look like legitimate Facebook users to trick the [company's] artificial intelligence," said Ross Tapsell, a researcher at Australian National University who documented the surge of paid troll activity in the Philippine province of Cebu.
Some trolls, he said, get offered a rate of $1 per social media post. In some cases operatives contract the work out to troll farms in far-off places, including Saudi Arabia.
"We have only scratched the surface of what a lot of this involved," he said.
The government employee who last year watched what she believed were trolls swarm to the defense of Duterte on Facebook said her suspicions were confirmed when her boss later talked openly at a meeting about Gabunada's troll operations. She also met colleagues who had visited an office building in metropolitan Manila that housed the troll farm.
She quit soon after.
"It was very scarring," she said. "I don't know if these practices will end. It's very normalized in the Philippines, and advertising professionals are not ashamed that they use these strategies."
Among those who have been in the trenches is Joyce Ramirez, a publicist who ran social media for one of Duterte's rivals, Grace Poe.
Ramirez, who specializes in promoting films and celebrities, at one point controlled an army of 50 social media loyalists who together had 45 million Twitter followers on accounts that didn't use the owners' names. With a few strokes, she said, she could make any entertainment-related topic trend on Twitter in the Philippines. The tweeters were sometimes paid in cash, sometimes in cellphones and other gifts.
Such a network is politically potent, as in the Philippines, "there is a thin line that separates politics from showbiz," Ramirez said.
When a pro-Duterte blogger accused Ramirez of secretly working for another opposition candidate in 2017, she was attacked on social media by a blogger who was echoed by thousands of pro-government users; Ramirez believes they were paid trolls. The blogger was under contract at the time as a social media consultant for the Philippine department of foreign affairs.
"They hammered fake news against me again and again, with 5,000 to 7,000 people writing against me," Ramirez said. "It was all made up."
Ramirez quit politics. Her army of young influencers disbanded, some switching sides to defend Duterte's government, others leaving Twitter after their accounts were deleted or suspended. What the experience taught her, she said, is that Filipinos "thrive greatly in manufactured noise."
"Nothing is ever real," she said. "Whatever you hear in the news is most likely to deflect people from the truth."

Texto completo: New York Times columnist David Brooks was roasted on Twitter after he claimed that candidates for national office face a harder time if they are from an urban area on either coast.
Brooks theorized that it's more difficult for a candidate to run for national office if they're from California or New York because those areas are not representative of the rest of the country.
"It’s hard to run for national office from California or New York. The urban parts of those states are so unrepresentative you don’t understand what you’re about to face," he tweeted on Thursday and included a link to a New York Times story about the downfall of California Sen. Kamala Harris's presidential campaign's downfall.
Many on social media were quick to point out fallacies in Brooks's theory: mainly that President Trump long lived in New York before recently changing his residence to Florida while he ran against Hillary Clinton, who served as New York senator from 2001-2009.

‘Flailing ... teetering’: New York Times and Washington Post declare Kamala Harris doomed

Texto completo: Both the New York Times and Washington Post published stories arguing that Sen. Kamala Harris's presidential campaign is on uneasy footing and nearing a collapse.
Harris, despite declaring her candidacy in front of over 20,000 people in January, has experienced a significant dip in the polls in recent months in part because voters still have questions about who she is and what she supports.
The Post reported, "As a result, her candidacy is now teetering, weighed down by indecision within her campaign, her limits as a candidate and dwindling funds that have forced her to retreat in some places at a moment she expected to be surging," and labled her campaign "flailing."
The Harris campaign recently laid off staffers to the ire of those left in the offices. Campaign manager Juan Rodriguez was pelted by questions from other members of the campaign following those layoffs earlier this month. Kelly Mehlenbacher, the Iowa operations director, roasted Rodriguez and Harris's sister Maya, who's also the campaign chairwoman, in her resignation letter. She has since joined the Bloomberg campaign.
The Times obtained Mehlenbacher's resignation letter, in which she claimed, “This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly," and added that, “With less than 90 days until Iowa we still do not have a real plan to win."
They also reported that factions have been created within the Harris campaign and that she is no longer on good terms with Rodriguez. Rep. Marcia Fudge, who has endorsed Harris and is a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, argued that while Harris is not absolved of responsibility, she needs to get rid of Rodriguez in order to regain her footing in the primary.

Fired Navy Secretary criticizes Trump in SEAL case

Texto completo: BY ROBERT BURNS
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Richard Spencer, who was fired as Navy secretary for his handling of a SEAL war crimes case championed by President Donald Trump, wrote that the commander in chief "has very little understanding" of how the American military works.
The extraordinary accusation came in an opinion piece published on The Washington Post's website Wednesday evening, three days after he was fired. Spencer called Trump's intervention in the case of Navy Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher "shocking" and unprecedented.
Spencer was fired Sunday by Defense Secretary Mark Esper for working a private deal with the White House to ensure that Gallagher be allowed to retire without losing his SEAL status.
In his Post article, Spencer acknowledged his mistake but also asserted that Trump's actions were detrimental to the military.
Spencer said Trump had involved himself in the Gallagher case "almost from the start," by telephoning Spencer even before the SEAL's court martial started to ask that Gallagher be moved out of confinement at a Navy brig. Spencer said he resisted Trump because the presiding judge had decided that confinement was important. Nonetheless, Trump ordered Spencer to transfer Gallagher from the brig to the equivalent of an enlisted barracks.
Spencer said he believes Trump's interest in the case stemmed partly from the way Gallagher's defense lawyers and others "worked to keep it front and center in the media."
After Gallagher was acquitted of most charges but convicted of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State extremist in Iraq, he submitted his request to retire. In Spencer's telling, that raised three questions for the Navy, including whether Gallagher should be allowed to retire at his current rank. The military jury had said he should be demoted.
Trump, who had tweeted support for Gallagher and stated that his case had been "handled very badly from the beginning," short-circuited the Navy's administrative review of Gallagher's status by ordering Spencer to restore Gallagher's rank.
"This was a shocking and unprecedented intervention in a low-level review," Spencer wrote. "It was also a reminder that the president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices."
Spencer's scathing commentary echoes the thrust of an opinion piece published two days earlier by two of his predecessors, Richard Danzig and Sean O'Keefe.
Danzig, who led the Navy under President Bill Clinton, and O'Keefe, his predecessor in the administration of President George H.W. Bush, wrote in The New York Times that Trump has politicized the military to its detriment.
"His values are not those of our military," they wrote.
Last week, Trump tweeted that Gallagher must be allowed to keep his Trident pin, the medal that designates a SEAL member. The Navy had planned to let an administrative board review the question starting Monday, but eventually Esper decided to stop that process and let Gallagher retire as a SEAL, as Trump had ordered.
Earlier Wednesday, the Navy announced that it had canceled the peer-review boards for three SEAL officers who supervised Gallagher during the Iraq deployment that gave rise to the war crimes charges.
Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said the case was becoming a distraction for the commando force, known for its quiet professionalism but recently roiled with controversy.
The decision was the latest twist in the Gallagher matter. Trump has made no mention of the three SEAL officers also ordered to be reviewed. All three had overseen Gallagher during his 2017 deployment to Iraq.
But Modly said there were better ways to address any "failures in conduct, performance, judgment, or professionalism exhibited by these officers."
He directed the chief of naval operations to end the review process for Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, Lt. Jacob Portier and Lt. Thomas MacNeil.
"The United States Navy, and the Naval Special Warfare Community specifically, have dangerous and important work to do," Modly said in a statement. "In my judgment, neither deserves the continued distraction and negative attention that recent events have evoked."
Modly said his decision should not be interpreted as loosening the standards he expects of SEALs. He said ongoing efforts will continue to address problems within the SEAL community, which has had numerous allegations of misconduct in recent months.
"Navy uniformed leaders have my full confidence that they will continue to address challenging cultural issues within the Naval Special Warfare community, instill good order and discipline, and enforce the very highest professional standards we expect from every member of that community," he said.
Portier was Gallagher's platoon commander and was charged with failing to report the killing of the captive. He denied the charges and they were dropped after the jury acquitted Gallagher of murder.
Portier's attorney, Jeremiah Sullivan, said Portier was happy to learn he would be allowed to keep his trident, a pin designating SEAL status.
"Lt. Portier is extremely grateful for the unwavering support of President Trump," Sullivan said.
Attorneys for Breisch and MacNeil did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

U.S. News: Giuliani Considered Ukrainian Business

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani said he was in talks earlier this year to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars from Ukrainian government officials but decided against it as he pushed the country to pursue investigations sought by his client, President Trump.
In January, Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine's prosecutor general, asked Mr. Giuliani to represent the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and him personally on two matters, Mr. Giuliani said in an interview Wednesday. Mr. Giuliani, a lawyer, said he subsequently drew up two retainer agreements, for a total of about $500,000, and gave them to Mr. Lutsenko.
The next day, Mr. Giuliani decided he couldn't represent Mr. Lutsenko personally because he believed doing so would pose a conflict with his representation of the president, he said, but continued to consider the Ministry of Justice contract. He said he ultimately declined that one, too, and was never "paid a penny" in connection with the proposed arrangements.
Mr. Lutsenko, who was removed from his post in August, didn't respond to a request to comment.
Mr. Giuliani's discussions about representing Mr. Lutsenko and the Ukrainian ministry came, he said, as he was meeting the Ukrainian prosecutor in New York to discuss an entirely different matter: investigations the president was seeking into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, as well as into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
The talks between Mr. Giuliani and the Ukrainian officials were reported earlier by the New York Times and the Washington Post.
The push for those investigations by Mr. Giuliani and the president ultimately led to a phone call between Mr. Trump and new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which set off the impeachment inquiry this fall. The overlap between Mr. Giuliani's business interests in Ukraine and his campaign on behalf of Mr. Trump is also at the center of a growing investigation by Manhattan federal prosecutors, which among other matters is examining whether the president's personal attorney might have violated rules on domestic and foreign lobbying.
A recent broad subpoena issued by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office sought records of any payments to Mr. Giuliani and records related to his consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have denied wrongdoing.
More recently, Mr. Giuliani said, he was in talks to help represent PrivatBank, Ukraine's largest lender, in a lawsuit against the former co-owners of the bank, Igor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Bogolyubov. Mr. Giuliani said he met with lawyers at the firm Quinn Emanuel about the case but ultimately decided against it.
Lawyers for Quinn Emanuel in Europe saw Mr. Giuliani's public mentions about Mr. Kolomoisky and believed he might have information that would be helpful to their case, according to a person familiar with the talks. After two meetings with Mr. Giuliani, the person said, it became clear that he didn't have any independent information about Mr. Kolomoisky, and the law firm determined "there was no role for him."
While Mr. Giuliani ultimately didn't represent either Mr. Lutsenko or the Ministry of Justice, he continued to be in close contact with the Ukrainian prosecutor. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lutsenko met again in Warsaw in February and continued to be in touch over the following months. In May, Mr. Giuliani planned a trip to Kyiv, but Mr. Giuliani ultimately canceled the trip after news of it was reported.

Texto completo: He worked to advance black causes within the Catholic Church. In 1981 he drew national coverage and consternation in the church when he adopted a child.
The Rev. George Clements, a Chicago priest who caused a stir in the Roman Catholic church when he adopted a child in the early 1980s, and whose civil rights and social justice activism inspired a television movie about his career, died on Monday at a hospital in Indiana. He was 87.
The Archdiocese of Chicago confirmed the death but did not specify the cause. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, another Chicago priest, said Father Clements had had a stroke and heart attack in recent weeks.
Father Clements was devoted to the civil rights movement as well as his faith, and he worked hard to advance black causes. He marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Chicago, Alabama and Mississippi; he also found common cause with the Black Panther Party in Chicago in the 1960s. He helped create programs, like the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, to support African-Americans within the church.
Father Clements told Contemporary Newsmakers, a biographical guide, in 1985 that he thought such internal organizations were necessary. "I felt very lonely," he said, "and felt like I was really kind of lost in a sea of whiteness in the midst of all the furor that was taking place in the civil rights movement, and it was a beautiful thing to find kindred souls around the country that felt the same way as I."
Father Clements started programs to help drug addicts and incarcerated people and their families. In 1980 he created One Church One Child, a program to help Catholic churches find adoptive parents for orphaned black children. That year he announced that he intended to adopt a black child himself to dramatize the problem, drawing national media coverage and creating consternation in the church.
The Associated Press reported in 1980 that the Chicago Archdiocese issued a statement that praised Father Clements's character but said, in part, "It may be more appropriate for a priest to leave adoptions to those who are less encumbered by pastoral responsibilities, to those who can provide a true home."
The church agreed in 1981 that adoption would not violate Father Clements's vows, and he adopted a 13-year-old boy, Joey, from an orphanage. "I had given up hope of finding a family," Joey said, according to an article in The New York Times. "I am very proud to have him as my dad."
Father Clements said: "If the church had blocked me, I would not have defied them. But they didn't. Thank God they didn't."
In time Father Clements adopted three more sons. His life and work were chronicled in "The Father Clements Story," a 1987 television movie starring Louis Gossett Jr.
George Harold Clements was born to Samuel and Aldonia (Peters) Clements on Jan. 26, 1932, in Chicago, where his father worked as a city auditor.
In 1945, Father Clements became the first African-American to graduate from the Chicago Archdiocese's Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary. He completed bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of St. Mary of the Lake seminary in Mundelein, Ill., north of Chicago, before he was ordained in 1957.
Father Clements was accused in August of sexually abusing a minor in 1974 while he was pastor of Holy Angels parish on the South Side of Chicago. He denied the allegation, but Cardinal Blase J. Cupich asked him to step aside from the ministry while the charges were investigated.
A spokesman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services said the allegation was classified as "unfounded" after the department's investigation, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. The archdiocese, however, said its own investigation was "still ongoing."
He is survived by his sons, Friday, Stewart, St. Anthony and Joseph; a sister, Ynez Gilmer; 15 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.

Texto completo: A man snuffs out his aristocratic relatives one by one in the 1949 British film "Kind Hearts and Coronets," now showing at Film Forum.
A mannerly cad murders his way to a dukedom, dispatching eight relatives all played by Alec Guinness. Obviously, "Kind Hearts and Coronets" is a comedy. In fact, a recent British Film Institute poll ranked it as Britain's greatest.
Directed by Robert Hamer for Ealing Studios, the movie is showing in a new 4K restoration of its original version on the occasion of its 70th birthday through Dec. 5 at Film Forum.
In his 1950 review, the New York Times critic Bosley Crowther hailed "Kind Hearts" as "a spoof on the highest level of cultivated humor." That's one way to describe this savage jest, saturated with class hatred and narrated in a tone of droll understatement by its unflappable serial-killer protagonist, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price).
Mazzini is introduced in prison awaiting his date with the hangman and finishing his memoirs, a litany of crime. His mother, disowned by her aristocratic family for marrying an Italian opera singer, was denied burial in the ancestral crypt, thus inspiring her son to avenge her by eliminating all those in the way of his succession.
What follows is a series of creative murders, all entertainingly annotated by the killer. The most elaborate involves the poisoning of a doddering clergyman; the most outlandish has Mazzini using a well-aimed projectile to burst the hot-air balloon carrying the militant suffragist Lady Agatha: "I shot an arrow into the air. It fell to earth in Berkeley Square." That the victims, including Lady Agatha, are universally Guinness removes the sting -- however Mazzini does away with them, his look-alike relatives keep popping up.
The actor's multiple appearances turn the movie into a stunt. "The sly and adroit Mr. Guinness plays eight Edwardian fuddy-duds with such devastating wit and variety that he naturally dominates the film," Crowther wrote. Perhaps this performance diverted Crowther's attention from Mazzini's other sketchy escapades, outrageous for the time, which include courting one victim's widow (Valerie Hobson) while carrying on an affair with a friend's sultry wife (Joan Greenwood). In his way, this British villain is as coldblooded as Richard III or Macbeth.
Among Ealing's most accomplished directors, Hamer was not primarily a maker of comedies. He made his reputation with the creepy "haunted mirror" sequence in the classic 1945 horror anthology "Dead of Night." He also directed the atmospheric crime thriller "It Always Rains on Sunday," a 1947 movie that, in its treatment of London's working-class East End, predates the gritty "kitchen-sink" naturalism of films like "Room at the Top" (1959) and "Look Back in Anger" (1959) by a dozen years.
With "Kind Hearts," Hamer had first planned to make a comedy about the French serial killer Henri Landru, but Charlie Chaplin beat him to it, with "Monsieur Verdoux." He then adapted Roy Horniman's 1907 novel, "Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal," a snobbish, anti-Semitic satire in which a Jewish interloper gets away with murder and winds up a duke.
In the aftermath of World War II, it was surely prudent to change the killer's ethnicity. Such sensitivity did not extend, however, to a racial slur used twice in a children's nursery rhyme and overdubbed for release in the United States. The American version also added a final shot to ensure no one gets away with murder.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump was briefed on the whistleblower complaint about his dealings with Ukraine before the White House released nearly $400 million in military aid to Kyiv, officials say, shedding new light on events that triggered the impeachment inquiry.
Trump was told about the complaint in late August in a briefing by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, according to two officials not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.
The lawyers told the president about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress, the officials said. The aid was released on Sept. 11 amid growing pressure from lawmakers.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The White House has claimed there was no link between the military aid suspension and the president’s request for Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his family.
But it was his request to Ukraine’s president in a July phone call that prompted the government whistleblower’s complaint about a link. The assertion of such a link has since been corroborated by a parade of witnessed testifying on Capitol Hill.
The August briefing with Trump was first reported by The New York Times.
The revelation comes just days before the House Judiciary Committee takes over the impeachment probe, scheduling a hearing for next week as it pushes closer to a possible vote on charges of "high crimes and misdemeanors."
The Judiciary panel scheduled the hearing as the Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released two last transcripts from its depositions, including from a White House budget official who detailed concerns among colleagues as Trump ordered them, through intermediaries, to put a hold on military aid to Ukraine.
Trump and his lawyers have been invited to attend the hearing and make a request to question witnesses, according to Democratic rules approved by the House last month. The committee released a letter from committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, to the Republican president, saying he hopes Trump will participate, "consistent with the rules of decorum and with the solemn nature of the work before us."
The White House said Wednesday no decision had been made whether to send a representative.
"But what is obvious to every American is that this letter comes at the end of an illegitimate sham partisan process," press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.
Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus reaffirmed in a statement the U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Could Philippine troll armies hit US? Officials pay to null conflict and boost government online

Texto completo: MANILA, Philippines - As public anger mounted last year over delayed plans to shake up the Philippines' outage-plagued telecommunications sector, angry comments and one-star ratings flooded a government-run Facebook page.
When employees suspected online trolls, President Rodrigo Duterte's digital mastermind offered a solution.
"I'll handle this," said Nic Gabunada, the architect of the social media strategy that powered Duterte's 2016 election victory, according to a government employee who managed the Facebook page.
Pro-Duterte comments soon poured onto the page, with users defending the president's handling of the situation or blaming the problems on the previous administration. Many of the new commenters had only basic profile information on their pages, which featured mostly generic posts with religious or pro-government messages.
"It was Nic," said the employee, who was interviewed on the condition her name not be used for fear of retribution. "The fact that he had a troll army was known by everyone, but not openly talked about."
In the Philippines, candidates and government officials routinely pay vast cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to smear opponents and prop themselves up.
It's all part of the online propaganda wars shaking politics in the country.
And it could soon be coming to the U.S., according to election officials and disinformation scholars who are watching closely. They warn that the Philippine epidemic probably will spread here, given Filipinos' proficiency in English, facility with social media and the lure of money from campaigns looking for a new way to get an edge over the competition.
Already, U.S. operatives in both parties have made early efforts at using trolls for political gain. Rogue progressives stealthily launched fake social media campaigns against Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, during a 2017 special election. Their campaign aimed to confuse voters into thinking Moore supported banning alcohol and that Russian bots were working on his behalf.
The New York Times revealed the plot, along with an earlier, aborted plan developed by a firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents to engage dozens of paid trolls in swaying delegates to Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP convention. The plan was requested by a senior Trump campaign official but was not carried out.
"The presence of a large for-hire market looking at all the disinformation online that you can buy and people are selling is quite disturbing," Camille Francois, the chief innovation officer of Graphika, a firm that helps tech companies and government investigators find and confront online disinformation, said at a Federal Election Commission symposium in September.
"What these troll farms are reporting is a growth of global business. What do we do about that?"
Manila, alone, has hundreds of active troll farms. The shadowy networks act as weapons that, for the right price, can build artificial buzz around a product, a celebrity - or a political figure.
Those troll techniques "will be used more and more," said Malou N. Tiquia, chief executive of the Manila political strategy consultancy Publicus Asia. "When Facebook said it won't ban political ads, that was already a signal to everyone that anything goes."
U.S. regulators have barely begun to consider the mounting threat, and Silicon Valley has shown itself lacking the tools and will to effectively confront it. Tech firms are making little headway stamping out the scourge where it has emerged so far, even after Facebook in March removed from its platform 200 pages for "inauthentic" activity and took the rare step of identifying Gabunada's network as the culprit.
The Filipino digital propagandist has denied trafficking in misinformation and did not respond to texts seeking comment about his work for the Duterte administration.
Such moves by Facebook are doing little to slow the trolls.
Filipinos spend so much time online - they average a staggering 10 hours a day, according to industry data - and disinformation has spiraled so quickly that Katie Harbath, Facebook public policy director for global elections, branded it "patient zero in the global disinformation epidemic" during a 2018 talk in Berlin.
"The propaganda looks really organic and it often doesn't trip any of the flags" that alert tech companies, said Jonathan Ong, a professor of global digital media at University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research has taken him inside Filipino troll farms.
Political campaigns contract out their digital efforts to consultants, who in turn pay up to $1,000 per month to college students and recent graduates who are charged with launching multiple fake Facebook pages designed to look like they were created by actual voters or grassroots groups.
"It is so easy to be enlisted in these jobs," Ong said. His recent study on the industry includes an interview with one paid troll who fell into the work when the chief of staff of the political campaign she was working on ordered everyone to start creating fake accounts and posting on them.
Others have fleeting loyalties politically but are attracted to the cash. Consultants running troll farms have been known to switch sides in the middle of an election.
"The alliances are very shifty," Ong said. "Strategists will switch in the middle of a campaign to join who they think will be the winner. They will betray their client. It happened in the last election."
Most often, the operations are run through contractors separate from the actual campaigns so the candidate has no fingerprints on the weapon. And the trolls often don't trigger attention from tech platforms because they know how to avoid detection. The algorithms that tech companies use to detect phony accounts tend to focus on dozens of commenters posting the same message around the same time, or users with a stock photo on their profile page. The trolls don't do these things.
"You can look like legitimate Facebook users to trick the (company's) artificial intelligence," said Ross Tapsell, a researcher at Australian National University who documented the surge of paid troll activity in the Philippine province of Cebu.
In some cases operatives contract the work out to troll farms in far-off places, including Saudi Arabia.
"We have only scratched the surface of what a lot of this involved," he said.

Excusing bad behavior in any situation only encourages worse

Texto completo: Professional football involves systematic violence. On every play, men do things that would get them arrested in other contexts. What makes it a game -- rather than a brawl, a riot or deadly combat -- is that the violence is controlled.
There's a penalty for "unnecessary roughness" because roughness must be kept within certain limits. Some types of brutal contact are allowed, but others are forbidden.
Some forbidden ones were committed by Cleveland Browns defensive star Myles Garrett in a recent game against Pittsburgh. Having made a late hit on the Steelers' Mason Rudolph, which led to a scuffle with the quarterback, Garrett yanked Rudolph's helmet off and then struck him on the head with it.
Shocking incidents like this put a choice to the NFL: Deal leniently or sternly with the offender. The league could have decided that Garrett's ejection, coupled with a stiff fine and mandatory counseling, would suffice for his tantrum. Instead, it suspended him for the final six games of the season and gave no promise about when he will be reinstated. It thus sent Garrett a message that such outrageous conduct will not be tolerated.
But it also sent a strong message to all the players who get through each game without going berserk: that their stoic fortitude is recognized, respected and rewarded. To let Garrett off with a slap on the wrist would devalue their discipline. It would excuse bad behavior and generate more of it.
Donald Trump has a different attitude about punishing wrongdoers. He recently pardoned Clint Lorance, an Army lieutenant convicted of ordering the murder of three Afghans, and Matthew Golsteyn, a Green Beret major charged with murdering an Afghan prisoner.
Navy Secretary Richard Spencer was fired after Trump elected to reverse the demotion and preserve the SEAL Trident pin of Eddie Gallagher -- who was prosecuted in a military court on charges of murder and other crimes, though he was convicted only of posing for a photo with a corpse. Trump justified his decision by tweeting, "We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
But even in war, some killings are not allowed. Trump's intervention drew sharp criticism from military leaders, notably former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey and former Marine Corps commandant Gen. Charles Krulak.
Retired Army Col. Mike Jason, who led combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan, tweeted, "The decision to pardon these three men, countering the sanctity of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the decisions of commanders, the verdict of their peers, our adherence to the Laws of Warfare -- WILL have long lasting battlefield consequences."
These veterans know more of war than Trump does. It was Gallagher's fellow SEALs who accused him of crimes. Nine members of Lorance's unit testified against him. "It tainted our entire service," one of them told The New York Times. "Every time a new story calling him a hero happens, I don't sleep."
The vast majority of our troops recognize that fighting a war is not a euphemism for mass slaughter or premeditated murder. They respect the rules of combat, even when it would be easier and safer not to. When the president sides with those who violate those rules, he effectively denigrates the integrity and self control of everyone else in uniform.
What leaders get is what they reward and tolerate. Trump cares nothing for laws of war. He wants our troops to be "killing machines." His indiscriminate bloodlust will make it harder for commanders to elicit restraint from their troops.
The same logic, of course, applies to Trump's own corrupt, reckless, self-serving and destructive behavior as president -- most notably in his attempt to extort the president of Ukraine and his subsequent efforts to prevent Congress from learning all the facts.
No president since Richard Nixon has shown such contempt for law and such eagerness to misuse the powers of his office for his own benefit. Nixon was forced out, and his fate was a lesson to his successors on the boundaries of acceptable behavior.
If Trump is not impeached and removed, the message will be that presidents can get always with virtually anything. If he isn't held fully accountable for his abuses, he will set a new low standard for acceptable conduct. And we can expect the same, if not worse, from future presidents.
As musician Jason Isbell sings, "The right thing's always the hardest thing to do." Honoring the virtuous by punishing the vicious is one way to make doing the right thing just a bit easier.

Texto completo: A psychological thriller series debuts on Apple TV Plus. And the first two "Godfather" movies air on IFC.
What's Streaming
SERVANT Stream on Apple TV Plus. A recent trailer for this series has all the ingredients of a shocking story: an unsettling doll, foreboding rain and a title card that reads "from M. Night Shyamalan." That filmmaker is an executive producer of the series, a psychological thriller about a couple (Lauren Ambrose and Toby Kebbell) who have lost a child. As part of a form of therapy meant to help them cope, the pair start taking care of a lifelike baby doll. They even enlist a nanny (Nell Tiger Free) to help -- which is when matters begin to take a turn for the exceedingly strange.
FROZEN (2013) Stream on Disney Plus; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The fact that "Frozen 2" has basically taken over movie theaters is a sign of the enduring passion audiences have for Elsa and Anna, the royal sisters at the center of the films. (It is also a sign of the increasing monopolization of theaters by franchise movies.) The sisters, voiced principally by Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell, were introduced to the world in this first entry in the animated series, which won two Oscars. "Allegorically, 'Frozen' lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like 'Beauty and the Beast,"' Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The New York Times, "but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film."
BRICK (2006) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaker Rian Johnson just released an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery called "Knives Out," which hit theaters this week. He's no stranger to a murder tale: "Brick," Johnson's debut feature, also centers on a mysterious killing. The movie injects film noir into a 2000s Southern California setting, telling the story of a teenager (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who takes it upon himself to solve the murder of an ex-girlfriend (Emilie de Ravin).
What's on TV
THE GODFATHER PART II (1974) 9:30 p.m. on IFC. There are two big reasons Francis Ford Coppola's revered mob sequel is worth revisiting this month: Roger J. Stone Jr. and Martin Scorsese. Scorsese's new mob movie, "The Irishman," pairs Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, who each had one of the biggest roles of their career in "The Godfather Part II." The films would make a natural (if very long and gruesome) pairing. The second "Godfather" movie also came up this month in the trial of Stone, where a text message Stone once sent asking an associate to "do a Frank Pentangeli" came into play. The message was a reference to a character who gives obtuse answers during a Senate hearing in "The Godfather Part II" -- and is a good example of the deep cultural impact that the series has had. For memorable lines about "an offer he can't refuse" and a muscleman sleeping with the fishes, see the original movie, THE GODFATHER, which will air at 5:30 p.m. on IFC.

Texto completo: Readers, moved by their plight, ask what they can do and urge action to increase affordable housing.
To the Editor:
Re "114,000 Students in New York City Are Homeless. These Two Let Us Into Their Lives," by Eliza Shapiro, with photographs by Brittainy Newman (news article, Nov. 20):
First I have to say bravo! This was an incredibly well-written article that had the intended impact.
It was so poignant to consider that these were just two of the 114,000 stories, and the others are untold. It was crushing to hear about the lengths that these kids go to in order to overcome the obstacles to an education they face. And an education is what will lift these kids out of homelessness and poverty and offer a chance for a better life for them and their future children.
What can I as a New York City resident do to help, both big picture (what laws to vote for) and on a small scale (can we donate to these children, tutor them, offer our support)? I urge The Times to outline ways that we can help homeless children in need.
Hannah Ritchey
New York
Editors' Note: The author of the article offers some suggestions about how to help.
To the Editor:
The addition of more Education Department social workers is an important step in the right direction, but urgent attention must be paid to the conditions that continue to produce family homelessness and housing instability.
More and more children are bearing the enormous burden of our affordable housing crisis. This crisis is neither natural nor inevitable. Over the past 15 years, New York City's affordable housing market has been destabilized by predatory private equity companies and by landlords who illegally harass and intimidate low-income and rent-stabilized tenants to drive them out in favor of higher-paying tenants.
City and state leaders must listen to the voices of youth and parents demanding stable and good-quality affordable housing.
Elizabeth Clay Roy
New York
The writer is executive director of TakeRoot Justice.
To the Editor:
It is heartbreaking to read about homeless children like Sandy and Darnell. Both are being raised by poor, single mothers who have multiple children.
For 10 years, I mentored an extremely bright girl living in the poorest neighborhood in Bridgeport, Conn. Raised by an emotionally and physically abusive single mother, she graduated from one of Connecticut's worst-performing high schools, with a degree but not an education, with no path to supporting herself financially and no hope.
She had her I.U.D. removed and intentionally got pregnant. For her, a baby held the promise of love, companionship and a purpose in life, but her child is virtually guaranteed to grow up poor.
While access to effective birth control is critical, unless we address the emotional factors that drive women living in poverty to have children they cannot afford to raise, there will be too many stories like Sandy's and Darnell's.
Carolyn Field
Wilton, Conn.
To the Editor:
It is unconscionable in the richest country in the world that there are millions of homeless people, including more than 114,000 homeless school-age children in New York City alone. Perhaps those living in mansions could be persuaded to set an example and spend some of their billions to build housing for the homeless. What a heartwarming story that would be.

White House budget officials resigned amid concerns about frozen Ukraine aid

Texto completo: Two White House budget officials resigned in the wake of President Trump’s decision to freeze U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, a top budget official testified.
Mark Sandy said in a closed-door deposition to House impeachment investigators that at least two Office of Management and Budget officials resigned in part over their concerns about the halt in aid. Sandy said one of the officials resigned in September after voicing concerns about the holdup.
“As I recall, he expressed some frustrations about not understanding the reason for the hold,” Sandy said, according to a transcript of his testimony, which was released on Tuesday.
He said the other official, a lawyer, stepped down over concerns that the halt was violating the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which puts limits on the executive branch’s authority to impound congressionally appropriated funds.
Sandy did not name either of the officials who resigned and noted that he did not know whether other factors played into their decisions to resign.
House Democrats have sought to determine whether Trump conditioned nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine on the country launching an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, could face Trump in the general election.
The hold was released in September after a whistleblower filed a complaint about Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine. Trump had been briefed on the complaint when he unfroze the aid, according to the New York Times.

Confronting the reality of a cruel hoax on race and crime

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 27 Nov 2019: 10.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/confronting-reality-cruel-hoax-on-race-crime/docview/2318876477/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that "systemic racism" will "be with us" no matter who is in the White House. Sen. Cory Booker called for "attacking systemic racism" in the "racially biased" criminal justice system.
Let’s follow up by examining Booker’s concern about a "racially biased" criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, "A Platform of Urban Decline," which appeared in Manhattan Institute’s publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you’ve never read before.
According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: "According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well."
There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races.
White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House" are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people. We face the difficult, and sometimes embarrassing, task of confronting reality.
Mac Donald says that Barack Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an "unforgivable outburst of white supremacy." Here’s what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: "If we are honest with ourselves," too many fathers are "missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men." Then-Sen. Obama went on to say, "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
White liberals deem that any speaker’s references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. Black people cannot afford to buy into the white liberal agenda. White liberals don’t pay the same price. They don’t live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don’t go to bed with the sounds of gunshots. White liberals don’t live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don’t attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair, such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago.
Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system.

Texto completo: Arthur MacCaig, the subject of his estranged son Dónal Foreman's evocative documentary “ The Image You Missed ," knew little about the Troubles in Northern Ireland before spending a summer there in the 1970s. After that the conflict became his life's obsession. He went to film school in Paris so he could become a documentarian and record what he observed and reveal what he believed to be the real story about the ongoing struggle, truths that had been ignored or denied by other media.
His debut feature “The Patriot Game" (1979) got a rave review from Janet Maslin in The New York Times and was condemned by the United Kingdom Foreign Office as “damaging and highly critical of Her Majesty's Government." MacCaig, who died in 2008, at 60, would make seven more films on the subject over the next three decades, documenting the evolving strategy and tactics of the Irish Republican Army, which permitted him extraordinary access to its activities.
Foreman was born in 1985. MacCaig, based in Paris, didn't have much time to spare from his filmmaking for him or his mother, who raised Foreman by herself, in Dublin. That neglect might be the missed image mentioned in the documentary's title. In the film, Foreman tries to restore it with impressionistic montages that reflect the vagaries of memory, the verities of history, and the need to reconcile the potential of the past with the realities of the present. He deftly and dreamily cuts from MacCaig's footage to his own images and counterpoints his father's comments in interviews or letters with his own sometimes-plaintive, never-to-be-answered questions about why his father abandoned him and what his life might have been like had he not.
“In 1997 I was making my first film as you were making your last," Foreman says, introducing a striking sequence. Foreman, then 11, is seen shooting an amateur movie with his friends in his kitchen about terrorists. In one scene a kid stumbles through a door with his shirt covered in fake blood. A match cut is made to a shot of a man also stumbling through a door covered in real blood. It's from the work-in-progress that MacCaig is seen in the process of editing, later to be released as “War and Peace and Ireland" (1998).
“Today I'm making a film about the end of the conflict," MacCaig says. “I hope." He is referring to the then-ongoing negotiations that resulted in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought a fragile but still-lasting peace to the island. However, as Foreman has pointed out, it would also be his father's last feature because, as MacCaig laments, “nobody wanted to fund the film about peace in Northern Ireland."
Foreman also poses a dialectic between the father's and son's disparate concepts about cinema. “Filmmaking is nothing more than people who find themselves in front of a camera confronted by a filmmaker and their own experiences," MacCaig states. “In effect they must have the courage to account for their lives." Foreman's approach is less dogmatic and more searching. He envies his father's certitude but questions its validity. “Your camera always looked out into other people's worlds," he says. “Never your own."
“The Image You Missed" screens at the Brattle Theatre as part of the DocYard series on Dec. 2 at 7 p.m. A question-and-answer session with the director will follow.

Texto completo: You gotta love the art of sliming.
We Americans are good at it, thanks in no small part to a political climate in which disinformation serves as a devious means to an end — the end being what, exactly? More power, more money, more blind tribal affiliation, more of everything including a confused electorate?
Arguably the most successful practitioners of this art are the always entertaining talking heads at Fox News. Addictive stuff they're feeding us.
Now, thanks to former Fox talk show guest host Tobin Smith, we know how they do it. In a column published by the New York Times, Smith reveals how and why, by way of example, popular Fox host Laura Ingraham and guest John Yoo can concoct a fantasy about Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. Vindman, the guy who testified in the House impeachment proceedings, might be a Ukrainian spy. Whoa Nelly, who knew?!
Yes, Vindman is a Purple Heart recipient who serves as the Director of European Affairs for the National Security Council. So what? Vindman is an immigrant and possibly a spy to boot. This means he cannot be trusted to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth — especially when it comes to President You Know Who.
Bizarrely, probably after being water boarded by fake news reporters from the Times, Yoo later claimed he was really thinking about Ukrainians, not Vindman, when he made that accusation. "I really regret the choice of words," he said on CNN.
Well, call me unpersuaded. Yoo's original accusation remains firmly entrenched in my TV viewing head. Vindman is a disloyal spy who hates President You Know Who.
Speaking of disloyal traitors, Smith's insights into Fox News tell us something about right-wing TV's methods and motivations. He describes how the network's hosts routinely use narrative story lines — "Vindman might be a Ukrainian spy" — as weapons of mass emotional manipulation. These story lines give viewers simple explanations of events that they can use to personal advantage when talking with like-minded friends and uninformed political enemies.
Smith describes the Fox News counter narrative model as "simple and cunning". Two questions get asked every day. What is today's most emotionally engaging story? How can a believable Fox counter narrative story be constructed around it?
The hunt for what Smith calls the "killer narrative" starts with a high level memo that identifies the highest-trending articles on Foxnews.com and Drudge. Next, Fox News contributors are primed to deliver the new counter narrative wrapped inside an existing or new narrative. Ratings confirm that the most engaging narratives are built around something we all really love: Good old fashioned conspiracy theories.
You can't give me enough titillating conspiracy theories. Love 'em all. They make me feel really good about myself and help me be smarter than my political enemies. I'm grateful that all my tribal friends — loyal elected officials being prime among them — can amplify and tweet conspiracy narratives to their (and my) heart's content.
We all end up knowing the real truth: Deep state operatives are out to get President You Know Who for no good reason. Hillary Clinton was never properly investigated for her scandalous emails. Attorney General Bill Barr didn't misrepresent the worst findings of the Mueller report. The indignation juices really get flowing when it feels like they're attacking me, too! I am victimized twice over, yet again!
Funny how I'm left craving more while Fox goes cha-ching. Fortunately, I feel more in control, better armed with special knowledge. If Fox talking heads suggest Vindman might be a Ukrainian spy, that's good enough for me. How about you?

On Set for Alison Roman's Thanksgiving

Texto completo: The NYT Cooking video team spent two days capturing the feast preparations in Ms. Roman's small Brooklyn apartment -- jokes, hot takes and all.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was a cool afternoon in early September, and Thanksgiving was in the air in Alison Roman's Brooklyn apartment.
There were bowls full of shallots, onions and garlic on her kitchen table. Squashes lined her countertops. (No sweet potatoes, though; Ms. Roman isn't a fan.) Forty-two pints' worth of turkey stock sat in her fridge. Even her bathtub had been turned into a makeshift cooler for the turkey.
Among the bounty, the production team behind the NYT Cooking YouTube channel traversed the small apartment in their socks (it's a no-shoe household), checking sound and lighting and making other preparations to begin filming.
That week, Ms. Roman, a columnist for The New York Times's Food section, made not one but two complete Thanksgiving meals in her one-bedroom apartment. The first meal was prepared for a photo shoot for a guide to the day, complete with recipes, and print spread that will appear in Wednesday's paper. And the second was prepared as a demonstration for the NYT Cooking video, "Small Kitchen, Big Thanksgiving with Alison Roman."
When I arrived on set during the first day of filming, the small crew was just breaking for lunch. They seemed more like family than co-workers as they passed dishes down the table, splitting and sharing falafel plates, hummus and salads.
"We all know that we're a small team and we have a big job ahead of us," Scott Loitsch, the executive video producer, said. "We're all in on that and supporting each other."
The three-person NYT Cooking team may be small, but it is mighty. They work separately from other video staff at The Times and produce one video a week. Most videos are between eight and 15 minutes and focus on specific recipes by a variety of Times columnists and contributors. Ms. Roman is featured regularly on the channel. And the Thanksgiving video special, which by the end had produced more than 16 hours of footage, was the first longform video that presented an entire menu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Loitsch, from upstate New York, leads the trio and works one camera. Vaughn Vreeland, a senior video journalist from North Carolina, commands a second camera, while Gina Fernandez, a production assistant and Bronx native, coordinates production and monitors sound, sometimes bringing filming to a halt to wait for planes or loud traffic to pass.
Over the past few months of working together, they have gotten to know each other and Alison exceptionally well. While filming the Thanksgiving video, they listed her "hot takes" -- controversial opinions -- without taking a breath.
"She doesn't like sandwiches," Ms. Fernandez said. "Or burgers," Mr. Vreeland added, quickly after.
"Alison and I both agree that marshmallows don't deserve to be on food," Ms. Fernandez said.
In fact, Ms. Roman doesn't like "soft foods" in general, which meant that pumpkin pie was definitely not on her Thanksgiving menu.
"For me, it's more about taking the general Thanksgiving menu framework and making it work for the flavor profiles and ingredients you like to cook with anyway," she said. "So you have a turkey potato stuffing, a green bean, an orange vegetable, a gravy, a cranberry."
For Ms. Roman, and Mr. Vreeland, that cranberry is best jellied and canned.
"I grew up eating it, so I was very happy that somebody who's very out there in the culinary world also agrees with my trash tastes," he said.
Which gave the team one of their favorite moments while filming the Thanksgiving project with Ms. Roman.
"She had just gone on this long diatribe about how the best, most effective way to open a can of cranberries is upside down," Mr. Vreeland said.
So when the time came, she opened the can at the bottom, gripped it and shook it, but all that came out was a cartoonish "bwip."
"We were all just dying," Mr. Loitsch said. "The footage is almost unusable because it's so shaky cause we were laughing so much."
The goal of the NYT Cooking videos is not only to teach people how to prepare specific recipes, but to entertain, inspire and demystify cooking for the audience. Occasionally, viewers will even see the team behind the scenes in videos, which is no accident.
"We want them to look real, and we want it to be like you're in the kitchen with us as we're filming," Mr. Vreeland said.
After Ms. Roman and the team had been together for close to 48 hours, filming was done. Production wrapped in her kitchen with wine, mezcal shots and cheers.

'In my own name': Anonymous author pledges to confront Trump before 2020 election

Texto completo: The anonymous "resistance" op-ed author claims he or she will come forward to speak out against President Trump before the 2020 election.
"Trump will hear from me, in my own name, before the 2020 election," the unnamed author of the new tell-all book, A Warning, declared on Tuesday.
Ever since the New York Times published an anonymous opinion piece by a senior member of the Trump administration in September 2018, which spoke of an internal "resistance" group of officials working to stymie the president's worst inclinations, rampant speculation has swirled about the identity of the author.
"As far as anonymity is concerned, I will not keep my identity shrouded in secrecy forever. I am not afraid to use my own name to express concern about the current occupant of the Oval Office," the unnamed writer said while taking part in a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" forum.
"Donald Trump has not heard the last of me. There is more to come," the author continued. "Other people who are currently serving, and who have left, are also considering adding their voices before votes are cast in 2020. We talk about this with some regularity. In the meantime, Trump must answer to the American people for his own conduct instead of redirecting their attention."
One possible hint came when a Reddit user asked if the U.S. Naval Academy will win in the annual Army-Navy college football game. "Yes," the writer replied.
"A clue!" another Reddit user exclaimed.
The forum took place following the Nov. 19 release of A Warning, which sought to tell voters "the truth" before the 2020 election.
There were several explosive claims in the book that reflect poorly on Trump, including one that focuses on a group of high-level White House aides putting together tally of Cabinet members they believed would support the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Another section of the book talks about how a group of senior Trump administration officials considered a "midnight self-massacre" in which they would resign together to draw attention to Trump's behavior.
Despite the bombshell allegations, the White House shrugged off the publication of the book.
"Others can fret about ridiculous, cowardly accusations; President Trump remains focused on delivering results to the American people," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. Asked if the White House now had a clearer idea of the identity of the author, Grisham added, “Yes — a coward."
But a little more than a year ago, following the publication of the Times op-ed, a litany of Trump administration officials denied being the author amid frenetic speculation, including Vice President Mike Pence, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump, who called the author "gutless" and question whether a "so-called 'Senior Administration Official'" really existed, even pushed then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions investigate the source of the opinion piece.
This week Guy Snodgrass, an ex-speechwriter for former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, raised suspicions when he tiptoed around rumors that he was the author of A Warning. But he later rejected the rumors, saying, “No, I’m not the writer."
In the "AMA" on Tuesday, billed by Sean Desmond, publisher of Twelve, as "the first opportunity for Anonymous to respond to questions," the anonymous author addressed a wide range of topics. The official raised concerns about Trump's mental stability and appeared to confirm still being employed by the Trump administration.
"You'd be surprised (or maybe not) how remarkably widespread the sentiments conveyed in A Warning are shared — almost hourly — among folks in all corners of the White House and the Administration. The President knows this and fears this, which is why he's ordered us to ignore this book," the person said.
Impeachment was also discussed during the "AMA." The anonymous author said there was no doubt that Trump "demanded a quid pro quo from Ukraine in order to disrupt the 2020 election," but cautioned against Congress removing Trump from office.
"The only credible way to stop Trump is at the ballot box--and by a convincing margin," the official said. "He has to be defeated badly enough that Republicans will recognize they cannot support Trump's claim of voter suppression, or tampering, or fraud. He will never willingly acknowledge defeat and will fuel conspiracy theories for years to come. That will be dangerous for the country, so we've got to deprive him of those arguments with decisive electoral action."
Anonymity was heralded as an effective weapon when criticizing Trump, exemplified in recent months when a CIA analyst, who has yet to be identified, filed the whistleblower complaint that spurred impeachment proceedings.
"Trump thrives on distractions, and anonymity is a way to deprive him of his favorite weapon of mass distraction--personal attacks--and force the discussion to center on the substance, his character," the author said. "We've seen this on full display in the past few weeks, as the President has mercilessly attacked honorable public servants, from an anonymous whistleblower to aides on his own National Security Council. He can't win on ideas, just on mud slinging and personal attacks. So he's trying to use the long arm of government to unmask and undermine his critics."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance Monday with the dog he called the "world's most famous" - Conan, the Belgian Malinois injured in the raid that took down Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
"Conan is a tough cookie, and nobody's going to mess with Conan," the president told reporters gathered in the Rose Garden. He added, "Yet you see how beautiful and how calm he is during a situation like this. And you're very lucky, because he's not in a bad mood today."
Mr. Trump identified the dog as male during the news conference. But confusion over the dog's sex abounded after it concluded. A pool reporter, citing a White House official who spoke on background, said the dog was female. That claim was later contradicted by another official, who said Conan was male.
Intrigue has surrounded the heroic canine ever since Mr. Trump disclosed that "a beautiful dog, a talented dog" had chased al-Baghdadi into a dead-end tunnel during the Oct. 26 operation in northern Syria. The pup's identity was briefly considered classified, with U.S. officials concerned that publicizing it might also reveal the identity of the elite Army unit she served.
Yet Mr. Trump, who has complained about not receiving enough credit for the raid that killed the terrorist leader, fed into the frenzy over the dog he said had played a key role. He first tweeted out a photo of the "wonderful" animal on Oct. 28.
"We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of [IS], Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!" Mr. Trump wrote.
More tweets followed, with the president eventually revealing the dog's name. In one image he tweeted, a Medal of Honor recipient was replaced with a photograph of Conan - tongue lolling - receiving the honor. He promised to commend the dog in person.
On Monday, Mr. Trump told reporters he had presented Conan with a medal and a plaque for heroism. He said the dog had been "very badly hurt" during the raid that killed al-Baghdadi - exposed to electric wires while chasing the terrorist leader - leading some to fear Conan "might not be able to recover." Yet Conan has bounced back and is nowhere near retiring.
The Belgian Malinois breed, Mr. Trump said, is the "ultimate fighter, ultimate everything," and besides being able to take a person down can also sniff out drugs.
As Mr. Trump described Conan as "so brilliant" and "so smart," the subject of his praise, mouth agape, looked to Vice President Mike Pence for head scratches. Mr. Trump, the first American president in a century without a dog of his own, stood with his hands at his side, as did first lady Melania Trump.
It was "a real joy to help walk him here to the White House," Mr. Pence said.
On their way back into the White House, the first couple laughed when a reporter shouted out, "Melania, do you want to adopt the dog for Barron?" She appeared to decline.
Conan joins a long, scruffy line of war dogs that have served alongside U.S. troops for more than a century. And in each major campaign, dogs have become remarkably agile on battlefields as some of the most fearsome and effective weapons.
"They have to adapt the same way humans adapt," said Rebecca Frankel, author of "War Dogs: Tales of Canine History, Heroism and Love." As long as combatants plant their feet on soil, Ms. Frankel told The Washington Post, "dogs are the best nonhuman partners on the ground."
War dogs are now most prominent in Special Operations raids. In 2011, a dog named Cairo accompanied Navy SEALs on the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.
Troops on raids don't rely on dogs just to sniff out bombs. They also use the jarring, ferociously fast attack of dogs like Conan to terrify would-be threats. In the case of a handler and the dog, "the enemy now has two threats," Ms. Frankel said.

Texto completo: The federal investigation into two associates of Rudy Giuliani is exploring a wide range of potential crimes — including wire fraud and failure to register as a foreign agent — as prosecutors dig into the pair's interactions with the president's personal lawyer and the main pro-Trump super PAC, according to people familiar with the investigation.
Giuliani's dealings with the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are being investigated by federal prosecutors at the US attorney's office in Manhattan. That office has already filed campaign finance charges against Parnas and Fruman, accusing them of conspiracy and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission.
According to people familiar with the ongoing case, investigators are scrutinizing Giuliani's consulting business and eyeing donations made to America First Action, the main pro-Trump super PAC set up by his advisers and allies after his election, as well as its affiliated nonprofit group.
As part of the probe, federal prosecutors are examining a raft of other potential crimes, including destruction or alteration of documents, aiding and abetting federal crimes, and foreign nationals contributing to US candidates, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.
The list of possible crimes under investigation does not mean those charges will be filed. They do, however, indicate that prosecutors are casting a wide net for potential wrongdoing as they examine the business and legal dealings of the president's personal lawyer, and two Soviet emigres business executives who have been assisting Giuliani in the efforts to dig up damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on the president's behalf.
Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty. An attorney for Parnas declined to comment. An attorney for Fruman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Giuliani, who has not been accused of any crimes, has denied any wrongdoing. He did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman for American First Action said the group reached out last month to federal prosecutors in New York, offering to cooperate voluntarily. She said the group has received no subpoenas and follows the law, declining to comment further.
A representative for the US attorney's office declined to comment.

Trump ordered review of US sanctions on Turkish bank
President Trump told the Treasury Department and Justice Department to look into the impact of US sanctions on a Turkish state-owned bank after being lobbied by Turkey's president, a Treasury official acknowledged in a letter last week to a top Democratic senator.
The letter, sent in response to queries by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, outlined seven meetings Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had with senior Turkish officials from April 2017 through this month, but didn't detail what was discussed or answer other questions posed by Wyden, who is the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.
Bloomberg News reported in October that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made repeated entreaties to Trump to avoid charges against Halkbank, one of Turkey's largest lenders. Trump assigned Mnuchin and Attorney General William Barr to look into the issue after an April phone call with Erdogan.
Wyden in a statement said the Treasury's response was unsatisfactory and "raises more questions than it answers."
Bloomberg News
Rick Perry says Trump is God's 'chosen one'
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry believes that President Trump was chosen by God to lead the country — and he handed the president a one-page description of morally flawed biblical kings as inspiration, he said.
"God's used imperfect people all through history. King David wasn't perfect. Saul wasn't perfect. Solomon wasn't perfect," Perry said in an interview on Fox News.
Trump himself caused a stir in August when he described himself in seemingly messianic terms: In one day, he looked to the sky while calling himself "the chosen one" to handle trade policy, and quoted the words of a conspiracy-theorist radio host who likened Trump to "the King of Israel" and "the second coming of God."
Perry says he told the president that this posturing, which some critics took as egotistical or even blasphemous, was correct.
"'Mr. President . . . you said you were the chosen one,"' Perry recalled saying in the Oval Office. "I said, 'You were . . . You are here in this time because God ordained you."'
He noted that he believes Barack Obama was also ordained by God for the presidency.
It's a common view among some evangelical Christians. Some of Trump's loudest evangelical defenders, like Franklin Graham, often compare him to sinful but important biblical kings, especially King David — who wrote the beautiful Psalms and slayed Goliath, but also impregnated Bathsheba and then calculated to have her husband killed.
It's a less common theme among political figures, prior to Perry's comments on Fox News.
Perry, whose trip to Ukraine for the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is under scrutiny as the House impeachment inquiry probes the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine, went on to say that he believes Trump will not be removed from office.
Perry, a former Texas governor who ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican primary for president, has served as energy secretary since the beginning of the Trump administration.

Conan the dog gets hero's welcome at White House
A US military dog that played a starring role in the raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seemed oblivious to the praise that President Trump heaped on it Monday at the White House.
Conan, a Belgian Malinois, seemed much more interested in the head scratches it was getting from Mike Pence, repeatedly looking up at the vice president in search of more attention.
Trump used a slew of adjectives to describe Conan, which was injured when it was exposed to electric wires in the late October raid while chasing al-Baghdadi at the terrorist's compound in northwest Syria. “Incredible." “Brilliant." “Smart." “Ultimate fighter." “Very special." “Tough cookie."
“So this is Conan," Trump said. “Right now, probably the world's most famous dog."
Trump said he bestowed a medal on Conan and presented the dog with a plaque. First lady Melania Trump stood a few feet away.

Texto completo: First son Barron Trump has his own Cabinet, of sorts.
A new insider book dished that the 13-year-old son of the president and first lady Melania Trump is the boss of the president’s 10 grandchildren.
Barron, according to Inside Trump’s White House, being released tomorrow, “rules the grandkids.”
Donald Trump, Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, Barron Trump
The big reveal in historian Doug Wead’s book, provided to Secrets, comes from half brother Donald Trump Jr., who described the first few days of the Trump presidency and the family’s experience of their first two nights inside the White House in 2017.
On the second night, Jan. 21, after a day of celebration, the White House staff filled a State Dining Room table with burgers and chicken fingers, Trump recalled. The adults couldn’t resist and joined their children in a mini-feast.
Wead wrote, “The children didn’t stay in the dining room long. They were soon scattered throughout the State Floor in a rousing game of White House hide-and-go-seek with Uncle Barron as the supervisor. ‘The kids all love Barron,’ Don Jr. explains. ‘He rules the grandkids.’’
Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Barron Trump
That same night, as the adults dined, Eric and Lara Trump announced that they were having another child, Luke.
When the family applauded, Barron was drawn back to the State Dining Room to see what the commotion was about.
“What happened? What happened?” he asked. Told of the news about a 10th Trump grandchild on the way, he said, “OK,” as the other grandchildren called from the East Room where they were playing. “Uncle Barron was needed elsewhere,” wrote Wead.
The New York Times best-selling author, who is the official Trump biographer, also suggested that in a family of tall men and women, Barron is fast on his way to being the tallest.
Donald Trump, Barron Trump, Melania Trump
At 13, he already appears taller than his mom and dad, who stands six-foot, two inches, and getting close to his tallest brother, Eric, at six-foot, five inches.
“By the time I finish this book, Barron may stand taller than any of them,” wrote Wead.
Throughout the administration, the first family has been protective of Barron, following a pattern set by other White House parents with younger children.
Still, he has been assailed on the internet.
Wead told Secrets, "He's not in the book very often, but he's a star."
He added, "Imagine, he came in a 10-year-old boy, and he will leave as a man, perhaps taller than all of the brothers. Imagine such a physical transformation, which you can see? Every time you buy shoes, they are the wrong size. And then imagine the emotional and intellectual transformation that you cannot see. The attacks on his father and mother."
"No wonder Melania is protective."

Texto completo: When I was in my 20s and living in Cleveland, Ohio, I hungoutregularlywithagroup of friends who loved to try new recipes.We'd divvy up duties inoneof
ourill-equippedkitchens for a fabulously messy
cook-a-thon, then fill our plates around a table set with cheap, mismatched dishware, swooningoveroursuccessesandpoking
fun at our flops. Our biggest kitchen disasters remain some of our greatest sources of hilarity.
Reading Alison Roman's "Nothing Fancy:Unfussy Food for Having People Over" (Potter, $42.50) makes me nostalgic for those days. The columnist for The New York Times
and Bon Appetit has amassed a huge cult following for the low-stress, high-impactspreads she cooks up in her tiny Brooklyn kitchen and shares on Instagram. She calls this "having people over" rather than "entertaining," a word that, to her, implies "something per-formative at best and inauthentic at worst."
Throughout chapters for snacks(not "hors d'oeuvres!"), salads, sides, mains and desserts, she offers tips and pep talks for people who tend to overthink menus to the point that they never get around to issuing invitations.
She suggests starting a party with a "house snack" that friends can expect whenever they visit. Hers is a bowl of Creamy Sesame Turmeric Dip with Ak-Mak crackers (Armenian cracker bread) for dipping.It sounds a lot more interesting than the ubiquitous CaliforniaDip(sourcreamblended with Lipton Onion Soup mix) with ruffled potato chips of a certain generation, but it's just about as easy.
One night, I whipped up her One-Pot Chicken with Dates and Caramelized Lemon and paired it with Frizzled Chickpeas and Onions with Feta and Oregano.I hadn't planned on company, but this meal seemed too good not to share. Soon, my neighbor and I were raving over the deliciousness of this last-minute feast, wondering aloud why we didn't dine like this more often.

Texto completo: The billionaire said he bought the symbolic domain name this month "to make sure someone didn't do something crazy with it."
Well, you had your chance.
After going up for auction last month, Democracy.com has officially been sold. Its new owner is Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks.
Mr. Cuban, who is also famous for his role on the reality television show "Shark Tank," confirmed the sale in an email exchange with The New York Times. He explained that he had no plans for the highly symbolic address and had purchased the domain to protect it from abuse -- or, in his words, "to make sure someone didn't do something crazy with it."
He offered limited additional information about the deal.
"Someone sent me a cold email," he explained. "I gave them a price I would be willing to pay. They said yes." He declined to say how much he had paid.
The minimum bid had been set at $ 300,000, but the auction was called off after Mr. Cuban made his offer.
The sale, through Heritage Auctions, had been orchestrated by Talmage Cooley, an entrepreneur who used the domain for years as the home to a start-up social platform where politicians and civic groups could connect with supporters. The enterprise ran out of money in February, prompting the decision to sell the domain, which was owned by one of Mr. Cooley's investors, whom he declined to identify.
Days before the auction was set to close, Mr. Cooley emailed Mr. Cuban to invite him to buy the domain.
"I just made it super succinct and talked about the importance of this name being used for good," Mr. Cooley said.
Mr. Cuban replied within minutes and the sale was completed within a few days, according to Mr. Cooley. (While he declined to share further details about the deal, citing a confidentiality agreement, Mr. Cooley said that Mr. Cuban's offer exceeded the auction's minimum bid.)
Mr. Cuban has long been vocal about politics.
In 2016, he endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and he has described himself as a social centrist and fiscal conservative. In September, he said that his family opposed the idea of his running for president in 2020, but that if he did, he would do so as an independent.
Despite its resonant and memorable name, Democracy.com has had a relatively unremarkable history. It was registered in the mid-1990s on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, which ultimately did nothing with it, according to a 1997 article in the magazine In These Times.
The domain was later sold to John Carrieri, an entrepreneur who told The Times last month that he had wanted to use it as the home to an educational website but sold it about a decade later after deciding that he couldn't garner the resources necessary to do it justice.
The domain was then listed in auctions hosted by a domain name reseller in 2010 and 2012, the year that Mr. Cooley said he began licensing the address.
While he is disappointed that the start-up didn't work out, Mr. Cooley said he was happy that the domain was in good hands.
"I'm glad that somebody in the U.S. bought it, as opposed to a Russian counter-democracy organization," he said.

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
You see, apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 piece for the New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"If you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents' blood, your children's blood, your lover's blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water."
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a "probable link" between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
"I was just floored," said Ruffalo. "It's like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it."
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters." The film — opening in select cinemas Friday, Nov. 22 before expanding on Nov. 29 and playing nationwide on Dec. 6 — was produced by Ruffalo.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on the issue of PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
The question of Bilott's motivation compelled Ruffalo, the actor said.
"Was there really a rebellious quality in him? Did he have a chip on his shoulder about something?" Ruffalo wondered. Instead, the actor kept coming back to a much more straightforward answer.
"He believed in people, and he saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo said of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That's how he handled everything, and it's that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that's just not the nature of Rob and that's not the nature of the story."
Oscar-winning actor and activist Tim Robbins co-stars in "Dark Waters" as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
"That's what spoke to me, it was the unexpected nature of it," said Robbins, "the man whose law firm represents chemical companies, to take on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right? This is not something they normally do. I find characters like that really inspiring."
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670.7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins said, serve as guides for how more changes could come in the future.
"It's not like they're your liberal reformers or anything, it's people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," said Robbins. "And quite frankly, it's going to be up to people like Tom Terp to realize that morality in themselves and take risks and perhaps compromise their position of power or their livelihood to do the right thing."
Directed by Oscar nominee Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, "Dark Waters" is a Focus Features release presented by Participant.
Haynes' film is firmly in the whistleblower cinema tradition that includes "All The President's Men" (1976) and "The Post" (2017), specifically the environmental and legal sub-genre alongside Oscar-winner "Erin Brockovich" (2000) and Oscar nominee "A Civil Action" (1997).
But it also has plenty in common with Ruffalo and Participant's 2015 modern classic "Spotlight," which earned a Best Picture Oscar and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Ruffalo. Both films are non-sensationalist, methodical examination of all of the work — legal in the case of "Dark Waters," journalistic in "Spotlight" — that goes into uncovering the truth.
"Dark Waters," with its exposure of DuPont practices, also serves as an inadvertent companion piece to "Foxcatcher." That 2014 starred an Oscar-nominated Ruffalo as Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, who was murdered in 1996 by chemical empire heir John du Pont, played by Steve Carrell.
Taken together, "Dark Waters" and "Foxcatcher" chillingly speak to the free reign our society has afforded powerful corporations and families.
"It is a corporate elite in America that basically because of economic reasons are given free hand to pollute, to dominate, to run amok," Ruffalo said. "Whether it's John du Pont in 'Foxcatcher' and his delusions of grandeur that came from a lifetime of privilege and money or it's DuPont as a corporate entity who was a driving economic factor in American business.
"If all we value is the GDP of a country as a value of its health or well-being, then you're going to have a lot more stories like the PFOA story and a lot more companies like DuPont who knowingly and willingly poisoned the world for pure profit and the almighty dollar."
"Dark Waters," 126 minutes, rated PG-13, open in select cinemas before expanding on Friday and playing nationwide on Dec. 6. More info: www.focusfeatures.com/dark-waters.

The Real Cost of Tweeting About My Kids

Texto completo: When I've told you what my son said, it's not "his data" anymore.
Here is an anecdote I was not allowed to post on Twitter.
On a recent trip to Costco, the kids were fighting in the back of the car and I asked my husband, "Why do we have such bad children? Is it because we're bad parents?" He said, "Yes, but it's not our fault, we must've had bad parents." I said, "But that's not their fault -- " and my 6-year-old son interrupted, enraged, yelling from the back of the car, "IT'S ALL GOD'S FAULT!"
Your own reaction to this story can tell you why my son wouldn't let me tweet it: He doesn't want you to think he's cute. (He has consented to have it appear here. No children's rights were violated in the writing of this essay.) When he was saying those words, he was not trying to entertain. He was angry -- at me, at my husband, at God and, after I asked him whether I could tweet it, at you for the way he knew you would react.
My oldest son is 15, and he finds my Twitter behavior undignified. ("Why does the world need to know that we are at Costco?") He feels that a teacher, mentor and role model should cultivate a distance, even a mystique, so as to elicit the kind of respect she needs from her students, advisees and admirers. If people do not think they know you, then you do not need to worry, as my 6-year-old did, that you have left yourself in their interpretive hands. You can restrict their thoughts about you.
To allow others to think about us in whatever way they feel like -- perhaps to laugh at us, perhaps to dismiss us -- is a huge loss of control. So why do we allow it? What is the attraction of it? I think that it's the increase in control we get in return. Social media has enabled the Great Control Swap. And it is happening right now, beneath our notice.
The first baby step toward the Great Swap was the shift from phone calls to texts. A phone interaction requires participants to be "on the same time," which entails negotiations over entrance into and exit from the conversation. Consider all the time we spend first on, "Is this a bad time to call? Can you talk?" And then later on, "O.K., gotta go, talk to you soon, see you later, good talking to you ... " (It's only in the movies that you can just hang up on someone.) Everyone has been in a phone conversation that ended much later than they wanted it to; the form subjects us to the will of another.
A text or email interaction, by contrast, liberates the parties so that each may operate on their own time. But the cost comes in another form of control: data. Homer's "winged words" fly from the mouth of one directly to the ear of another, but text-based communication requires stationary words: One person puts them down, so the other can come along and read them at her leisure. And that means they leave a trail.
Imagine a man conducting a romantic affair exclusively by email. He needn't lie to his wife about fake "business trips," since he can pursue his shenanigans right under her nose. Likewise, he avoids undesirable entanglements with his mistress: He doesn't even need to buy her dinner! Email allows him the control to steer the two women out of the way of one another -- but the price he pays is a very robust data trail. His affair has a text archive. If his mistress decides to write a book about it, she can be scientific. She needn't rely on memory or vague impressions. She can systematically analyze their interactions and quote his exact words.
Our anger at social media companies resembles this man's anger over his mistress's theft of his "private data." We wanted one kind of control, and didn't reckon with the fact that we'd have to pay for it with another kind. We wanted to be able to interact with other people entirely in our own time, with people who make no demands on us. We wanted entry and exit to be painless. We understood from the start that this form of socializing -- like an affair without physical contact -- was shallower than the other, more demanding kind. We were prepared to accept that trade-off, but failed to grasp that we were trading away more than depth. We were also trading away a kind of control.
As my children appreciate, the control issue goes well beyond whether Facebook monetizes our data. It is also a matter of making oneself into a thing that others can own. When I've told you what my son said, it's not "his data" anymore. He can't control whether you laugh at it, or what tone you use when you do.
We don't like to acknowledge just how much we are willing to pay for distance from other people. For example, people warn prospective parents that having a baby is expensive, but that isn't exactly true. What's expensive is getting away from your baby. If you don't want to feed them with your body, you buy formula and bottles. If you don't want them looking at you all the time, you buy contraptions to entertain them. A stroller so you don't have to carry them, a crib so you don't have to sleep with them, a house with extra rooms so you don't even have to sleep near them, child care so that you can get farther away yet: These are the costs that add up. You don't pay much for babies, but you pay a lot to escape them.
All of us have a desire to connect, to be seen. But we live in a world that is starting to allow us to satisfy that desire without feeling the common-sense moral strictures that have traditionally governed human relationships. We can engage without obligation, without boredom and, most importantly, without subjecting our attention to the command of another. On Twitter, I'm never obligated to listen through to the end of someone's story.
The immense appeal of this free-form socializing lies in the way it makes one a master of one's own time -- but it cannot happen without a place. All that data has to sit somewhere so that people can freely access it whenever they wish. Data storage is the loss of control by which we secure social control: Facebook is our faithless mistress's leaky inbox.
When we alienate our identities as text data, and put that data "out there" to be read by anyone who wanders by, we are putting ourselves into the interpretive hands of those who have no bonds or obligations or agreements with us, people with whom we are, quite literally, prevented from seeing "eye to eye." People we cannot trust.
The Great Control Swap buys us control over the logistics of our interactions at the cost of interpretive control over the content of those interactions. Our words have lost their wings, and fallen to the ground as data.

Texto completo: Ciara hosts this year's American Music Awards, and Judy Garland stars in the beloved period musical "Meet Me in St. Louis."
What's on TV
2019 AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. Ciara hosts this year's A.M.A.s ceremony, which honors the music industry's top performers. As always, the night will feature an eclectic slate of live performances -- this year, from Kesha and Big Freedia; Christina Aguilera featuring A Great Big World; and Post Malone, who will be joined by Ozzy Osbourne, Travis Scott and Watt. Selena Gomez will showcase new music, Green Day will celebrate the 25th anniversary of "Dookie" and Shania Twain will perform a medley of her greatest hits. Taylor Swift, who suggested earlier this month that her former label Big Machine was preventing her from singing her old songs on TV, is scheduled to be honored as artist of the decade.
BACK TO LIFE 10 p.m. on Showtime. Life for Miri Matteson (Daisy Haggard) post prison hasn't been easy. Members of her small coastal community have responded to her return by leaving offensive graffiti on her parents' house, lobbing a brick at her through a window at her new job and sending her a very unpleasant package in the mail. But Miri has soldiered on, trying to convince people that she's not the monster they think she is, working to repair her strained relationship with her mother, reconnecting with old friends and even testing the waters with a new love interest. In the final two episodes of the first season, Miri confronts the unforgiving residents of her town and learns about the events that led to the death of her friend.
CHRISTMAS 9 TO 5 8 p.m. on Lifetime. The latest installment of Lifetime's holiday programming touches on a topical phenomenon: the decline of the American department store. Jennifer (played by Tiya Sircar) is an investigative reporter who goes undercover as a store clerk at Desmond's, an outlet known for its holiday decorations and festivities. There, she starts up a workplace romance with Jack (Joe Dinicol), who informs her that the store will be closing after Christmas. Together they work to restore Desmond's to its former glory.
What's Streaming
MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944) Stream on the Criterion Channel. This film is perhaps more remembered for its musical numbers, like "The Trolley Song" and "Meet Me in St. Louis," than it is as a holiday classic. But with its focus on family dynamics and Judy Garland's performance of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," it's also a seasonal favorite. The film follows the Smith family in St. Louis, Mo., over one lively year leading up to the 1904 World's Fair as the sisters Rose (Lucille Bremer), Esther (Garland), Agnes (Joan Carroll) and Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) navigate romance and anticipate a move to New York after the Christmas holiday. In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote, "The Smiths and their home, in Technicolor, are eyefuls of scenic delight, and the bursting vitality of their living inspires you like vitamin A."

Texto completo: Lhooq Books, the funky Carlsbad Village bookstore and arts hub that was set to close Saturday after losing its lease, has been granted a seven-month reprieve. But proprietor Sean Christopher said without community support to find and underwrite a new location, the business will close for good next spring.
Christopher, 45, has leased the property for the last 12 years at 755 1/2 Carlsbad Village Drive and lives with his 10-year-old son, Jack, in an 1940s-era home next door. Although Christopher said he had never missed a rent payment on the two properties, the landlord unexpectedly canceled his month-to-month lease in mid-September and gave him 60 days to vacate the property.
With so little time to find both a new home and retail space, and no savings to pay for the move, Christopher said he feared he and his son would end up homeless.

After starting a community appeal on Facebook and a Gofundme campaign, Christopher hired a lawyer and he and the landlord, San Juan Capistrano City Manager Ben Siegel, hammered out a compromise Oct. 31. The lease has been extended to May 31. Although details of the agreement are sealed, Christopher said he's grateful to have time to figure out his next steps.
Ideally, Christopher said he would like to find an arts-loving philanthropist or nonprofit organization that would underwrite Lhooq Books' move to a new location in coastal north San Diego County, which he could continue to operate as a paid employee. But if there's not enough community support to relocate, Christopher said he will sell off the store's vast collection of vintage books, art and memorabilia and move to the Pacific Northwest, where he would concentrate on writing novels and short stories, his first passion. As a fourth-generation Carlsbad resident, he's hoping for the former, rather than the latter.
"I think North County, especially coastal North County, needs an arts and culture space that specializes specifically in what many would call avant-garde or underground art, music and writing," he said. "We worked very hard at creating a space that was all that, but also was inviting to all."
Lhooq Books -- located in an alley between Garden Stage Bagels and the Taco Bell/KFC restaurant near Madison Street -- has the oddball, grass-roots vibe of something you'd find in San Francisco or Berkeley.
The front outdoor wall of the converted garage is lined with hundreds of books that community members are welcome to borrow or pay what they can to buy. Inside, thousands of rare, vintage and new books line floor-to-ceiling shelves decorated with found art, globes, statuary, antique typewriters, a fish tank and chess sets. There are shelves devoted to literature, beat poetry, philosophy, religion, poetry, war, fiction and biographies.
On the fenced patio between the shop and house where he and his son live, there are tables and chairs where visitors can order a cappuccino and watch movies or attend readings, concertsand writing workshops. Another wall of the is decorated with a large colorful mural by local skater-artist Kris Markovich.
The hidden-gem quality of Lhooq Books -- which Christopher named after "L.H.O.O.Q.," a tongue-in-cheek 1919 artwork by Marcel Duchamp -- has made it a darling with travel writers and bloggers. It's been written up in the New York Times, the Hidden San Diego website and in a local arts crawl guide.
The Gofundme campaign that Christopher launched in September has raised about $5,700, which he used to pay his attorney and help cover expenses at the shop while he explores options.
He's in talks with friends and supporters about possibly hosting fundraisers or an auction to underwrite the relocation.
If nothing else, Christopher said he has time to gradually sell his inventory to raise enough money to begin the next chapter of his life.
That future includes his new wife, an artist in Eastern Europe whom he married in December. He spent the last few weeks in her hometown doing interviews and paperwork for her immigration, which should happen in the next four to six months.
Because he wants to make his growing family a priority, Christopher said he can no longer afford to live a hand-to-mouth existence and needs a better work-life balance. So he's hoping to seek out grants, donations and underwriters willing to commit to saving Lhooq Books and supporting a paid staff.
"I think it is a very serious and important cause. We need a place that nurtures the kind of art and culture we supported," Christopher said. Places such as Lhooq Books are where the true artists discover themselves and eventually get discovered, he added.

Beware the federal “Grinch” during the season of giving

Texto completo: It’s officially the holiday shopping season. But be wary. Your Grinch neighbor, the IRS, is sitting high on the mountain, waiting to pounce. When money or items of value change hands, the IRS often wants a share, and believe it or not, it includes gift-giving.
The basic rules
A recipient of a gift does not pay income taxes on the gift. But the donor may pay gift or estate taxes. These taxes work together but are two different taxes, separate and apart from income taxes. A gift tax applies to gifts made during your lifetime, paid by the donor and not the recipient.
Estate tax applies to transfers at your death, paid by the decedent’s estate, not the recipient. There is one tax exemption for both these taxes. Currently, the exemption is $11.4 million, so you can give that amount away during your life or at your death, or some combination thereof, without gift or estate taxes.
Additionally, anyone can give another person a gift of up to $15,000 a year. That means spouses can together gift $30,000 per year. After that, the gift is subject to gift tax and you’ll need to use part of your exemption.
How it works
If you gift, for example, $25,000 to your adult child, $10,000 is a potentially taxable gift. You would need to file a gift tax return and claim a portion of your lifetime exemption, leaving you with $11,390,000 still to gift during your lifetime or at your death without taxes. An amount beyond that is taxed at 40%, and you or your estate pays that tax, not the recipient.
You may think that with an exemption that high you have nothing to worry about. — gift away! (Please add me to your list.) But beware that the exemption amount is scheduled to drop to about $5.4 million after 2025. Expect to see a lot of serious gifting by the wealthy in 2025 to use up the larger exemption that will disappear the following year.
What could go wrong?
There can be a lot of reasons to gift during your lifetime: your kid needs the money, you need to drop an asset from your estate, you’re downsizing and would like to see your child and grandchildren live in the family home. But beware that besides the potential for a gift tax, there’s an income tax issue, too.
Unlike property inherited due to death, gifted property keeps the same tax basis the donor had. Say you have stock you paid $25,000 for that is now worth $50,000. If the stock is given to your heirs, it would have an income tax basis of $50,000. If they sold the stock, they’d have no taxable gain. If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

Texto completo: Navy Secretary Richard Spencer is weighing whether to quit over President Trump’s interference in the case of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of murdering an injured Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017.
During an Air Force One flight to Dover Air Force Base on Thursday, military leaders pleaded with Trump to stop intervening in the case in an effort to keep Spencer from resigning, according to NBC News.
Gallagher was acquitted by a military court, but he was found guilty of posing with the dead fighter’s body.
Trump, who restored Gallagher’s rank last week, condemned a board review into whether Gallagher should remain in the elite SEAL corps.
“The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!” the president tweeted Thursday.
Spencer told the White House that Trump’s tweet was not an official order and he would need to put it in writing. Four officials said Spencer was strongly considering resigning if Trump follows through with a written order to end the investigation.
Rear Adm. Collin Green, who leads the SEALs, also threatened to quit over Trump’s interference, according to the New York Times.
Gallagher, 40, was charged in 2018 for war crimes while he was deployed the previous year in Iraq. As a result of his conviction for posing with a dead ISIS fighter, his rank was reduced from chief petty officer to petty officer.
Trump has intervened in the case several times while Navy leaders sought disciplinary action against Gallagher.

Could Philippine troll armies hit US? Officials pay to null conflict and boost government online

Texto completo: MANILA, Philippines - As public anger mounted last year over delayed plans to shake up the Philippines' outage-plagued telecommunications sector, angry comments and one-star ratings flooded a government-run Facebook page.
When employees suspected online trolls, President Rodrigo Duterte's digital mastermind offered a solution.
"I'll handle this," said Nic Gabunada, the architect of the social media strategy that powered Duterte's 2016 election victory, according to a government employee who managed the Facebook page.
Pro-Duterte comments soon poured onto the page, with users defending the president's handling of the situation or blaming the problems on the previous administration. Many of the new commenters had only basic profile information on their pages, which featured mostly generic posts with religious or pro-government messages.
"It was Nic," said the employee, who was interviewed on the condition her name not be used for fear of retribution. "The fact that he had a troll army was known by everyone, but not openly talked about."
In the Philippines, candidates and government officials routinely pay vast cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to smear opponents and prop themselves up.
It's all part of the online propaganda wars shaking politics in the country.
And it could soon be coming to the U.S., according to election officials and disinformation scholars who are watching closely. They warn that the Philippine epidemic probably will spread here, given Filipinos' proficiency in English, facility with social media and the lure of money from campaigns looking for a new way to get an edge over the competition.
Already, U.S. operatives in both parties have made early efforts at using trolls for political gain. Rogue progressives stealthily launched fake social media campaigns against Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, during a 2017 special election. Their campaign aimed to confuse voters into thinking Moore supported banning alcohol and that Russian bots were working on his behalf.
The New York Times revealed the plot, along with an earlier, aborted plan developed by a firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents to engage dozens of paid trolls in swaying delegates to Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP convention. The plan was requested by a senior Trump campaign official but was not carried out.
"The presence of a large for-hire market looking at all the disinformation online that you can buy and people are selling is quite disturbing," Camille Francois, the chief innovation officer of Graphika, a firm that helps tech companies and government investigators find and confront online disinformation, said at a Federal Election Commission symposium in September.
"What these troll farms are reporting is a growth of global business. What do we do about that?"
Manila, alone, has hundreds of active troll farms. The shadowy networks act as weapons that, for the right price, can build artificial buzz around a product, a celebrity - or a political figure.
Those troll techniques "will be used more and more," said Malou N. Tiquia, chief executive of the Manila political strategy consultancy Publicus Asia. "When Facebook said it won't ban political ads, that was already a signal to everyone that anything goes."
U.S. regulators have barely begun to consider the mounting threat, and Silicon Valley has shown itself lacking the tools and will to effectively confront it. Tech firms are making little headway stamping out the scourge where it has emerged so far, even after Facebook in March removed from its platform 200 pages for "inauthentic" activity and took the rare step of identifying Gabunada's network as the culprit.
The Filipino digital propagandist has denied trafficking in misinformation and did not respond to texts seeking comment about his work for the Duterte administration.
Such moves by Facebook are doing little to slow the trolls.
Filipinos spend so much time online - they average a staggering 10 hours a day, according to industry data - and disinformation has spiraled so quickly that Katie Harbath, Facebook public policy director for global elections, branded it "patient zero in the global disinformation epidemic" during a 2018 talk in Berlin.
"The propaganda looks really organic and it often doesn't trip any of the flags" that alert tech companies, said Jonathan Ong, a professor of global digital media at University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research has taken him inside Filipino troll farms.
Political campaigns contract out their digital efforts to consultants, who in turn pay up to $1,000 per month to college students and recent graduates who are charged with launching multiple fake Facebook pages designed to look like they were created by actual voters or grassroots groups.
"It is so easy to be enlisted in these jobs," Ong said. His recent study on the industry includes an interview with one paid troll who fell into the work when the chief of staff of the political campaign she was working on ordered everyone to start creating fake accounts and posting on them.
Others have fleeting loyalties politically but are attracted to the cash. Consultants running troll farms have been known to switch sides in the middle of an election.
"The alliances are very shifty," Ong said. "Strategists will switch in the middle of a campaign to join who they think will be the winner. They will betray their client. It happened in the last election."
Most often, the operations are run through contractors separate from the actual campaigns so the candidate has no fingerprints on the weapon. And the trolls often don't trigger attention from tech platforms because they know how to avoid detection. The algorithms that tech companies use to detect phony accounts tend to focus on dozens of commenters posting the same message around the same time, or users with a stock photo on their profile page. The trolls don't do these things.
"You can look like legitimate Facebook users to trick the (company's) artificial intelligence," said Ross Tapsell, a researcher at Australian National University who documented the surge of paid troll activity in the Philippine province of Cebu.
In some cases operatives contract the work out to troll farms in far-off places, including Saudi Arabia.
"We have only scratched the surface of what a lot of this involved," he said.

POINT PARK CANCELS FALL MUSICAL STUDENTS CONCERNED WITH ITS RACIST CONTENT

Texto completo: Student concerns over racist content in Point Park University's fall show have led to the cancellation of "Adding Machine: A Musical."
On Thursday, Steven Breese, artistic director of the university's Pittsburgh Playhouse and dean of the Conservatory of Performing Arts, convened a town hall in the Playhouse's Highmark Theater, where "Adding Machine" was to have opened Dec. 5. More than 200 students, faculty and staff aired concerns for nearly three hours.
"While it might be unusual and maybe even unprecedented, given the circumstances and the dialogue we had, it was absolutely the right thing to do," Mr. Breese said.
The provocative, expressionist musical was chosen for the current season by Mr. Breese's predecessor of 18 years, Ron Allan-Lindblom. Mr. Breese took the job in July.
Based on the 1923 play by Elmer Rice, "Adding Machine" debuted in 2008 to a rave New York Times review, which called it an "impossibly bleak, improbably brilliant little musical."
The show's protagonist is a racist who commits murder after being replaced by technology. In one particularly harrowing scene, as described in an essay by Chicago actor Bear Bellinger, "Inhabitants hurl epithets around the stage in a stylized musical sequence that is an apparent send-up of American White nationalism in an age of discrimination. But, when you add minority bodies to that mix, the message becomes muddled."
Mr. Breese was familiar with the play but not the musical when he arrived at Point Park. He understood the intent is to show "how easily discrimination and hatred become woven in the fabric of society."
Jordyn Hronec, covering the Thursday gathering as editor-elect of the Point Park Globe, quoted student actors who felt their concerns about the show's racist content were not being addressed. She wrote that the director of the COPA production, Tlaloc Rivas, who attended the meeting, had previously "described what he referred to as an "Action Plan for Traumatic Content' - something that students at the meeting claimed had not been effective enough."
Students did not hold back at the meeting. "It was not clear enough that the show was 'mocking' the characters expressing racist sentiments. Students were also concerned about the lack of trigger warnings given to students during the audition process, as well as on marketing materials," Ms. Hronec reported.
"I think there is difficult language in the show that is the trigger for emotional responses," Mr. Breese said Friday. "But also, and importantly, the play does hold a mirror up to society, and it's an ugly reflection. But there is this hate speech that we are supposed to react strongly to, yet there isn't a sense of getting their punishment or comeuppance for it. That's intentional in the playwright's mind but not easy for everyone to reconcile."
American musicals have dealt with racism, often by exposing it with disturbing images and language. "Show Boat," which debuted in 1927, includes a light-skinned black woman passing as white, who is discovered and ostracized. The song "Ol' Man River" from it was introduced with the N-word included - a lyric that has been modified through time, including by its original singer, Paul Robeson.
There have long been arguments for and against showing theatrical works in their original forms, as reflected by the times in which they were created and those in which we live today. "Thoroughly Modern Millie" is one example of a show that was rewritten to erase the racist stereotypes that featured white actors playing Asian characters.
In 2015, Clarion University canceled its production of "Jesus in India" after playwright Lloyd Suh voiced concerns over white actors being cast in roles written for actors of South Asian descent.
Canceling a university show, with actors already cast and rehearsal well underway, is not an easy decision, but "it was the right one," Mr. Breese said. The conservatory dean added that accommodations would be made for seniors or for any student who had worked on this production as a requirement.
Holding town hall meetings is something Mr. Breese has done in previous university positions and intends to do twice a semester. In this particular case, he praised the students' courage and passion in speaking up.
"It was an opportunity to have this dialogue and for students to express what was on their minds," he said. "Clearly when we got into the room, and there were 200 people, it indicated there was more conversation than any of us recognized. From that perspective, I'm delighted we did this."
Upcoming productions for the 2019-20 conservatory season are "The Wolves," a play about a girls soccer team that was a finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for drama; the Tony-winning musical "Parade," a historical account of the lynching of a wrongly accused Jewish man in the South, directed by Tony- and Emmy-winning director Rob Ashford, a Point Park alum; and the world premiere of the new rock musical "Pump Up the Volume."

Texto completo: U.S. lawmakers are asking Airbnb Inc. to provide information about hosts that list short-term rentals on the site who don't comply with local laws and violate the company's own policies.
In a letter to Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky, six members of Congress said they are particularly interested in recent media reports that have highlighted the proliferation of limited liability corporations on the home-sharing platform. For example, the lawmakers cited an article in the New York Times that reported that listings by one operation, out of compliance with company policy, were able to generate revenue of almost $21 million in three years.
Deceptive and misleading listings have also led to customers being scammed by "hosts" who abuse Airbnb's cancellation policies, according to the letter, which was signed by Democratic Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Barbara Lee of California and Robin Kelly of Illinois, among others.

"While we appreciate that you have frequently stated that Airbnb has a 'zero tolerance' policy with respect to these types of host behaviors, it also seems clear that you have failed to authenticate host identities in a way that would prevent bad actors from continuing to rent through your platform under false identities after being banned," the letter stated.
The lawmakers said they hoped Chesky would meet with them within the next two weeks to answer a list of questions, including how Airbnb vets hosts and how it will check the veracity of photos on rental listings.
Airbnb announced significant safety measures this month after a deadly shooting at a house in California. The changes include a 24/7 neighbor hotline, 100% verification of all the listings on the site and a full-refund policy for guests. The San Francisco company is preparing for a public stock market listing next year and is trying to resolve regulatory issues with cities across the U.S.

Texto completo: John R. Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, said he was breaking his silence -- on Twitter. But what he meant was that he was taking back control of his Twitter account. He kept quiet on Ukraine and impeachment.
WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Washington has waited to hear what he had to say. So when John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, popped back up on Twitter on Friday morning with a teasing message, it sent the town, well, all atwitter.
"Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months," Mr. Bolton wrote. "For the backstory, stay tuned........"
Was he finally going to describe his internal opposition to President Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine for damaging information about his Democratic rivals? Would he confirm that he called the whole thing a metaphorical "drug deal" and considered Rudolph W. Giuliani a "hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up"?
Sorry, no go. Over the course of the day, Mr. Bolton posted a few more messages -- not about the Ukraine matter that has propelled his former boss to the edge of impeachment but about his own two-month battle to "liberate" his Twitter account, as he put it, from a White House that refused to give it back when he resigned in September in a flurry of acrimony.
Anyone who knows Mr. Bolton should never have thought he would actually spill on Twitter. A Yale-trained lawyer, he has made clear he is waiting for a court to tell him whether he has to testify, relying on a lawsuit filed by a deputy that will be argued on Dec. 10. While former colleagues have issued public statements, Mr. Bolton's legal team believes making any public comments could be interpreted as waiving any claim of immunity -- he could hardly claim confidentiality with Congress and then tell all on Twitter.
But Washington got excited all the same. And Mr. Bolton seemed to enjoy the tease. He issued a handful of additional tweets, spaced out with hours in between, building up interest. Along the way, he attracted tens of thousands of new followers, topping 800,000 by the end of the business day.
"We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor," he wrote. "More to come....."
Three hours later, he added: "Re: speaking up -- since resigning as National Security Advisor, the @WhiteHouse refused to return access to my personal Twitter account. Out of fear of what I may say? To those who speculated I went into hiding, I'm sorry to disappoint!"
Two and a half hours after that, he continued: "In full disclosure, the @WhiteHouse never returned access to my Twitter account. Thank you to @twitter for standing by their community standards and rightfully returning control of my account."
Mr. Bolton, it turned out, had turned over control of his personal Twitter account to the White House when he joined the National Security Council last year. An avid Twitter user since 2010, Mr. Bolton brought a strong following to the new job and wanted it back when he left. In fact, he used the account moments after leaving the White House in September to accuse the president of not telling the truth about his departure.
After Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Sept. 10 that he had fired him, Mr. Bolton tweeted 12 minutes later that that was not true. "I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow,"' Mr. Bolton wrote, without elaborating.
That was his last tweet until Friday. Shortly afterward, he discovered that he no longer had control of the account. The White House had evidently changed his password and his verifying email address.
"The White House attached software to the account," Mr. Bolton said by telephone on Friday. "They would not give it back. A representative of mine spoke with John Eisenberg, who said he would get it released, and it never happened. So finally we went to Twitter."
Mr. Eisenberg is the top National Security Council lawyer and himself a player in the Ukraine drama. It was not clear what kind of software Mr. Bolton was referring to, but it appeared related to government efforts to archive messages in keeping with presidential records law.
Mr. Trump denied freezing Mr. Bolton's account. "No, of course not. Of course not," he said when asked on Friday on "Fox and Friends." "No, I actually had a good relationship with John. We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship."
No one from the White House or the National Security Council would say on the record whether anyone else in the building refused to surrender control of Mr. Bolton's account or why. But an administration official who insisted on anonymity denied that the White House blocked him from gaining access to his account and said it would not know how to do that.

Texto completo: The president was wrong or misleading or exaggerated about topics related to impeachment, Ukraine and the Democrats, among other inaccuracies.
In a freewheeling 53-minute interview on Friday morning on Fox News, President Trump rattled off exaggerations, falsehoods and debunked conspiracy theories, often related to the impeachment inquiry. Many of them have previously been fact-checked by The New York Times and found false, including his claim that Ukraine, rather than Russia, was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016; his accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped him; and his characterization of the whistle-blower's report as baseless. Here's a check of some of his newer assertions.
"He made up a phone call, and then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed."
False. Mr. Trump was referring to statements Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, made about the president's July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. But Mr. Trump's timeline is scrambled.
A day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, the White House released the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky.
The following day, Mr. Schiff opened a congressional hearing with a characterization of the transcript. He did not claim to be reciting from the White House transcript, but said he was conferring "the essence" of the conversation, "shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words."
So Mr. Schiff's account of the call came after Mr. Trump released the reconstructed transcript, not before, and while Mr. Schiff took some liberties in the way he recounted the July 25 call, his characterization generally stuck to the actual substance of the conversation.
Mr. Trump has at other times acknowledged that Mr. Schiff's account of the call came after the release of the transcript. At a campaign rally in October, he said Mr. Schiff "had to make up a fake conversation" because the transcript of the actual call was "so good."
"I know Ukrainian people. They're great people. But it's known as being the third most corrupt country in the world."
This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has often claimed that he withheld military aid to Ukraine because he was concerned about corruption. The statistic he offered to prove this point, however, is not quite accurate.
Transparency International ranked Ukraine at No. 120 out of 180 countries in its 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index, which is based on 13 global data sources on development. Ukraine also ranked at No. 120 in 2017, but its score improved by two points. (The three most corrupt countries in 2018 were Somalia, Syria and South Sudan. Seven countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia had lower rankings than Ukraine.)
Mr. Trump's insistence that he was focused on corruption also lacks support. For one, he did not raise those concerns during his July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky or in an April 21 call. The Pentagon had also certified in May that Ukraine had "taken substantive actions" to root out corruption. The military aid to Ukraine was withheld in July and released on Sept. 11, but neither Mr. Trump nor his aides have specified what corruption improvements had been made in Kyiv in those two months.
"How about the guy with the telephone? How about that one? I guarantee you that never took place."
This is disputed. David Holmes, the political counselor at the United States Embassy in Ukraine, testified on Thursday that he had overheard a cellphone call between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in July. During the call, Mr. Holmes said, Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Sondland about Ukrainian investigations into his political rivals. Mr. Holmes testified that he provided an account of the call to his boss immediately afterward and also informed other colleagues at the embassy in Kyiv.
Though Mr. Trump insisted Mr. Holmes's account was wrong, Mr. Sondland said Wednesday in congressional testimony that he had "no reason" to doubt it, though he could not recall precise details of their conversation.
"It's true that the president speaks loudly at times, and it's also true -- I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky," Mr. Sondland said, referring to the American rapper who was charged with assault in Sweden around that time.
"Actually, actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president's concerns," he said, referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer. "However, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended."
"This was an Obama person. Wouldn't -- didn't want to hang my picture in the embassy."
This lacks evidence. The president was referring to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who served as the United States ambassador to Ukraine until he recalled her this spring. She had come under intense criticism from allies of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr., who helped spread accusations that Ms. Yovanovitch was insufficiently loyal to the president. She has become a witness in the impeachment inquiry.
Mr. Trump's remark about his portrait may have been drawn from an exchange between Representative Lee M. Zeldin, Republican of New York, and Mr. Holmes during closed congressional testimony last week.
Mr. Zeldin asked Mr. Holmes if it was true that there was no official portrait of Mr. Trump hanging inside the United States Embassy in Kyiv by August 2017. Mr. Holmes replied that he could not recall.
But the White House did not release the portraits of Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for distribution in federal facilities until Oct. 31, 2017. Lawyers for Ms. Yovanovitch disputed Mr. Trump's claim, according to the NBC reporter Geoff Bennett, and said the embassy in Kyiv hung his portrait, along with Mr. Pence's and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's, "as soon as they arrived."
Mr. Trump was also wrong to characterize Ms. Yovanovitch as an "Obama person." She has served as an ambassador under presidents of both parties. She was first appointed as an ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia by President George W. Bush and was sent to Ukraine by President Barack Obama.
"Nancy Pelosi's totally incompetent. She's lost, absolutely lost. She doesn't know what she's doing. She hasn't done anything. She can't get anything approved."
False. Mr. Trump has a point that the current divided Congress hasn't exactly been productive compared with years past, but he is wrong to say Speaker Nancy Pelosi has done nothing at all.
Congress has enacted 69 pieces of legislation into law since January, and about a dozen since the impeachment inquiry began, including a stopgap spending bill on Thursday. The House, for its part, passed or agreed to 568 bills or resolutions, more than 100 of which were acted upon since the impeachment inquiry began.
Ms. Pelosi, in a news conference on Thursday, highlighted a bipartisan resolution supporting pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong that passed both chambers but has not yet been signed by Mr. Trump. She also faulted Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, for failing to take up legislation passed by the House on background checks for gun purchases, anti-domestic violence, immigration and a host of other issues.
The White House and Republicans, for their part, have blamed Ms. Pelosi for holding up Mr. Trump's revised North American trade deal. Top Democrats said they have been making progress in negotiations with the White House, but no deal has yet been reached.
Here are some of the other inaccurate claims made by the president that The Times has previously fact-checked.

- He repeated his unfounded accusation that Mr. Obama had carried out "the modern-day version of whatever wiretapping may be" on his campaign. (No evidence has emerged since Mr. Trump first suggested it in 2017.)
-
He repeated the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had hacked the Democratic National Committee's computer server in 2016. (The theory has been debunked by a number of Trump officials in the hearings.)
- He claimed the F.B.I. "has never gotten the server." (They received forensics.)
-
He exaggerated when he said that European nations are not contributing aid to Ukraine. (They do contribute.)
- He hyperbolically described the aid sent by the Obama administration to Ukraine as "pillows and sheets." (Mr. Obama did not send lethal assistance but did send other defense equipment.)
-
He claimed to "hardly know" Mr. Sondland. (He complimented Mr. Sondland last month, and Mr. Sondland said they had spoken around 20 times.)
- He falsely claimed to have signed the largest tax cut in American history. (The 2017 tax cuts rank below at least a half-dozen others.)
-
He omitted the context in which Mr. Zelensky "brought up" and then criticized Ms. Yovanovitch on their July 25 phone conversation. (This happened only after Mr. Trump mentioned the ambassador.)
- He falsely claimed that the whistle-blower complaint "bore no relationship to my call." (It was quite accurate.)
-
He wrongly took credit for the Veterans Choice Act. (It was signed into law in 2014.)
- He falsely claimed China is currently paying the United States "hundreds of billions in tariffs," whereas before "we never took 10 cents." (The amount is $ 37.6 billion as of Wednesday, and tariffs on Chinese products have been previously imposed.)
-
He falsely claimed that China had its "worst year in 57 years." (The Chinese economy experienced its slowest growth rate in 27 years.)
- He falsely claimed that he "opened" a factory that makes Apple computers on Wednesday. (It's been operating since 2013.)

Texto completo: Also this week, guarding Arctic researchers from polar bears
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. And, to keep up on climate news the rest of the week, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter .
Sometimes, Thanksgiving dinner comes with a side dish of climate denial.
Whether it's grumbling about "the climate hoax" from your parents, a sibling or that cousin you rarely see, it's time to get ready in case climate myths come up at the dinner table. Here are 10 resources to refresh your understanding of our warming planet.
Websites and Fact Sheets
Skeptical Science -- This stalwart's "Arguments" page lists 197 common myths about climate change ("It's the sun") alongside what the science actually says ("In the last 35 years of global warming, sun and climate have been going in opposite directions"). It's all backed by abundant research.
Climate Change: How Do We Know? -- With a multitude of visuals, and using language that you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand, NASA dissects the evidence, causes and effects of climate change. You might want to bookmark the FAQ page.
The 12 Questions Every Climate Activist Hears and What to Say -- This PDF from The Climate Reality Project will arm you with evidence-based answers to the "most common arguments against man-made climate change."
Podcasts
The Origin of Climate Denial -- It's important to remember that climate change wasn't always questioned. This engaging episode of WNYC's "The United States of Anxiety" explores how we went from broad climate consensus to having a persistent denial movement.
Today I Learned: Climate -- You can't really argue with MIT scientists. Well, you can, but you'll probably lose. These nine bite-size podcasts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology interview professors on topics like clouds, carbon pricing and geoengineering.
The climate crisis is an oceans crisis -- On a recent episode of his podcast, Ezra Klein, a co-founder of Vox, had a smart discussion with Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, about the water that covers more than 70 percent of the planet and the hundreds of millions of people who depend directly upon it.
Videos
Why Climate Change Is Anti-Justice -- Talia Buford, a ProPublica reporter, offers an introduction to the subject of environmental justice on the PBS show "Hot Mess." Also worth a click: this video from its sister show "It's Okay to Be Smart" explaining where that "97 percent of climate scientists agree" statistic originated, and this video divvying climate science into 24 parts.
13 Misconceptions About Global Warming: Got six minutes? Then watch Derek Muller, host of the YouTube channel Veritasium and holder of a doctorate in physics education research, offer humorous rebuttals to more than a dozen common climate myths.
Short Books
The Madhouse Effect: In just 208 pages, the climatologist Michael E. Mann and the cartoonist Tom Toles dismantle climate change denial with the help of witty writing and cartoons.
What Is Climate Change? This 112-pager from Gail Herman, which made Yale Climate Connections' list of recommended books for children, will allow you to learn the science of climate change alongside your kids.
There you have it. You've got about a week before Thanksgiving, so study up.
As Jamie Margolin, the 17-year-old co-founder of Zero Hour, a youth-led environmental justice group, said: "It's the one-on-one conversations that are slowly but surely going to change the political climate on, well, the climate."

Scientists visit the Arctic. Local residents are curious.
Esther Horvath is a documentary photographer aboard the icebreaker Polarstern, which is frozen into the ice in the Central Arctic on a yearlong science expedition to better understand the region's changing climate. In preparing for the expedition, Ms. Horvath trained as a guard to protect researchers from polar bears.
My first shift as an armed polar bear lookout was on Oct. 12, before the permanent winter darkness set in. I was assigned to "Met City," a science station about 2,000 feet from the ship with equipment for making atmospheric measurements. There were 12 of us at the station that day.
After about 90 minutes, I and the guards at the other science stations received an order from the bridge to bring everyone back to the ship immediately. A polar bear and her cub had been spotted. (They had been seen in previous days, but not when people were on the ice.)
Polar bears, by the way, are the largest land carnivores on the planet. And they're not just big, they're surprisingly fast. They can run about 20 miles per hour and maintain that pace for a mile.
The bridge gave us the position and distance of the bears -- about 2,500 feet from the stern and moving toward us. We had two snowmobiles and two sleds, and made a quick return. All the other groups returned safely, too. I had to stay on the ice with the other guards until all the researchers had scrambled back aboard.
This was the expedition's first ice floe evacuation because of a polar bear visit.
On my second shift there was another evacuation, and in some ways it was even more stressful.
By then, we were living in the 24-hour darkness of polar winter. I was close to the Polarstern at another research station, the one we call Ocean City, where oceanographic measurements are made through holes cut in the ice.
Guarding Ocean City made me uneasy because the researchers were all inside a tent and I was standing alone outside on a top of a small ridge. I would rather have been closer to the scientists.
That day, conditions were different. It was very windy and minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit, or about minus 26 Celsius. Blowing snow, combined with light coming from the ship, made it difficult to keep a lookout for bears.
But, at least we had the wire. Not long after my first shift on the ice, a perimeter trip wire had been installed some distance from the ship. The idea was that any wandering bear would hit the wire, giving us early warning of a visit.
The wire made me feel more secure but I still had a strange feeling, standing alone in the darkness with only the lights from the ship to help me see.
Then, an alarm went off not far away. The wire had been tripped.
I radioed the bridge and told the scientists in the tent that they had to stop working and get back to the ship. My heart was pumping fast from a rush of adrenaline, but we made it back without incident.
A short time later some other guards went out to check the wire. It turned out that a gust of wind had tripped the alarm; there were no signs of a bear.
After these two experiences, I've served my polar bear duties on the bridge, keeping watch from there. It's a lot less stressful.

From the mailbag
One reader had some criticism for the One Thing column this week: "These ideas, while nice, are almost completely pointless in the face of climate inaction at the regulatory level."
It's true: Those smaller actions, by themselves, aren't nearly enough to solve climate change. But recent research shows they're far from pointless. In fact, they appear to be directly linked to systemic change.
It made us think we should remind everybody about an item we published in June: Don't Do Just One Thing.
"It can't just be one thing," said Patrik Sorqvist, research director of environmental psychology at the University of Gavle in Sweden, in the item from the summer. "It needs to be one thing and a complete transformation."
Thanks for reading and see you next week.

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
Apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 report for New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"You already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents’ blood, your children’s blood, your lover’s blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water. "
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a ‘‘probable link’’ between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, preeclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
“I was just floored," says Ruffalo. "It’s like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it. "
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters" (in select theaters Friday before expanding Nov. 29 and showing nationwide Dec. 6), which he produced.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
"He saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo says of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That’s how he handled everything, and it’s that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that’s just not the nature of Rob and that’s not the nature of the story. "
Tim Robbins co-stars as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP, who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
“That’s what spoke to me," says Robbins. "The man whose law firm represents chemical companies (takes) on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right?"
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670. 7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins says, serve as guides for future change.
"It’s not like they’re your liberal reformers or anything, it’s people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," he says. "And quite frankly, it’s going to be up to people like Tom Terp to realize that morality in themselves and take risks and perhaps compromise their position of power or their livelihood to do the right thing. ”
Director Todd Haynes' film is firmly in the whistleblower cinema tradition that includes "All The President's Men" (1976), "The Post" (2017) and "Erin Brockovich" (2000).
But it also has plenty in common with Ruffalo's "Spotlight" (2015), which won best picture and earned Ruffalo a best supporting actor nomination. Both films are non-sensationalist, methodical examination of all of the work – legal in the case of "Dark Waters," journalistic in "Spotlight" – that goes into uncovering the truth.
"Dark Waters," with its exposure of DuPont practices, also serves as an inadvertent companion piece to "Foxcatcher. " That 2014 film starred Ruffalo as Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, who was murdered in 1996 by chemical empire heir John du Pont.
Taken together, "Dark Waters" and "Foxcatcher" chillingly speak to the free reign our society has afforded powerful corporations and families.
“It is a corporate elite in America that basically because of economic reasons are given free hand to pollute, to dominate, to run amok," Ruffalo says. "Whether it’s John du Pont and his delusions of grandeur that came from a lifetime of privilege and money or it’s DuPont as a corporate entity who was a driving economic factor in American business.
"If all we value is the GDP of a country as a value of its health or well-being, then you’re going to have a lot more stories like the PFOA story and a lot more companies like DuPont who knowingly and willingly poisoned the world for pure profit and the almighty dollar. ”

Texto completo: Big tech companies such as Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Google have benefited from enabling users to easily share pictures or videos, but they are now working to stem the spread of maliciously doctored content ahead of next year's presidential election.
So-called deepfakes are images or videos that have been manipulated through the use of sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to make it almost impossible to differentiate between what is real and what isn't. While the technology has benign applications—Walt Disney Co. has used algorithms to insert characters in some of its "Star Wars" movies—it can be used to create nefarious content.
The tools to concoct fake images are improving so rapidly that soon it will be very hard to detect deepfakes with technology, said Dana Rao, executive vice president and general counsel for Adobe Inc., which is best known for its Photoshop image-editing software. The fight will be "an arms race," he said.
The number of deepfakes online nearly doubled from December to August, to 14,678, according to a study by cybersecurity startup Deeptrace. The rise has prompted action by tech giants.
Alphabet Inc.'s Google on Wednesday, in an update to its political advertisement policy , said it would prohibit the use of deepfakes in political and other ads.
Twitter earlier this month said it was considering identifying manipulated photos, videos and audio shared on its platform. "The risk is that these types of synthetic media and disinformation undermine the public trust and erode our ability to have productive conversations about critical issues," said Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity.
Facebook, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. are working with more than a half-dozen universities to run a Deepfake Detection Challenge starting next month. It is intended to accelerate research into new ways of detecting and preventing media manipulated to mislead others, Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer wrote in a September blog post.
Interest in making deepfakes is growing fast, according to Deeptrace. Two years ago the first deepfakes appeared on Reddit, the popular chat forum. Now, at least 20 websites and online forums are devoted to discussions about how to better produce them.
Deeptrace found online services that can generate and sell custom deepfakes in as little as two days and for a cost as low as $2.99 a video, the researchers said.
"It doesn't take a lot of skill," said Matt Turek, a program manager overseeing deepfake-related research and development efforts at the Pentagon's technology incubator, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The Pentagon is studying deepfakes out of concern that military planners could be fooled into making bad decisions if altered images aren't detected.

Darpa has developed a prototype media forensics tool for use by government agencies to detect altered photos and video. It wants to develop additional technology to detect synthetic audio and fake text and identify the source and intent of any manipulated content.
How companies deal with deepfakes is another point of conflict between tech companies and Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) denounced Facebook earlier this year for its refusal to take down a doctored video of her. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, following the incident, said the company was reviewing its policy on deepfakes.
Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas has co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D., Nev.) to boost research to identify such content manipulation. On Wednesday, Mr. Moran called deepfakes "a specific threat to U.S. voters and consumers by way of misinformation that is increasingly difficult to identify."
Several startups have emerged to work on image verification, and now big tech companies, which have been criticized for not doing more to prevent disinformation, are getting more involved in the fight.
For example, Facebook has amassed more than 100,000 videos featuring actors that researchers can use to help develop and test systems to spot deepfakes. Facebook said its users' data isn't part of the research.
Google has similarly built up a catalog to hone deepfake-detection research. This year the company assembled a trove of audio clips to help researchers develop ways to identify fake speech that can be spliced into a video. Google also is drawing on its development of text-to-speech conversion tools to devise new ones that can help authenticate a speaker.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What role should tech companies play in identifying altered media? Join the conversation below.
Adobe is taking a different approach. The company has developed a system that will allow authors and publishers to attach information to content, such as who created it and when and where. It is working with New York Times Co. and Twitter and will share the technology, which it envisions serving as industrywide system for authenticating content.
Adobe said it would offer the authentication tool on its Photoshop editing software starting in 2020. Adobe expects most legitimate authors and creators to opt into the feature, while bad actors wouldn't, Mr. Rao said.
Elsewhere, the nonprofit arm of the AI Foundation, an advocacy group for the safe use of artificial intelligence, has created a website to help election campaigns and journalists analyze photos and videos within minutes of receiving them. The portal, called Reality Defender 2020, uses complex algorithms to detect pixel changes and other anomalies—such as in a candidate's mannerisms, mouth movements, face wrinkles and shadows—to detect alterations. It has drawn on research from dozens of academics.
"There is no one silver bullet," said Rob Meadows, the AI Foundation's founder and chief technology officer.

Bloomberg was Chafee's fellow independent, Raimondo's 'political idol'

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE — Back in September 2010, then-New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stepped into Providence's Biltmore hotel and greeted two future Rhode Island governors.
“I've left two parties, you've only left one," Bloomberg said as he endorsed Lincoln D. Chafee, then a fellow independent who would go on to win that year's governor's race.
Now, Bloomberg, a Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent, has returned to the Democratic Party, and on Thursday he filed paperwork to formally create a presidential campaign committee — inching closer to running.
Chafee, meanwhile, has tried to keep up with Bloomberg's party-switching pace: The Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat joined the Libertarian Party earlier this year, and he, too, is toying with running for president.
But Chafee wasn't the only future governor at the Biltmore that day: Gina M. Raimondo, then the Democratic candidate for general treasurer, showed up to meet Bloomberg before a news conference.
“He's my political idol," she explained at the time. “He's not partisan, and he gets things done."
Raimondo, who succeeded Chafee as governor in 2015, is now chair of the Democratic Governors Association. And as former Vice President Joe Biden prepares to come to Providence for a fund-raiser on Sunday, Raimondo is facing questions about which of the many Democratic candidates she will back in the presidential primary.
When reminded of her 2010 comments about Bloomberg in a recent interview, Raimondo said, “I was young then. 'Idol' may be a stretch. But he does get things done."
Raimondo praised Bloomberg's accomplishments in business and government, saying, “He is a practical problem solver, and he could probably go toe-to-toe with Trump because Trump pretends that he is a successful businessman when, in fact, we know he is a fraud and a failure. I think Mike could really take it to him."
But Raimondo noted Bloomberg would be making a late entrance in the race. “It's a big gamble," she said. “But look, I like him, and I think he is enormously talented."
So would she support Bloomberg if he runs? “We will have to see," she said. “We will get there when we get there."
Raimondo, whose tenure as Democratic Governors Association chair concludes at the end of this year, said she does not know when she will endorse a candidate. But she said, “I might wade in before the convention."
The 2020 Democratic National Convention is set for July 13-16 in Milwaukee. “You can be sure I am going to do everything in my power," she said. “I will get behind our nominee."
Raimondo also praised a new entrant in the Democratic contest — former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. “I have enormous respect for Deval," she said. “I think he had a good record as a governor."
But she noted that Patrick, too, is getting in late. “It's very, very, very difficult at this stage," she said. “But he is a friend, and he has a great record to run on."
Raimondo acknowledged another friend, US Senator Cory Booker, is running. Booker and Raimondo's husband, Andy Moffit, were roommates at Yale Law School, and Raimondo graduated from Yale Law the year after Booker.
“I've known Cory for 26 years, and I adore him," she said. “Look, we have to win."
But what is the path to victory for Democrats?
On Monday, The New York Times quoted Raimondo in a story titled “How Moderates Are Seizing the Moment in the Democratic Primary."
“Clearly, factually, people who voted for Trump voted for our Democratic gubernatorial candidates," Raimondo is quoted as saying. She said Democrats could win those voters in 2020 with a “message of unity" and pragmatic promises on issues like health care and student debt.
In October, Raimondo went on “The Axe Files" podcast with former President Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod, and repeated a concern that some of US Senator Elizabeth Warren's views may not play well in a general election nationally.
“I worry about free this, free that, Medicare for all," Raimondo told Axelrod.
So does she believe Democrats need a moderate candidate to prevail?
“I am not running into people out and about talking about impeachment or who is too liberal or who is too moderate," Raimondo told the Globe. “It's like: Who can deliver for people around what really matters -- good jobs, affordable health care, and college debt. Getting stuff done. We will have to see who can do that."
Chafee, meanwhile, said Bloomberg was a good New York City mayor. “That is one of the hardest jobs in politics," he said. “He has energy and resources, so let the people in the Democratic primary decide."
But one potential obstacle is that Bloomberg is 77 years old. “Despite his energy and the fact his mom lived so long, the age factor is a tough one to overcome," the 66-year-old Chafee said.
Chafee said he is fascinated watching a fresh crop of Democratic candidates emerge. “There is a lot of unease out there," he said. “A lot of it has to do with the fervor of Democratic base to defeat Donald Trump."
Chafee said he has been following elections since 1960 and has never a second ballot for presidential nominees in either major party.
“But 2020 could be the year the Democrats have a second ballot -- or even a third, fourth, or fifth ballot," he said. “It's wide open."

Political Economics: Inside Beijing's Ministry for Taking Things Away

Texto completo: Last weekend's publication of leaked documents about Beijing's abuses of China's Uighur citizens was so shocking on its face that many subtle points may have been lost. One of the more important is the extent to which China's political economy has shifted from giving-things-out mode to taking-things-away mode.
To recap, the New York Times released a trove of secret Communist Party documents, 403 pages, related to the repression that continues in the far west region of Xinjiang. For several years Beijing, under President Xi Jinping, has been engaged in what can best be described as cultural genocide. As many as a million Uighurs (ethnic Turkic Muslims) are believed to be interned in camps; traditional cultural trappings such as abstention from alcohol or a beard can land one in such a prison.
The secret papers reveal how Beijing justifies this abuse to itself and also some practicalities related to the running of 21st-century concentration camps. Shocking details from the report included a script for police to explain to Uighur students returning from universities elsewhere in China why their families were in the camps (to cure them of the "virus" of radicalism) and threatening those students not to make a fuss (or else your parents will remain captive longer). The papers document secret speeches to party cadres in which Mr. Xi railed against the supposed terrorist threat from the Uighurs.
The documents also illustrate an important shift in the party's approach to its own legitimacy under Mr. Xi. Beijing has long fretted about separatism in Xinjiang. Before Mr. Xi, the main method for addressing this was to purchase affection -- a program of public-works investment and economic opportunities for the Uighurs, with which to buy their acquiescence to Communist rule.
No more. The leaked documents lay bare a purge of Communist Party officials responsible for implementing that policy in and around Xinjiang in recent years. The regime opened more than 12,000 investigations into Party members in Xinjiang in 2017 alone. Mr. Xi has disbanded the informal "Ministry for Handing Things Out," as one might think of the party apparatus previously oriented toward buying hearts and minds. In its place he has created a "Ministry for Taking Things Away" -- a hard-line cohort of officials newly determined to strip Uighurs of cultural identity, economic favors and even their freedom in order to beat them into submission.
This is part of a pattern Mr. Xi is repeating in many other parts of greater China.
In Hong Kong, gone is Beijing's old tolerance for political independence and the hope that the city's partial freedom and rising prosperity would divide and weaken opposition to Beijing's ultimate sovereignty. In its place Mr. Xi proposed an extradition law that would, quite literally, whisk obstreperous Hong Kongers away from their families. This week Beijing doubled down by trying to take away more of Hong Kong's constitutional autonomy with an assault on the independent judiciary.
Beijing wields its Ministry for Taking Things Away against Western companies, threatening to yank their products from the Chinese market. The National Basketball Association is supposed to kowtow to Beijing's demands that even little-known managers not criticize the regime because otherwise the Communist Party will not allow China's middle class to watch American basketball.
Germany is embroiled in a debate over whether to buy 5G wireless-network equipment from Huawei despite security concerns. The fear in some corners of Berlin seems to be that if Germany doesn't buy Huawei equipment, the Ministry for Taking Things Away won't allow Chinese consumers to buy German cars.
In both cases, Chinese citizens are targets as much as the Westerners. The message: We will subordinate your comfort to our power.
What could explain the shift?
One factor is a shortage of things to hand out. The most important economic story of our day is that the Chinese Communist Party has run out of reliable ways to stimulate its economy of 1.4 billion consumers. With the old Ministry for Handing Things Out perilously short of resources, some other means of political control has to be found.
The other is human nature. Good Communists like Mr. Xi are die-hard materialists who chronically fail to grasp any human motivation other than the crassly economic. Imagine his surprise watching young Hong Kongers protest out of a confusing mix of economic frustrations feeding into greater social and even spiritual aspirations that only freedom can satisfy. History could have warned him, as revolutions most often take root not in the poorest societies but in those where prior economic growth has failed to satisfy other civic yearnings.
The job of the Ministry for Taking Things Away is to crush that spirit through a combination of outright violence (Xinjiang and Hong Kong) or at a minimum demoralization (basketball and cars). Can this ministry succeed? That Mr. Xi must ask himself this is a sign of profound regime weakness, no matter how many jackboots his ministry sends into the streets.

Texto completo: Playhouses and troupes beyond Broadway generate $ 584 million in economic benefit. But dependence on volunteer labor is high.
Broadway has the bright lights. But the world of New York theater stretches far beyond Times Square.
A new study, commissioned by the mayor's office and released on Wednesday, finds that the city is home to 748 Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway theater organizations responsible for 3,000 jobs.
But there is also quite a bit of churn: The study reveals that more than 280 theater organizations were established in the city since 2011, while more than 100 closed.
The study was overseen by the office of media and entertainment, and conducted by the consulting firms BuroHappold Engineering and 3x3 Design.
It argues that small venue theaters -- the term it uses for the range of New York City theaters beyond Broadway -- have an outsize cultural influence, often nurturing risky work, and reaching a wider audience with more affordable tickets.
And it suggests a link between the nonprofit theater world and the growing production of streaming content in the city, noting that some of the same artists work in both areas.
The study calculates that theaters aside from Broadway are responsible for $ 584 million in direct annual economic output, and estimates $ 1.3 billion in "direct, indirect and induced benefits."
"Traditionally people have viewed this as a niche sector, but we found it's a significant contributor to the creative sector in New York City, and also a significant economic driver," said Anne del Castillo, the commissioner of the city agency.
And the study cites the success of recent shows such as "Hadestown" (first presented at New York Theater Workshop) and "The Band's Visit" (at Atlantic Theater Company), each of which eventually reached Broadway and won the Tony Award for best new musical, as well as "Hamilton" (at the Public Theater) and "Fairview" (at Soho Rep), each of which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. ("Hamilton" also won the Tony).
Del Castillo said she was hopeful that the study would help spur greater support for smaller theaters from donors as well as patrons and government officials.
Not surprisingly, the study identifies two related challenges facing Off and Off-Off Broadway companies: money and real estate. In a dry nod to persistent low salaries for rank-and-file theater workers, the report observes, "Employees are frequently faced with unstable compensation structures in comparison to other cultural sectors, such as television, film or other media."
Among the study's findings:

- Of the 748 small venue theater organizations identified by the city, 97 present work at a regular location, 51 are part of larger organizations, and 600 are production companies -- nomadic nonprofits.
-
Most of the nonprofit theater venues are in Manhattan (and below Central Park), with 30 percent in Midtown and 15 percent near the East Village and Lower East Side.
- Almost all of the theaters outside Broadway are nonprofits -- just 24 of the 748 are commercial. (This is the inverse of the economic landscape on Broadway, where 35 of the 41 theaters are operated as commercial ventures.)
-
The small theaters have a total of 51,779 seats on 226 stages, many of which have fewer than 99 seats.
- The industry depends on more than 9,000 nonsalaried volunteers. This is especially the case at small organizations: 92 percent of the labor at organizations with budgets under $ 100,000 is performed by volunteers.
-
Smaller theaters are particularly dependent on philanthropy and government grants; the larger the organization, the more they are generally able to raise from box office sales.

Texto completo: Jim Kay's favorite part of drawing is right before he makes a mark.
"The best moment is a blank sheet of paper," he said. "Every line is a slight degradation of that ideal."
Kay, the artist behind the illustrated editions of the Harry Potter series, works long days and often into the night in a free-standing studio in the garden of his home in Sussex, England.
His cluttered work space contains virtually every artist's tool imaginable, and some unlikely props: metal scrapers from a dentist's office, which he uses to add details to clay models; insect specimens; a model skeleton; and leaves, branches, seeds and feathers that he collects. He uses those motley materials to build three-dimensional models of winged dragons, elves, goblins and trolls, which he then sketches.
"The problem with fantasy books is these things don't normally exist, so you have to create them to give them a sense of reality," Kay said.
In October, Scholastic released Kay's latest illustrated volume, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." He gave us a tour of his studio and explained his elaborate process.
What appealed to you about this studio space and this spot?
We're surrounded on all sides by National Trust land. It's amazing for wildlife. We have badgers and owls at night and rabbits and foxes during the day, and a huge number of birds.
What objects do you keep in your studio for inspiration?
Hares are my good luck thing. In every book I've done, there's been a hare.
When I was a bit younger, my brother lived out in the countryside. It was a hot summer day and I was lying in a cornfield and a hare appeared. If you're ever face to face with a wild hare, it's quite a strange experience. They're quite freaky looking. Ever since that, I've been very fond of them.
I've always drawn crows. They're straight from Edgar Allan Poe and Gothic horror, and I love them. They're beautiful things.
I've got a lot of toys I've been collecting for many years since I was a kid. I've never grown up, that's the problem.
You also have quite a few insect specimens, which show up a lot in your illustrations.
When I was a little boy I used to keep insects under my bed in ice cream tubs. I used to catch butterflies and beetles. I had an entomologist uncle who used to send me insects in the post. It's never changed. I've always drawn from the natural world.
You seem to collect little bits of flotsam from nature, leaves and twigs and seeds. How do you use them in your work?
I collect loads of leaves. I'm working on an illustration at the moment that's predominantly green. On the floor I have all these different leaves and acorns from oak trees around the garden. Everything is starting to turn into really beautiful autumn colors. I'm trying to get more colorful. I think in black and white and I've got to go past that, so I surround myself with beautiful colors to make me push myself a bit harder. Otherwise everything I draw will look like a movie from the 1920s.
How do you make these abstract splatter images, and how do they factor into your work?
I make random marks or splatters with inks. Your own drawing becomes very predictable and formulaic, so it's nice to have something that has a bit of chance. It's nice to have visual images that I've not created myself. I'd lost confidence in drawing and so I thought if I randomly made marks and shapes, then it's not my hand that's doing it, it's just randomness. So I collect textures and mistakes and splatter spots. Sometimes if I'm working on a painting and there's a piece of paper next to it that I use to clean my brushes on, I'll often get rid of the painting but keep that piece of paper with the brush marks. I love the way you're not consciously thinking of making a mark, and you get these beautiful effects where the color bleeds or breaks up. It throws something random into the mix.
When you're drawing imaginary creatures that doesn't exist, how do you make them look real?
You're trying to get people to buy into an alternative world. The more you can seat it in apparent reality, the better it works.
On a more practical level, it's much easier to draw if you have something in front of you. If it doesn't exist, I make it. If there isn't something in the wild or it's not in a museum, I'll try to make it out of clay or plasticene. I'm not one of those illustrators who can pull stuff out of my head, I'm afraid. I'm not that good.
You seem to have a lot of 3-D art material in your studio, modeling clay and fabric and models. How do you use those materials in your illustrations?
I really struggle with drawing, still, so it's great to have something in front of you. Particularly for lighting, I struggle with how shadows are cast. It's a difficult thing to do, to understand how a solid object casts a shadow in a landscape. The main thing is to give it a more sculptural feel, because drawing can be very flat and two-dimensional. I have trouble with that, so I'm trying to get more depth and a more sculptural feel to the drawing.
The people who do the best drawings I think are sculptors. If you look at Henry Moore's drawings of elephant skulls and the London Underground, they've got such a sense of weight and gravity to them. They look solid, like they are occupying space, which is very difficult.
As the illustrator of the Harry Potter novels, you have a unique challenge, because the movies are so popular and most people already have an image of the characters in their heads. Was that an obstacle for you in developing your own version of the characters, and how did you overcome it?
It was very difficult because I'm very fond of the films. The only way to do it was to start from scratch. I built the landscape first, really physically built it with models, so I built a model landscape for Hogwarts. After that, I recast the film and I used people I know. For Ron, Ginny and Molly who are the Weasleys, I used a real mother, daughter and son as inspiration for the illustrations. By dint of the fact that I've got a real family, I buy into my version. I cast people I know who fit the character. My niece is a perfect Hermione. It took about two years, but now I think of my world and not the film one.
Which character is the hardest for you to draw?
Harry by miles, I find him so difficult. Children are difficult anyway, because if you put a line out of place on a child's face you age them by about five years. But Harry, also because he wears glasses and glasses are a nightmare to draw. I've literally smashed up and thrown stuff across the room in frustration trying to draw Harry. He's very hard. I think because I've got a very particular idea of him in my head that I've never been able to execute the way I want it. Even though I've got a boy who models Harry for me, I still can't get him right.
How would you say your style has evolved over the years?
I haven't found a style yet. I'm desperately trying to find a style. I'm a bit worried.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "How Not to Kill an Animal," by Margaret Renkl (Op-Ed, Nov. 19):
As we enter another season, among many, that includes among its rituals the sacrifice of an animal (or several), Ms. Renkl makes a brilliant point: Instead of debating whether we should kill animals, let's at least agree how not to do it.
While we prattle on about how much we have to be grateful for, some of us kill with cruelty for the sake of fashion, or simply out of habit.
I suggest that we put thankfulness aside this year and concentrate instead on respect. Respect for those creatures that have as much right to be here as we do, and respect for the fact that they can and do suffer, just as we do.

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate carried live on MSNBC Wednesday night drew 6.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen, which is the smallest audience so far in the race to determine who will take on President Trump in the 2020 election.
Sponsored by Comcast Corp.'s MSNBC and the Washington Post, the debate was the fifth among the Democratic contenders. It came after a long day of impeachment hearings that aired on cable news channels, which may have contributed to political fatigue for viewers.
MSNBC said its online broadcast of the debate notched more than 1.3 million live-streams.
The previous Democratic debate, which was carried by CNN and co-sponsored by the New York Times, averaged 8.5 million viewers.
The next Democratic debate is scheduled for Dec. 19 and will be carried by PBS and CNN.

Texto completo: Con las fronteras del país cerradas y las fuerzas militares en máxima alerta, Colombia vivió este jueves una masiva jornada de protestas convocadas por opositores del presidente Iván Duque y su gobierno.
Las centrales obreras y movimientos sindicales que llamaron a la protesta lo calificaron como “paro nacional” y se registraron protestas en Bogotá y otras grandes ciudades como Medellín, Cali y Barranquilla.
Las protestas comenzaron con marchas pacíficas, si bien se produjeron enfrentamientos entre las fuerzas del orden y los manifestantes en algunos puntos del país.
En la capital, donde la jornada terminó con un cacerolazo, durante el día se registraron fuertes disturbios tanto en el centro como en el noroeste, donde algunos manifestantes intentaron dirigirse al aeropuerto internacional El Dorado.
Otros disturbios se produjeron en Cali, donde el alcalde, Maurice Armitage, decretó el toque de queda en la ciudad a partir de las 7 de la noche de este jueves tras los actos vandálicos registrados en varios puntos de la ciudad.
Debido a los disturbios y hechos violentos ocurridos hoy en la ciudad, el alcalde @MauriceArmitage ha decretado toque de queda entre las 7:00 p.m. de hoy y las 6:00 a.m. de mañana. Las personas que estén por fuera en este lapso, serán detenidas por las autoridades. pic.twitter.com/v69iEvrltp
— Alcaldía de Cali (@AlcaldiaDeCali) November 21, 2019
El gobierno implementó de forma previa una serie de medidas para evitar los disturbios en el país, entre ellas el cierre desde primera hora de este miércoles y hasta las 5:00 de la mañana del viernes de los pasos fronterizos de Colombia con Venezuela, Brasil, Ecuador y Perú.
Además se ordenó el acuartelamiento en primer grado (máxima alerta) de las fuerzas militares.
No obstante, se sumaron otros colectivos así como más reivindicaciones que hacen que desde 1977 no se viviera en el país tanta tensión por un paro nacional.
Duque, por su parte, ya en horas de la noche, se refirió a los “actos de violencia atribuibles a vándalos que no representan el espíritu de quienes marcharon”.
“Los hechos sucedidos con posterioridad a la marcha son vandalismo puro y no obedecen a una expresión de la voluntad popular”, aseguró el presidente.
El mandatario también afirmó que habían sido detenidos “decenas de criminales” a los que van a “aplicarles todo el peso de la ley”.

Y sobre el fondo de la protesta, aseguró que el suyo es un gobierno “que escucha y construye”.
“El diálogo social ha sido la bandera principal de este gobierno. Debemos profundizarlo con todos los sectores de nuestra sociedad y acelerar nuestra agenda social y de lucha contra la corrupción”, afirmó.
Estas son algunas de las razones de la protesta.
Las organizaciones sociales también reclaman al gobierno un mayor compromiso con la implementación del acuerdo de paz con las FARC alcanzado en 2016.
En particular, y relacionado con el punto anterior, critican duramente lo que consideran un incumplimiento por parte del gobierno respecto al punto 4 del acuerdo que habla de la sustitución gradual y voluntaria de los cultivos de uso ilícito por otras alternativas de subsistencia para las comunidades más pobres.
Esto, según los expertos, está contribuyendo a la crisis de inseguridad que vive población indígena en el país.
En abril de este año, Duque presentó seis cuestionamientos a la ley de la justicia para la paz , lo que le provocó una ola de críticas e incluso protestas callejeras.
Aquella decisión, que fue sugerida por Álvaro Uribe apenas unos días antes, provocó que defensores del acuerdo con la exguerrilla FARC acusaran al mandatario de “permitir morir la paz” y de ser tildado por columnistas como “subpresidente”.

Por otro lado, recientemente se han llevado a cabo operaciones contra la disidencia de las FARC . En la última, en un caso que estremeció a la sociedad colombiana, al menos ocho menores de edad (algunos medios hablan de 18) murieron en un operativo de las fuerzas de seguridad a un campamento guerrillero.
La muerte de los menores , incluida una niña de 12 años, un adolescente de 15 años y otra menor de 16, había sido ocultada por el gobierno -que solo había hablado de una impecable y exitosa operación- pero fue revelada en el congreso, costándole el puesto al ministro de Defensa Guillermo Botero.
* Guillermo Botero dimite en medio de la polémica por la operación militar en que murieron varios menores
Las críticas contra Botero se habían agravado en mayo pasado cuando un reportaje de The New York Times revelaba que el alto mando ordenó a los militares que doblaran “el número de criminales y guerrilleros que matan, capturan o fuerzan a rendirse en combate (y posiblemente admitiendo un mayor número de víctimas civiles)”.
Esto hizo recordar directivas similares que, durante el gobierno de Álvaro Uribe Vélez, condujerom a la ejecución por parte del ejército de miles de jóvenes que luego fueron presentados como guerrilleros, en lo que se conoció como los “falsos positivos”.
.
La combinación de estos factores han generado un clima de descontento con el gobierno de Duque, cuya popularidad pasa por sus horas más bajas desde su llegada al gobierno en agosto de 2018.
* Un año de Iván Duque en el poder: “Subpresidente”, la pesada carga del presidente de Colombia por ser el elegido de Álvaro Uribe
Una encuesta de la empresa Gallup correspondiente a octubre de 2019 ubicó el nivel de desaprobación de Duque en 69%, mientras que su aprobación era de 26%.
Por lo que este paro nacional representa, para Duque, una de las pruebas más difíciles hasta ahora en su mandato.

Inside Beijing's Ministry for Taking Things Away; The Communist Party no longer has the resources to buy affection, so it resorts increasingly to coercion.

Texto completo: Last weekend's publication of leaked documents about Beijing's abuses of China's Uighur citizens was so shocking on its face that many subtle points may have been lost. One of the more important is the extent to which China's political economy has shifted from giving-things-out mode to taking-things-away mode.
To recap, the New York Times released a trove of secret Communist Party documents , 403 pages, related to the repression that continues in the far west region of Xinjiang. For several years Beijing, under President Xi Jinping, has been engaged in what can best be described as cultural genocide. As many as a million Uighurs (ethnic Turkic Muslims) are believed to be interned in camps; traditional cultural trappings such as abstention from alcohol or a beard can land one in such a prison.
The secret papers reveal how Beijing justifies this abuse to itself and also some practicalities related to the running of 21st-century concentration camps. Shocking details from the report included a script for police to explain to Uighur students returning from universities elsewhere in China why their families were in the camps (to cure them of the "virus" of radicalism) and threatening those students not to make a fuss (or else your parents will remain captive longer). The papers document secret speeches to party cadres in which Mr. Xi railed against the supposed terrorist threat from the Uighurs.
The documents also illustrate an important shift in the party's approach to its own legitimacy under Mr. Xi. Beijing has long fretted about separatism in Xinjiang. Before Mr. Xi, the main method for addressing this was to purchase affection—a program of public-works investment and economic opportunities for the Uighurs, with which to buy their acquiescence to Communist rule.
No more. The leaked documents lay bare a purge of Communist Party officials responsible for implementing that policy in and around Xinjiang in recent years. The regime opened more than 12,000 investigations into Party members in Xinjiang in 2017 alone. Mr. Xi has disbanded the informal "Ministry for Handing Things Out," as one might think of the party apparatus previously oriented toward buying hearts and minds. In its place he has created a "Ministry for Taking Things Away"—a hard-line cohort of officials newly determined to strip Uighurs of cultural identity, economic favors and even their freedom in order to beat them into submission.
This is part of a pattern Mr. Xi is repeating in many other parts of greater China.
In Hong Kong, gone is Beijing's old tolerance for political independence and the hope that the city's partial freedom and rising prosperity would divide and weaken opposition to Beijing's ultimate sovereignty. In its place Mr. Xi proposed an extradition law that would, quite literally, whisk obstreperous Hong Kongers away from their families. This week Beijing doubled down by trying to take away more of Hong Kong's constitutional autonomy with an assault on the independent judiciary .
Beijing wields its Ministry for Taking Things Away against Western companies, threatening to yank their products from the Chinese market. The National Basketball Association is supposed to kowtow to Beijing's demands that even little-known managers not criticize the regime because otherwise the Communist Party will not allow China's middle class to watch American basketball.
Germany is embroiled in a debate over whether to buy 5G wireless-network equipment from Huawei despite security concerns. The fear in some corners of Berlin seems to be that if Germany doesn't buy Huawei equipment, the Ministry for Taking Things Away won't allow Chinese consumers to buy German cars.
In both cases, Chinese citizens are targets as much as the Westerners. The message: We will subordinate your comfort to our power.
What could explain the shift?
One factor is a shortage of things to hand out. The most important economic story of our day is that the Chinese Communist Party has run out of reliable ways to stimulate its economy of 1.4 billion consumers. With the old Ministry for Handing Things Out perilously short of resources, some other means of political control has to be found.
The other is human nature. Good Communists like Mr. Xi are die-hard materialists who chronically fail to grasp any human motivation other than the crassly economic. Imagine his surprise watching young Hong Kongers protest out of a confusing mix of economic frustrations feeding into greater social and even spiritual aspirations that only freedom can satisfy. History could have warned him, as revolutions most often take root not in the poorest societies but in those where prior economic growth has failed to satisfy other civic yearnings.
The job of the Ministry for Taking Things Away is to crush that spirit through a combination of outright violence (Xinjiang and Hong Kong) or at a minimum demoralization (basketball and cars). Can this ministry succeed? That Mr. Xi must ask himself this is a sign of profound regime weakness, no matter how many jackboots his ministry sends into the streets.

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo plays a suddenly impassioned environmental attorney in "Dark Waters," a story that was his passion project; he took it to the director Todd Haynes, then served as one of the film's producers as well as its star.

* 'Citizen K'
The subject is corporate malfeasance that results in environmental pollution on a massive scale over a long period of time. If that makes you think of Erin Brockovich chasing down the source of hexavalent chromium, think again. Instead of Julia Roberts's crowd-pleasing flamboyance there's Mr. Ruffalo's earnest, admirably serious portrayal of Rob Bilott, a real-life defense attorney for chemical companies who became an environmental crusader, in and out of court, after switching sides to go after DuPont Co., an industry supergiant, on behalf of a grievously wronged farmer in West Virginia.
Mr. Haynes, a notable stylist whose work is sometimes tinged with surrealism, was an improbable choice to direct this material, though a fine one, as it turns out. Like Rob, the film isn't flashy, but it is honorable, admirable and improbably stirring—for its hero's idealism and tenacity, for its devotion to detail and its straight-in-the-eye look at plain people living hard lives in a company town. (The cinematographer was Edward Lachman, Mr. Haynes's longtime collaborator. His work is first-rate, as always, though I wish he hadn't emphasized the region's grimness with a blue-skewed palette.)
The farmer, Wilbur Tennant, is played by one of the pre-eminent character actors of our day, Bill Camp. He's a study in coiled fury, as well he might be. When he and Rob first meet in 1998, Wilbur has lost 190 cows to an unknown something that causes deformities, aberrant behavior and rampant cancer, and he's been stonewalled in every effort to seek information. As Rob discovers through exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, research, the villain—the physical villain—is perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, huge quantities of which DuPont has dumped in a landfill near Wilbur's property, even though the company has known for years that the substance is highly toxic.
One of the hallmarks of good corporate-malfeasance stories is that they ramify. Rob's case is a prodigy of ramification, from one rural landfill to a nearby stream to global pollution of water and air. Once the case advances to the discovery phase, DuPont swamps Rob in documents, delivering so many boxes of them to his office in Cincinnati that it looks like the archive at the end of "Raiders of the Lost Ark."
The script, based on a New York Times Magazine story by Nathaniel Rich, was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (his credit reads "earlier screenplay") and Mario Correa. It's lucid, dutiful and inevitably sprawling—there's no easy way to structure a story that spans almost two decades before reaching a dramatic, and in this case dramatically financial, payoff. Anne Hathaway does as well as she can in the severely underwritten role of Rob's wife. But "Dark Waters" is Mr. Ruffalo's film, both in its gestation and execution, and his passion has been well served.

How could MLB's proposed cuts affect independent leagues?

Texto completo: With the recent news of the proposed changes from Major League Baseball, a handful of players throughout the minor leagues could be without jobs within a year.
The independent leagues, of which there are eight across the country, could be an option for those players affected by the possible changes.
The MLB has entertained the thought of making some sweeping changes to professional baseball at the end of the 2020 season. Reports of MLB cutting ties with 42 of its minor league teams arose during October. Over the weekend, a New York Times report released the list of teams that could lose their affiliation.
For those 42 teams that would be removed under the proposal, MLB suggests creating a "Dream League." This MLB-MiLB joint venture would resemble independent leagues in a sense.
Clubs in the Dream League could fill their teams with undrafted players. The players who go undrafted would have the option of going to the Dream League or to the independent leagues.
The York Revolution, an independent team in the Atlantic League, has carried players who have professional experience from season to season. Mark Mason, York Revolution Field Manager and Director of Player Personnel, doesn't see the Atlantic League being affected in a big way if the MLB makes the changes.
"If all of this does end up happening, I think most players who do not have much experience playing professionally will go to other independent leagues," Mason said. "The Atlantic League tends to carry players who have had experience in the majors or extensive trips in the minors."
Eric Menzer, President of the York Revolution, believes independent leagues could be the right move for players, if the proposal does go through.
"If one or more currently affiliated teams lose its affiliation, that provides an interesting opportunity to come join a team in the Atlantic League or any other independent league," Menzer said.
Unlike other independent leagues, the Atlantic League does not have classifications for its roster limitations.
"We can sign any player, regardless of their age or level of experience," Mason said.
In talking with other managers from different independent leagues, Mason heard a lot of concerns on where managers would get players from.
"From a recruiting standpoint, I don't think we will face any turmoil, but other leagues could certainly face some," he said. "With other leagues dealing with younger players and having classification levels, some managers could have some difficulties finding players.
Independent Leagues like the Frontier League have specific player eligibility limitations and different classifications that each team has to abide by.
"I think that players will take advantage of the Independent Leagues if this proposal goes through and it will be interesting to see how everything plays out," Mason said.
In his current role as president of an independent team, Menzer understands that there are some challenges being independent.
"There are advantages and disadvantages of not being affiliated," he said. Independent leagues pay their own players and the MLB doesn't. "I would say that is a disadvantage because that is something MLB does not have to deal with," Menzer said.
Being independent does give you full control of how you can run your team and decisions can be made at any time.
"We play to win so we have the ability to hire and fire our own players at any point during the season," Menzer said. "My job is to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages."
On the thought of a possible expansion of current independent leagues if the proposal were to pass, Menzer believes there could be a possibility.
"I don' think you can look at the situation and say that there is anything but a possibility that there could be more independent teams in the leagues," he said. "I think that this whole situation is not going to turn out the way it's sitting right now; there is a lot of negotiation to be done."

FedEx Delivers Billions to the Taxman

Texto completo: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution makes clear "the right of the people . . . to petition the government for a redress of grievances," and the FedEx board of directors and senior management takes this very seriously. As a corporate citizen, we decided many years ago to engage openly in four areas of public policy that have strategic implications for our company and the more than half a million people who work for us: energy, the environment, trade and taxes.
Although FedEx is an American company focused mostly on governmental issues in the U.S., we serve 220 countries and territories around the world, and appropriately make our views known on these topics internationally as well. We would never advocate policies that we did not feel benefit society overall.
During the Obama administration, and more recently the Trump administration, we worked consistently to change U.S. corporate tax policies. As one country after another lowered corporate tax rates, the U.S. stood by and allowed wide swaths of this country to be deindustrialized due in large measure to its globally uncompetitive business tax rates. At the same time, the country lost focus on vital trade policies following the financial crisis of 2008-09.
The primary victims of this governmental disregard were blue-collar, high-school-educated wage earners, particularly outside metropolitan areas. President Obama belatedly came to embrace the need for a change in both policy areas and supported lower corporate tax rates, increased infrastructure spending, and new trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. I met with Mr. Obama several times on these issues, and I hope our views were in part responsible for his positions during his second term.
When President Trump took over along with a Republican Congress, we worked very hard through various open communication channels, coalitions, and meetings with members of Congress and the administration to effect passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
While I met with Mr. Trump on a couple of occasions, I never discussed tax reform with him, although we did talk about other public-policy matters. We at FedEx were very pleased when he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec. 22, 2017. In response, we increased capital expenditures. We placed a major order for 24 Boeing wide-body freighters, funded major facilities modernizations and expansions, put additional funds in our pension plan, and increased wages by more than $200 million.
Had the tax cuts not passed, we would have significantly lowered capital expenditures in 2018. Instead, the expensing provision of the legislation encouraged FedEx to buy new 777F and 767F aircraft. During the debate on tax reform, the chief executive of UPS, David Abney, and I jointly penned an op-ed in these pages urging passage of corporate tax reform.
I know the FedEx aircraft orders created thousands of incremental new jobs for Boeing, General Electric (the engine supplier on freighters), and a multitude of smaller suppliers. In fact, each order of a 777F injects about $540 million into the U.S. economy, supports 1,850 jobs, and generates roughly $45 million in federal, state and local taxes.
While major capital expenditures under the tax-cut legislation can be expensed, thereby initially deferring U.S. corporate tax receipts, these assets should produce significant revenues for the U.S. Treasury in the years to come while also providing great jobs for the thousands of people who will operate, maintain and provision FedEx and UPS aircraft.
There is little doubt the significant increase in U.S. employment and wages since the tax cuts were passed is due to the decrease of corporate tax rates from 35% (which we used to pay) to 21%, which is competitive with the rest of the industrialized world. Over the past five years, we have paid more than $10 billion in U.S. taxes. After the temporary effect of capital expensing wears off, I expect FedEx will pay billions more into the U.S. Treasury from the earnings produced by our investments.
The recent slowdown in U.S. companies' capital expenditures is, in my opinion, due to trade disputes and the attendant global slowdown. We believe re-embracing TPP and TTIP and passing the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would reverse these trends in short order.
With the above background in mind, I urge readers to review the New York Times's disparaging story from Nov. 17 about FedEx's involvement in corporate tax reform and see a great example of polemics: printing selected facts, connecting unrelated events, and implying nefarious activities when there were none whatever. FedEx takes great pride in being a good corporate citizen -- here and abroad -- at all times.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a great achievement for the American people, and we are proud to have played a small role in passing this important legislation.

Texto completo: ATLANTA, Georgia — The top-tier Democratic presidential contenders and those fighting to stay in the 2020 White House race are set to clash during Wednesday night's November primary debate.
Front-runners such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will take jabs at each other from their respective podiums at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. Meanwhile, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, along with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, businessman Tom Steyer, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, will try to land punches from their spots on the wings.
Here are five moments or trends to watch out for during the fifth debate, co-hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post, and moderated, for the first time, by an all-female panel:
Buttigieg has a target on his back
Buttigieg, 37, is surging in Iowa ahead of the opening nominating caucuses on Feb. 3, with 25% of likely Democratic caucus-goers telling pollsters for the Des Moines Register and CNN that the openly gay, married Navy veteran was their first choice to become the party's standard-bearer. The historically crowded field has swiped at Buttigieg in the past — first for, among other issues, his gun control rhetoric, for openly predicting the race will winnow to himself and Warren, and for using a stock photo of a Kenyan woman to promote his policies for black America. But his rivals are increasingly hitting him for his lack of experience as a "college town mayor," attacks in part motivated by the threat posed by his $23 million campaign war chest.
Warren is under assault for 'Medicare for all'
Warren, 70, was the prime target of her opponents the last time candidates convened on October's debate stage in Ohio, for failing to acknowledge the prospect of middle-class tax hikes under "Medicare for all." In the ensuing weeks, the former Harvard Law School professor released a plan outlining her proposal to pay for a single-payer system and how she wants to transition to it, including passing comprehensive immigration reform. Biden and Buttigieg, in particular, have sustained their criticism of Warren's plan on the trail. Sanders will likely continue to defend his signature platform if pushed to on Wednesday night.
Fireworks over "Medicare for all" represent a larger argument among the competitors, with many of Warren's more centrist counterparts taking umbrage with her call for the party to reject a "safe" nominee. She told Democrats in Iowa this month anyone who "tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory." She and Biden, who turns 77 Wednesday, have exchanged barbs after the initial Consumer Financial Protection Bureau point person accused the 36-year Delaware senator of sticking up for health insurance companies, claiming he was running in the wrong party's primary. Biden was a non-entity during the last debate, so he may go on the offensive.
Impeachment proceedings
When the White House hopefuls walk out on stage, they will do so amid the House Democratic-led impeachment investigation into President Trump and hours after a key witness, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, testifies before lawmakers. While the majority of the field has come out in support of impeachment, the politics of the proceedings are still playing out, with different consequences for the primary and general electorates, especially for Biden as a central figure in the investigation.
Will Klobuchar continue her Minnesota mean streak?
Klobuchar's bid experienced a second-wind after the October debate when the 59-year-old dropped her "Minnesota nice" act and went after Warren. Though still trailing in national polls, the Midwest former prosecutor is looking to capitalize on a bump in public opinion in Iowa and New Hampshire. Simultaneously, Harris, 55, another ex-prosecutor who has also qualified for December's debate but has diverted staff from New Hampshire and Nevada to Iowa, needs a moment, as well, to salvage her presidential efforts. Unlike Klobuchar's blows aimed at Warren, Harris' confrontation of Biden in June over federally mandated busing received mixed reviews for coming across as premediated.
Gabbard's last stand
Gabbard, 38, has gained a reputation for her debate take-downs, first of Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in June over Middle East foreign policy and Harris in July over her prosecutorial record. Wednesday is likely to be the Hawaii National Guard major's last appearance on a stage as the qualifying polling and fundraising criteria become more stringent heading into December. Booker, Steyer, and Yang additionally have nothing to lose given they are yet to cross the thresholds to participate in the next round, set to be hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles on Dec. 19.

Washington Post admits Ukraine interfered in 2016 election but attempts to minimize its effect

Texto completo: It’s virtually impossible to get anyone in the national media to concede that yes, Ukraine did interfere in the 2016 election for the explicit purpose of hurting President Trump’s campaign. And when one reporter finally does admit it, the result is comical, such as in this piece in the style section of the Washington Post last weekend.
The story, by Paul Farhi, looked at past articles written by reporter Kenneth Vogel, one in the New York Times and one in Politico, which have to do with conflict of interest questions swirling around Joe Biden and Ukraine’s 2016 meddling.
Farhi’s piece acknowledged that Vogel’s reporting on Ukraine “extensively detailed Ukrainian efforts to undermine Trump in 2016, such as publicly questioning his fitness for office, disseminating documents implicating Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman at the time, in corruption and helping a Clinton ally research damaging information about him.”
So doesn’t that settle it? Nope!
Farhi then went on to belittle Ukraine’s role in 2016, disparaging Vogel’s reporting for having “implied an equivalence with Russian efforts to undermine Clinton.” He was also sure to point out that Ukraine’s own particular interference wasn’t even close to “the type of hacking and disinformation campaign waged by the Russians in 2016.”
How’s that for a distinction without a difference? On the one hand, you have Ukraine’s government aggressively working to screw Trump’s campaign — so much so that one of its managers, Manafort, is now in prison because of those efforts — and on the other, you have Russia with “hacking and disinformation.”
Interference is interference. I know that the media prefer the kind that unsuccessfully attempted to keep one candidate — Trump — away from the White House, but that doesn’t make the interference on behalf of the other candidate any better, cleaner, or fairer.
If that were the case, reporters would have to admit that some foreign interference is fair. Any takers?

FedEx Delivers Billions to the Taxman; The New York Times runs a misleading story on our 2018 tax return. Here's the real story.

Texto completo: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution makes clear "the right of the people . . . to petition the government for a redress of grievances," and the FedEx board of directors and senior management takes this very seriously. As a corporate citizen, we decided many years ago to engage openly in four areas of public policy that have strategic implications for our company and the more than half a million people who work for us: energy, the environment, trade and taxes.
Although FedEx is an American company focused mostly on governmental issues in the U.S., we serve 220 countries and territories around the world, and appropriately make our views known on these topics internationally as well. We would never advocate policies that we did not feel benefit society overall.
During the Obama administration, and more recently the Trump administration, we worked consistently to change U.S. corporate tax policies. As one country after another lowered corporate tax rates, the U.S. stood by and allowed wide swaths of this country to be deindustrialized due in large measure to its globally uncompetitive business tax rates. At the same time, the country lost focus on vital trade policies following the financial crisis of 2008-09.
The primary victims of this governmental disregard were blue-collar, high-school-educated wage earners, particularly outside metropolitan areas. President Obama belatedly came to embrace the need for a change in both policy areas and supported lower corporate tax rates, increased infrastructure spending, and new trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. I met with Mr. Obama several times on these issues, and I hope our views were in part responsible for his positions during his second term.
When President Trump took over along with a Republican Congress, we worked very hard through various open communication channels, coalitions, and meetings with members of Congress and the administration to effect passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
While I met with Mr. Trump on a couple of occasions, I never discussed tax reform with him, although we did talk about other public-policy matters. We at FedEx were very pleased when he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec. 22, 2017. In response, we increased capital expenditures. We placed a major order for 24 Boeing wide-body freighters, funded major facilities modernizations and expansions, put additional funds in our pension plan, and increased wages by more than $200 million.
Had the tax cuts not passed, we would have significantly lowered capital expenditures in 2018. Instead, the expensing provision of the legislation encouraged FedEx to buy new 777F and 767F aircraft. During the debate on tax reform, the chief executive of UPS, David Abney, and I jointly penned an op-ed in these pages urging passage of corporate tax reform .
I know the FedEx aircraft orders created thousands of incremental new jobs for Boeing, General Electric (the engine supplier on freighters), and a multitude of smaller suppliers. In fact, each order of a 777F injects about $540 million into the U.S. economy, supports 1,850 jobs, and generates roughly $45 million in federal, state and local taxes.
While major capital expenditures under the tax-cut legislation can be expensed, thereby initially deferring U.S. corporate tax receipts, these assets should produce significant revenues for the U.S. Treasury in the years to come while also providing great jobs for the thousands of people who will operate, maintain and provision FedEx and UPS aircraft.
There is little doubt the significant increase in U.S. employment and wages since the tax cuts were passed is due to the decrease of corporate tax rates from 35% (which we used to pay) to 21%, which is competitive with the rest of the industrialized world. Over the past five years, we have paid more than $10 billion in U.S. taxes. After the temporary effect of capital expensing wears off, I expect FedEx will pay billions more into the U.S. Treasury from the earnings produced by our investments.
The recent slowdown in U.S. companies' capital expenditures is, in my opinion, due to trade disputes and the attendant global slowdown. We believe re-embracing TPP and TTIP and passing the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would reverse these trends in short order.
With the above background in mind, I urge readers to review the New York Times's disparaging story from Nov. 17 about FedEx's involvement in corporate tax reform and see a great example of polemics: printing selected facts, connecting unrelated events, and implying nefarious activities when there were none whatever. FedEx takes great pride in being a good corporate citizen—here and abroad—at all times.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a great achievement for the American people, and we are proud to have played a small role in passing this important legislation.

We met with Vice President Pence to talk about press freedom. Here’s why it’s important.

Texto completo: The extent to which the defense of press freedom has been a bipartisan concern is suggested by the fact that as a member of Congress, Mike Pence served as the co-chair of the Freedom of the Press Caucus — along with Adam Schiff.
"If you believe in limited government, you understand that the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press,” Pence said on the floor of the House in 2005, when he was pushing for legislation to protect journalists and their sources.
Today, of course, Schiff is leading the congressional impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump, and Pence is the vice president in an administration that has waged a relentless war on the press.
Trump’s attacks on the news media, while divisive and polarizing in the United States, are doing far worse damage in places around the world where authoritarian governments are jailing journalists in record number or, as was the case with Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, murdering them with impunity.
Pence and press freedom winners
On Monday, I went to see Vice President Pence with a group of courageous journalists from Pakistan, Nicaragua, Tanzania, India and Brazil. These journalists were in the United States to receive press freedom prizes from the Committee to Protect Journalists, the organization I lead. We are honoring them for putting their lives on the line to bring us the news.
The journalists shared a variety of experiences. Neha Dixit described the onslaught of hate she has endured in India about publishing stories on sex trafficking and other sensitive issues. Patrícia Campos Mello, who has reported on alleged corruption in Brazil, said President Jair Bolsonaro has emulated Trump’s rhetoric, unleashing a torrent of online death threats and harassment. Bolsonaro even went so far as to cancel the government’s subscription to her publication, Folha de S. Paulo, after Trump banned The New York Times and The Washington Post from the White House.
Northwestern journalism dean: 'Give the young people a break' in the Sessions story
Several of the journalists raised concern about the proliferation of laws criminalizing “fake news” and the ways these laws are used to target critical media.
Zaffar Abbas, the editor of the Dawn, one of Pakistan’s top newspapers, called on Pence to stand up for journalists working in developing democracies around the world.
Meanwhile, Miguel Mora and Lucia Pineda, who were jailed in Nicaragua in reprisal for their critical reporting, thanked Pence for the support they had received from the U. S. government, which they said helped get them out of prison.
Impeachment keeps leaders apart
The vice president was deeply engaged by these stories and reaffirmed his commitment to press freedom. That’s important, but the reality is that the impeachment inquiry is polarizing, and it’s hard to imagine our political leaders coming together again to defend this critical principle.
That’s why the American people should.
Regardless of how you feel about the impeachment proceedings, many Americans are glued to the news, and we want to know and understand what’s transpiring in Washington. That’s the role of a free press, which is facing new challenges in this country, from the decline in local news to legal action targeting journalists’ sources.
This month, along with our partners at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and more than 40 media organizations around the country, we launched a new campaign called Protect Press Freedom. The campaign seeks to educate Americans about the threats to press freedom, celebrate the diverse journalism that keeps the public informed and mobilize citizens to stand up for freedom of the press — no matter what news is important to them.
There’s another reason that we are calling on all Americans to stand firm for press freedom, and that’s to bolster journalists around the world who work without the protection of the First Amendment. Their reporting not only informs their own societies but also reaches a global audience. The journalists who met with Vice President Pence told him they would like the United States to be an ally and an inspiration. He seemed to get this. Let’s hope he can persuade his boss.

Minor league baseball could be in for a drastic change after MLB made a proposal to cut affiliation with 42 minor league teams, including the Jackson Generals.
It was first reported on Oct. 18 by Baseball America reporter J.J. Cooper that the MLB has proposed eliminating 25% of its minor league teams to increase pay, improve transportation between games and improve the working conditions for players.
On Saturday, the New York Times released a list of the 42 teams that could be on the chopping block, which included four AA baseball teams: Binghamton Rumble Ponies, Chattanooga Lookouts, Erie Seawolves and Jackson Generals. No AAA teams were on the list.
On Monday, the Jackson Sun confirmed with the MiLB — the organization that operates minor league baseball — that the Generals were on this list.
"MLB's list was apparently made after looking at a combination of factors, some of which are the location of the team and how far away other Southern League teams are located, the quality of the ballpark and proximity to each team's major league affiliate," Jeff Lantz, MiLB senior communications director, said.
MLB agreements with its minor league affiliates are up in 2020, the same year that the Jackson Generals lease agreement with the city of Jackson ends.
"Minor League Baseball has assured us that they have no intention of allowing this contraction to take effect," Jackson Generals GM Marcus Sabata said in a press release. "Both MLB and MiLB have both acknowledged that negotiations are in the early stages, are primarily focused on facilities and player care issues, and that any adjustments will take place in 2021."
Sabata and Jackson Generals owner David Freeman declined the Jackson Sun request for an interview.
Freeman also owns a second minor league baseball team in Florida, which is also on the list of 42 teams. His Florida team recently accepted a buyout to move from its current location in Osceola County.
Jackson Generals uncertain future An article published by the Jackson Sun in July showed that Jackson is spending over $1 million per year for the last eight years to keep Generals in Jackson. It was also reported in October that West Tennessee Healthcare was pulling its $65,000 sponsorship from the team because of its uncertain future.
"We are aware of the situation and are monitoring it closely," Jackson Mayor Scott Conger said. "It has no effect on us fulfilling our current contract obligations."
Conger did not respond to the Jackson Sun's question on whether he has begun negotiating a new lease agreement with the team.
"I am confident that the Jackson Generals, the City of Jackson, Congressional leaders and MiLB will do all that is necessary to make sure we continue to provide quality family entertainment in West Tennessee for years to come," Sabata said in the release. "In the interim, we will work closely and quickly with the city to ensure that the Ballpark at Jackson maintains its status as a premier Southern League facility."
The Generals are the minor league affiliate for the Arizona Diamondbacks. The team has won the Southern League Championship for three of the last four years, including this year.
The Southern League has three teams each from Tennessee and Alabama , and two each from Mississippi and Florida.

Texto completo: The former Knick and 10-time All-Star joins a team off to a disappointing start after a run to the Western Conference finals last season.
Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein's weekly N.B.A. newsletter here .
Carmelo Anthony, who has not played in the N.B.A. since November 2018, officially joined the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday.
Anthony signed a one-year, veteran minimum contract, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. If Anthony is on Portland's roster beyond Jan. 7, his $ 2,159,029 salary -- pro-rated from the full veteran minimum of $ 2,564,753 for the portion of the season Anthony has already missed -- becomes guaranteed.
He made his Blazers debut on Tuesday night in New Orleans, scoring 10 points on 4-of-14 field-goal shooting (2 of 3 from 3-point range) and grabbing four rebounds while playing 24 minutes in a 115-104 loss. He was in the starting lineup and, as expected, wore the jersey No. 00. Anthony wore No. 15 with the Denver Nuggets and No. 7 for the Knicks, Thunder and Rockets.
"Carmelo is an established star in this league that will provide a respected presence in our locker room and a skill set at a position of need on the floor," Neil Olshey, Portland's president of basketball operations, said in a statement.
The Blazers, coming off a trip to the Western Conference finals last season, are a disappointing 5-10 after their loss to the Pelicans on Tuesday, and they have turned to Anthony, 10 times an N.B.A. All-Star, to try to add scoring punch to a depleted frontcourt. Zach Collins (shoulder) and Jusuf Nurkic (leg) are out with long-term injuries.
Anthony, 35, has been looking for a job to resurrect his N.B.A. career for more than a year. The Rockets used him in only 10 games last season before essentially banishing him from the team until they could trade him to Chicago in January, having decided that his game was a poor fit. The Bulls released Anthony after the Jan. 22 trade without even bringing him to Chicago.
"The last year and a half has just been like an emotional roller-coaster," Anthony said in a YouTube video.
Portland's star guards, Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, lobbied Anthony to push for a trade from the Knicks to the Blazers in the summer of 2017, but Anthony later told The New York Times that he considered a move to the Pacific Northwest to be too far away from his family. Anthony opted instead to waive his Knicks no-trade clause to facilitate a trade to Oklahoma City, then spent one season with the Thunder before they dealt him to the Rockets.
"I always kept my eye on Portland," Anthony said in the video. "It just didn't work out at other times. Now it seems like a perfect opportunity."
Anthony won the N.B.A. scoring title in 2012-13 by averaging 28.7 points per game. That was the last season that the Knicks made the playoffs.
In recent years, though, Anthony's defensive deficiencies and offensive limitations raised fears that he would not get another chance in the league after his doomed stint as a Rocket. He is considered much more effective as a scorer when used in isolation plays rather than as a catch-and-shoot option on the perimeter as most teams prefer in the modern game, but the Blazers do use plenty of isolation schemes.
"It will only work if all parties see it the same way," Anthony said.
LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers expressed support for his friend's comeback last week, telling local news reporters: "He belongs in this league. I'm happy the Blazers gave him an opportunity. He'll make the most of it. We'll see what happens. I'm just happy he's back in the league."
Of the 19 players in league history with at least 25,000 career points and more than 6,500 rebounds, only four have not won an N.B.A. championship: Karl Malone, Dominique Wilkins, Alex English and Anthony.

Teacher pay

Teachers salaries arent keeping up

I recently discovered a copy of the salary schedule from Pinellas County schools from 2005-06. Being in my 24th year of teaching, I paid attention to the salary of a 24-year experienced teacher from back then. In the 05-06 school year a teacher with a bachelors degree and 24 years experience would have made $54,400. The salary for a bachelors degree teacher with 24 years experience in 2019-20 is $55,008, a difference of only $608. That equals a 1.1 percent overall pay increase in 14 years. During that same time period the CPI in the Tampa Bay area rose an average of 2.2 percent a year  an overall increase of 33 percent. If the pay scale had just managed to keep up with the cost of living, the pay for the said 24-year teacher would be $72,403, a difference of $17,395. Year after year, experienced teachers are being squeezed out of the system with wage compression that Tallahassee forces on the districts. While paying beginning teachers higher and higher salaries is a good and decent thing, the insulting and injurious pay scale for the experienced teachers helps explain the exodus of good, experienced teachers from the profession.

Bicyclist injured after hit-and-run inside bike crossing | Nov. 17

Flashing lights should be red

It has always been a head scratcher for me that crossings for pedestrians and cyclists come with flashing yellow lights rather than red. Drivers are taught that red means stop and yellow means slow down and proceed with caution. If the true purpose for crosswalks is to protect walkers and bikers, then red flashing lights need to be the only color option. Otherwise, people attempting to share a roadway with motor vehicles will always lose out.

Rich co-opt tax break | Nov. 17

Pick the person, not the party

While I have been a registered Democrat ever since I first began to vote, I have on occasion voted for a Republican when I thought the person would be a better representative of all the people as opposed to a Democratic opponent who only seemed to want to represent himself. Thus, I am amazed by the indoctrination of Republicans who vote for their party no matter what. Reading this article about then-Gov. Rick Scotts giveaways to the rich along with a similar article a few days earlier about his shenanigans concerning his denial of Medicaid expansion  and how Republican legislators here in Florida want to continue such draconian policies  is enough to make me worry about the future of our republic.

Trump Jr.s book is a No. 1 bestseller | Nov. 15

Fiction or non-fiction?

President Donald Trump bragged on Twitter that his sons book was No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. Now Im confused. I thought the president believed the New York Times was fake news.

Barriers zigzag across America like a scar

Texto completo: A few words about walls.Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border -- the one he swore Mexico would pay for -- has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as eight.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
• In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
• In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library's request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, "Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
• In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, "I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds."
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books -- and bodies -- into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual -- and emotional -- separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom -- for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

ANALYSIS: Warren 'Medicare for all' push slowing her 2020 primary momentum

Texto completo: For months, Elizabeth Warren held off publishing details on how to pay for her "Medicare for all" proposal, which would effectively eliminate private health insurance in favor of a government program.
It turns out there was a good reason why.
Since the Massachusetts senator released details of her healthcare plan on Nov. 1 to counter charges by 2020 Democratic presidential rivals that it would raise taxes on middle-class earners, her poll numbers have dropped in key early voting states.
Ahead of the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, every poll of Democrats in the state this month has shown her support decrease. The latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll found her at 16% support. An Oct. 25-30 New York Times/Siena College poll had her at 22% support.
Nationally, Warren has seen her numbers in the mid-to-high teens, down from her consistent polling in the 20% range during October. Warren, 70, is now 6.7 percentage points behind former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, in the RealClearPolitics national average.
Warren doesn't have the "Medicare for all" proposal to herself. Socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders made the idea famous, going back to his 2016 Democratic presidential bid. But Sanders has openly campaigned on higher middle-class taxes to fund his healthcare plan, arguing American taxpayers would end up saving money due to decreasing healthcare costs.
Democratic strategists and insiders who have spoken with the Washington Examiner since the beginning of the month have expressed dismay that Warren committed to a "Medicare for all" program and have said it could prove to be a major liability in a general election.
[Read more: Warren says she'll phase in 'Medicare for All' gradually via an opt-in government healthcare plan]
That reflects skepticism by Democratic primary voters, as seen in a poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers conducted by the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom. The survey found that 36% support a "Medicare for all" plan that would eliminate private health insurance and enroll all Americans into a government-run system. Over 54% said that instead they would like to see a public option, backed by government, or improvements to the Affordable Care Act, which relies largely on private insurance.
Only 36% of respondents said they want a nominee who will "back big ideas, even if there's a lower chance they would become law." Fifty-two percent said they want a candidate who will "advocate for proposals that have a good chance of becoming law, even if the changes aren't as big."
"The work we’ve done shows there’s nothing to suggest Democratic voters are in favor of 'Medicare for all.' I think people are trying to get things that fix the current laws and get a policy that works," said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who has worked with Democrats such as President Bill Clinton and the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
"You have 10, 12 people running, and one of the things candidates tend to do is say, 'How can I get a share of the electorate?' and not ask what it means if I’m the nominee," Hart told the Washington Examiner. "They play for the short end of the field. It plays well for certain constituencies, but it becomes a liability. Senator Warren is trying to figure out how to walk this back slightly, without flip-flopping."

Texto completo: The Batavia Muckdogs, Auburn Doubledays and more than three dozen other minor league baseball teams in the nation could have their ties to a parent club eliminated through a Major League Baseball proposal, according to The New York Times.
The newspaper reports that Major League Baseball says the reorganization is needed to make the minor leagues more efficient and to improve conditions and facilities. Major and Minor League Baseball's current Professional Baseball Agreement is set to expire after the 2020 season.
Among the proposed changes are to sever ties with 42 minor league teams, which is approximately a quarter of the minor league teams under the current contract; and to shift the baseball draft from June to August and limit the number of rounds.
Under the plan, a new "Dream League" would be operated by MLB at minimal cost and provide undrafted players an opportunity to break into professional baseball.
The New York Times reported that such a league could be a "death sentence" as a loss of major-league affiliation would significantly diminish a team's value in the community and could alter interest among prospective employees.
Sen. Charles Schumer on Monday implored MLB to reconsider.
"America's favorite pastime should not become part of Upstate New York's past," he said in a statement to the USA TODAY Network New York.
"It's no secret that New York's minor league teams are institutions within their communities, which is why I implore MLB to reconsider any such plans and will be reaching out to them directly to advocate for our New York teams."
Speaking in Rochester on Monday morning, Schumer said he plans to call baseball commissioner Rob Manfred and "make a strong push" on behalf of the minor league teams that would by affected by this proposal.
Baseball's long history in upstate New York Both the Auburn and Batavia teams are part of MLB's New York-Penn League, which has been operating since 1939. The team in Batavia – then known as the Clippers – was one of the league's six inaugural teams and was the only one still operating in 2019.
For most of its history, the league was largely comprised of teams in small upstate communities, which at various times also included Binghamton, Corning, Elmira, Geneva, Hornell, Jamestown, Lockport, Newark, Olean, Oneonta, Utica, and Watertown.
Last season, just six of the league's 14 teams were based in New York state, and two of them are slated for elimination.
The Batavia Muckdogs, in Genesee County, are a feeder team for the Miami Marlins.
The Auburn Doubledays, in Cayuga County, are a feeder team for the Washington Nationals, which won the 2019 World Series.
Other New York teams on the elimination list include the Binghamton Rumble Ponies and the Staten Island Yankees.
Some New York teams appeared safe, including the Hudson Valley Renegades in Wappingers Falls and the Tri-City ValleyCats in the Albany area. They both also play in the New York–Penn League.
"These teams are not only regional economic and tourism engines, they are also part of the DNA of these communities – and we are more than willing to work with them and Major League baseball to stop this from happening," said Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Binghamton Mayor Richard David said he has spoken with state and local leaders about the news reports and vowed "to fight tooth and nail" to keep the Rumble Ponies.
He said the city-owned stadium is well positioned to fight any efforts by MLB, saying state and local governments have recently invested more than $8 million to upgrade the facility and meet team requirements.
"We were very proactive several years ago where there were deficiencies to put us in a strong position" going forward, he said, adding, "It's something we are concerned about. We are organizing and mobilizing very quickly."
But David warned that these stances often come up when there are contract negotiations coming.
"I would just reiterate that this is a proposal by Major League Baseball, and historically we have seen this every decade or so when contract negotiations come up between minor league baseball and Major League Baseball," David said in Albany as he attended a meeting of the New York Conference of Mayors.
"I don't think that proposal will be adopted in that form."
Auburn City Clerk Chuck Mason offered similar concern, saying losing the Doubledays would be a major blow to the community that has supported a baseball team for more than a century.
"It's a big economic driver," he said. "We're doing everything we can to communicate with our state and federal officials to try to get support for maintaining the New York-Penn League."
Why is MLB proposing to eliminate minor league teams? The proposed changes were first reported by Baseball America's J.J. Cooper in August, which came as part of the negotiation to renew an operating agreement between the minor and major leagues that expires at the end of the 2020 season.
On Saturday, Dan Barry of the New York Times revealed the names of the 42 teams who would be impacted by the plan.
For more than 100 years, minor league teams have negotiated affiliation agreements with big-league teams. The parent club provides funding and players to the minor league teams, which help train and develop young players who aspire to a major league career.
Cooper reported that MLB owners and team officials have long expressed concerns about the quality of playing facilities where many of the affiliates operate. They'd also like minor league teams to contribute more to player salaries.
But perhaps the biggest reason behind the proposed reductions is a shift in the way teams are thinking about player development, driven by the emergence of technology and data analytics.
As teams have adopted these tools, they've concluded that their current system is woefully inefficient. Travis Sawchik, a sports reporter for FiveThirtyEight, wrote in September about why the Houston Astros were among the teams who have reduced the number of minor league affiliates in recent years.
Team officials concluded that they need less time and fewer games to understand the potential of their young prospects, and it is better served by consolidating resources around their most promising players.
Teams have also shifted their development efforts off the field, using video analysis and other high-tech tools to help players improve their skills at their training facilities rather than by playing in regulation games. Many players have embraced these efforts on their own, turning to independent coaches and unaffiliated training facilities.
Sawchik and co-author Ben Lindbergh explored these changes in their best-selling book, "The MVP Machine: How Baseball's New Nonconformists Are Using Data to Build Better Players."
They describe a system where teams have traditionally poured in hundreds of players and millions of dollars each year in the hopes that a handful of those prospects will eventually emerge on the other end to help the big league team. The process seems mysterious from the outside, and in truth, the effort has often been more art than science.
"As far as many fans are concerned, players disappear after draft day," Sawchick and Lindbergh wrote, "encased in cocoons from which some emerge as beautiful baseball butterfiles, while most wither away, forever forgotten or, if they're particularly talented, lamenting for failing to molt."
Sawchik and Lindbergh said that the adoption of these new technologies has helped teams to realize they can get a competitive advantage by upending the way they develop players and shifting away from the minor league model they've relied on for the last century.
Jeff Lantz, Senior Director of Communications for Minor League Baseball said the sides will meet in upcoming weeks to negotiate a plan that would "save as many teams" as possible.
"From what we gathered from the MLB, they did a poll of which ballparks were better, which needed a lot of work and came up with a mass list," he said.
Lantz said an estimated 1,200 players would also lose their jobs should the proposal be approved.
"A lot would be released and have their dreams of being big-league players crushed," Lantz said. "We'll see how things shake out. Both sides want to get a deal done that benefits baseball."
However, the 2020 season is not in jeopardy and is scheduled to be played uninterrupted, he said.
"This is where people gather in the summertime, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities," Lantz said. "Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."
Fans cry 'foul' While these changes might represent an improvement for major league operations, the proposed restructuring could have a devastating effect on long-standing minor league teams and the communities they serve.
Brett Mandel, who wrote a book about his experiences playing minor league baseball, says baseball risks further alienating its fans.
"Minor league baseball may not be the most cost-effective way to cultivate MLB talent," Mandel said, "but I would argue that it is an incredibly efficient way to connect millions of fans to baseball and its players in an intimate and personal way that is impossible in Major-League markets.
Some fans of teams that are on the cutting block have taken to social media to express their displeasure with the plan.
"I think it is profoundly stupid to deny people in smaller communities the opportunity to see live professional baseball at an affordable price," said Ed Wright of Hamburg. "As though baseball isn't losing its popularity fast enough already. This will exacerbate that trend."
Mike Armstrong, now a Connecticut resident, once worked for the team in Auburn.
"I spent the best summer of my life working for the Doubledays," he tweeted. "Would be devastating to see the loss of small-town minor league baseball under this proposal."
Hilton resident Jason Rhodes said he loves going to games in Batavia because it makes him feel closer to the sport he grew up loving.
"These teams play such an important role in the life of these small towns, and they make the game approachable for fans," he said. "If you got to a big-league game you'll spend 50 bucks and your seat will be far removed from the playing field. Sitting in the bleachers at Dwyer (Stadium in Batavia) makes me feel reconnected to the game in a way that isn't possible anywhere else."

Texto completo: Gig workers on Mechanical Turk, a platform run by Amazon, do computer-like tasks for pennies. Here's what I learned when I joined their ranks.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
"What's your story about?" friends and colleagues would ask.
"It's about this ... thing," I'd say, "called Mechanical Turk."
If the other person did not speak tech, where Mechanical Turk, a platform run by Amazon, is synonymous with low-paid digital piecework, they would look at me blankly. So I would explain:
There are these people who do these little tiny online jobs that other people post. The other people pay them little tiny amounts of money, like 5 cents or 75 cents or two dollars, or sometimes one lousy cent.
The idea is to do lots of these little jobs as fast as you can and move on to higher paying ones and make something like an O.K. wage. If you navigate the learning curve, you sort of can. Most people, including me, do not, as I wrote about my brief experience working as a "turker" in an article published on Friday.
This description, though, leaves out a key aspect of Mechanical Turking, which is how strangely disconnected it feels to do it.
Here is a job I performed on Sept. 17: Type the letters A and B as fast as you can, in alternation, for 10 minutes: ABABABABABAB. For every 100 times you type A and B, you get 6 cents.
It turns out I can type A and B pretty fast -- all those years of piano lessons and high school typing class. In 10 minutes I typed them 2,371 times. For this, I was paid $ 1.42, plus a $ 1 bonus -- the most I made on any Mechanical Turk task. But why?
That same morning, I accepted a task with the inviting subject line "Make 1 art, upload the image. With bonus." The catch was that the task was "only for people who have or personally know someone harmed by gun violence." Like millions of Americans, I qualified. My job was to make an artwork about the incident.
Feeling creeped out and kind of violated but strangely compelled to finish the assignment, I drew a man pointing a gun at another man, with a broken heart next to it. I answered a series of questions: "How has gun violence harmed someone you know?" ("A friend of mine was shot dead while driving a cab.") "Describe how your artwork is about the topic." ("My artwork shows James helpless to stop his killer from shooting him.") I hit "submit." I earned 7 cents.
These two tasks were so puzzling that I contacted the requesters, as people who post tasks on Mechanical Turk are known, to learn more.
The task where I typed A and B turned out to be part of an economics study about racial discrimination. The researcher, Sher Afghan Asad, a graduate student at Iowa State University, explained that some participants were paid more or less than me, while others were paid nothing but told that their typing would cause another person who was identifiably black or white to be paid.
The experiment used typing speed as a measure of caring. "We're looking at whether people care about others based on race," Mr. Asad said. His paper is due out soon.
The gun violence task was part of an art project. The requester, Jason Zhao, a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, commissioned hundreds of turker artworks on hot-button topics and is selling them in a vending machine for $ 3 apiece.
His project, "Everyone Will Be an Artist," is a critique and satire of Mechanical Turk itself, and of the art market, and capitalism, and alienated labor. The anti-exploitative twist is that if an artwork sells, Mr. Zhao gives the $ 3 to the turker, minus 53 cents overhead and 12 cents profit.
(The New York Times Company itself, I learned, has made interesting use of Mechanical Turk. Last year, The Times paid turkers 4 cents apiece to read articles and tag the emotions they evoked. Their responses were used to train a program called Project Feels that places ads with articles whose emotional valence can increase clicks on the ads.)
Really, though, most jobs on Mechanical Turk were more like this: I voted on whether someone should call their website "proMerchantShop.com" or "goWebMerchant.com " or "merchantEZ.com." I looked at 82 pairs of photos of edible things and answered whether, for instance, fried chicken is a subcategory of food, or equivalent to food, or neither.
Turkers get used to this indifferent march of tasks.
"Honestly, monotony can be good," one turker, Katie Boehm of Pittsburgh, told me. "'Is article A the same as article B?' over and over -- you just kind of get in this flow, and you realize, 'I just made 20 bucks."'
Ms. Boehm was the only turker I talked to who actually found the work occasionally meaningful. Surveys are big on Mechanical Turk, and Ms. Boehm, who is bisexual, likes doing ones involving L.G.B.T.Q. issues and discrimination. "I'm given a platform to tell someone, a student who's studying rights, what's really happening out here," she said.
For me, turking usually felt bubbled off from the real world. But there was a moment when I was transcribing a long register receipt from a Target store near Denver and the date on it caught my eye: The receipt was from that very day. I looked at the time stamp: less than an hour and a half ago.
It dawned on me that halfway across the country, an actual person had just bought a sleeve of 18-ounce red plastic cups, a pair of Cat and Jack girl's leggings, an 18-ounce bag of Smarties, a four-pack of Totino's triple cheese frozen party pizzas and a 49-cent pencil sharpener. And some aspect of recording that transaction had been entrusted to me.
I felt a rush of pride at my role keeping the wheels of commerce turning. For 14 minutes of my life, 3 cents felt like a bonus.

Texto completo: Ashley James, most recently of the Brooklyn Museum, started there this week.
At a time when museums all over the country are trying to increase the number of people of color on its staff, boards and walls, the Guggenheim Museum has hired its first full-time black curator: Ashley James.
Ms. James, who this week started on the job as the museum's associate curator of contemporary art, was most recently an assistant curator of contemporary art at the Brooklyn Museum, where she was a moving force behind the acclaimed exhibition "Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power."
"Her work complements the Guggenheim's mission to present the art of today," Nancy Spector, the Guggenheim's artistic director and chief curator, said in a statement, "which we understand as a deep and expansive view of art history."
Before coming to the Brooklyn Museum, Ms. James was a Mellon Curatorial Fellow in the Museum of Modern Art's drawings and prints department, where she focused on retrospectives of the artists Adrian Piper and Charles White. Ms. James has also held positions at the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Yale University Art Gallery. In the spring, she will receive a Ph.D. from Yale in English Literature, African-American Studies, and women's, gender and sexuality studies.
"I am eager to begin work with my colleagues to develop new research, explore new ideas for exhibitions, programs and publications," Ms. James said in a statement, "and continue to expand and shape such a vital collection."
The appointment coincides with recent frictions in the Guggenheim's relationship with a guest curator, the art historian Chaédria LaBouvier, who organized the exhibition "Basquiat's 'Defacement': The Untold Story." Speaking up recently at a museum panel discussion, Ms. LaBouvier, who is black, accused the Guggenheim of snubbing her and undermining her curatorial role by, among other things, not inviting her to participate in the Guggenheim's panel discussion about Basquiat with other scholars who had contributed to her own catalog. Last summer she told The New York Times that she was cut out of other decisions on how the exhibition was to be presented and that her research had been shortchanged.
Ms. LaBouvier was the first black female curator to organize a solo exhibition at the museum in its 80-year history. The independent Nigerian curator Okwui Enwezor was one of several organizers of a show on African photography in 1996 and the artists Carrie Mae Weems and Julie Mehretu are among six artist-curators in the current exhibition "Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection," running through January.
In a statement, the Guggenheim said, it "is proud to have presented the exhibition Basquiat's "'Defacement': The Untold Story," curated by Chaédria LaBouvier based upon her original and groundbreaking research." (PHOTOGRAPH BY ELLE PÉREZ)

Texto completo: Two days after a mysterious, unannounced hospital visit, President Trump's physician issued a late-night statement attributing it to "regular, primary preventative care."
WASHINGTON -- The White House sought on Monday night to quell a torrent of speculation about President Trump's health two days after a mysterious, unannounced visit to the hospital, denying that he was treated for an emergency and insisting that it was just "regular, primary preventive care."
"Despite some of the speculation, the president has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues," Cmdr. Sean P. Conley, the president's Navy physician, wrote in a memo released by the White House in an unusual late-night statement. "Specifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations."
Mr. Trump was taken on Saturday to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in his motorcade in a trip that had not been listed on his public schedule. He stayed for about two hours for what White House officials said were routine tests, but since the visit had not been revealed in advance and came only nine months after his last annual physical, it touched off much discussion about whether the president had an undisclosed health issue.
Mr. Trump, 73, is the oldest man ever sworn in for a first term as president, and he is not known for a healthy diet or exercise other than weekend golf. At his February checkup, he weighed in at 243 pounds, which is considered obese for a man of his reported height of 6-foot-3. He has been reported in the past to be taking rosuvastatin, a lipid-lowering drug, to control his cholesterol.
Dr. Conley reported that his latest test showed Mr. Trump's cholesterol at 165, down from 196 in February. His LDL has fallen to 84, from 122, while his HDL was 70, up from 58. The doctor did not release results of any other tests, if conducted, including an updated weight.
In his memo, Dr. Conley called Saturday's visit "a routine, planned interim checkup as part of the regular, primary preventative care he receives throughout the year." He said it was not announced in advance "due to scheduling uncertainties," without explaining further.
Dr. Conley also made no mention of whether Mr. Trump underwent a routine colonoscopy, which his physician at the time said in January 2018 would be conducted at his next regular exam. The president's doctors did not say in February whether he had one then.
After the February exam, Dr. Conley described Mr. Trump as being in "very good health." He made no characterization one way or the other in Monday night's statement, but brushed off concerns generated by the Saturday visit.
"Primary preventative medical care is something that occurs continuously throughout the year, it is not just a single annual event," Dr. Conley said. "As such, I will continue to monitor the president's health, planning on a more comprehensive examination after the new year."

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Nov. 15, 2019 edition of the Inside the Dodgers newsletter. To receive the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
I broke the story of Andrew Toles’ promotion to the big leagues in the summer of 2016. One thing I didn’t include in any of my reporting at the time was this text message from a Dodgers staffer: “that could end poorly.”
The story of Toles’ career with the Dodgers hasn’t technically ended. He’s still under contract to the team, but he spent all of 2019 on the restricted list and did not play. The reason for his absence was never revealed; we only knew that Toles had the support of the organization while he was away. For a player who joined the team in a cloud of mystery, it was an appropriate fadeout to the decade.
The Dodgers were well aware of his question marks when they signed Toles as a minor league free agent. They knew Toles had been disciplined by two different college programs — kicked off the University of Tennessee baseball team in 2011 and suspended by Chipola College in 2012. They knew the Tampa Bay Rays expelled Toles from his Single-A team following a blow-up with his manager in May 2014. They knew all this because the GM who drafted and developed Toles with the Rays was none other than the Dodgers’ Andrew Friedman.
Toles’ second chance in professional baseball went much better than his first. Fast-tracked from Single-A to the majors in 2016, Toles slashed .314/.365/.505 in 48 regular season games. By October, he had ramrodded his way into the starting outfield. Toles started four of six NLCS games against the Cubs that year, going 6 for 13 (.462) with a pair of doubles. At 24 years old, Toles had made the leap from prospect, to failed prospect, to starting outfielder on a playoff team. The transformation landed him in the pages of the New York Times.
The following winter, the Dodgers jettisoned their de facto left fielder, Howie Kendrick, paving the way for Toles to seize regular playing time in 2017. However, a knee injury in May promptly ended his season. His absence on the field would have been more conspicuous without the emergence of Chris Taylor. Still, by 2018, Toles was healthy and competing for a job in spring training. There was a pathway for him to regain his standing on the depth chart.
By the final week of camp, Toles and Joc Pederson were in the running for the final outfield job. Pederson went 8 for 54 during the Cactus League season. Toles went 15 for 53. Pederson won the job anyway, and Toles began the season in Triple-A. There, a hamstring injury cost him two months. He batted .306 at Oklahoma City but never cracked a Dodger outfield rotation that now featured a rejuvenated Pederson and Matt Kemp, in addition to Chris Taylor, Kiké Hernandez and Yasiel Puig. On Sept. 29 in San Francisco, Toles singled and stole second base against the Giants. He hasn’t batted in a major league game since.
Judging only what he did on the field, Toles deserves some extolling. His postseason at-bats, limited though they were, look impressive in the context of the decade. His .792 regular-season OPS compares surprisingly well with the Dodgers’ other outfielders of the last 10 years. His effort in the outfield and on the bases was at least as impressive as hit bat. Ironically, Toles’ hard-nosed efforts landed him in the operating room and derailed his early promise perhaps as much as anything. Toles is still only 27 years old. But without knowing the substance of his off-the-field issue(s), it’s hard to say anything definitive about his future in baseball.
All we have for now are memories of one of the game’s best personalities, a talented athlete who offered tantalizing glimpses on the field. Who else points at a mean-mugging Chase Utley and says, unironically, “I wake up in the morning and I’m like, ‘how can I be like Chase Utley today?’ ” Who else admits he checked FanGraphs to see when he’d get called up from Triple-A? Who else, while being unable to walk, says (also unironically), “I’m pretty much healthy right now … besides my knee”? No one, that’s who. You can tell the story off the 2010s Dodger teams without Andrew Toles, but it wouldn’t be nearly as fun.

David Leonhardt: Comey, Mueller and the true courage of Marie Yovanovitch

Texto completo: To understand the courage that witnesses like Marie Yovanovitch have shown during the Ukraine investigation, it’s worth looking back on a couple of the other signature moments of the Trump era.
One was in the summer of 2016, when James Comey, then the FBI director, faced an uncomfortable choice. He and his colleagues had concluded that Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted for using a private email account to conduct government business. Her conduct was sloppy and inappropriate, but it was also fairly common and not close to being criminal.
Still, Comey knew that Republicans would vilify him for his decision not to prosecute. They would portray it as partisan, rather than what it was: a straightforward application of the law. And Comey prized his reputation for appearing to be above partisan politics.
So he looked for a way to dilute the criticism. Instead of simply closing the Clinton investigation, he gave a news conference blasting her. Doing so violated Justice Department policy, but also ensured that the subsequent criticism of Comey would come from both Democrats and Republicans. Comey, in short, put a higher priority on avoiding the appearance of partisanship than on doing the right thing.
Three years later, Robert Mueller faced his own uncomfortable choice. As special counsel, he helped uncover evidence that President Donald Trump had repeatedly broken the law, including paying hush money to two women and interfering in the Russia investigation. But Mueller understood that clearly laying out his conclusions would subject him to vicious criticism as a partisan. Like Comey, he prized his reputation for floating above partisan politics.
Conveniently, he found a solution that protected his reputation. Mueller’s final report included a detailed recitation of facts, but its conclusions were deliberately obtuse, which meant they changed almost nobody’s mind. “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller cryptically said. Making matters worse, he then allowed the Trump administration to control — and spin — the report’s release.
Mueller, to be fair, has a stronger defense than Comey. Throughout, Mueller interpreted Justice Department guidelines in narrow ways: Those guidelines didn’t compel him to present clear conclusions — as Kenneth Starr had two decades earlier — and so Mueller didn’t do so. It’s possible that Mueller’s mistakes had more to do with naïveté than pride.
Yet the outcome was the same. Both Mueller and Comey preserved their nonpartisan images (only temporarily in Comey’s case, because he later engaged in a full-on fight with Trump), while the country suffered.
Comey’s unprecedented insertion of the FBI into the final stages of a presidential campaign may have decided the outcome. And Mueller’s convoluted report was a gift to Trump. Mueller’s long investigation uncovered extensive evidence of a president who had broken the law and abused his power, but Mueller did almost nothing to hold the president accountable.
Now let’s return to the Ukraine case — and contrast the approach of Comey and Mueller with the very different decisions by Yovanovitch, Alexander Vindman, Bill Taylor, George Kent and, above all, the whistleblower.
After learning that Trump was pressuring a foreign country to investigate U.S. citizens, the whistleblower took the extraordinary step of filing a formal complaint against the president. He had to have understood the risks of doing so. He could lose his job and his career. He could become a Fox News boogeyman. Any part of his background could be subjected to public scrutiny. His life might never be the same.
And yet he put a higher priority on doing the right thing than on avoiding accusations of partisanship.
Since then, Yovanovitch, Vindman, Taylor and Kent have made similar decisions. Despite the personal risks, they have testified forthrightly about Trump’s actions. Sure enough, Trump apologists have smeared them. Conservative pundits suggested Vindman was a traitor, and a House Republican lamely tried to link Yovanovitch to a Democratic operative. Trump has publicly insulted the witnesses. They have been portrayed as partisan hacks rather than what they are: Americans willing to pay a price for their country.
The radicalization of the Republican Party means that other people are going to face versions of this dilemma. Not just Trump, but many members of Congress, have chosen to depict anything other than partisan hackery for their own side as partisan hackery for the other side. Just look at Adam Schiff, the House Democrat who — though like every human being makes occasional missteps — has run a fair, rigorous impeachment inquiry and whom Republicans have painted as a vindictive villain.
The situation is even more difficult for people who pride themselves on their nonpartisanship. This group includes Mueller, Comey, diplomats, law enforcement agents, journalists, national security officials, Federal Reserve officials and more. Many of them may be faced with a miserable choice, in which they can’t both do the right thing and preserve their reputation for doing the right thing.
Mueller and Comey are decent men who have served their country honorably for decades. Yet when confronted with this test, even they failed it. Which should make us all the more grateful for Yovanovitch, Vindman, Taylor, Kent and the whistleblower.

The Pete Buttigieg Experience; The mayor isn't the only one who wants to leave South Bend.

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg is surging again in presidential campaign polls, and media observers are once again asking whether the mayor of South Bend, Indiana has enough experience to run the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the latest depressing story out of South Bend suggests that what Mr. Buttigieg lacks most of all is achievement.
He has certainly achieved a large measure of popularity among Iowa Democrats. Brianne Pfannenstiel reports in the Des Moines Register:
Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.
Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa's likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register's Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor.
But back home in Indiana, one of the mayor's most distinguished employees has decided he's had enough. Marek Mazurek reports in the South Bend Tribune today:
Last year, Elijah Arias was recognized as the South Bend Police Department's Officer of the Year.
Earlier this month, Arias and two other former South Bend officers were sworn in at the Mishawaka Police Department, leaving South Bend with a shortfall of officers after two recent recruiting cycles yielded no new hires.
Doesn't anybody want to work for Mayor Pete? Mr. Mazurek reports:
The South Bend Police Department has come under increased national scrutiny in connection with Mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign following the fatal shooting of Eric Logan, who is black, by a white officer in June...
Sgt. Harvey Mills, president of the Fraternal Order of Police in South Bend, believes Buttigieg's actions following the incident drove some away from the force.
"There were a lot of officers that left as a result of Mayor Buttigieg's comments and lack of support," Mills said.
In the aftermath of the Logan shooting, Buttigieg wrote in a campaign email "All police work and all of American life takes place in the shadow of racism."
All of South Bend life takes place in the shadow of rising violence. Last month, Christian Sheckler reported in the Tribune:
Through August, the latest month for which full statistics are available, South Bend had seen 10 homicides, an increase from five over the same period last year. The pace of homicides increased in September, with four killings in the city in the past month...
Through the end of August, 79 people had been injured or killed in shootings this year. That's an increase of almost 60 percent compared with the 50 shootings through the same period in 2018.
In another South Bend Tribune story in today's edition, Allie Kirkman notes that South Bend schools have "suffered from reduced enrollment," not exactly a sign of a thriving community. Nevertheless school officials are asking voters to approve another tax increase.
A recent editorial in the Tribune suggested that Mayor Pete's school system is having just as hard a time as the police department in attracting and retaining valuable employees:
In September, South Bend had 16 teaching jobs still open. In contrast, other local school districts, including School City of Mishawaka and Penn-Harris-Madison School Corp., were fully staffed.
Last night Mr. Buttigieg wrote in an email to presidential campaign supporters:
When I announced my campaign for president, I knew it was more than a little bold. Here was a youthful, Midwestern Mayor stepping forward as a candidate for the highest office in the land. We heard things like, "Is this for real?" and "Why now?"
As people study his record as mayor, Mr. Buttigieg may also hear things like, "Why should we apply your South Bend model nationwide?"
***
Elizabeth Warren's Problem
Mr. Buttigieg's rise has been fueled in part by voter concerns about the health plan advanced by presidential campaign rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). Those concerns may have room to grow. Shane Goldmacher, Sarah Kliff and Thomas Kaplan write in the New York Times that Sen. Warren is still struggling to market government-run health care:
...speaking to reporters the day after unveiling her Medicare for all financing plan, she uncharacteristically stumbled over the specifics, insisting, incorrectly, that only billionaires would see their taxes go up.
Meanwhile the U.K.'s government-run health plan hardly argues for a similar experiment in the U.S. Today Helen Puttick reports in the Times of London on the lengths patients of the National Health Service must go to find a safe operating room:
An NHS operating theatre has been mothballed because of staff shortages and patients having surgery are being taken to a mobile theatre run by a private company.
NHS Scotland is paying to transport people daily almost 40 miles from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to have their operations at the temporary unit. One of the theatres in the hospital's general surgery suite has been shut because the health board cannot find enough trained nurses to safely provide treatment there.

Texto completo: Thankful for SCAD's impact on downtown life
While the Habersham School is moving to a brand-new campus on Chatham Parkway next year, we will look fondly on our years in downtown Savannah, where the city was our classroom and students could be found reading their Dante and Dostoevsky in the shade of our many squares.
In a recent conversation with one of our art teachers, Jared Seff, I realized what we will miss most about downtown - what Savannah has that no other American city can offer: the flagship campus of the Savannah College of Art and Design.
"When we're downtown, the presence of SCAD - students, bikes, buildings, construction, and art displayed seemingly everywhere - constantly reinforces that we are participating in a culture of art and creativity that is larger than ourselves and not confined inside any walls," he said.
The SCAD Museum of Art, Ex Libris Bookstore, the numerous SCAD galleries and exhibitions, festivals and live theater productions, and other learning events and environments have made Savannah an educator's paradise.
Habersham students have competed in the SCAD Sand Arts and Sidewalk Arts Festivals, attended demonstrations led by SCAD students and faculty, hosted SCAD professors on our own campus for talks and lectures, visited many exhibitions and installations at the SCAD Museum of Art and other SCAD galleries, and toured SCADstory. By the way, if you haven't seen SCADstory, you must go. So unexpected and brilliant.
As I reflect on the Habersham School's success and growth since its founding only seven short years ago, I want to express gratitude to SCAD for making Savannah a city known not just for history and beauty but also for invention and discovery. As we're fond of saying at Habersham, where goodness and truth exist, there you will find beauty.

Administration ignores climate damages
Authoritative sources have revealed a compelling reason for taking quick action to curb climate disruption. They report that climate threats to human survival on Earth are more imminent than previously predicted.
A New York Times article, citing recent coverage in Scientific American, describes extensive on-the-ground evidence that damages caused by our overheating climate are already far beyond the predictions previously made by most climate scientists.
For instance, in all human existence there has never been so little glacial ice on Earth - for hundreds of thousands of years. Across the globe, temperatures have registered so many record-breaking highs that dangers expected no sooner than mid-century are already occurring.
Compounding this alarming record of accelerated damages caused by the climate crisis are reckless, defiant political responses where leadership in Washington is now dismantling both well-established environmental protections of air and water as well as emerging efforts taken to reduce the causes of climate change - the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs).
Over the past five years alone, events linked to climate disruption suffered by Americans caused more than a trillion dollars in damage, unparalleled and unprecedented - primarily due to wildfire and major storms. Each year, hundreds of billions of dollars in harms have been incurred, and full recovery is often impossible.
Yet, U.S. officials continue budgeting billions annually in subsidizing the fossil-fuel industry, the primary cause of dangerous overheating trends, now confirmed to be accelerating. Similarly, billions in federal funds continue being foolishly spent on development and redevelopment in high-risk areas vulnerable to growing climate-driven disasters.
Meanwhile, financial institutions have issued well-founded precautions about avoiding such risks. A member of the Federal Reserve recently warned that climate impacts pose a significant threat to the financial stability and welfare of millions of Americans living in harm's way

Rep. Carter questionnaire draws response
I believe Rep. Buddy Carter to be a good congressman in most ways and I think he cares about his constituents.
Yet it is disingenuous for Carter to ask for my opinion when he has clearly made up his mind. He doesn't care what I think about the impeachment process. Otherwise, he would not describe his view of it as "shocking" before ever asking my opinion and he would not have worded a recent questionnaire such that anyone who answered "no" would seem to be saying they cared nothing about the American people. How can Carter hope to find truth if he frames the world the way he framed that question?
I do care about America, Republicans, Democrats and everything in between and I know Carter does, too. I implore him to care with a more open mind. Perhaps this process is proceeding as it should. Our president clearly broke the law. At a minimum, this needs to be acknowledged and atoned for. I can read, I don't need a talking head to tell me what to think and what I think is that the transcript released by the White House was an unintentional admission of guilt.
What I found shocking was that they actually released such self-incriminating evidence. I don't think they knew that they had broken the law and that makes me more afraid of who isn't minding the store than who is.
I understand why Carter thinks the policies of our president are beneficial. But there are limits to the breaches of law and of morality that we can suffer in support of any person or policy. The end does not justify the means. No one is above the law.

Senators show double standard on impeachment
For Sens. Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell and many of the other Republicans who voted for articles of impeachment inquiry or conviction during the trial of President Bill Clinton, lying about extramarital sex to the American people was an impeachable offense. These same senators now find nothing wrong with President Donald Trump's lying, obstructionist tactics, and walking all over the Constitution. Sen. Graham in 1999 said, "Impeachment is not about punishment but is about cleansing and restoring integrity to the office." Graham now: "The Democrats have lost their minds to want to impeach President Trump". Sen. McConnell had similar views in 1999 and the same today as Graham. Republicans talked about the rule of law in 1999 and that even the president was not above the law. I assume that they feel that it's OK with Trump lying, walking on the Constitution, and doing whatever he wants to do or say because they feel he's just being Trump.
When President Trump said that he was above the law, that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street and nothing would happen, his party should've straightened him out at that time. If nothing else they could have told him that if he does something unethical or illegal, that he would be held accountable. The Republican congressmen seem to be afraid of President Trump.
I never thought I would see the day when we would hold our professional athletes to a higher standard than we hold our president. Our Congressman Buddy Carter should be about upholding the Constitution and letting the truth come out good or bad.
The one thing for sure is that the truth will come out now or later. Later might be worse for a former President Trump. That, he should be assured.

Texto completo: Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border - the one he swore Mexico would pay for - has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as eight.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
- In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
- In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library's request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, "Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
- In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, "I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds."
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books - and bodies - into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual - and emotional - separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom - for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Texto completo: Provo • For the last 41 years, Leah Scharp thought her older sister Marla had been killed by notorious serial killer Henry Lee Lucas.
That belief, like her sister’s untimely death, was a hard truth to swallow, but knowing the person responsible for the slaying had been caught gave her some sense of justice.
That all changed last month, when Karra Porter with the Utah Cold Case Coalition presented the Scharps with a thick stack of investigative files and a PowerPoint presentation that convinced them Marla’s death couldn’t have been committed by Lucas.
The Provo Police Department was apparently similarly persuaded. They have reopened the case, Porter announced Saturday outside police headquarters — and she called for departments in 27 other states where Lucas confessed to murders to reopen their cases, too.
“Because every case that Henry Lee Lucas falsely confessed to is a cold case,” Porter said. “It really has not been solved.”
Lucas had confessed to hundreds of murders, but later recanted, The New York Times reported at the time of his death in 2001. Many of those cases were never reopened.
The Times reported that Lucas “attributed the confessions to a steady diet of tranquilizers, steaks, hamburgers and milkshakes fed to him by investigators, along with crime scene clues that he said he had parroted back to detectives.”
One of the cases he confessed to was the June 29, 1978, rape and murder of Marla Scharp, 26.
Marla Scharp, a former BYU student, lived in a Provo house with roommates, but on that June day, she found herself alone for about half an hour. That’s when the assailant struck.
Police closed the case in 1984 when Lucas confessed. But in looking through the investigative file, Porter came across evidence that she thinks proves that Lucas couldn’t have killed Scharp.
For one, all the information Lucas knew about the case were details that had been given to him by police. Lucas himself admits this in a letter he wrote to the “people of Provo," saying, “I never killed the [Scharp] girl.” He said he was in Maryland that year and that police played a “guessing game” with him about the facts of the case until he got them “straight.”
Porter provided a copy of the letter to The Salt Lake Tribune and other media.
Second, Porter said, police found forensic evidence at the scene that she says Lucas couldn’t have produced.
Now, more than four decades after Marla Scharp was killed, her family members are again trying to find the person who did it. Leah Scharp said she just wants to know the truth.
“I don’t believe in closure, because for something like this, there is no closure. You don’t get any closure for something like this," Leah Scharp said, "But somebody killed my sister and they need to be brought to justice.”
The revelation that Lucas may not have killed Marla Scharp didn’t come as a surprise to some in the family, Leah Scharp said.
Marla’s brother Craig Scharp said he never thought Lucas was responsible. Leah Scharp’s two daughters also had doubts.
The family says they’re confident the police will get to the bottom of the case, and are thankful investigators were willing to reopen it.
“What Henry Lucas did by claiming that he had murdered these people is he stopped these investigations, and that’s a horrible thing,” Craig Scharp said. “So by the Provo police being willing to reopen this — that’s huge.”
At the Saturday news conference, Porter presented a piece of evidence that was found at the murder scene, hoping it could jog some people’s memories: a unique Budweiser beer tap.
She said the 6-inch tall tap was found at the homicide scene, and that it was very unlikely it belonged to Marla Scharp or her roommates.
Anyone with information can call Provo police at 801-852-6210.

Going solo lets you explore at your pace

Texto completo: November is National Adoption Awareness Month. Journalist, author and adoptee, Seth Berkman, got a taste of his birth country when the New York Times sent him to report on the United Korean women's hockey team. Consisting of players from North and South Korea, select players trained and competed together as teammates at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Berkman's coverage spurred him to write "A Team of Their Own: How an International Sisterhood Made Olympic History" (Hanover Square Press, $19.99).
An edited version of our conversation follows.
Q: How have your trips for work shaped how you travel?
A: Traveling for work has been one of the privileges of my job. In particular, traveling to smaller cities in America is always intriguing. I often find that it's helpful to capture the ethos of a location, to learn about the subject I'm reporting on. Environment can critically shape who we are. I also enjoy going running in new places. I find that's a great way to explore the intricate nooks of somewhere new.
Q: Where have you been to that you'd like to return to explore further?
A: Seoul. I was born in Seoul, then adopted at a very young age. I didn't go back until February 2018 for the Winter Olympics. I was so busy with work duties on that trip and follow-up reporting trips, I feel like I really haven't had a chance to get to know the city where I was born.
Q: What is your favorite vacation destination?
A: Vienna, Austria. I was lucky enough to live in Vienna for a few months on a fellowship and have immensely enjoyed going back. The city is a wonderful combination of old Europe and new style, which can be seen in their abundance of museums.
Q: What untapped destination should people know about?
A: Fukushima city, Japan. In the fall of 2017, I traveled to Fukushima to report on their preparation for hosting events at the 2020 Olympics (in Tokyo). While many parts of Fukushima are still uninhabitable after the 2011 (nuclear) disaster, the city of Fukushima is a great destination. Not only are there numerous onsens (hot springs) and great local restaurants, there is resonance in the sincerity of the residents and their hopes for more tourism and to change the perception that all of Fukushima is a permanently damaged area.
Q: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?
A: I really like to travel alone, because it gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace. I have cultivated some memorable friendships with people I've randomly met on the road, who I probably wouldn't have talked to or bothered to spend the time to get to know if I encountered them in New York. The city hardens you in a way that is not conducive to the best of human nature, so it's important to remember to let down my guard when I'm traveling.
Q: Where are your favorite weekend getaways?
A. I'm not a real weekend getaway person, but I do enjoy jogging in Central Park or running alongside the Hudson River. Go early, though, because these paths become too crowded later in the day.
Q: What is your best vacation memory?
A: On one of my first days in Seoul in February 2018, I randomly met up with a friend of a friend, who showed me around the city and had me run a lot of errands with her. It was a great way to explore. We ended the night in Itaewon until about five in the morning. She's an Olympic athlete and this was like a week before the Games began, so I'll keep her name confidential.

Texto completo: His biographer notes that "every Supreme Court Justice who served at least five years since 1966 mentioned Friendly by name in an opinion, a remarkable nineteen. Justices of all persuasions respected him." The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts clerked for Judge Friendly in 1979.
Henry J. Friendly was 16 when he entered Harvard. He had skipped three grades in school and was the valedictorian for the Class of 1919 at Elmira Free Academy.
Not only was he first in his class, editor in chief of the school newspaper, a member of the student council and a member of the Class Song and Motto Committee, but when he graduated, he had the highest score of any student in the 55-year history of the New York State Regents examinations.
According to author David Dorsen, Friendly excelled at Harvard as well, graduating summa cum laude, with a B in a physical training course the only deviation from straight A's.
From Dorsen's book "Henry Friendly, Greatest Judge of His Era":
"At Harvard, Friendly realized the high quality of his Elmira education. 'I looked at the elementary course in English, and it didn't seem to me I'd learn very much from it that I hadn't already learned.' He found he could take an 'anticipatory examination,' which if he passed, would obviate the need to take the course and if he failed would not count against him. 'I was told there was absolutely no chance that that was only for boys who had gone to Exeter and Andover, and places like that, and very few of them get excused. Well I took it and I got excused. So apparently the English instruction in Elmira had been pretty good.'"
Henry Jacob Friendly, born in Elmira on July 3, 1903, was the son of Myer H. and Leah Friendly, and the grandson of Henry and Lena Friendly.
His home was 411 W. Church St. His father was a businessman who owned Friendly Boot and Shoe Co., which was started by Myer's uncle on Baldwin Street. Myer Friendly became president of the company after his uncle retired but later moved to the mortgage business as the shoe business faded.
The Friendlys were members of the High Street Temple, a reformed congregation within the Elmira Jewish community. While Myer and Leah were not particularly observant, Henry's namesake, his grandfather, was a leader in the Jewish community.
According to his obituary published Feb. 23, 1910 in the Star Gazette, "Each of the Elmira synagogues has felt his helping hand when a mortgage was personally lifted by him — mere divergence of a few ideas of worship making no difference in his generous nature."
According to his biographer, when young Friendly was admitted to Harvard, he was ready to leave Elmira. He told an interviewer, "We didn't have a very close family."
During World War I, as a young teenager, he gave speeches and sold war bonds in the towns around Elmira. He preferred reading and long walks to developing friendships.
An illustration of his earnestness as a youth was told by Judge Morris Lasker, whose stepfather grew up in Elmira. It seems Dr. Ben Levy, from Elmira, visited Lasker in Manhattan. Lasker asked him if he would like to meet Friendly, who was also from Elmira. Levy replied, "Hell no. When I was growing up, all I would hear from my mother was, that is not the way Henry Friendly would do it." (Dorsen)
It is noteworthy that at the end of Friendly's junior year at Harvard, President A. Lawrence Lowell proposed limiting the number of Jews to be admitted. His rationale: "There had been a gradual increase in the number of Jewish students ... that was as high as it should get ... it wasn't going to be good for Christian students and it wasn't going to be good for Jewish students."
He believed that Harvard could only survive if it had a majority of old American stock. Antisemitism was very much alive.
According to Friendly, "All hell broke loose." Friendly vowed to leave the school if the policy was not rejected, which it was.
Future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, then a professor at Harvard Law School, became a mentor for Friendly.
When Friendly graduated from Harvard Law, with what in effect was an A++ average, the first ever summa cum laude graduate, Frankfurter described him as "by long odds one of the ablest lawyers who came out of the Harvard Law School in my time."
Upon leaving law school, Friendly served as a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. After the clerkship, he entered private practice in 1928, becoming a Wall Street lawyer. He was a founding partner of the Cleary Gottlieb Law Firm and became the full-time general counsel for Pan Am Airways. He worked on bankruptcies, argued before the Supreme Court and even negotiated for Pan Am with Howard Hughes to purchase planes.
On Sept. 4, 1930, he married Sophie Stern, of Philadelphia. They settled in New York City and raised three children.
Friendly was in private practice for 31 years until he was appointed to the Second Circuit Court of New York by President Eisenhower in 1959.
His career on the federal court would be one of distinction.
After the 1968 election, he was mentioned in newspapers along with Warren Burger as a potential nominee for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. His name was raised again for Justice in May of 1969 (with the resignation of Abe Fortas) and in 1971.
Space does not allow for reviewing the significant cases in his career, but his biographer notes that "every Supreme Court Justice who served at least five years since 1966 mentioned Friendly by name in an opinion, a remarkable nineteen. Justices of all persuasions respected him."
The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts clerked for Judge Friendly in 1979.
In 1977, Judge Friendly received the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, from President Ford.
Friendly observed in the Star-Gazette on Jan. 4, 1977: "I don't know much about the award, but I was at the White House once before and they had excellent food."
Sadly, Friendly became very depressed after the passing of his wife, Sophie. On March 10, 1986, exactly one year after her memorial service, he died by suicide. He was 82.
In his obituary in the New York Times, Chief Judge Feinberg of the Second Circuit called Friendly "one of the greatest Federal judges in the history of the bench."
His biographer notes that "every Supreme Court Justice who served at least five years since 1966 mentioned Friendly by name in an opinion, a remarkable nineteen. Justices of all persuasions respected him." The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts clerked for Judge Friendly in 1979.

Texto completo: Pitch seems designed to assuage worries about a more radical approach
WAVERLY, Iowa " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) pitched her new, more flexible approach to government-run health care during a town hall here Saturday afternoon as her campaign tries to move beyond an issue that's mired her for weeks.
Under her proposal, outlined Friday, all Americans would be eligible to participate in Medicare, but it would not be mandatory. Warren said she'd push a full-fledged Medicare-for-all bill through Congress later in her first term.
'I want to do it early, early, early,' Warren told a crowd of nearly 600 at Wartburg College in northeastern Iowa. 'There are millions of people right now who are struggling to pay their medical bills. Let's get them in the door.'
Her new pitch also seems designed to assuage voters worried that her earlier approach would force 150 million people off their private insurance. Her ability to sell this new plan " and refocus her campaign on her larger message of reform " will be a key test for her candidacy.
The toll on her campaign is particularly apparent here in Iowa, where a new poll by the Des Moines Register and CNN released Saturday night showed Warren in a three-way tie for second place with former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), while South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg surged ahead of the pack. The poll shows Buttigieg with 25 percent support and Warren, Biden and Sanders all with about 15 percent support.
Before this most recent poll, an average of five statewide polls since October showed Warren at 20 percent support among likely Democratic caucus-goers, Biden at 18 percent, Buttigieg at 17-percent and Sanders at 16 percent, with other candidates averaging 4 percent or less.
Warren has struggled to outline a plan for health care, saying earlier this month that she supports Sanders's Medicare-for-all plan but would pay for it differently.
On Friday, she announced she will push Congress to pass legislation that allows all Americans to opt into the existing Medicare program in her first 100 days in office and take executive actions even sooner to lower the price of prescription drugs.
She wouldn't push for full-blown Medicare-for-all until the third year of her term.
That has prompted Sanders to adjust, adding a line to his stump speech that contrasts Warren's approach to his.
'Today I tell you that on our first week in office, we are going to introduce Medicare-for-all single-payer legislation,' he said Saturday in East Los Angeles.
Polls consistently show that Iowa Democrats say health care is their top issue and also that many Democrats have conflicted views about Medicare-for-all.
A recent New York Times-Siena College poll found that over 7 in 10 likely caucusgoers support 'a single-payer health care system, which would abolish private insurance and provide every American with a government health insurance.'
But the same poll also found that more Democrats prefer a candidate who 'promises to improve the existing health insurance system' rather than 'replace the current health care system with Medicare-for-all.'
Several who attended Warren's town hall Saturday were relieved by her new approach.
'I like the shift,' said Elizabeth Texley, 43, of Cedar Rapids. Texley works with seniors and hasn't yet decided who she will support in the upcoming caucuses.
'The goal of Medicare-for-all is great,' she said. 'But I don't think you're going to be able to get everybody on board right now.'
Warren's new proposal, Texley added, 'does make it easier to support her.'
Kristina Burroughes, 28, said she wants Medicare-for-all to happen quickly but believes Warren's adjustment is smart strategy. 'It's walking into it instead of diving,' Burroughes said as she waited in line for a photo with the candidate.
In Iowa, Warren also tried to explain how her new plan differs from the proposal laid out by Buttigieg. Her plan, she argued, would get more people on government insurance for less money.
'Mine is about actually giving people Medicare-for-all that is going to be full health-care coverage,' she said when asked about the differences. 'I'm going to bring in as many people as we can right at the beginning.'
Sean Savett, a spokesman for Buttigieg, said that the Buttigieg plan preserves private insurance for those who want it. ' Pete's plan would also achieve universal health care coverage,' he said. 'But unlike Senator Warren, he wouldn't kick tens of millions of American families off their private health care plans because he trusts the American people to choose what's right for them.'
But some voters didn't detect a large difference between the two " aside from timing.
'She's a week late for me,' said Conni Miller, 59 of Waverly, who came to Warren's town hall even though she just committed to support Buttigieg largely because of his heath-care plan.
A key part of Warren's gambit is to remain close enough to Sanders's plan so that his voters would, at some point, support her. But among Sanders's supporters gathered Saturday afternoon, there was deep skepticism.
'I think it's terrible,' said Eduardo Barrio, 23, of San Bernardino, Calif. 'She's not going to be fighting for it.'
'There's a gap [between] them,' he added. 'She's clearly the second-best option, but why have the copy when you can have the OG?'

A case of senioritis

Texto completo: For the Valley News
I am 66 years old, a “young” senior. I would not even consider running for president of these United States. The logistics wouldn’t work. State dinners would have to end before dark. I don’t much like to drive, even in motorcades, after the sun sets.
Also, I couldn’t forswear watching Jeopardy!, which starts nightly at 7. On the dot.
If I felt like napping and the world was falling apart at the seams, I would take my nap. Russia can wait.
I am not infirmed, but taking on the labors of the so-called Leader of the Free World would be a stretch. At 66, even stretches are a stretch. When I flop on the floor and try to touch my toes without bending my knees, my toes mock me from afar. But so what? You can live a rich life without touching your toes like a yogi. Just say to hell with it and bend your knees.
I have been limbering up in this column until we reach the main point: I am surprised — no, make that amazed — at the advanced age of many of our presidential candidates. I do not question their capacities, though I peek for signs of decline, just as you would inspect an old home for dry rot, bad wiring or bat infestations. We did that insufficiently in 2016.
Our current president (I won’t mention his name since it may be a trigger for some Upper Valley residents) will be 74 on election day 2020. By my math, if the Electoral College once again works its magic and overrules the popular vote, he would be about 78 at the end of a second term. Even if you like his policies, you have to admit that there’s a fair chance that our chief executive in his latter days could be spending his evenings ranting at Fox News in his underwear (notable only if that’s not already the case).
The Democratic candidates offer diversity in age. Babyface Buttigieg, aka Mayor Pete, is 37, born the same year I started working at the Valley News. When I retired at 65, I told a similarly aged colleague that I could still put in a good eight hours, but any more and I would droop. After 5 p.m, it took me two hours to do one hour’s work. Double shift? Only if I was in bed.
Bernie Sanders, whom I admire for his zeal and authentic outrage, is 78 and just had a heart attack. Joe Biden is 76 and looks it. (That’s not to say that “electability” doesn’t make him look 10 years younger to me.) Billionaire Michael Bloomberg might jump into the fray. He’s 77. Elizabeth Warren is a comparatively youthful — seriously, she looks pretty vigorous for her age — 70. If this was a half-mile footrace, I’d put my money on her.
I am not saying they are absolutely too old, but 70 is kind of late to be starting a new job, especially one that calls for forward thinking. Even in my early elderhood the past is calling to me more and more. The kids can fret about artificial intelligence. I’m going to watch another World War II documentary. Kanye West? I’m listening to Crosby, Stills and Nash sing Suite: Judy Blue Eyes for the seven millionth time. I see a classic car from the ’60s roll down Main Street and I am transported. No seatbelts, no problem. You don’t need them on the highway of dreams.
Of course older people can accomplish great things. A story in ARTNews ran under the headline, “Artists who are going strong at 80 and up find that old age offers freedom, self-assurance, and room to explore.” Michelangelo apparently hardly missed a beat before he died in his late 80s. Monet and Mattisse were hot tickets in their 80s as well. My painting has also improved as I’ve aged, but mostly because I’ve finally learned to use blue tape for edging.
All kidding aside, at 66 I sense changes in my outlook on life and work. They are not fatalistic, but realistic. Last year we put a new 25-year roof on our house and I thought, next time it’s someone else’s problem. Comedian George Burns, who was funny well into his ’90s, used to say, “At my age, I don’t even buy green bananas.”
Speaking of them, I am now working in a part-time job where I am happily a second banana. It seems to me that after a certain age the emphasis should not be on climbing the ladder but holding it steady for someone else. Share your wisdom — after all, you have tested out many bad ideas through the years. No need to see them repeated.
The New York Times reported this week that Bernie Sanders is taking better care of himself. He’s walking more and ordering nutritious dishes and salads. I recently found out I’ve got some sludge in a cardiac fuel line (not an actual medical diagnosis) and need to do the same. Hello diets and statins. So long Ben & Jerry’s.
As for me, I would not run for president. I would not walk for president. I would not amble, stroll or saunter. Let the burdens of the future be carried by a younger generation – they are the ones who will have to live in it.
Now should come the softer, slower, healthy season of hummus and spinach for people my age — and, I might add, our elders.

Texto completo: The coveted Cortaca Jug will boldly go where it has never gone before.
Neither Jim Butterfield Stadium nor SUNY Cortland Stadium will host the annual game between Ithaca College and SUNY Cortland this season.
The Division III football rivals with campuses about 20 miles apart in central New York are hitting the road this year to play at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Kickoff is 1 p.m. Saturday.
Here are 10 things to know about the Cortaca Jug:
It'll be a record The largest crowd to see a Division III football game is 37,355. That happened Sept. 23, 2017, when Minnesota rivals St. Thomas and St. John's played at Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins.
As of about two weeks ago, more than 42,500 tickets had been sold for the Cortaca Jug, Ithaca College Athletic Director Susan Bassett said.
"We've probably expanded a lot of peoples' imagination at this point," Bassett said. "For Division III to have this kind of showcase and this type of interest, everyone thinks it's all about professional sports and Division I sports, but this really sets the bar for interest in Division III athletics."
Doing the math Ithaca and Cortland have been playing for the Jug since 1959, with the Bombers holding a 37-24 lead in Jug games.
But their first football game came in 1930, a 12-0 Cortland victory.
They played 16 times before the first Cortaca Jug. Ithaca leads the overall series, 41-33-3.
The teams played twice in 1988, the Red Dragons winning the Cortaca Jug game, 21-20. Three weeks later they met in an NCAA quarterfinal and the Bombers won, 24-17.
It's more than football Ithaca will be sending 16 buses to New Jersey, many carrying student spectators as well as others who participate in the event.
The Bombers' choir will sing the national anthem, cheer teams will accompany both teams, Ithaca's West African Drumming and Dance Ensemble will perform and students from IC's school of sports management will organize pre-game events
"It's beyond this being a football game," Bassett said. "There are multiple ways people are involved. It's multi-faceted and comprehensive."
Media interest Cortland AD Mike Urtz said he's done interviews with the New York Times and Forbes Magazine in the lead up to the game.
"Our campus is getting unbelievable exposure," he said. "This is probably my fourth interview. When you look at the free marketing and free branding for both institutions, it's been incredible."
Local talent While Cortland and Ithaca are located in Section III and Section IV, respectively, both teams have their share of Section V talent.
For Cortland, senior quarterback and Webster Schroeder graduate Brett Segala headlines the Rochester-area talent.
Segala has started each of the Red Dragons games the past two seasons and has a total of 2,362 yards and 21 touchdowns to 6 interceptions on 164-for-275 passing this season.
Joining Brett Segala are younger brother and fellow Webster Schroeder grad, sophomore Brees Segala, freshman quarterback Jack Johnston from Canandaigua and sophomore running back Dom Gombetto out of Fairport.
Freshman linebackers Jair Ford (Fairport) and Alex Testa (Greece Arcadia), as well as junior defensive lineman Roman Simmons (Brighton) are the Section V alums who help make up the Cortland defense.
The Red Dragons coaching staff also has area ties in assistant coach (Special Teams Coordinator/Tight Ends) Jake Spalik.
Spalik played wide receiver for, graduated from and coached at The College at Brockport, finishing as the Golden Eagles all-time leader in receiving yards for a career and receptions for a career, season and single game.
For Ithaca, the local talent is spread across all three facets of the game and is highlighted by running back, kickoff return specialist and Canandaigua alum, sophomore AJ Clifford.
Clifford leads the Bombers with 23 kickoff returns and 553 yards for a 24.04 average and long of 44 yards.
Other Ithaca players hailing from Section V are sophomore wide receiver Jacob Cooney (Webster Thomas), sophomore linebacker Patrick Bowes (Penfield), freshman offensive lineman Jacob Cole (Pittsford) and freshman tight end Jon Crowley (Victor).
Downstate interest Bassett and Urtz said a major reason ticket sales have been so brisk is the large number of downstate graduates from both schools.
"The alumni gatherings to watch the game down in the city, they were getting larger and larger," Urtz said. "Within the last two years, there were two bar/restaurants in New York City somewhere, one of them hosted Cortland and the other hosted Ithaca and they were across the street and they each had more than 1,000 people just to watch the game. I knew we were going to have a pretty good draw."
Tickets They're still available, plenty of them. If you're looking to go and you're a fan of perusing online ticket sites such as stubhub or ticketmaster, you can find tickets for as low as $20 or as expensive as $500.
Might happen again Bassett said given the interest this year's game has drawn, she wouldn't be surprised if the Cortaca Jug returned to the NYC area in the future.
"We look at this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Bassett said. "At some point is it possible our campus leadership would say, 'Let's do this every four years and we'll alternate who the host team is.' I just have no idea. We haven't gotten that far yet. We're so focused on this experience.
"If you had a couple years to plan, I think this would be so much easier for everybody, but this is all coming together nicely."
What can you bring If you're heading to the game, here's what you can bring:
Clear bags that are 12-by-6-by-12 inches or less in size (one bag per person); small purses/handbags (clutch-type bags) that are 41/2-by-61/2 or less in size (one per person); food of any kind that is contained in a clear plastic bag; plastic bottles of water or soft drinks that are 20 ounces or less; cameras with a lens that is 6 inches or less in length; jackets, blankets or other items, which will be patted down or searched; official national flags that can reasonably be hand held by a single person.
What can't you bring Don't bring these items:
Seat cushions of any size except those for medical needs; glass bottles, cans, coolers of any kind, thermoses or ice chests; alcohol of any kind; banners of any size; flags that are not the official flag of a country; umbrellas, strollers, laser pointers and balls of any kind; video cameras or still photography cameras with a lens longer than six inches; selfie sticks; weapons or any item that may be used as a projectile or one that is deemed dangerous by stadium management; any animal aside from service animals; any item deemed inappropriate by stadium management.

Texto completo: ['DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB' (1964), BY STANLEY KUBRICK]
Unlike several of his peers in the ranks of great American filmmakers, such as John Ford and George Stevens, Stanley Kubrick never wore a uniform in service to his country. "I slipped through the cracks each time," said Kubrick, who was born in 1928, in an interview with film critic Gene Siskel in 1987. "I was 17 when World War II ended and was married when the Korean war began."
Yet the filmmaker's civilian status did not discourage him from considering war as a subject throughout his career. Among his first four films, two were stirring antiwar jeremiads: his debut, "Fear and Desire" (1953), and the powerfully poetic "Paths of Glory" (1957). By 1987, when he made his Vietnam War drama "Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick had shifted from the spirited outrage of those early efforts to a more nuanced view accounting for the thrill of battle. "'Full Metal Jacket' suggests that there is more to say about war than it is just bad," Kubrick told Siskel.
Fifty-five years ago, however, Kubrick decided that the most pertinent thing to say about war was that it could be funny -- very, very funny. In 1964, Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," which comically repurposed the basic scenario of Peter George's 1958 novel "Red Alert."
With a cast of characters including googly-eyed military officials, feeble politicos and a gluttonous Russian ambassador, "Dr. Strangelove" surely carries the patina of the Cold War, but its scorching satire, in which all sides of the debate are sent up, remains as perennially invigorating as Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal."
Co-scripted by Kubrick, George and Terry Southern, the film unbalances the viewer from the first scene at Burpelson Air Force Base, where Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), in an effort to advance his anti-Communist agenda, has single-handedly set into motion a nuclear strike against the U.S.S.R. Most comedies would present the certifiably cuckoo Gen. Ripper as an outlier, but Kubrick doesn't find too much virtue -- or even common sense -- in the characters who surround him, including several played by Peter Sellers.
One of Sellers's characters is relatively sympathetic -- Royal Air Force Capt. Lionel Mandrake, who fruitlessly endeavors to bring Gen. Ripper back from the brink -- but beyond that, the actor was asked to represent the extremes of nuclear-age cluelessness and recklessness.
As President Merkin Muffley, Sellers effortlessly embodies the soft-headed squareness of a generation of left-of-center politicians. Muffley -- whose bald-headed, professorial appearance and singsong, schoolmarmish manner are surely meant to recall Democratic presidential contender Adlai Stevenson -- makes futile appeals to reason and order in dealing with the crisis. "Gentlemen, you can't fight in here -- this is the War Room," he says as he tries to settle the squabbles of his advisers, including Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), a red-blooded chewing-gum fan who carries with him a binder outrageously labeled: "World Targets in Megadeaths."
Meanwhile, as the inconsistently wheelchair-bound title character, Sellers brings to life a scientist even madder than Gen. Ripper in his suggestion that the pending global cataclysm -- unstoppable when it's revealed that the U.S.S.R.'s counterattack is automatic -- might not be all bad for the survivors who cluster in mine shafts.
In its equitable distribution of satirical targets, the film proved popular in unlikely quarters -- including with military brass. In Peter Bogdanovich's 1999 New York Times oral history of Kubrick, John Milius recalled that Kubrick had been approached by higher-ups at the Strategic Air Command after the film was released. "He was afraid they'd be angry with him -- that they would do something to him," Milius said. "I said, 'Stanley, how can you have been that paranoid? They wanted to honor you. They loved "Dr. Strangelove."'"
Indeed, Kubrick places a pox on the houses of both the hawks and the doves. Each group founders in failing to halt Gen. Ripper, whose rise to power serves as the sober warning at the heart of the film. As Kubrick said in an interview with Playboy in 1968, "The serious threat remains that a psychotic figure somewhere in the modern command structure could start a war." Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor gives the film a subtle, sometimes documentary-like camera style that belies the jokey character names and one-liners; the film looks authentic even when the story turns preposterous or apocalyptic.
Following the failure to fully nullify the general's order, the final scene presents a wave of presumably earth-annihilating nuclear explosions against Vera Lynn singing "We'll Meet Again." Yet, in declining to back down from the darkest implications of its plot, "Dr. Strangelove" today seems sharper and less mawkish than such earnest antinuclear films as "On the Beach" (1959) and "Fail-Safe" (1964).
Kubrick believed he was doing humanity a service in making a comedy that wraps up with the world as we know it blasted and burned. Speaking with Playboy, the director reflected: "A recognition of insanity doesn't imply a celebration of it -- nor a sense of despair and futility about the possibility of curing it."

Texto completo: Dartmouth should kill the biomass plan once and for all
The biomass project at Dartmouth College lurks. Despite known deficiencies, college officials waffle about biomass as part of the college’s energy future. Emboldened supporters (mostly woodlot owners and foresters) relentlessly flog this project while scoffing at those who oppose it. Some facts the supporters don’t want to mention:
In a recent New Yorker article, Bill McKibben, a world-renowned environmentalist and the Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College, warned of the dangers of biomass.
In a 2017 commentary on VTDigger, Hans Ohanian of Burlington, a physicist and adjunct professor at the University of Vermont, wrote of the Middlebury College biomass plant: “my own number-crunching tells me that this heating plant is horse (manure) rolled in sugar and sold as doughnuts.”
In an Aug. 9 Valley News opinion column, (“Dartmouth’s planned biomass plant would only make things worse”), George Woodwell, a 1950 Dartmouth graduate and founder of the Woods Hole Research Center; William Schlesinger, Dartmouth ’72 and dean emeritus of Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment; and John Sterman, Dartmouth ’77 and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of its Sustainability Initiative, wrote: “We urge the college to avoid making a heavy investment in a mistaken assumption that a wood-fired heating plant will benefit the college or the world.”
On its own website, Dartmouth states: “To reach our long term, ambitious goals, we will likely have to transition away from generating heat with combustion, period.”
Temporizing about climate change is neither vision nor leadership. Vacillating about climate change is not an option for my grandchildren. Absolute clarity about this biomass project is essential. So let me propose the following: The college should plunge the “Green Initiative” flag into the heart of this biomass project and kill it once and for all.

All the news that’s fit ...
The board of commissioners in Citrus County, Fla., recently voted to deny the county library system’s request for funding for a digital subscription to The New York Times, with commissioners saying they support President Donald Trump and accusing the Times of printing “fake news.”
The Valley News has often presented articles and commentary that have been critical of the president. Is the Valley News producing “fake news”? Should the towns in the Upper Valley vote to remove the Valley News from their libraries?

Put the focus on sports
First off, congratulations to Hanover High School’s soccer and field hockey teams for winning their state championships. I commend the hard work, good sportsmanship, and fair and aggressive play all three teams demonstrated throughout the season.
This sports fan, however, is disappointed in the Valley News’ preference for depicting female athletes celebrating their wins rather than giving them the proper sports coverage they deserve.
While I wholeheartedly believe in the importance of being a supportive teammate, I would have rather seen a Valley News photo of field hockey goaltender Ella Edmonds saving a sick shot than of her receiving a kiss from a teammate. Reading about Pepper Joseph sprinting toward goal on a breakaway would have been more interesting to me than reading about her kissing and twirling around with the team’s trophy.
Please, Valley News, more action and less kissing in your sports section.

Texto completo: A new exhibition that opens Sunday at the Walker is a look at collecting, the expressive potential of the human body, and how different artists have portrayed the body, from Max Beckmann to Andy Warhol.
Curated by Joan Rothfuss, “The Expressionist Figure: The Miriam and Erwin Kelen Collection of Drawings” features some 100 works on paper by 73 artists. Most were recently donated to the Walker by the Kelens, who are longtime patrons. Rothfuss also included related drawings and sculpture from the Walker’s collection.
The show invites us to see the body in ways both familiar and new. Spanning more than a century of experimentation by artists working in the United States and Europe – the earliest drawing dates from 1900, the latest from 2018 – works include portraits, figure studies, social satire, narrative, fantasy and erotica. Media range from crayon, ink, and graphite to watercolor, pastel and collage. Along with Beckman and Warhol, artists include Jim Denomie, Henri Matisse, Christo, Pablo Picasso, Claes Oldenburg, David Hockney, Joan Miró, Egon Schiele, Zak Smith, and Edgar Degas.
“The Expressionist Figure” will be on view in the Walker’s Burnet Gallery through April 19, 2020. If you want to bring it home, there’s an exhibition catalog in the gift shop(s) with full-page color reproductions of each drawing, an essay by Erwin Kelen, an introduction by Rothfuss, along with her short essays on 14 of the works, and a foreword by the Walker’s new ED, Mary Ceruti.
On Jan. 30 at 6 p.m., you can tour the exhibition with Walker curatorial fellow William Hernandez-Luege for free. No tickets required, just show up.
The picks
Opens tonight (Friday, Nov. 15) at Theatre in the Round: “Agatha Christie’s Towards Zero.” As Park Square Theatre has a way with Sherlock Holmes, Theatre in the Round has a history with Christie. “Towards Zero” is its latest holiday toast to the Queen of Crime. Originally a novel (1944), it was adapted into a play (1956) by Christie and Gerald Verner. But only recently (2015) was it discovered that Christie had written her own adaptation for the stage. The theater at Seven Corners will present this version, directed by Wendy Resch Novak, who returns to TRP for her fourth Christie play. The setting is a clifftop manor on the English seaside, where a house party is interrupted by a brutal murder. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($22). Runs Fridays-Sundays through Dec. 15.
Saturday at MacPhail: MacPhail Spotlight Series: “Locally Sourced.” For an evening of Minnesota music and stories, artistic director Mischa Santora has promised a Prince cover. For the rest, composer Libby Larsen has set music to words by Minnesota and North Dakota poets; her “Jazz at the Intergalactic Nightclub” will be performed by tenor Dennis Peterson and pianist Timothy De Prey. Pina Basgöze and Susana Pinto will play a pair of piano duos by Greg Theisen, and Fred and J.D. Steele (of the famous Steeles) will share songs. 7:30 p.m. Preconcert talk at 6:30. FMI; for tickets ($25/15), call 612-767-5250.
Saturday at the O’Shaughnessy: “Band Together: An Event to Benefit Climate Generation.” We know, this comes right after Give to the Max, but dig into your pockets if you can. Hosted by Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy, this will be a night of music, storytelling and climate action. Featured performer and emcee Xiuhtezcatl, a 19-year-old indigenous rapper climate activist, will be joined by a strong lineup of Minnesota artists: Astralblak, Chastity Brown, Strong Buffalo, Chris Koza, Lazerbeak, Eric Mayson, Jeremy Messersmith, Lucy Michelle, Ben Weaver and Aby Wolf. Artist pre-party at 5:30, concert at 7. FMI and tickets ($55; with pre-party, $125).
Saturday and Sunday at the Ted Mann: University Opera Theatre Presents Peter Brook’s “Carmen’s Tragedy.” Every semester, students at the U of M present a fully-staged operatic production – no small feat. Brook’s “Carmen,” last seen here in a Feb. 2017 production by Skylark Opera, is shorter than Bizet’s, packing all the fire, intensity and emotion of the original (and the best music) into 90 minutes. David Walsh directs; Ho-Yin Kwok will conduct the chamber ensemble in this contemporary take on a classic tale. 7:30 p.m. Saturday, 1:30 p.m. Sunday. FMI and tickets ($26/15/7).
Sunday at the Dakota: The Jeremy Walker/Clara Osowski Quartet: Ellington + Originals: Jazz Art Song. Just over a year ago, award-winning mezzo-soprano Clara Osowski and jazz pianist and composer Jeremy Walker released their first album together, “Haunted Blue.” It was a new direction for both of them, and magical. They’re working on another project, using poems from Edna St. Vincent Millay, and exploring new arrangements of Duke Ellington favorites. And they’ve added drummer JT Bates to the mix, turning their trio with bassist Anthony Cox into a quartet. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($20).
Monday at Minneapolis Central Library: Talk of the Stacks: Carmen Maria Machado. Machado was a 2018 National Book Award finalist for her breakthrough story collection “Her Body and Other Parties,” published by Graywolf Press. That was a mix of horror, comedy, science fiction and fantasy the New York Times described as “a wild thing … covered in sequins and scales.” Just out from Graywolf, “In the Dream House” is her unconventional memoir, the story of an abusive relationship with a former girlfriend. Machado is a fast-rising literary star, so you might want to arrive early. 6:15 doors, 7 p.m. program. Overflow seating with live feed will be available. A book signing will follow. FMI.

Sen. Mike Lee says he’s co-chairman of Trump’s reelection effort after taking ‘scenic route’ to liking the president

Texto completo: Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who was sharply critical of Donald Trump in 2016 and withheld his vote from Trump in the last election, admits that he “took the scenic route” to becoming a fan of the nation’s 45th leader.
But he’s certainly arrived there now, with a Friday announcement that he will co-chair Trump’s reelection effort in Utah along with former Sen. Orrin Hatch and several others. Speaking at an event in the Utah Capitol — where second lady Karen Pence also made an appearance — Lee commended those who were quicker than he to embrace the president.
“Look, some of you in this room, some of you in our state were wise enough to see where this was heading a few years ago. You were quick and astute enough to see the gift that President Trump and Vice President Pence would be to the United States of America,” the Utah Republican said. “Some of us took a little bit more time.”
Lee cast what he previously called a “protest vote” for independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin in the 2016 general election. During that year’s campaign, he called for Trump to step down after release of the “Access Hollywood” tape and was critical of him for proposing a “religious test” in deciding to ban Muslims from entering the United States.
He also sided with “never Trump” delegates at the Republican National Convention, in a rowdy attempt to free pledged delegates to vote their consciences rather than being bound by results from their local primaries or caucuses. Speaking to reporters Friday, Lee said he never identified as a “never Trumper” and asserted that the convention rule-change effort was incorrectly portrayed by the media as an anti-Trump maneuver.
During his speech Friday, Lee said he was “not going to make any excuses” for his initial discomfort with Trump, but explained that he warmed to the president over time. He was unable to pinpoint the exact moment he changed his mind about Trump, instead referencing a period shortly after the 2016 elections when he and the president began to converse and develop an understanding. While the two don’t see eye to eye on every issue, the senator said they’ve found they agree more often than not.
Trump won Utah in 2016 without a majority, landing about 45% of the vote — the worst showing for a Republican presidential candidate in the state since 1992, when George H.W. Bush mustered just 41% after independent Ross Perot drained 26%.
Lee predicted in an interview that the incumbent president will perform better in Utah next year — and that the ongoing impeachment inquiry will only strengthen him.
“The Democrats have overreached on this. I think he’s been treated unfairly in the House,” Lee told reporters. “I think people throughout our state and many other places across the country will see that and people will be more sympathetic to him as a result.”
Pence also spoke at the event, which took place after she had filed paperwork to add Trump’s name to the Republican primary ballot next year.
Pence highlighted Trump’s appointment of conservative judges to the federal courts, his focus on religious rights and the nation’s low unemployment rates.
“Make no mistake about it: We are getting things done. America has the strongest economy in the history of the world,” Pence said.
Later, urging the roomful of supporters to contribute to Trump’s reelection effort, she said: “This election is about jobs, it’s about security and it’s about our liberties. We are winning under President Trump’s leadership, and to keep winning, we need four more years.”
Thomas Wright, national committeeman for the Utah GOP and a potential contender in state’s next gubernatorial contest, also spoke in glowing terms of the Trump administration during the kickoff of the president’s formal reelection bid in Utah. He credited the president for the “decimation of ISIS and just wiping them off the face of the Earth." (Analysts have said the recent death of the Islamic State’s leader in a U.S. raid will hurt the organization but will not eradicate it, The New York Times has reported.)
He also praised Trump’s judicial appointments.
“Is there any better accomplishment than Justice Gorsuch and Kavanaugh?” he said to loud applause.
In addition to Lee and Hatch, Trump’s Utah ground game will be led by U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, Utah Sen. President Stuart Adams, community leader Don Peay, policy leader Ron Fox and U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart — who serves on the House Intelligence Committee that is currently conducting an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Bloomberg will not save the Democrats

Resumen: "In a dramatic acknowledgment of his own late start in the race," the Times reported, "Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers have decided that he would pursue a risky strategy of skipping all four traditional early state contests ... and focus instead on big states that hold primaries soon afterward." Bloomberg predecessor Rudy Giuliani essentially tried it in the Republican contest in 2008, and by the time the first four primaries were over, voters barely remembered Giuliani was in the race. Recall the excitement and 24/7 media attention that precedes the Iowa caucuses, and then the shift to New Hampshire, and so on.

Every four years, Michael Bloomberg hears something virtually no other American hears: a groundswell of support for a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy. Now, as the 2020 Democratic primaries rapidly approach, he’s hearing it again.
Bloomberg, a fairly successful mayor of New York and a fabulously successful businessman, has an estimated net worth of $52 billion. Without that fortune, nobody would be talking about a Bloomberg candidacy at this late date. But with his money, Bloomberg could self-finance a run from start to finish without ever having to ask a single donor for a penny. That gives him freedom to float a would-be candidacy long after the field has been set.
This time, Bloomberg, who in his political life has been a Democrat, a Republican, an independent and now a Democrat again, is setting a personal record by flirting twice in a single cycle.
Last spring, there was a ripple of speculation about a 2020 Bloomberg candidacy. On March 5, Bloomberg put an end to it when he announced flatly, "I’m not running for president." Instead, he said, he would pour his energy and resources into a new climate change project called Beyond Carbon.
Now, however, he has apparently moved beyond Beyond Carbon. Last week, The New York Times reported that Bloomberg is "actively preparing to enter the Democratic presidential primary."
"Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to [defeat Trump]," Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson told the paper. "If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America’s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America’s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist."
Bloomberg is said to be concerned — and it is a legitimate concern — that the current Democratic field has moved too far left, embracing policies like Medicare for All, virtually open borders, free college and wealth taxes. That’s what Wolfson meant when he said the field is "not well positioned" to beat Trump.
But there is no indication that voters believe Bloomberg is the solution to the problem. This latest tease is too recent for any reliable polling — although one survey found Bloomberg with the highest negatives in the field — but in the past, he has never been a voter favorite outside the confines of New York City.
Bloomberg is being pressed into action by states with early primary filing deadlines. He has already placed his name on the ballot for the Alabama primary, and a short time later flew to Arkansas to file there.
Alabama and Arkansas are fine, but what about Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — the first states to cast votes and award delegates? Bloomberg has apparently decided to blow them off.
"In a dramatic acknowledgment of his own late start in the race," the Times reported, "Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers have decided that he would pursue a risky strategy of skipping all four traditional early state contests ... and focus instead on big states that hold primaries soon afterward."
Instead of "risky strategy," one might substitute "crazy strategy." Candidates in the past have sometimes tried to skip an early primary or caucus, but skipping all four at the beginning is a sure way to lose. Bloomberg predecessor Rudy Giuliani essentially tried it in the Republican contest in 2008, and by the time the first four primaries were over, voters barely remembered Giuliani was in the race.
The same will likely happen to Bloomberg, if he goes through with it. Recall the excitement and 24/7 media attention that precedes the Iowa caucuses, and then the shift to New Hampshire, and so on. Bloomberg won’t be a part of that. He can buy all the ads he wants telling people to just wait until he gets in, but there will be Democratic winners chosen by the voters of the first four state contests who cannot be ignored.
Also, if Bloomberg jumps in, voters will eventually recognize that he, like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, is too old to be president. Bloomberg will be nearly 79 on Inauguration Day 2021. Like Biden, who will be 78, and Sanders, who will be 79, Bloomberg will have to convince voters that a president in his 80s — never before seen in American history — is nothing to worry about.
Bloomberg’s move is a symptom of Democratic anxiety. We’ve seen it before, in both parties. At the beginning of a primary season, with a big field of candidates starting the race, the party faithful say, "Isn’t this great? We have so many good candidates — almost an embarrassment of riches!" Then, after several months of campaigning, they say, "Can’t somebody enter this race and save us?"
The answer is no. The Democratic field is what it is. One of the candidates in the race right now will win the nomination, go on to face President Donald Trump, and have a chance to become the next president. There’s no savior waiting to rescue Democrats — and that includes Michael Bloomberg.

Banning e-cigs could do more harm than good

Texto completo: The nation is facing two distinct vaping-related health crises: surging e-cigarette use among teenagers and a lung-injury outbreak that has sickened more than 2,000 people and killed at least 40. Both have exposed gaps in the nation's public health apparatus.
But instead of closing those gaps, policymakers have turned to banning products.
The impulse to remove e-cigarettes from the market is understandable. The Food and Drug Administration's hands-off approach to vaping and e-cigarette regulation has backfired badly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — and state and local health departments around the country — are struggling to pick up the slack.
But prohibition is not a good long-term solution, for several reasons. Such measures are not guaranteed to prevent teenagers from getting e-cigarettes and they would almost certainly force people who already use these products, including about 11 million adults, to choose between traditional cigarettes (which remain widely available) and black-market vaping products.
Because these black market products are a leading suspect in the lung-injury outbreak, product bans are more likely to exacerbate this crisis than to mitigate it.
The better, if more complicated, option would be to build a public health system that's strong enough to combat all nicotine addiction in the long term. That could help drive a cultural shift for e-cigarettes akin to the shift that took place for traditional cigarettes.
With sustained and careful investment, e-cigarettes might become nothing more than a harm-reduction option for adult smokers.
Treat e-cigarettes like cigarettes. Traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products are already bound by rules that helped sharply lower both youth and adult smoking rates in recent decades. E-cigarette makers have evaded similar regulations.
Learn from Britain. So far, the country has managed to make e-cigarettes available for adults who want to quit using regular cigarettes without triggering an epidemic of nicotine dependence among its youth.
Invest in public health. The C.D.C. and state and local health departments across the country are struggling to hold the line on public health gains made over the past century. For tobacco control, that means educating the public about the risks of nicotine addiction.
Invest in research. There remains much we don't know about e-cigarettes. Are these products truly effective at helping people quit smoking, and is there a way to maximize that effectiveness? How safe is long-term e-cigarette use, and are some products safer than others? Health officials need answers.
Maintain pressure. Scientists and universities have refused to take "research" money from companies that make e-cigarettes; advertising agencies and health and wellness companies are pledging to do the same. These movements reflect a growing public wariness that is itself a powerful check on the industry.
The tobacco industry has a terrible track record of self-policing. But the fact that the company even took these steps is proof that even while regulatory efforts falter, public sentiment can still hold sway.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' at the Lyceum Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 20). Ghosts of Broadway past, present and future unite in a new adaptation of the Charles Dickens Yuletide-cheer monger. The playwright Jack Thorne and the director Matthew Warchus weave Christmas songs into the tale of a miser redeemed. Campbell Scott stars, with Andrea Martin and LaChanze as spirits.
212-239-6200, achristmascarolbroadway.com
'FEFU AND HER FRIENDS' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (previews start on Nov. 16; opens on Nov. 24). After a four-decade absence, María Irene Fornés's lapidary comedy-drama, an early example of a promenade play, returns Off Broadway. At a country house, in 1935, eight women gather to discuss love, violence, gender and philosophy. Lileana Blain-Cruz directs a cast that includes Amelia Workman and Jennifer Lim.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'THE HALF-LIFE OF MARIE CURIE' at the Minetta Lane Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 19). Most of Audible's theatrical enterprises are solo efforts, but to tell the story of an episode from the life of the physicist and chemist Marie Curie, it takes two. In Lauren Gunderson's drama, Francesca Faridany stars as Curie, with Kate Mulgrew as the engineer Hertha Ayrton, who spent a summer with Curie in 1912. Gaye Taylor Upchurch directs.

'THE INHERITANCE' at the Barrymore Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 17). Three generations of gay men live, grieve, love and mourn through the six and a half hours of Matthew Lopez's modern epic, which Matt Wolf called "capaciously moving" when it was staged in London last year. The play arrives on Broadway directed by Stephen Daldry and starring the original cast members John Benjamin Hickey, Paul Hilton and Andrew Burnap, as well as Lois Smith.
212-239-6200, theinheritanceplay.com
'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' at the Public Theater (previews start on Nov. 18; opens on Nov. 22). The Public's Mobile Unit has been solving Shakespeare's political problem play at correctional facilities, homeless shelters and community centers throughout the five boroughs. The production, directed by LA Williams, now returns to the theater with a reminder of how lawmakers place their own interests above the commonweal.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'THE UNDERLYING CHRIS' at the Tony Kiser Theater at Second Stage Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 21). Will Eno, a playwright who packs big emotions and big ideas into small, nondescript packages, returns with a new play. Inspired in part by his young daughter, it is a meditation on identity and the things that make and mar us. Kenny Leon directs a cast that includes Hannah Cabell and Michael Countryman.
212-246-4422, 2st.com
Last Chance
'THE HEIGHT OF THE STORM' at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater (closes on Nov. 24). Florian Zeller's drama about a couple, long married and possibly dead, divorces itself from Broadway. Jesse Green wrote that Zeller's "idée fixe about unfixed consciousness gets its fullest and least rewarding workout." Still, he praised the play's stars, Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, "who face the adversity of the text in contrastingly and compulsively watchable ways."
212-239-6200, manhattantheatreclub.com
'HEROES OF THE FOURTH TURNING' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Nov. 17). Will Arbery's anguished moonlit chat with young Christian conservatives ends its Off Broadway run. Jesse Green wrote that this astonishing play, set in Wyoming and directed by Danya Taymor, "explores the lives and ideas of conservatives with affection, understanding and deep knowledge -- if not, ultimately, approval."
212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org
'IS THIS A ROOM' at the Vineyard Theater (closes on Nov. 24). Tina Satter's lauded play, based on a transcript of an F.B.I. interview with the whistle-blower Reality Winner, ends its interrogation. Ben Brantley praised the "almost forensic detail" of Emily Davis's central performance and the nerve-shredding over all. "Unlike more classic high-anxiety plays -- say, 'Oedipus Rex' or 'Macbeth' -- this production isn't about to offer you the cleansing release of catharsis," he wrote.
212-353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org
'SOFT POWER' at the Public Theater (closes on Nov. 17). David Henry Hwang and Jeanine Tesori's new play, a multinational, metatheatrical meditation on creativity and control, lowers its curtain. Directed by Leigh Silverman, this show about an Asian-American playwright contracted to write a musical for a Chinese impresario is, as Jesse Green wrote, "something of a miracle but also something of a muddle."

Turkish President Hands 'Tough Guy' Letter Back to Trump on U.S. Visit

Texto completo: The Turkish leader clashed with a Republican senator and returned President Trump's pointed letter warning against a military incursion into Syria.
WASHINGTON -- To outward appearances, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey enjoyed a genial visit to the White House on Wednesday, where he and President Trump exchanged compliments and resolved to work out multiple policy disputes between Washington and Ankara.
But behind the scenes, the visit featured some tense and awkward moments that have come into clearer view only after Mr. Erdogan's departure. Among them was an unusual Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump convened with Mr. Erdogan and five Republican senators, some of whom challenged the Turkish leader in sharp terms, according to attendees.
On his return to Turkey, Mr. Erdogan was rewarded with accolades from pro-government news outlets for standing up to Mr. Trump by returning a blustery letter Mr. Trump sent him in October. In the message, Mr. Trump warned the Turkish leader, "Don't be a fool," by launching a military operation against Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria. Mr. Erdogan ignored the warning and sent troops across the border on Oct. 9.
"We gave back the letter that we have received," Mr. Erdogan said Wednesday during a joint news conference with Mr. Trump. On his plane home, Mr. Erdogan said the White House "had no reaction" to his gesture, according to the Turkish news channel NTV.
While Mr. Erdogan himself did not gloat, pro-government news outlets in Turkey did. The Daily Sabah ran an article under the headline "Decisive Stance From Erdogan," noting that the letter "was returned to its owner by hand." Hurriyet and Milliyet, two newspapers owned by a pro-government conglomerate, also announced the return of the letter on their front pages.
The White House declined to comment, and Mr. Trump did not mention the letter on Wednesday.
Mr. Erdogan also went on the offensive in his meeting with the senators. Sitting beside Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, he surprised the lawmakers by producing an iPad to play a video depicting atrocities said to have been committed by two Kurdish groups, the People's Protection Units, known as the Y.P.G., and the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the P.K.K.
The Y.P.G. played an instrumental role in the fight against the Islamic State, working closely with United States military forces. Turkey calls it an offshoot of the P.K.K., a separatist organization that the State Department has designated as a terrorist group. Mr. Erdogan insists he is unfairly branded as anti-Kurd, and objects only to Kurdish groups he calls a threat to Turkey's security.
Mr. Erdogan told reporters on his plane that Mr. Trump was "very impressed" by the video, according to NTV.
But the Turkish leader was also on the receiving end of stinging words.
Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who was among the Republican attendees in the Oval Office meeting, recounted on Thursday that Mr. Erdogan -- a strongman rarely challenged directly at home -- "went nuts" after Mr. Graham used the word "invasion" to describe Turkey's widely condemned military offensive against the Kurdish fighters.
"I said, 'Well, the reason it's an invasion is that's exactly what you did,"' Mr. Graham said. "I warned you not to do it. And everything that I was worried about came true in spades."
In response to Mr. Erdogan's video, Mr. Graham recalled, "I said, 'Want me to get the Kurds to make one about what you're doing?"'
Analysts said that Mr. Trump probably hoped such exchanges would demonstrate for his Turkish counterpart, with whom he has sought warm relations, the pressure he faces from members of Congress who are furious over the Turkish military action in Syria, as well as Turkey's purchase of a Russian antiaircraft missile system. Leaders of both parties in Congress have called for sanctions to punish the moves by Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally that under Mr. Erdogan's leadership has moved toward authoritarianism, including closer ties with Russia.
Mr. Trump said he wanted to salvage that relationship, and on Wednesday he cited a 70-year alliance between Washington and Ankara forged during the Cold War, when Turkey feared Soviet domination.
The Republican senators in attendance -- Mr. Graham, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Jim Risch of Idaho, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida -- share that view, but have been far more willing than Mr. Trump to criticize the Turkish leader.
"Primarily, this was Trump's favor to Erdogan, allowing him to plead his case directly with the Republican senators in an attempt to prevent a veto-proof sanctions vote against Turkey," said Aykan Erdemir, a former member of Turkey's Parliament and now a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.
"Trump would have also seen this as an opportunity to demonstrate that he alone does not call all the shots on U.S. foreign and security policy, so as to lower Erdogan's expectations from him personally," Mr. Erdemir added.
Mr. Risch, who serves as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he and the other senators who attended had explained to the Turkish president that the mood of Congress was "very clearly not in his favor." He added that Mr. Erdogan's tone had been "defensive."
Mr. Risch said he told Mr. Erdogan that he would effectively block Turkey from receiving any American F-35 fighter jets, which it helped develop in partnership with the Atlantic alliance, as long as the country retains the Russian surface-to-air missile systems, known as the S-400. Defense Department officials say that operating the advanced F-35 in proximity to a Russian system could compromise the plane's technology. Mr. Risch and other leading members of Congress also say that Turkey's acquisition of the missile system should set off sanctions under a 2017 law meant to punish the purchase of Russian military hardware by other nations.
"The president I can tell you was sitting right there when we delivered this very hard message," Mr. Risch added. "Erdogan did not look to him for help and the president did not offer help."
Mr. Risch said he hopes to move a bipartisan package of sanctions against Turkey that he sponsored with Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the panel, although not until "negotiations have fallen off the rails."
Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, met Thursday with Mr. Trump and discussed, among other matters, the S-400 sale. European diplomats said a compromise was possible, and both sides were signaling they wanted one. But one diplomat said the technical hurdles to reaching some sort of deal that is acceptable to both sides remained a challenge.
"There is a strong motivation, drive to solve the disagreement," Mr. Stoltenberg said. "And if we are not able to solve the disagreement, to find a way to avoid it undermining the alliance."
Mr. Trump also held a second meeting with Republican senators on Thursday, including Mr. Cruz, Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, Steve Daines of Montana, Michael D. Crapo of Idaho and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota.
"Having some relationship, even with your adversaries, makes sense, particularly one that still is a NATO ally, and we still have obviously some very strong interest in," Mr. Cramer said.
After the White House publicly released Mr. Trump's Oct. 9 letter to Mr. Erdogan, some Turkish news reports suggested the Turkish leader had thrown it in the trash, and he publicly criticized it, telling reporters in Istanbul, "We will not forget this lack of respect."
Michael Crowley and Catie Edmondson reported from Washington, and Megan Specia from London. Julian E. Barnes and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington.

Texto completo: A new batch of leaked emails illustrates the degree to which Mr. Miller used a think tank's work to shape coverage at Breitbart News and policy at the White House.
WASHINGTON -- Stephen Miller, President Trump's hard-line immigration adviser, has long relied on data produced by the Center for Immigration Studies, a right-leaning think tank, to shape policy at the White House. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Miller became well-known in the West Wing for putting printouts of studies published by the group on the president's desk.
A new set of emails first published by a civil rights advocacy group, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and shared with The New York Times illustrates the degree to which Mr. Miller used the work of the think tank, which advocates restricting immigration, to shape coverage at Breitbart News, a conservative news site, while he served as a communications aide to Jeff Sessions, the former Republican senator from Alabama.
"He was almost a de facto assignment editor for the political writing team at Breitbart," said Kurt Bardella, the site's former spokesman and now a frequent critic of the Trump administration.
In one instance in January 2016 -- around the time he joined Mr. Trump's presidential campaign as a senior policy adviser -- Mr. Miller sent Breitbart employees a study from the think tank that tracked Muslim population growth in the United States: "Huge Surge in U.S. newborns named 'Mohammed,"' Mr. Miller wrote in the subject line. A related story appeared on Breitbart the next day.
In another email sent in July 2015, Mr. Miller praised the work of Jason Richwine, an anti-immigration author whose work appears often on the think tank's website. Mr. Richwine, who has drawn public furor for arguing that Hispanic immigrants are less intelligent than white Americans, said in an email on Thursday that he was a "mainstream" analyst whose work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal and Politico.
"Those publications are not embarrassed to promote my work," wrote Mr. Richwine, who said that he did not personally know Mr. Miller. "So I don't know why Stephen Miller should be either."
In several cases, the think tank has shared with readers links to websites tied to white nationalists, including the site VDARE, which regularly publishes white nationalists and traffics in anti-immigrant messages. Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart editor who leaked the cache of emails, said Mr. Miller emailed her a link to an article on VDARE. Ms. McHugh has said she now denounces far-right groups.
The White House defended Mr. Miller on Thursday by equating the law center's reporting to libel.
The law center "libels, slanders and defames conservatives for a living and in fact is a discredited, debunked far-left smear organization that has even recently been forced to pay someone $ 4 million for defamation," Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in an email. Mr. Gidley was apparently referring to $ 3.4 million the group paid to settle a lawsuit filed by Maajid Nawaz, an activist whose advocacy organization the law center initially said was an "extremist" group.
Mr. Gidley also claimed that criticism of Mr. Miller was connected to his Jewish faith. "I work with Stephen," Mr. Gidley said. "I know Stephen. He loves this country and hates bigotry in all forms -- and it concerns me as to why so many on the left consistently attack Jewish members of this administration."
Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the think tank, said in an interview that he knew Mr. Miller from his time with Mr. Sessions, and that he had discussed immigration policy with him during two White House meetings.
Mr. Krikorian disputed the law center's designation of the think tank as a hate group, but said he was aware that some content on VDARE was "outrageous."
Mr. Miller, who delivered a 2015 keynote speech at one of the think tank's events, is now one of the main speechwriters for the president, as well as Mr. Trump's chief adviser on immigration policy. He often shares news coverage that he thinks will catch Mr. Trump's attention, or perhaps draw his ire, according to several current and former officials.
In 2017, while searching for ways to illustrate the cost of resettling refugees, Mr. Miller urged State Department officials to embrace data from the think tank that showed it was 12 times more costly to bring a refugee to the United States than to help that same person in their own region. State Department officials declined on the grounds that the think tank report, which did not take into account refugee contributions through taxes, was flawed.
Mr. Miller also publicly used the think tank's data to bolster his argument for the Trump administration's initial travel ban that restricted travel from seven largely Muslim countries, a narrower version of which the Supreme Court upheld last year. He said he referred to the think tank's analysis that 72 people from the those countries had been implicated in terrorist activity since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
"We know there's at least several dozen, perhaps many more than that, cases of terrorism from these countries that have happened in the United States in terms of terroristic plots, terroristic activity, material support for terrorism, supporting terrorism overseas, all different kinds of terroristic activity that's been interdicted in the United States tracing back to these seven countries," Mr. Miller said in an appearance on ABC's "This Week" in February 2017.
A host of fact checks found that the think tank's claims were overstated -- most of those people were not charged with crimes related to terrorism.
"The only thing I can say from the outside is that he really does seem to have mastered the art of bureaucratic infighting," Mr. Krikorian said of Mr. Miller. "It's clear to anyone that he's done a good job of maintaining his position within the White House, and that's not nothing."

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he embarrassed himself following a tense exchange Thursday where he asked the White House counselor to respond to her husband's criticism of President Trump on television.
Lawyer George Conway has frequently attacked his wife's boss on social media. MSNBC brought him into the studio Wednesday to serve as an analyst during its coverage of the House impeachment hearings.
Blitzer, toward the end of an in-studio interview with Kellyanne Conway on Thursday morning, said he had a sensitive but substantive question for her.
“I don't want to talk about your marriage," he said. “I know there are issues there."
Conway seemed taken aback.
“What did you say?" she asked. “You don't want to talk about my marriage but there are issues there? Why would you say that?"
Conway noted that there was no shortage of Trump critics who appear on CNN and MSNBC and wondered why Blitzer brought up her husband.
“Because he's a legal scholar, he's a lawyer, and he was really going after the president of the United States," Blitzer said. “He was all over television yesterday."
Responded Conway: “And the relevance is, come on, wait for it, drumroll, he's married to me."
CNN rolled a tape of George Conway criticizing Trump for using foreign policy to advance his own interests. It aired on a split screen, as another camera followed his wife's reaction.
Kellyanne Conway said it was “his opinion."
“What you just quoted is said every single day by other voices," Conway said. “But you wanted to put it in my husband's voice because you think somehow that will help your ratings or that you're really sticking it to Kellyanne Conway. And let me make it very clear, you didn't stick it to Kellyanne Conway. I think you embarrassed yourself and I'm embarrassed for you."
MSNBC didn't bring up Kellyanne when her husband was on the air Wednesday, although anchor Brian Williams gave a knowing reference to “yes, that George Conway," when introducing him.

Trump Jr.'s book makes bestseller list
NEW YORK — Donald Trump Jr.'s “Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
“Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Nov. 24 edition of the Times.
Among those celebrating was President Trump, who tweeted, “Wow! Was just told that my son's book, 'Triggered,' is Number One on The New York Times Bestseller List. Congratulations Don!"
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were “bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said Thursday that the RNC has been offering “Triggered" as a fund-raising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."
“Triggered" also placed high on the weekly report compiled by NPD BookScan, which tracks around 85 percent of the print market. According to BookScan, “Triggered" sold 71,000 copies last week, second only to Jeff Kinney's latest “Diary of a Wimpy Kid." NPD could not immediately determine how many of those sales were bulk sales.

Texto completo: Veterans Day was a national holiday on Nov. 11, a date that was established by the armistice that ended World War I on Nov. 11, 1918. It was originally called Armistice Day for that reason, but as the sufering from that confict faded into history, the date, Nov. 11, was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.
The purpose of the holiday now is to honor those who served honorably in the military. There was a universal military draft in 1954 of young men who were not aficted with a bone spur. The holiday was in recognition of those who completed their term of service and were honorably discharged.
With the nature of warfare becoming more frequently an urban confict, it seems that it might be fscally efcient for competent soldiers to morph into
metropolitan police ofcers. The army has developed a code of conduct that seems to be more stringent than the requirements for the discipline of urban police ofcers.
A story in the New York Times reports that the district attorney in Brooklyn, New York has blacklisted seven police ofcers whose work is so fawed and so lacking credibility that their testimony is precluded from criminal cases. The story indicates that this is a common practice, but the names of the ofending police ofcers are usually not publicized.
This problem must be resolved if the U.S. is to repair its criminal justice system. Veterans Day suggests the idea that military training might serve as a prep school for the civilian police.

Mirren, McKellen relish roles in
‘The Good Liar’
NEW YORK | Roles for older actors can fall into some predictable tropes, but Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen say their new film, “The Good Liar,” let them brush aside cliches and even their characters’ mortality for a good cat-and-mouse thriller.
“Elderly characters are sort of there to be the lovely old grandfather or granddad that the kids go and visit,” Mirren said. “As you get older and you realize, ‘You know what? I still have agency in my life. Things are still happening in my life. It doesn’t all stop when you’re 50.”
The film, which opens in theaters Friday, brings Mirren, 74, and McKellen, 80, together on the big screen for the first time.
McKellen plays Roy, a man who has spent his life swindling others and sets his sights on Mirren’s character, a lonely widow named Betty. Roy is hoping to cash in on Betty’s life savings.
Actor Dave Bautista is now guardian to 2 abandoned pit bulls
TAMPA, Fla. | A Florida animal shelter sent out a desperate plea after someone had abandoned two pit bull dogs. But volunteers never expected the post would catch the attention of “Guardians of the Galaxy” actor Dave Bautista.
The 6-year-old pit bulls, Maggie and Ollie, were handed over to the county after their owner had a baby. Volunteers from Rescue Me Tampa wrote a post seeking someone who would take both dogs, writing they’d been together their whole life.
That was last month. A week later, the group posted a picture of the star hugging the two pups and announcing he had adopted them.
Trump Jr.’s book is a No. 1 bestseller, but with an edge
NEW YORK | Donald Trump Jr.’s “Triggered” is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.

Texto completo: Irreverent funnyman Jeff Dunham, is bringing his gang of wise-cracking puppets and his international tour "JEFF DUNHAM: SERIOUSLY!?" to Savannah on Nov. 17 at the Johnny Mercer Theatre.
Dunham is crisscrossing 36 cities in North America and Canada splitting sides and ruffling feathers with his topical jokes and flippant puppets. For the past two decades, Dunham has entertained crowds with his ventriloquism and memorable characters including Peanut, a fluffy purple alien; Walter, a cranky elderly veteran; and proud country-boy Bubba J, among others.
On this latest tour, Dunham adds a new personality to the mix with his puppet Larry, billed as the U.S. President's personal advisor who will offer an inside-take on what it's like to work at the White House.
Dunham has been cracking up audiences with his non-stop touring and TV specials, and is fresh off a new Netflix Originals stand-up special, "Jeff Dunham: Beside Himself." The comedy special was filmed in June at the American Airlines Center in his native Dallas, TX. He's also been a featured guest on many hit TV shows including the Emmy-winning series "30 Rock" and such movies as "Dinner for Schmucks" featuring actors Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd.
Dunham also adds best-selling author to his resume after his recent autobiography, "All By My Selves: Walter, Peanut, Achmed and Me" was featured on the New York Times' Best Seller list for three weeks in a row. One of his proudest moments came in 2017 was Dunham was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame recognizing his more than two decades in show business.
A Texas native, Dunham graduated from Baylor University before moving to Los Angeles, CA where he hit the ground running on the comedy club circuit. Dunham's crass and hilarious puppet routines soon caught the attention of TV networks where he has had several comedy specials air on NBC and Comedy Central and more.
The show "JEFF DUNHAM: SERIOUSLY!?" comes Sunday, Nov. 17 to the Johnny Mercer Theatre located at 301 Oglethorpe Ave. Showtime is 3 p.m. Ticket prices start at $55.

Texto completo: Childhood trauma more common than we think
Kudos to the Baltimore Sun on an excellent summary on the science of childhood trauma ("We can prevent the health consequences of childhood trauma," Nov. 6).
As you point out, adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, affect us all. We likely all know someone who has experienced an ACE, like family addiction, abuse, divorce, witnessing community violence or experiencing racial discrimination.
One in six Americans have experienced four or more ACEs. Children at our facility, the Baltimore Child Abuse Center, have an average of six to seven ACEs. And yes, thought leaders are starting to pay attention to decades of research showing that addressing childhood trauma can help prevent poor health and social outcomes, addiction, incarceration and even early death.
Baltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen and the office of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings are on the vanguard of elected officials who are legislating ways to build networks of trauma-responsive institutions and agencies. We are witnessing a paradigm shift in the making. This good news has been slow to spread, but thank you for helping to spread it.

Biden's relationship with Ukraine was no secret
Donald Trump and his Republicans supporters have employed the gamut of logical fallacies to oppose impeachment - lying, hypocrisy, goal post moving, false equivalencies, ad hominem attacks, appeals to ignorance and straw man tactics.
How would they respond to the following set of facts? As we know, in 2016, Vice President Joe Biden, in plain sight, threatened to withhold financial aid to Ukraine unless its leaders dismissed Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin ("Alternative Fact of the Week: Kellyanne Conway, still the champion prevaricator," Nov. 7). His son, Hunter Biden, was on the board of Burisma since 2014. The Biden defense to allegations of corrupt intent are well known. He was acting in concert with Ukrainian domestic and international pressure to oust Mr. Shokin, known to be corrupt. Mr. Shokin's replacement would more likely reopen a dormant investigation into Burisma, putting the gas company and its directors at greater risk.
Here is a different take. We know that Hunter Biden's seat on the Burisma board was not a secret. In fact, President Barack Obama's spokesperson, Josh Earnest, in response to a question about the Mr. Biden's potential conflict of interest given his son's seat on Burisma, referred the reporter to the vice president's office. The New York Times wrote a story about the potential conflict of interest.
Meanwhile, the Republicans, who had control of the House and Senate, were not shy to launching dubious investigations against alleged Obama administration wrongdoing. The Republicans investigated Benghazi (eight times), IRS targeting, Solyndra and Fast and Furious. If the Republicans of today are so certain that Mr. Biden acted corruptly in 2016, why did they not feel that way then and launch an investigation three years ago. Why didn't Rand Paul and others in office then speak out about the so-called travesty of Mr. Biden's actions?
We know the answer. The Republicans of 2016, many of whom are in office today, knew that Mr. Biden's actions were not inappropriate. Hearings would have quickly revealed that Mr. Biden's actions were not only appropriate, but highly successful and lauded.

Education spending requires accountability
The key to ensuring public support for the Kirwan Commission education recommendations to boost public school outcomes is not to demonize the cost of the commission's goals nor to provide a blank check for its implementation, but to assuage taxpayers' understandable concerns by legislatively mandating accountability measures with real teeth ("Former county executives: Maryland governor plays politics with education," Nov. 6).
In 1998, I sponsored amendments that were adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee to require accountability for the expenditure of public school funding.
Unfortunately, the Maryland State Department of Education was woefully lax and ineffective in ensuring that these accountability requirements be enforced. For oversight to be effective, the General Assembly must legislate strict accountability requirements that provide sanctions for non-compliance that include cuts in administrative salaries and withheld appropriations.
Based on its track record for the past 20 years, the legislature should not rely on MSDE to strengthen its own accountability efforts. The legislature must act in the coming session to mandate potent accountability measurements.

Texto completo: Senior Trump administration officials considered resigning en masse last year in a "midnight self-massacre" to sound a public alarm about President Donald Trump's conduct, but rejected the idea because they believed it would further destabilize an already teetering government, according to a new book by an unnamed author.
In "A Warning" by Anonymous, obtained by The Washington Post ahead of its release, a writer described only as "a senior official in the Trump administration" paints a chilling portrait of the president as cruel, inept and a danger to the nation.
The author, who first captured attention in 2018 as the unidentified author of a New York Times opinion column, describes Trump careening from one self-inflicted crisis to the next, "like a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport."
The 259-page book, which was published by Twelve, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group, and goes on sale Nov. 19, does not recreate many specific episodes in vivid detail, which the author writes was intentional to protect his or her identity.
At a moment when a stream of political appointees and career public servants have testified before Congress about Trump's conduct as part of the House impeachment inquiry, the book's author defends his or her decision to remain anonymous.
"I have decided to publish this anonymously because this debate is not about me," the author writes. "It is about us. It is about how we want the presidency to reflect our country, and that is where the discussion should center. Some will call this 'cowardice.' My feelings are not hurt by the accusation. Nor am I unprepared to attach my name to criticism of President Trump. I may do so, in due course."
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham derided the book and its anonymous author.
"The coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies," Grisham wrote in an email. "Real authors reach out to their subjects to get things fact checked -- but this person is in hiding. ... Reporters who choose to write about this farce should have the journalistic integrity to cover the book as what it is -- a work of fiction."
The author describes senior officials waking up in the morning "in a full-blown panic" over the wild pronouncements the president had made on Twitter.
"It's like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him," the author writes.
The author argues that Trump is incapable of leading the United States through a monumental international crisis, describing how he tunes out intelligence and national security briefings and theorizes that foreign adversaries see him as "a simplistic pushover" who is susceptible to flattery and easily manipulated.
After the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, the author writes, Trump vented to advisers and said he would be foolish to stand up to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
"Do you know how stupid it would be to pick this fight?" Trump said, according to the book. "Oil would go up to one hundred fifty dollars a barrel."
One theme laced throughout the book is Trump's indifference to the boundaries of the law. The author writes that Trump considered presidential pardons as "unlimited 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards on a Monopoly board," referring to news reports that he had offered pardons to aides.
As he ranted about federal courts ruling against some of his policies, including the 2017 travel ban, the author writes, Trump once asked White House lawyers to draft a bill to send to Congress reducing the number of federal judges.
"Can we just get rid of the judges?" the president said, according to the book. "There shouldn't be any at all, really."
The author also ruminates about Trump's fitness for office.
"I am not qualified to diagnose the president's mental acuity," the author writes. "All I can tell you is that normal people who spend any time with Donald Trump are uncomfortable by what they witness. He stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information, not occasionally but with regularity. Those who would claim otherwise are lying to themselves or to the country."

Texto completo: Jane Fonda's protest look makes a statement of its own.
Forget the power shoulder. These days, it's all about the power coat. At least when it comes to Jane Fonda -- and, perhaps, to those who would follow her example.
We are speaking, of course, of the five-alarm, bright red coat the actress and activist wore last Friday (or last #firedrillfriday, as she has designated them) as she protested at the National Capitol to raise awareness about the climate crisis. The one she has worn every Friday for the last five Fridays, and will wear tomorrow, and continue to wear every Friday through the end of the year.
The one she is wearing in the video she posted on her website explaining her actions. The one that she says is the last piece of clothing she will ever buy.
The one that has, like the burnt orange MaxMara coat Nancy Pelosi wore back in December when she confronted President Trump after her return as speaker of the House, provoked a viral obsession thanks to its ability to represent visually the issue Ms. Fonda is raising verbally (and physically), while also looking deeply chic.
According to a recent article in The New York Times, the idea of wearing red came from discussions over Labor Day weekend between Ms. Fonda and some of her friends, as well as the author Naomi Klein, Annie Leonard of Greenpeace USA and the environmental activist and author Bill McKibben.
How, exactly, participants wanted to interpret the red in garment form would be up to them.
In some of the arrest photos of Ms. Fonda, you can see other celebrities adopting the tactic. Sam Waterston seems to be partial to a burgundy-tone cable-knit sweater; Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's wore a Crayola red polo over a long-sleeved gray T-shirt; the activist Jodie Evans wore a lush velvet cherry red coat. (Ted Danson, who was arrested in a gray crew neck, did not seem to have gotten the message.)
But none of the garments have the clarity and impact of Ms. Fonda's coat.
Ms. Fonda went to Neiman Marcus to buy her version, on sale. We don't know the label (when asked, Ms. Fonda told The Hollywood Reporter she could not remember, though she did say it cost $ 500). It has a large shawl collar and belt, which she sometimes leaves undone. Speculation has centered on a Mackage style. If, indeed, it is her last fashion purchase, it was a good one.
The coat does everything it needs to do. It is unmistakable in a crowd and sends a message: Warning! Our house is on fire! Urgent action is needed! It also provides warmth and some comfort during Ms. Fonda's time in jail. It has become so immediately recognizable that it was its own Halloween costume.
One Twitter observer noted: "BTW, I hope that red coat ends up in the Smithsonian." It probably should. It has made that rare but historically significant leap from garment to symbol: of a time, place and movement. A red-coated Jane Fonda, shown being arrested on Nov. 1, has made a habit of getting cuffed while protesting a lack of action against climate change.

Texto completo: Readers urge the House to compel witnesses to testify; one appeals to John Bolton to "do the right thing" and "speak out now."
To the Editor:
Re "What Is the President Hiding?," by Neal K. Katyal (Op-Ed, Nov. 13):
Just shortly before the impeachment hearings even began, an unsettling feeling came over me. I now conclude that the public testimony during the impeachment proceedings, by longstanding devoted public servants, will not make a difference. The average Trump supporter and Republican either will not tune in, or will tune out (and deny facts). And, of course, the Republican-dominated Senate will never vote to convict.
Does that mean that the House shouldn't have pursued impeachment? Certainly not, or more clearly, it has an obligation to do so. However, there should be many more contempt citations issued by the House, more subpoenas issued and much more court activity to compel witnesses to appear and testify. The judiciary, as the third branch of our government, must step up and do its job.
Mr. Katyal is right that the damage to our democratic institutions caused by President Trump's and the executive branch's obstruction of the proceedings may cause as much or even greater damage to our democracy than the Ukraine scandal itself.

To the Editor:
The question to be answered by John Bolton, former national security adviser, is: "What do you know and how do you know it?" The time for answering is now and not at some undefined point in the future. His reputation for honesty and integrity over his entire career is on the line.
Mr. Bolton is a consummate principled professional, yet, so far, he is failing to do the right thing and testify at the impeachment hearings. He doesn't need the White House or the courts' judgment to know what's best for his country and what best underscores the oath he took to support and defend the Constitution -- the same oath that I took when I was commissioned as an officer in the Marines many years ago.
Of course, he wouldn't disclose classified material. But so much of what he heard and took notes about is the unclassified story of abuse of power and obstruction of justice. That knowledge cries out to be shared. Do the right thing, Mr. Bolton: Speak out now.

Re "Ignoring the Real Problem in the White House," by Michelle Cottle (Editorial Observer, Nov. 12):
The criticism of administration members who seek to help the country by quietly undermining Donald Trump's insane or illegal efforts instead of resigning is too simple a solution to a complicated problem. Yes, as Ms. Cottle points out, they are "propping up a president who continues to erode democratic norms and the rule of law." But aren't they also saving us from some disastrous actions? Let's look at a worst-case scenario:
Suppose Mr. Trump, in a fit of pique, decides to use a nuclear weapon against, say, Iran or North Korea. Do we want presidential subordinates who will stymie his demands by undermining such an order, or do we want them to resign until he finds someone who will carry it out?

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Pro sports alliance tries to alter politics of gambling

Texto completo: Fifteen months ago, on a hot August evening, the top executives of Atlanta's four professional sports teams - the Braves, the Hawks, the Falcons and Atlanta United - gathered at the War Horse, a private dining club on Northside Drive.
Over steaks and a bit of paperwork, they agreed to band together and attempt a fundamental change in the politics of legalized gambling at the state Capitol.
"At our core, we're all huge sports fans," Steve Koonin, CEO of the Atlanta Hawks, who was one of the diners. "We got ourselves aligned and have worked together really, really well as a unit, because we all want to do the same thing. We all want an illegal activity to be made legal. And we want it to be taxed."
On Monday, a year and change later, the umbrella organization the Big Four will use to make their case was unveiled: The Georgia Professional Sports Integrity Alliance. Signing onto the cause, in addition to Koonin, was Derek Schiller, president and CEO of the Braves; Rich McKay, president and CEO of the Falcons; and Darren Eales, president of Atlanta United.
The quartet is calling for a new state law -- the initial strategy is aimed at avoiding a constitutional amendment -- to legalize wagering on professional sports via mobile phones and the Internet. Betting on the sacred Southern institution of college football would remain illegal, as would wagering on professional minor league teams.
All would be regulated by the Georgia Lottery Commission. State revenue generated would go to the HOPE program.
Right about now, you're wondering how this is different than any other push we've seen over the past decade -- all unsuccessful -- to expand gambling in Georgia beyond the lottery. The answer is twofold.
First, previous conversations have focused on casinos - er, destination resorts - and horse racing facilities. Those would become, critics have argued, physical magnets for unsavory activities. This sports-wagering proposal would be architecturally invisible and thus, one could argue, more politically digestible. Even betting kiosks would be barred from the three metro Atlanta stadiums involved.
The teams say they will not partake of any proceeds from licensed wagering outlets. "We would not book bets, take bets. I imagine they would be advertisers, but that would be about it," Koonin said. "We're not the house. We're not bookies. It's pure opt in, via the phone."
The larger reason to treat this effort as something different is the fact previous gambling expansion efforts have originated with entities located beyond Georgia's borders. The best example may be that day in 2015 when Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson parked his limousine on the Mitchell Street side of the state Capitol - so that he could have a chat with a few of the more important people inside.
This would be the first gambling initiative instigated by home-grown institutions, which matters - economically and politically. Also note the four franchises offer a bipartisan balance, which could become important in January.
The Braves' move to Cobb County in 2017 has made the team a GOP favorite. National Football League stats say fans of the Falcons list slightly Republican. The Hawks and Atlanta United, meanwhile, cater to a Democratic demographic, if age and race are any guide.
The timing of the four-sport effort is no coincidence. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal ban on commercial sports betting in most, but not all states.
The New York Times quickly offered up this forecast of the coming revolution: "Placing bets will be done on mobile devices, fueled and endorsed by the lawmakers and sports officials who opposed it for so long. A trip to Las Vegas to wager on March Madness or the Super Bowl could soon seem quaint."
The dinner at the War Horse in Atlanta came three months later.
Possibly, you're baffled by the sports quartet's claim they don't intend to make any direct profit off the bets placed on their players. Although they do want some control over what kind of bets are placed - nothing that can be easily "fixed," like who makes the first foul in a basketball game, or whether the first pitch in an inning is a ball or strike.
And they want control of the statistics that might be used by the betting world - batting averages, completion stats and such.
So why do they want this? All four sports now live in a fractured TV universe with declining viewership. Video streaming is the uncertain future. Koonin said the Atlanta teams are taking a lesson from European soccer on the link between sports betting and fan investment in a team.
"How do you raise a generation that loves going to the games but has the attention span of a goldfish?" Koonin asked. "It's about engagement. The economic benefits go to the state. And an illegal activity becomes legal."
Last spring, the Tennessee state legislature passed a bill to permit sports betting. The governor allowed it to become law without his signature. The Atlanta alliance thinks Georgia could see more than the $50 million a year in state revenue the Tennessee initiative is expected to generate, but they're using that figure as a starting point.
Success in Georgia's Legislature next year could depend on whether backers choose to pursue a simple bill that would require majority approval in both chambers, or a constitutional amendment that would require two-thirds passage - and approval in a November referendum.
Last month, the Office of Legislative Counsel, in an opinion written in response to a request by state Sen. Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, a horse racing advocate, noted our state Constitution isn't as clear on the topic of sports betting as it might be.
It forbids casino gambling and pari-mutuel betting, but sports betting falls into neither category. Which allows for the argument "the regulation of other forms of betting and gambling rests with the General Assembly," wrote Stuart Morelli, deputy legislative counsel.
But that's not a sure thing. "Because there are even odds on whether or not the Georgia Constitution currently prohibits sports betting, the only surefire way to avoid years of protracted litigation over the matter would be a constitutional amendment," he advised.

Texto completo: Pues esa será la cifra de precandidatos presidenciales demócratas si el exgobernador de Massachusetts Deval Patrick se suma a la carrera por la Casa Blanca antes del fin de semana, como informó el miércoles la prensa estadounidense.
Patrick, de 63 años, uno de los primeros gobernadores afroamericanos de Estados Unidos y cercano al expresidente Barack Obama , no confirmó haber comunicado estos planes a varios políticos demócratas, como indicaron varios medios.
Pero según el New York Times y la televisión CNN, este sexagenario relativamente moderado podría confirmar su decisión por video desde este jueves, e inscribirse como candidato a las primarias demócratas en New Hampshire el viernes, día de cierre de las inscripciones en ese estado.
Si se confirma, la candidatura tardía de Patrick demostrará las angustias en el campo demócrata: muchos se inquietan de ver que los senadores Bernie Sanders y Elizabeth Warren, muy de izquierda, suben en los sondeos y superan al centrista Joe Biden , lo cual según ellos arruina las posibilidades de que los demócratas expulsen a Trump de la Casa Blanca en las presidenciales de noviembre de 2020.
Testigo de estas preocupaciones, el multimillonario y exalcalde de Nueva York Michael Bloomberg también contempla disputar las primarias demócratas.
Casado con una abogada y padre de dos hijas, Deval Patrick descartó no obstante en diciembre de 2018 la idea de presentarse a las presidenciales, citando “la crueldad del proceso electoral que terminaría por perjudicar a personas que Diane (su esposa) y yo amamos”.
Pero a menos de tres meses de las primarias, Patrick estima ahora que aún hay lugar para un candidato capaz de unir a demócratas moderados y radicales, según sus allegados.
Nacido en una familia pobre de Chicago, luego becario de una escuela de élite de Boston antes de graduarse en derecho en Harvard, Patrick fue abogado durante mucho tiempo, sobre todo para la asociación de defensa de los derechos de los afroamericanos NAACP, antes de convertirse en gobernador de Massachusetts de 2007 a 2014.
Desde que dejó la gobernación trabaja para el fondo de inversiones privado Bain Capital, que se especializa en empresas que impulsan un modelo de desarrollo sustentable, y como comentarista político del canal CBS News.
Fue así que comentó el último debate demócrata, donde subrayó que “ser candidato, como ser un funcionario electo, es una mezcla de sustancia y de desempeño artístico”.
La disputa por la investidura demócrata ya cuenta con otros dos candidatos afroamericanos, la senadora de California Kamala Harris y el senador de Nueva Jersey Cory Booker. Pero ninguno lidera por ahora la carrera.

Let's wage a war on loneliness

Texto completo: LONDON - We humans make a lonely crowd, and it's killing us.
Social isolation is more lethal than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, or than obesity, according to research published by Julianne Holt-Lunstad of Brigham Young University. Since obesity is associated in the United States with 300,000 to 600,000 deaths a year, the implication is that loneliness is a huge, if silent, killer.
Loneliness increases inflammation, heart disease, dementia and death rates, researchers say - but it also simply makes us heartsick and leaves us inhabiting an Edvard Munch canvas. Public health experts in many countries are debating how to address a "loneliness epidemic" that corrodes modern life, but Britain has taken the lead: Last year it appointed a minister for loneliness.
"It touches almost every one of us at some point," Baroness Barran, the current minister for loneliness, told me. "It can lead to very serious health consequences for the individual and leads to erosion of our society, where people become isolated and disconnected."
I've become interested in loneliness while reporting on the opioid epidemic and soaring suicide rates in the United States. These have complicated roots, partly economic, but they also result from social isolation. Extended families have dissolved, and social institutions like churches, bowling leagues and neighborhood clubs have frayed. We are no longer so deeply embedded in our communities.
"I trained in internal medicine, and I expected most of my time would be spent on diabetes or heart disease or cancer," Dr. Vivek Murthy, who was surgeon general of the United States under President Barack Obama, told me. "What I didn't expect was that so many people I saw would be struggling with loneliness."
More than one-fifth of adults in both the United States and Britain said in a 2018 survey that they often or always feel lonely. More than half of American adults are unmarried, and researchers have found that even among those who are married, 30% of relationships are severely strained. A quarter of Americans now live alone, and as the song says, one is the loneliest number.
One gauge of social isolation, or perhaps selfishness: Murthy says he saw families sometimes drop elderly family members off at a hospital for Thanksgiving or another long weekend in what sounds to me rather like the practice of a family leaving a dog at a kennel when they're going away. At the hospital, doctors are sometimes the only ones to witness a patient's death, with no loved ones around.
Loneliness affects physical health in two ways. First, it produces stress hormones that can lead to inflammation and other health problems. Second, people who are alone are less likely to go to doctor appointments, to take medicine or to exercise and eat a healthy diet. We may resent nagging from loved ones, but it can keep us alive.
When I met Barran I suspected that the minister of loneliness portfolio was a bit of a gimmick. In fact, I'm now persuaded that it's a model for other countries.
The ministry started a "Let's Talk Loneliness" campaign that sparked difficult conversations across Britain, and it is handing out small grants to local gardening clubs, bird-watching groups and others so that they can spread the word and invite more people to join. One grant of $640, for example, went to a Birmingham group to buy board games and start a game club.
It is supporting "friendly benches," which are public benches where people are encouraged to go and chat with one another. It's pushing to keep community spaces open and to stop public transportation from being cut in ways that leave people isolated. The government is also putting social workers in doctor's offices for "social prescribing" - connecting lonely patients with local organizations.
One early lesson, Barran said: Because of stigma, don't post a sign inviting lonely people to show up. Rather, have an upbeat sign inviting people to take part in a dog-walking club, a community garden or some other activity.
"We should focus on people's gifts rather than people's problems, because most of us would prefer to talk about our gifts," Barran said.
I suggest that we also make it easier for people to have dogs. There is some evidence that dog owners (but not cat owners) are less lonely, although in fairness the research is mixed.
Some think that the internet has aggravated the problem, because a cursory look through Facebook or Instagram suggests that everyone else in the world is having a fabulous time and enjoys perfect relationships.
Meanwhile, the reasons to address the topic are compelling. "If we could tackle loneliness," Barran said, "people would feel stronger, more resilient, more optimistic about the future." Holt-Lunstad has found that greater social connection is associated with a 50% reduced risk of early death.
Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand have shown interest in adopting British approaches. Maybe the United States, too, should experiment: How about a new post in the Department of Health and Human Services - an assistant secretary for loneliness?
Nicholas Kristof writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Did Bevin get boost from Trump?

Texto completo: Since Republican incumbent Matt Bevin apparently lost his gubernatorial reelection bid to Democratic challenger Andy Beshear, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that Bevin was far behind in the polls and that he almost led the governor to victory.
But polling data and political analysts suggest that Bevin and Beshear were neck and neck heading into the election.
Since Nov. 5, Trump has tweeted out varying numbers about the election. On Election Night, the president said Bevin "picked up at least 15 points in last days, but perhaps not enough (Fake News will blame Trump!)." The next day, Trump wrote that his rally in Lexington on Nov. 4 had a major impact on the election, and "the increase in Governors race was at least 15 points, and maybe 20!"
And on Monday, the president once again took to Twitter:
"So with one Rally by me at the end of the campaign, I lift the poll numbers of Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin by 19 points, he just misses, every other Republican in the Commonwealth wins big, and the Fake News blames me for a bad night! OK! By the way, Mississippi won everything!"
However, given public polls, internal polling and general discourse, "the bulk of the data suggested that the race would be really close," said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, which provides nonpartisan analysis on elections through the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.
The race was close: with 100% of counties reporting results, Beshear led Bevin by 5,189 votes out of more than 1.4 million cast.
"When the president cites a specific number, I think you have to be very skeptical of that number," Kondik said. "He's very inaccurate in his public statements much of the time."
Trump might have gotten his data from pollster Targoz Market Research, which had Beshear up by 19% in a poll released on Oct. 23. But that firm received a grade of "C/D" for its reliability from FiveThirtyEight, which is "below average."
Other polling data had different results. A survey from Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy – which received a "B+" from FiveThirtyEight – released on Oct. 26 had Bevin and Beshear tied at 46%. An October-November poll by Trafalgar Group, which received a "C-" from FiveThirtyEight, had Bevin ahead by 6 percentage points.
Even Bevin and his party indicated that they didn't think the incumbent would lose. Voter modeling conducted by the Republican National Committee showed Bevin leading by 3%, according to an October report from Politico. And the governor told The New York Times that he would win by 6 to 10 percentage points: "I think you're going to be shocked at how uncompetitive this actually is."
But it is unclear if Trump's support actually helped Bevin. With the president winning Kentucky by 30 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, it is possible that Trump's visit to Lexington could have gotten Bevin more votes, Kondik said.
But, as Kondik pointed out, particularly in off-year elections, the party opposite of the president tends to have a historical advantage.
By claiming that Bevin was more behind in the polls than he was in reality, Trump was trying to "save face and to provide a narrative about the president's political abilities and his ability to help his fellow republicans," Kondik said.
"I think there's always going to be a level of spin in politics," he said. "But I do think if the campaign cites a specific number, it's incumbent on them to provide the data. And I don't think the president has in this instance."

Explorers discover sunken WWII sub Five Naval Academy grads were aboard USS Grayback

Texto completo: Five Naval Academy graduates were aboard the USS Grayback in February 1944 during its final combat mission of World War II, including commanding officer John Anderson Moore.
Cmdr. Moore was among 80 sailors aboard when the boat disappeared on Feb. 26, and was presumed to have died with the rest of his crew. The exact whereabouts of the sub remained a mystery for 75 years.
Sunday, a team of ocean explorers confirmed they had located the wreckage of the Grayback, one of the most successful U.S. submarines during the war. It was located about 50 nautical miles south of Okinawa in June. The group, led by undersea explorer Tim Taylor, spent the past few months searching for relatives of the crew, he told ABC News.
The Grayback sailed out from Pearl Harbor toward the East China Sea on Jan. 28, 1944 and sank at least two Japanese cargo ships in its path, according to the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command.
It was due to return on March 7 of that year, but it never did. The submarine was attacked about two weeks earlier and "exploded and sank immediately," according to Japanese reports cited by the Navy. A Japan aircraft struck the submarine with a 500-pound bomb.
The Grayback is the fifth submarine discovered by Taylor's Lost 52 Project, which aims to find the 52 U.S. submarines that were lost in World War II. The location of the vessel remained unsolved for so long because of one wrong number in coordinates recorded by the Japanese navy. A 1949 document with approximate locations for each missing submarine was translated from Japanese into English with one digit wrong in the longitude and latitude of the site the Grayback was believed to have sunk, The New York Times reported.
The error was reportedly detected last year by an amateur researcher. The submarine was destroyed in its 10th and most successful patrol, in which it had sunk more than 21,000 tons of shipping belonging to enemy forces, according to the Navy.
Moore graduated from Annapolis in 1932, according to USNA Virtual Memorial Hall, an online list of graduates who have died in service to their company. It is maintained by Run To Honor, an organization of Naval Academy alumni founded in 2007.
Known as "Johnnie," Moore came to Annapolis from Arizona. He was on his second patrol aboard the Grayback at the time of his death.
According to the website On Eternal Patrol, a private listing of members of the U.S. submarine service who have died in combat, the four other academy graduates serving aboard the sub when it was sunk were:
Cmdr. Raymond Leon Mayo, Class of 1930. Mayo was on his third combat patrol aboard the sub.
Lt. Cmdr. Carthel Hill Smith, Class of 1940.
Lt. William C. Roy Jr., class of 1942.
Lt. j.g. Melvin Clyde Phillips, Class of 1944.
Naval Academy offices were closed Monday, and a spokesperson was unavailable for comment on the discovery.

Texto completo: The opening week of college basketball featured some incredible individual performances, several tremendous team wins, and also a number of off-the-court issues.
Unlike last November, when a select group looked like it was destined to separate from the rest of the sport, this season could be more balanced from now until Selection Sunday, when teams are picked for the NCAA tournament.
What we learned last week
Cole Anthony is already appointment television. Through two games, Anthony, a 6-foot-3 guard, has already broken several records at North Carolina. Anthony scored 34 points in his first game at North Carolina, more than any other freshman in his debut for the program. Anthony is also the only Tar Heels freshman to post 20 points and 10 rebounds in consecutive games. He is an early favorite for the national player of the year awards.
Shaka Smart is getting back to his roots. Smart, the Texas coach, made his name at Virginia Commonwealth by playing smaller lineups that featured four perimeter players. It looks like he's now finally set on doing the same thing at Texas. After years of having two traditional front-court players on the floor at the same time, Smart appears to be committed to using versatile 6-8 sophomore Gerald Liddell at power forward in an effort to maximize both skill and spacing. "When your second-biggest guy on the floor thinks like a guard and passes like a guard, it changes things," Smart said. "We haven't had the personnel to play that way the past few years." That alignment was critical in a 70-66 win at Purdue on Saturday, especially down the stretch when Texas trailed by 5 with 3:14 to play. Liddell finished with 14 points, eight rebounds and four assists.
Arizona is good at basketball again. The program has had a trying two years embroiled in the sport's corruption scandal, but the team in Tucson is back on track on the court, at least. Arizona's 90-69 rout of Illinois on Sunday night highlighted the Wildcats' upside, led by the talents of freshmen Nico Mannion, Josh Green, and Zeke Nnaji. Mannion, a 6-3 point guard, has a legitimate chance to be the best freshman floor general for Arizona since Mike Bibby helped lead the Wildcats to the 1997 national title.
What we're looking forward to this week
Villanova takes its first trip to Ohio State. Villanova coach Jay Wright and Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann coached against each other in the Big East when Holtmann was at Butler. With an NCAA tournament feel, the game presents the first national stage for Villanova freshman Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, who had 24 points and 13 rebounds in his college debut against Army.
Villanova freshman Bryan Antoine returned to practice last week after undergoing shoulder surgery. That's exciting, but this is going to be a process. While the 6-5 Antoine was the top recruit in Villanova's strong class, he hasn't played basketball since March.

Texto completo: To all of you who are writing letters castigating House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats for not doing their jobs and only concentrating on the impeachment of out president, please note that over 40 bills on every topic from healthcare to guns to infrastructure have been sent to the Senate where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sits on them.
It is not the Democrats who are ignoring what has to be done.

Protect, not destroy
The New Mexican editorial ("Boom times on the Hill need to be shared," Our View, Nov. 10), was overdue but good to see. It analyzes the impact of the battleships full of money being made available to Los Alamos National Laboratory for projects and upgrades. You know, the problem is not the supercomputer research or the plutonium power supplies for space exploration or the research into environmental issues such as climate change or the jobs they make available for local residents.
The problem is "expanding plutonium pit production for nuclear weapons," i.e., the new nuclear arms race. Who will enlighten them regarding this dead end? I know -- rocket scientists. Obviously, LANL needs more rocket scientists. That's who they should hire and for whom they should set up apprenticeships. They can use the new highway to commute to work for a better planet -- one that they will protect, not destroy.

Tapped memories
Reading about my godmother, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert in Pasatiempo ("As authentic as it gets," Amuse-Bouche, Nov. 1), brought back wonderful memories visiting her at her home on San Antonio Street. I have a 50-year old article about Mrs. Gilbert with reference to her book, We Fed Them Cactus, that tells her story growing up in New Mexico.

Deserving of praise
Too bad the photo on page A-4, intended to illustrate the challenges facing the Special Weeds Action Team (" 'Medians represent the pride we take in our city,' " Nov. 8), included the sign designating "Living Water" as the organization that adopted the median. The inference is that Living Water is to blame for the problem.
In my opinion, the medians adopted by Living Water are among the best maintained in the city -- they do a good job of balancing the lovely native grasses with a need for some tidiness. More to the point, Living Water should be applauded for having stepped up to partner with the Santa Fe Parks and Recreation Department to adopt medians. Most of the medians in the city have not been adopted. The Special Weeds Action Team should work to encourage more organizations to adopt medians -- it's a great way for companies to contribute to the community and get recognition.

No exemption
How can we possibly thank Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham? She says that if Trump loses reelection, she'll ask the Democratic president to give New Mexico an exemption from an oil and gas drilling ban ("Drilling Ban Proposals Divide Democrats in U.S. Oil States," New York Times, Nov. 1). Too bad that if we get a president to lead us out of the climate emergency the governor will instead continue business as usual, continuing destruction of New Mexico itself.
Thanks? No, thanks. Leadership gets thanks. Cowardice gets nada.

Love native plants
From the picture in the paper (" 'Medians represent the pride we take in our city,' " Nov. 8), those "weeds" now designated as unacceptable to many are chamisa and native grasses: the very plants natural to New Mexico that are beautiful and need absolutely no care whatsoever, so let's get rid of them and put in non-native growth requiring water, time and endless effort. Our newly designated Santa Fe, "mud town," continues to be not up-to-snuff. Thank goodness at least the city got rid of those awful bricks once in front of the railroad station along with the dull dirt color once so traditional and popular here. If you don't like the weeds, then cut them and let them grow back. Don't pull them out and replace them with Kentucky bluegrass.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook Inc.’s Instagram plans to remove the number of “likes” visible on posts for some users in the U.S. to decrease competitive pressure among people on the photo-sharing service.
Instagram has been hiding like counts in some markets since April, beginning in Canada, and later expanding to Japan and Brazil. The U.S. is one of Instagram’s largest markets with more than 106 million users, according to data analyst EMarketer. Instagram boss Adam Mosseri told NBC in October that the effort was meant to “make Instagram feel less pressurized, to make it less of a competition.”
Users will still be able to see the likes they receive on their posts if they want, but those metrics won’t be visible to others on Instagram, the company said.
Mosseri said the test will begin next week. He announced the plan Friday at a conference in San Francisco sponsored by Wired magazine.
Instagram’s follower counts and likes have made it one of the top places online to compare one’s popularity with others, especially among teens and young adults. The company has tried for years to combat the competitive trend by promoting good role models via posts on its @instagram account, hoping to reflect the parts of the app that are about creativity and art as opposed to self-promotion. Still, striving for the metrics was irresistible for its users, contributing to mental health issues and other ills, like users paying for fake likes and followers from bots.
Even some of the app’s most prolific celebrities have said a service without likes may be healthier for its users.
“It would be really beneficial,” said Kim Kardashian, speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference Wednesday. Kardashian, who has 151 million Instagram followers and regularly receives more than 1 million likes on her posts, said the Instagram team has been discussing the changes with select users to get feedback, “and that makes me happy.”
Instagram, Facebook and Twitter have been at the center of debate around issues like smartphone addiction and online health in recent years. As a result, product “health” has become a priority at the social media companies, which are trying to balance the need to drive user growth and engagement with the outside perception that they are contributing to problems such as online bullying.
Instagram, for example, has also announced a feature where users can limit the amount of time they spend on the app in a given day. Apple Inc. built a similar “time spent” feature into its iPhone software, and Google offers tools like this for Android phones. Twitter has a beta version of its main product that hides engagement metrics, including likes and retweets, from user replies and interactions.

It’s far-fetched, but there is hope

Texto completo: Aftermath

TAMPA  It was so much more than an interception.

A game-changer? Absolutely  but still so much more.

When Jamel Dean picked off a Kyler Murray pass late in the Buccaneers win over the Cardinals on Sunday, it was a reminder, a reminder that in sports anything can happen at any time. Even when theyre not supposed to. Even in Tampa Bay.

In the closing moments of the fourth quarter, the odds were stacked against Dean and the Bucs. A week ago, the rookie cornerback had allowed three touchdowns. Murray, meanwhile, hadnt thrown an interception since Sept. 29  a span of 211 consecutive passes.

When he dropped back to pass on that fateful second-and-10 play, Tampa Bay, trailing 27-23, was hanging by a thread. Various probability models placed Arizonas chances of winning at greater than 90 percent.

Four minutes later, the Bucs were celebrating their first home win of the season.

Could it be? A turnaround? Could this team make a run at the  the  p-p-p-playoffs?

Crazy talk, you say? Youre probably right. After all, Tampa Bay, at 3-6, is 17 times more likely to land a top-five pick in Aprils draft than it is to reach the postseason.

Even so, coach Bruce Arians has been clear on a couple of points:

1.) For better or worse, he has no intention of looking toward 2020.

2.) He doesnt care or understand probability. The man isnt afraid to waste timeouts, but going for it on fourth down? Nope, too risky.

Much would have to fall the Bucs way for them to make the playoffs, but we were able to chart, with the help of the New York Times playoff calculator, a somewhat realistic path to them being in the picture heading into the final weekend of the season. All aboard the crazy train!

 The Bucs can help their cause by, you know, winning more often. Even if they win their next six games, however, their chances are still worse than a coin flip.

Besides, Tampa Bay is not going to win six straight games. This is an average team that, more often than not, has found ways to lose. We have to build in at least some margin for error.

Say the Bucs lose as expected Sunday to the Saints (FiveThirtyEightgives New Orleans a 69 percent chance of winning). That would be a crushing blow, but it wouldnt necessarily be a season-killer. Their five opponents after that: Falcons (away), Jaguars (away), Colts (home), Lions (away) and Texans (home). Those are all winnable games. Its conceivable that they could be 8-7 heading into Week 17.

 Lets concede the NFC South to the 7-2 Saints. The goal is to clinch one of the conference wild-card slots. As of today, there are eight teams in front of the Bucs (nine if we count the NFC East-leading Cowboys, who easily could fall back into the wild-card picture): the Seahawks, Vikings, Rams, Eagles, Panthers, Bears, Lions and Cardinals.

 The Bucs would need either the Seahawks OR the Vikings to lose almost all of their remaining games. Its unlikely, of course, that either team will do that, but its more likely for the Seahawks, who are the weaker team and have the NFLs most difficult remaining schedule. Weve seen such a collapse before: The 1994 Eagles started 7-2 and lost their final seven games.

 So say the Seahawks lose their next six and are 7-8 heading into Week 17. What else would need to happen for the Bucs to climb back into contention? Assuming again that they lose to the Saints and beat everyone else, every team presently in front of them could win all of their home games but would need to lose all of their road games. Thats a little too clean, but its not all that far-fetched, is it?

 If everything fell into place, these would be the NFC wild-card standings heading into Week 17:

Vikings: 10-5

Eagles: 9-6

Bucs: 8-7

Panthers: 8-7

Cardinals: 7-7-1

Bears: 7-8

Cowboys: 7-8

Rams: 7-8

Seahawks: 7-8

Lions: 5-9-1

In this scenario, the Vikings have clinched one of the conferences two wild-card slots, and the Eagles have clinched the NFC East, leaving seven teams in the running for the second wild-card slot: the Bucs, Panthers, Cardinals, Bears, Cowboys, Rams and Seahawks.

 That gets us to Week 17 with the Bucs still alive. Their chances of making the playoffs: 38 percent. To get to 100 percent, two things would have to happen, both of which are realistic. They have to beat the Falcons, and the Saints would have to beat the Panthers.

Chances are Tampa Bay wins maybe three more games, finishes 6-10 and misses the playoffs for the 12th straight season. Well assess what went wrong and debate where to go from here.

But today? Lets linger a little while longer on the statement Dean made when he intercepted that pass Sunday: This thing isnt over yet.

Regulation in the Digital Age

Texto completo: The nation's tech giants, once celebrated as corporate heroes, are suddenly seen as bullies in the schoolyard of the American economy.
In recent months, federal agencies, states and Congress have started investigating the market power and potential anticompetitive behavior of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, collectively known as Big Tech.
What, if anything, should be done to rein in the Big Tech companies? New rules? Tougher enforcement? Break them up?
That is a hot topic in the United States, and in other countries. And it was a theme at The New York Times DealBook conference last week, addressed most pointedly by two participants: Makan Delrahim, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and Bill Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft, the target of the government's last big case against a technology company.
Policing the Big Tech companies, Mr. Delrahim said, should be left to the nation's federal competition officials rather than beefed-up regulation.
Congress is looking at creating a new digital authority or significantly expanding the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the tech giants. In congressional hearings, expert witnesses have made that recommendation.
Other countries, including Australia and Britain, have either set up or are creating regulatory agencies focused on digital markets, as a way to respond more quickly to allegations of anticompetitive practices and other abuses.
"I hope we don't go there," Mr. Delrahim said.
Antitrust laws, dating back a century, he said, should be nimble and flexible enough to cope with competition issues in the fast-moving digital markets. "That's the challenge for us," he said.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Traditional antitrust enforcement has relied on higher consumer prices as a key signal of monopoly power and anticompetitive behavior.
But the internet services from Google and Facebook are free to consumers. The old yardstick no longer applies, prompting calls for new rules for the digital giants.
Prices matter, Mr. Delrahim said, but he emphasized that they were only one consideration in antitrust enforcement. Others, he said, are the impact a dominant company's actions have on consumer choice, quality of service and innovation.
Free offerings are not new in antitrust law.
In the Microsoft case in the 1990s, Mr. Delrahim noted, the company bundled its Internet Explorer browsing software to its dominant Windows system as a free add-on. That undermined competition from a new competitor, Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer in internet browsing software.
At the time, Mr. Delrahim was a young lawyer working on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held hearings on Microsoft. Asked if he were in the Justice Department then, would he have pursued the Microsoft suit?
"I absolutely think that was a case to bring," Mr. Delrahim replied.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Gates disagreed. And he recalled his time at the center of an antitrust case and the personal and corporate energy consumed by it.
Microsoft was found guilty of repeatedly violating antitrust laws, and in a settlement agreed to stop some tactics.
Asked if the suit made the technology market more competitive, Mr. Gates said: "No. Everyone else can say that if they want. It's not true to me, and I will never change that opinion."

Still, Mr. Gates said, the lawsuit hurt Microsoft, distracting him and the company from moving quickly enough in new markets, like mobile computing and cellphones. "But that's not a pro-consumer thing," he said.
The most drastic remedy would be to break up the Big Tech companies. The most detailed proposal is a split-up plan for Facebook from two antitrust experts, Scott Hemphill of New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University, and Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook.
They propose forcing Facebook to shed two companies it acquired -- Instagram, a photo-sharing service, and WhatsApp, a messaging service. Those purchases, they say, were the biggest ones in a Facebook campaign to take over nascent competitors. A century ago, Standard Oil was broken up under a similar theory of "predatory" acquisitions as an anticompetitive strategy.
At the DealBook conference, Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, was skeptical that breaking up Big Tech companies would be an appropriate or effective solution to the perceived problem: the power the companies have over the economy and public discourse.
"Don't think that if you were to peel off WhatsApp and Instagram, that all of a sudden solves that problem," he said. "You still have two and a half billion people on Facebook."
He also defended big companies buying small ones as often vital to accelerate the spread of innovation, given the greater reach and resources of large corporations. Buyouts can also be extremely lucrative for the sellers, as it was for the fledgling Instagram in 2012. "When someone comes to you and offers you $ 1 billion for 11 people, what do you say?" Mr. Systrom said.

Texto completo: Five Naval Academy graduates were aboard the USS Grayback in February 1944 during its final combat mission of World War II, including commanding officer John Anderson Moore.
Cmdr. Moore was among 80 sailors aboard when the boat disappeared on Feb. 26, and was presumed to have died with the rest of his crew. The exact whereabouts of the sub remained a mystery for 75 years.
Sunday, a team of ocean explorers confirmed they had located the wreckage of the Grayback, one of the most successful U.S. submarines during the war. It was located about 50 nautical miles south of Okinawa in June. The group, led by undersea explorer Tim Taylor, spent the past few months searching for relatives of the crew, he told ABC News.
The Grayback sailed out from Pearl Harbor toward the East China Sea on Jan. 28, 1944 and sank at least two Japanese cargo ships in its path, according to the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command.
It was due to return on March 7 of that year, but it never did. The submarine was attacked about two weeks earlier and "exploded and sank immediately," according to Japanese reports cited by the Navy. A Japan aircraft struck the submarine with a 500-pound bomb.
The Grayback is the fifth submarine discovered by Taylor's Lost 52 Project, which aims to find the 52 U.S. submarines that were lost in World War II. The location of the vessel remained unsolved for so long because of one wrong number in coordinates recorded by the Japanese navy. A 1949 document with approximate locations for each missing submarine was translated from Japanese into English with one digit wrong in the longitude and latitude of the site the Grayback was believed to have sunk, The New York Times reported.
The error was reportedly detected last year by an amateur researcher. The submarine was destroyed in its 10th and most successful patrol, in which it had sunk more than 21,000 tons of shipping belonging to enemy forces, according to the Navy.
Moore graduated from Annapolis in 1932, according to USNA Virtual Memorial Hall, an online list of graduates who have died in service to their company. It is maintained by Run To Honor, an organization of Naval Academy alumni founded in 2007.
Known as "Johnnie," Moore came to Annapolis from Arizona. He was on his second patrol aboard the Grayback at the time of his death.
According to the website On Eternal Patrol, a private listing of members of the U.S. submarine service who have died in combat, the four other academy graduates serving aboard the sub when it was sunk were:
Cmdr. Raymond Leon Mayo, Class of 1930. Mayo was on his third combat patrol aboard the sub.
Lt. Cmdr. Carthel Hill Smith, Class of 1940.
Lt. William C. Roy Jr., class of 1942.
Lt. j.g. Melvin Clyde Phillips, Class of 1944.
Naval Academy offices were closed Monday, and a spokesperson was unavailable for comment on the discovery.
Two sailors from Maryland also were aboard the sub when it disappeared, Quartermaster 3rd Class Ralph Bloodsworth of Baltimore and Electricians Mate Richard Hitch of Wicomico County, according to On Eternal Patrol.

Texto completo: A prominent software developer said on Twitter that the credit card was "sexist" against women applying for credit.
Something curious happened when a husband and wife recently compared their Apple Card spending limits.
David Heinemeier Hansson vented on Twitter that even though his spouse, Jamie Hansson, had a better credit score and other factors in her favor, her application for a credit line increase had been denied.
Mr. Hansson, a prominent software developer, wondered how his credit line could be 20 times higher, referring to Apple Card as a "sexist program" (with an expletive added for emphasis).
The card, a partnership between Apple and Goldman Sachs, made its debut in the United States in August.
"My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time," Mr. Hansson wrote Thursday on Twitter. "Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does."
Mr. Hansson's tweets caught the attention of more than just his 350,000 followers.
They struck a nerve with New York State regulators, who announced on Saturday that they would investigate the algorithm used by Apple Card to determine the creditworthiness of applicants.
Algorithms are codes or a set of instructions used by computers, search engines and smartphone applications to perform tasks, from ordering food delivery to hailing a ride -- and yes, applying for credit.
The criteria used by the Apple Card are now being scrutinized by the New York State Department of Financial Services.
"Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law," an agency spokeswoman said in a statement on Saturday night.
"DFS is troubled to learn of potential discriminatory treatment in regards to credit limit decisions reportedly made by an algorithm of Apple Card, issued by Goldman Sachs, and the Department will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex," the statement said.
An Apple spokeswoman directed questions to a Goldman Sachs spokesman, Andrew Williams, who said that the company could not comment publicly on individual customers.
"Our credit decisions are based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law," Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Hansson did not respond to an interview request on Saturday night.
His wife's experience with the Apple Card, the first credit card offering by Goldman Sachs, does not appear to be an isolated case, however.
Steve Wozniak, who invented the Apple-1 computer with Steven P. Jobs and was a founder of the tech giant, responded to Mr. Hansson's tweet with a similar account.
"The same thing happened to us," Mr. Wozniak wrote. "I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019."
In addition to Goldman Sachs, Apple partnered with Mastercard on the Apple Card, which the companies hailed as a revolutionary "digital first" credit card that had no numbers and could be added to the Wallet app on the iPhone and used with Apple Pay.
A spokesman for Mastercard, which provides support for Apple Card's global payments network, referred questions to Goldman Sachs.
Mr. Hansson, a Danish entrepreneur and a California resident, is known for creating Ruby on Rails, a popular computer coding language used to create database-backed web applications. He is an author and a decorated racecar driver on the Le Mans circuit, according to a biography on his website.
In a subsequent tweet, Mr. Hansson said that the Apple Card's customer service representatives told his wife that they were not authorized to discuss the credit assessment process.
Mr. Hansson said that customer service employees were unable to explain why the algorithm had designated her to be less creditworthy but had assured his wife that the bank was not discriminating against women.
An applicant's credit score and income level are used by Goldman Sachs to determine creditworthiness, according to a support page for the Apple Card. Past due accounts, a checking account closed by a bank for overdrafts, liens and medical debts can negatively affect applications, the page stated.
On Friday, a day after Mr. Hansson started railing on the Apple Card's treatment of female credit applicants, he said his wife got a "VIP bump" to match his credit limit. He said that didn't make up for the flawed algorithm used by Apple Card.
Mr. Hansson said many women had shared similar experiences with him on Twitter, and urged regulators to contact them.
"My thread is full of accounts from women who've been declared to be worse credit risks than their husbands, despite higher credit scores or incomes," he said.

Every Photo Tells a Story. His Spoke Volumes.

Texto completo: Sam Falk's pictures for The New York Times brought a vivid sense of art to its pages.
"To tell the story, completely and instantly," was how Sam Falk described his mission as a photographer.
A staff photographer at The New York Times from 1925 to 1969 -- a turbulent and transformative era in American history -- Falk brought a sense of timing, framing and narrative that enriched the visual sensibility of the paper. For just 3 cents, the reading public could see pictures that could have just as easily hung in a museum. In fact, many later would.
"Mr. Falk brings us into even more intimate communion with the city," wrote one reviewer of "New York: True North," a book from 1964 featuring Falk's work. "He has a reporter's knack of being in the right place at the right moment and an artist's ability to capitalize on the moment. With equal skill he shares with us a darkling glimpse of some crapshooters caught by police under a streetlamp, a sunny moment while little girls romp beside the lake in Central Park and the concentration of some British diplomats in huddled conference at the United Nations."
"Sam was a gem," said Barton Silverman, an award-winning photographer who joined the paper as a photo lab technician in 1962 and worked as a staffer from 1965 to 2014. When Mr. Silverman started, Falk was working for the Sunday department, where he had been since 1951, photographing news features, covers for The New York Times Magazine and portraits of luminaries such as Nina Simone, Marcel Duchamp and Sidney Poitier.
Mr. Silverman remembered Falk as a meticulous photographer and a storyteller who encouraged the younger staff members, explaining: "Everybody respected him. He had carte blanche anywhere he went."
Kathy Ryan, the current director of photography at the magazine, was working on the 1996 centenary photography issue when she first saw Falk's work. "I thought, 'Whoa, who is this Sam Falk?' He's a really good photographer. And that was it," she recalled. Drawing comparisons to such foundational photographers as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Elliott Erwitt and Bruce Davidson, Ms. Ryan sees in Falk's work a "total appreciation for the observed moment."
Falk emigrated to New York from Austria as a child, and was still in high school when he sold his first photograph, a box-camera image of a streak of lightning, to The New York Morning World. After spending a few years working for a commercial photographer, he joined The Times in 1925, just as photojournalism was beginning to come into its own. By the time he retired in 1969, pictures had become an essential way of presenting the news.
Falk and his camera witnessed events from the Lindbergh kidnapping trial to V-E Day observances in Midtown Manhattan. He also shot sports, later stating that such assignments were the best training for a press photographer, to develop a "lightning sense of timing." Between 1925 and 1964, he had more than 20,000 photographs published in The Times.
Along the way, he decided that the standard camera for newspaper photographers, the 4x5 Speed Graphic, was too cumbersome, and he began to also use a smaller, 35-millimeter camera. (Staff photographers, including Falk, also used a Rolleiflex 120 camera.) In a conversation published in 1955, Falk lamented the bulkiness of a large-format camera: "Occasionally I hear press photographers say, 'Don't look at the camera.' They are trying to get that candid-type picture. But how can you possibly get a candid picture with that thing?" With the 35-millimeter, Mr. Silverman said, "you picked it up and nobody knew when you were making a picture or not."
Falk was one of the first at the paper to experiment with the 35-millimeter format. In addition to enabling more candid photographs, the 35-millimeter could shoot better in available light. The Times's photo department didn't have the equipment to process 35-millimeter film, however, so Falk bought a camera and developing tank with his own money. In an interview with Popular Photography in 1981, he remembered being chided: "Why can't you leave things alone; everybody else is using the Graphic; why do you have to be different?" Falk's persistence was not misplaced. The Times eventually converted to 35-millimeter cameras and relied on them for decades.
"Camera-wise, I think that really changed the way a photographer could go out and document," said Mark Lubell, executive director of the International Center of Photography. "I mean, you could really begin to capture that sort of day-to-day life in a way that technically might not have been possible before. And I think that's what you see a great deal of in Sam's work, is the ability to tell a personal story without sort of alerting the subjects."
In a photograph of dancers taken at a nightclub in 1964, for instance, Falk captured a scene in motion, with moments of velvety definition: the hanging lanterns, the man's raised arms, the woman's necklace. The mood is intimate, drawing you closer, and the chasm of time between when Falk pressed the shutter and now is compressed in an instant. You're there, in the scene.
Todd Heisler, a Times staff photographer since 2006, noted that "great photographers just seem to leave enough room in their frame for serendipity."
"Being a news photographer for a daily newspaper you have to make images every day," Mr. Heisler said before discussing Falk specifically. "Whether it was an image of the subway or a construction photo, or anything that's really mundane, he really made something beautiful out of it. That level of consistency and sophistication is really special for his time."
Falk's work is imbued with his love of New York, from his row of silhouettes framed against a blazing neon movie marquee, to his view of passengers at the old Pennsylvania Station. As he once put it, "There is nothing equal to the adventure of discovering something different in ever-changing New York City."
It's something Ms. Ryan sees in his work. When asked what she would assign Falk today, she responded: "Something that he could fall deeply in love with. A subject that you could see his tremendous fondness for. Because my favorite pictures are ones like this one of papers going on the truck outside the Times building. Or the ones that he did of couples in love. The ones that he did where you can just see that he's completely enamored of New York City."
This love of the city and its people may have inspired Falk, in 1948, to find the owner of some lost negatives. Falk had bought a camera at an auction for property lost on the subway, only to discover it contained exposed film. It showed a couple's wedding day, at a church on East 13th Street. In one of the photos, a license plate number was visible, and Falk used it to track down the camera's owner -- a professional photographer and friend of the couple -- and returned the developed negatives. More than a year after getting married, the happy couple, Peter and Mary Kichura, finally saw their wedding photos.
Falk died in 1991, at the age of 90, but even during his lifetime his work was repeatedly honored by galleries and museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian Institution, which devoted a solo exhibition to his photographs that ran for more than a year. In 1952, Falk received a citation from the City of New York, for his contributions to the "furtherance of the best aspects of life in this metropolis and advancement of the good will of its people."
The previous year, Falk had gone to Flushing, Queens, and positioned himself poolside to capture the Aquazanies, an acrobatic diving troupe. In the photograph, the divers hurtle like rag dolls toward the water below. The diving board juts out from the edge of the picture, the backdrop is an expanse of sky, but the focus is on the figures -- always falling, never landing -- suspended in everlasting motion.

Texto completo: In her new audiobook "Self-Tanner for the Soul," the quasi-reformed party girl tells listeners that you can, in fact, run away from your problems.
These days, Cat Marnell wakes up at 9 a.m. -- "early for me," she said.
She had been providing examples of her reformed life, including that she does Pilates videos on YouTube and sleeps every night, "for, like, a long time." She was sitting atop a picnic table in an empty private courtyard in Alphabet City, an impromptu interview setting she landed on after an hourlong, failed search for the treehouse where she used to smoke angel dust.
That was the old Cat Marnell, which she chronicled in her best-selling 2017 memoir, "How to Murder Your Life." The book showed her juggling an intense career as an up-and-coming magazine writer (at Lucky, xoJane, Vice) with an even more intense dependency on prescription pills; in defiance of other hard-partying confessionals, she didn't pretend to have conquered her addictions by the end. After she finished this anti-recovery memoir, she hit rock bottom. That's where her latest project, an Audible Original audiobook called "Self-Tanner for the Soul," picks up.
"It's said that you can't run away from your problems," Marnell, 37, said into a microphone in Audible's Newark studios in July, wearing an off-the-shoulder peasant dress, her black eyeliner thick, her wig platinum. She was reading aloud from the diary she kept during her two-year solo tour of the youth hostels, all-night supermarkets and grimy public beaches of Europe and Asia. "But guess what, babes? Untrue. Of course you can. You can do it fabulously."
Back in June 2017, when she impulse-bought a one-way ticket from J.F.K. to Lisbon -- the first of several flights she would miss -- the problems she had to run away from were many. She had achieved a kind of downtown Manhattan notoriety writing articles with headlines like "The Cockroach and the Cokehead" and "Trippy Terror Tuesday: Fantastic Hemp-Based Beauty for Vaguely Consensual + Very Stoned Hippie Sex Cult Orgies," all in deliciously strung-out prose.
The only thing was, she was strung out. One night in 2017, just before she was set to start promoting her book, she burned off all her hair and flooded her Chinatown apartment while high on Adderall. "It was complete beauty Chernobyl," she said, the culmination of substance abuse that stretched back to when she was 15. "Everything that I'd been doing my whole life caught up with me. All of a sudden, the inside matched the outside."
A few months later, she left New York City with little more than a Samsonite suitcase (nicknamed "Sammy") packed with neon wigs and amphetamines.
"Self-Tanner for the Soul" -- a title Marnell came up with forever ago, and here was the perfect chance to use it -- is a rambling tale of bus rides and breakfast-buffet binges, from Naples to Krakow and every consonant-laden town in between. As she recorded it in the studio, she interrupted herself with asides: "Cool, Cat, another airport? Fascinating." But she was committed in this project to authenticity, to telling it like it was. "This one was meant to be a break from writing writing," she said. In the introduction, she wrote a disclaimer that has since been cut: "These diaries are NOT what I'd call 'well-written.' They're just ... ME."
Her agent Byrd Leavell said that because of the debauchery, the drugs and the self-deprecation, people constantly underestimate Marnell.
"There's this magnificent brain that's inside that whole package," he said. "Cat is the first one to dismiss it, to always joke about whatever she's doing. But you realize, with the level of drug addiction she was essentially surviving, and then going to work, way back in the day, how tough she is, and how driven she is."
For Marnell, it is important that we not look at "Self-Tanner" as her Next Big Book, but as a real-time account of a journey that helped her get, if not quite healthy ("I'm definitely not in recovery"), then at least "the healthiest I've ever been," she said.
The result? "I think it's the most honest thing I've ever written," she said. "Because it's not glamorous at all. It's just a tired person moving through the world. And that's real."
As she describes in the audiobook, she begins as "still the crazy person I was in New York" but finds that Europe doesn't have the same tolerance for an adult woman parading around in a green wig, oversleeping past checkout time. "Also I was miserable because there's nothing going on at night anywhere," she said. "When I got there, I was dressed like I was in New York, it was like costumes, and by the end of it I dressed really normal. I just wanted people to like me. It really, really helped me."
After visiting more than 60 countries in two years, she felt she needed to come back to reality. "Actually, travel is kind of empty. That's what I've learned," she said. Since finishing the audiobook, she has been staying at her mother's house outside Washington. "She's very different now," said her mother, Stacey Marnell, certain that her daughter is no longer using.
"I knew her in all the dark days of her book as someone who couldn't keep a routine, couldn't focus," she added. "She's so focused now. If anything it's a little bit annoying, because her day revolves around an exercise class that she's doing on the floor of my living room."
But for Cat, reconciling herself to a more sober, more "normal" life has been a challenge. She started to well up recalling what came before: the "devastating" end of a toxic, eight-year on-again-off-again relationship; the 97-pound frame she had at her sickest ("I'm trying to embrace the fact that I'm never going to have that drug-addict body again, but of course I want it"); the dissolution of her so-called friendships with the graffiti artists who never knew she was smart or funny because they "never talked to me like a normal person." "I've really lost all my confidence," she said.
But then she tapped into that nonchalant resilience, the same instinct she must have used to whirl around the world alone, or to save her own life O.D. after O.D. "I need to let go of this stuff," she said, like she really meant it. Maybe she'll date, have a kid, move to London, maybe she won't. "What I'm excited about now is actually being a writer again."
A man appeared at the gate of the courtyard to tell us he was locking up, and stared at Marnell, as almost every passer-by does. "You look like an anime character with those lashes," he said to her.
"Thank you! Anime is always what I'm going for," she sang back, brushing past him onto the sidewalk.
Marnell slipped out of cartoon-doll mode just as easily as she'd slipped into it. "This next book I'm going to do is going to be so good. I'm not doing it voicey and bubbly. I'm doing it real tight, and focused, almost like poems are," she said. "I can do that. I know I can."

Texto completo: Readers respond to Nicholas Kristof's column about the drop in those who identify as Christians in the United States.
To the Editor:
Re "Less and Less a Christian Nation," by Nicholas Kristof (column, Oct. 27):
The drop in those who identify as Christians in the United States is not a result of the non-politically correct views of some churches. The fact of the matter is that the mainline churches, which for the most part acquiesced to popular social trends, have had the greatest decrease in church attendance.
A 2017 article in The Washington Post speculated that if present trends continue, mainline churches have only 23 Easters left.
Thoughtful observers believe that although social issues are important, the lack of a transcendence is mainly responsible for the lack of church relevance to contemporary society.
The rise in "nones" for both Catholics and Protestants should be a wake-up call that the New Coke is not selling.
(Rev.) Michael P. Orsi
Naples, Fla.
The writer is a Catholic priest.
To the Editor:
I agree with Nicholas Kristof.
I grew up in a Christian home, and I continue to practice my faith even now that I am living on my own in college. I have heard the things Mr. Kristof mentions -- bigotry, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia -- and it breaks my heart because that is not how Christianity should be represented.
The problem is that most of the time people focus on the bad rather than on the good. It is true that some people who claim to be Christians are sexist, homophobic bigots, but the overwhelming majority are not.
The overwhelming majority follow a God who teaches love, grace and justice.
Audrey Blackwell
Chicago
To the Editor:
My husband and I, who are well into our 70s, couldn't agree more with Nicholas Kristof. Our turn from Christianity was before the advent of the blowhard evangelical preachers I had previously referred to as "those who give Christianity a bad name."
Their rise has strengthened our resolve not to be identified as Christian, but we easily meet the test of those who have done something in the last week of feeding the hungry and working for a more just, equitable and loving society.
Ann M. Black
Cincinnati
To the Editor:
Many Christians have lost credibility for failing to be inclusive and concerned about the poor, the environment and climate change, and for their support of gun rights and Donald Trump.
Nicholas Kristof's column is a call to the church to follow Jesus. We delude ourselves if we think that political views are either not related to Christianity or that only these extreme views can claim Christianity.

Biden is the safe candidate for Democrats

Resumen: [...]if I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. Biden is playing to the middle, at least compared to other candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), who has a variety of crazy schemes which include eliminating private health insurance, free college for all, eliminating the Electoral College and a $52 trillion Medicare-for-all plan which, she says will not necessitate raising taxes on the middle class. While a recent Monmouth University poll showed Biden and Warren in a virtual dead heat, a Fox News poll of likely Democratic primary voters revealed 68 percent believe that Biden can defeat Trump, compared to 57 for Warren.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is going to win the Democratic nomination for president. I wouldn’t run to your bookie with this information. My track record is spotty, at best. But I’ll be shocked if I’m wrong and I’ll have plenty of company, including many Democrats. I don’t believe Biden is going to win because he’s putting together a great campaign or because he has the best ideas. In fact, if I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. Don’t do anything or say anything. Just kind of disappear for a while. The nomination is in the bag.
Biden will win because Democrats, in their collective heart of hearts, believe he’s the only one who can beat President Donald Trump. Sure, there will be a few more gaffes on the way to the nomination, and he might think he’s in Detroit when he’s actually in San Antonio, but that only makes him more kindly and relatable — an absent-minded uncle who pulls a silver dollar out of your ear.
If there is such a thing as a moderate Democrat these days, Biden is it. His positions on various hot-button issues, such as capital punishment and abortion have moved to the left over the years, but he has not endorsed a "Medicare for all" plan that his Democratic challengers are championing. He’s supported the "spirit" of the Green New Deal, if not the actual proposal, which left many climate activists wondering where he stands. Biden has a plan of his own, which includes elimination carbon emissions by 2050.
Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth Action, told The Associated Press in June that Biden’s commitment to climate change is "somewhat anemic."
Well played, Joe. A solid, C-plus, right in the meaty part of the curve.
Biden is playing to the middle, at least compared to other candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), who has a variety of crazy schemes which include eliminating private health insurance, free college for all, eliminating the Electoral College and a $52 trillion Medicare-for-all plan which, she says will not necessitate raising taxes on the middle class. This, of course, is a lie. There aren’t enough rich people in this country to pay for Warren’s Golden Corral, all-you-can-eat, entitlement buffet.
The media love Warren but they also loved Hillary Clinton. They’re just bored with Biden. He doesn’t move the needle much either way. He’s neither particularly inspiring nor overtly offensive. And this is why he’s going to win the nomination.
While a recent Monmouth University poll showed Biden and Warren in a virtual dead heat, a Fox News poll of likely Democratic primary voters revealed 68 percent believe that Biden can defeat Trump, compared to 57 for Warren.
But here’s some news that should give Democrats the heebiest of jeebies; according to a New York Times/Sienna College survey, Trump trails Biden but leads Warren in the battleground states that will ultimately decide the election.
Think about that for a second. Looming impeachment, low approval ratings, unrelenting attacks from a media that can’t stand him and still, Trump is competitive in swing states. Considering that the Democrats are actively involved in a primary and Trump really hasn’t started campaigning yet, Democrats should be worried.
If they want to give Trump a gift, they should nominate Warren.
To be sure, there are many progressives who believe Biden is too moderate, too centrist, and that he does nothing to energize younger voters. His nomination, they say, would lead to a repeat of 2016.
Biden is, indeed, the safe, establishment candidate. You might argue that so was Hillary Clinton. But she had baggage Biden doesn’t — too many people just didn’t like her. Warren has likability issues as well, along with an extreme agenda. Will moderate, blue-collar, union-member voters in states like Michigan and Wisconsin vote for Warren? For what it’s worth, the Times survey says "no."
Of course, the Democratic Party will eventually support whichever candidate starts winning primaries and will jettison the others, much like the crew of the Star Trek Enterprise jettisoned Mr. Spock in Wrath of Khan. But for Democrats who believe in an alternative to tepid, "middle-class Joe," I leave you with the words of Spock himself: "It is curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want."

Biden aides were concerned with optics of son's position with Ukrainian gas company

Texto completo: Aides to former Vice President Joe Biden were reportedly worried about the appearance of his son's employment with a Ukrainian gas company while his father was still in office.
Sources described as "people who worked with his office" told the New York Times that his staffers were concerned about the optics of Hunter Biden's employment on the board of Burisma while his father was publicly railing against corruption in the country.
"Hunter Biden’s activities struck many of the officials working on Ukraine policy as an unnecessary distraction, or worse," the publication reported Sunday. "Mr. Biden’s own aides were so worried about the optics, they enlisted State Department officials to gather facts to determine how to handle the story, according to people who worked with his office."
However, "few, if any, had raised the issue with Mr. Biden directly when it first arose." Most viewed Hunter Biden's position as an issue that was "simply not worth risking a scolding from Mr. Biden, who had reacted angrily when Mr. Obama’s aides raised the issue of his son’s lobbying during the 2008 campaign."
Others pointed to the personal loss of his son Beau Biden as another reason why aides shied away from discussing the matter with him.
Instead, they resorted to pushing the "private citizen" talking point about Hunter Biden, with a former adviser saying, "The independent activities of an adult child simply don’t create a 'conflict of interest' for the parent who is a public official."
Biden's son made $50,000 a month during his employment with the company, which he has since admitted was "poor judgment." The Bidens have insisted they did not discuss the younger's work and that the elder Biden simply told him, "I hope you know what you're doing" when he learned of his employment.
President Trump has accused the 2020 Democratic front-runner of corruption for his son's involvement with the Ukrainian company during his vice presidency. During a July 25 phone call, he pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, a conversation that launched House impeachment proceedings last month.

Texto completo: "There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true."
Ken Goldstein
Political scientist who conducts his own polls
With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true."

Texto completo: Two sides to property rights

Eight years ago, I bought my dream home in a quiet waterfront residential neighborhood in Crystal River. In the last few years, our once tight-knit neighborhood became a hotbed for short-term vacation rentals. Last year, the street I live on became a parking lot full of cars, trucks, boats and trailers. Every few days, a dozen new people cycle in and out  trespassing on neighboring properties, leaving trash on the street, partying and causing traffic at all hours. Due to a grandfathered rental ordinance, city code enforcement pursued the short-term rental activity, and for now, we have a shaky peace. But for the past three years, state legislation (backed by Airbnb) has been proposed that would threaten more damage to communities by overriding the ability of local governments to regulate short-term rentals.

Similar legislation passed in Arizona in 2016. The article, They killed our city: Sedona residents confront lawmaker over short-term rentals, highlights how this has hurt the community of Sedona, another tourist destination where vacation rentals are overtaking residential housing. One legislator is quoted as saying, We never anticipated that somebody would go into a neighborhood, purchase a home and turn it into a mini-hotel. But thats what is happening.

A big argument surrounding this issue is property rights. However, bill supporters are using it to put the property rights of investors operating vacation rentals above the property rights of homeowners who dont want to live next to mini-hotels. These investor-owned homes are vacation rental businesses, and they should be designated, regulated and treated as such.

When the Hernando County legislative delegation meets on Nov. 18 at the Hernando County Government Center, I encourage community members to attend and make their voices heard. Our legislators need to represent the best interest of their constituents by protecting the well-being and quality of life in our communities.

J.D. Ross, Crystal River

What did people expect?

So, e-scooters are not all they are cracked up to be. I had to giggle at how people are riding those wonderful e-scooters: men with babies strapped to their backs, people riding on streets where they arent supposed to be, riders leaving them lying around all over the place, and now we have people destroying them.

Im sure there are many of you who think scooters are great, but there are many not obeying the rules, and we act like we didnt know this was going to happen?

Where are the cops to hand out fines to these people? Dont the companies who are renting out these nightmares know who has them so they can hand them a hefty penalty for leaving them all over the place or not obeying the rules? Serious fines would solve the problem, and it shouldnt be a small fine like texting on your phone while driving. Wait  are people allowed to text or use their smart phones while riding a scooter? What a madhouse.

Anna Carletti, Tampa

Beware of park cyclists

North Shore Park in St. Petersburg is a disaster waiting to happen. The park is being inundated by bicyclists who look to be training for the next Tour de France, cyclists talking on phones and others exercising their dogs. Few let their presence be known by word or bell. These riders are putting children and animals at risk. A simple solution would be to post a speed limit and require all riders to announce their presence or be subject to a ticket and fine.

Lee Puckett, St. Petersburg

Seeking out the truth

People have been brought to life on both sides of the issue. The problem with not caring about what other people think about us across the country and in other parts of the world is that it shows how narrow-minded those in office and the community can be. They dont want those people here anyway.

They act as if the New York Times writes only about the president  never mind all the information about issues in the rest of the world. Never mind that the Pulitzer Prize is not given out randomly. Never mind the science, the world, the arts and health news taught to those of us wanting to continue learning way after our formal educations have ended.

People with closed minds are rigid. There is no room for logic to squeeze through to give a thought that will differ from what they are convinced is the only truth. There is no room, or need, to grow.

The problem isnt that the request for digital subscriptions for Citrus County library card holders was denied. Its the reason behind it, the phrase fake news. The world knows what that means and where it comes from. Our county is famous now. I read the New York Times because I trust it. Have things been written that turned out to have not been fully vetted? Yes, and a correction is made.

The real fake news comes from the shows people with these views watch non-stop believing every lie because it fits their narrative. You cant argue with people like this. Some are very proud of this notoriety. The rest of us? Were okay because we actually know what the truth is. We are in the majority, just not in Citrus County.

A bill that will cut emissions

We should support mass transit to reduce auto traffic and pollution. We should also support legislation that prices fossil-based fuels for their negative effect on health, the environment and climate. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act introduced by Reps. Francis Rooney and Charlie Crist does that. It will incentivize the use of mass transit and electric cars, reducing pollution, by placing a fee on production of carbon-based fuels and returning the funds to citizens as a dividend.

Texto completo: The mouse puppet that she made in the late 1950s in Italy became a worldwide phenomenon, with the help of "The Ed Sullivan Show."
Maria Perego, an Italian puppeteer and the creator of Topo Gigio, the lovable mouse who became famous to American audiences as a frequent guest on "The Ed Sullivan Show" in the 1960s and early '70s and was known worldwide, died on Thursday in Milan. She was 95.
Her death was announced on her official Facebook page.
Ms. Perego, who worked alongside her husband, Federico Caldura, came up with the 10-inch-tall Topo Gigio in the late 1950s. Topo Gigio was a sort of cross between a puppet and a marionette; three puppeteers, hidden in a black background, moved various body parts with rods.
According to "Sundays With Sullivan: How 'The Ed Sullivan Show' Brought Elvis, the Beatles, and Culture to America," a 2008 book by Bernie Ilson, Mr. Sullivan saw a tape of the puppet from Italian television and booked Topo Gigio for a series of appearances on his popular Sunday-night CBS variety show. The first, the book said, was on April 14, 1963.
Ms. Perego and two other puppeteers were on hand to impart the movements, and a fourth provided Topo Gigio's voice -- but, Mr. Ilson wrote, Mr. Sullivan had not realized that someone would also have to serve as the puppet's straight man. Mr. Sullivan, who was famously wooden on camera, stepped into that task for the initial appearance, figuring he would arrange for a professional comic to take over for later ones if the bit caught on.
"It was evident from the very first appearance, however, that the chemistry between Sullivan and Topo Gigio worked extremely well," Mr. Ilson wrote. "The exchanges between Sullivan and the mouselike puppet revealed another side of the host, a warm and humanizing element."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Sullivan remained in the role of sidekick for what the book says were some 50 appearances by Topo Gigio over the years. (Other sources give higher numbers.) The appearances often ended with the mouse saying, in a thick Italian accent, "Eddie, kiss me good night."
"The line became famous," Mr. Ilson wrote, "and it was not unusual for passers-by to call out, 'Eddie, keees-a-me goood night' as Sullivan walked the streets of New York."
The exposure on the Sullivan show helped make Topo Gigio a worldwide phenomenon.
"When I was called to have my puppet perform at 'The Ed Sullivan Show' in the now distant 1960s, I could not believe it was happening to me," Ms. Perego told Italy Magazine in 2013. "It was like a dream. My puppet not only entered Americans' households, I believe he also entered their hearts."
Ms. Perego was born on Dec. 8, 1923, in Venice, and later moved to Milan. She had homes there and in France.
In a whimsical account on the official Topo Gigio website, the mouse tells the story of how he came to be:
A Christmas tree cut out of a spongelike material caught Ms. Perego's eye as it sat in a barbershop. The material, she realized, would be just right for making new types of puppets, ones that, according to the account, "would now have soft and smooth faces, easily supporting the close-ups on television."
Also, because of the malleability of the material, a plastic foam, she could incorporate mechanisms that would allow the movement of eyes, mouth and fingers, creating a lifelike illusion.
In 1958 she and her husband began making puppets for the Italian variety show "Canzonissima" and other programs, according to the account. Sometimes when working on musical numbers they would play with the recording -- speeding it up, for instance, to get a sound that matched the personality of a particular puppet.
According to Topo Gigio's account, one day in 1959 a recording by the singer Domenico Modugno was played at fast-forward speed, and Ms. Perego exclaimed, "This is the voice of a little mouse!" A bit of cutting and sewing brought Topo Gigio into being.
At first the mouse didn't draw as much interest in Italy as Ms. Perego had hoped, so she shopped versions of it to Swiss, Dutch, German and Spanish television outlets. Somewhere along the line Topo Gigio came to Mr. Sullivan's attention, and the character really took off.
Over the years there have been Topo Gigio books, cartoons, record albums, stage shows and films. One movie, "The Magic World of Topo Gigio," drew a favorable review from Howard Thompson in The New York Times when it played in New York in 1965.
"The general tone is jaunty," he wrote, "and the perky, pear-shaped mouse is a joy to see and hear, as he outwits an evil magician and saves two pals, a golden-curled girl mouse and a tart-tongued worm with an inferiority complex. Put it all down as a nice treat for the kiddies."
The character had a particularly big following in Latin America. In 2015 Ms. Perego published a book in Italy, "Io e Topo Gigio" ("Me and Topo Gigio"), and at her death she was said to be working on a new animated series featuring the character.
"Topo Gigio is a naïve character, but with his optimism he tries to justify himself, to invent, to introduce himself and to enter into fantasy and the absurd," Ms. Perego recently said on a program on RAI, Italian state television. "He's always on the edge between imagination and reality."
Information on Ms. Perego's survivors was not immediately available.

Texto completo: The outreach may not expand the president's meager support among African-Americans, but it appeared aimed at reassuring suburban white voters discomfited by his use of racist tropes.
ATLANTA -- After a summer of racial furor, President Trump reached out to African-American voters on Friday, arguing that his economic and criminal justice policies had done more for them than decades of false promises by Democratic leaders who he said took them for granted.
Kicking off a new campaign effort called "Black Voices for Trump," the president sought to recalibrate his message as he heads into next year's re-election effort. Addressing several hundred African-American supporters who signed up to help him win another term, he vowed to compete for support across racial lines.
"We're going to campaign for every last African-American vote in 2020," he told the crowd at the Georgia World Congress Center. "We've done more for African-Americans in three years than the broken Washington establishment has done in more than 30 years." He added that "the Democrat Party already left you a long time ago" and said, "If you don't want liberal extremists to run your lives, then today we say welcome to the Republican Party."
The outreach may not expand the president's meager support among African-Americans, but it appeared aimed at reassuring suburban white voters discomfited by his use of racist tropes and incendiary language. Mr. Trump has played to the nation's raw racial divide as no other president has in the modern era, repeatedly stoking public feuds with African-American athletes and lawmakers while describing Latin American migrants as marauding invaders and rapists.
Over the summer, he demanded that four liberal Democratic congresswomen of color "go back" to their home countries, even though three were actually born in the United States and the other was a naturalized citizen. He went after Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, describing his Baltimore district as a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess" where "no human being would want to live." Mr. Cummings died last month from a long illness.
Mr. Trump has insisted over the years that he is the "least racist person you've ever met" and said it is his critics who use race as a weapon against him. Some of his supporters amplified that argument at Friday's event in Atlanta.
"Let me tell you something, if he's a racist, he's an awfully bad one," Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development and the only African-American in the cabinet, said in introducing the president. "He needs to go get a lesson from the real racists."
Yet Mr. Carson obliquely acknowledged that Mr. Trump was not popular among African-Americans. "Thank you for your courage to be here," he told the audience, assailing what he portrayed as the tyranny of the politically correct left. "It takes a lot of courage to say you're supporting President Trump."
The event was like a Trump rally in miniature. Instead of a large stadium, it was held in a conference room with about 400 people. Among them were some of Mr. Trump's most loyal African-American supporters, including Herman Cain, the pizza mogul turned 2012 presidential candidate; Alveda King, a niece of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and anti-abortion leader; and Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, two African-American sisters and internet stars better known as Diamond and Silk.
It did not go unnoticed on social media that at least a couple of the people wearing "Blacks for Trump" were actually white. The president asked the crowd whether they preferred "Blacks for Trump" or "African-Americans for Trump" and they began chanting, "Blacks for Trump! Blacks for Trump!"
The Democratic National Committee scoffed at the notion that Mr. Trump was a friend to African-Americans, citing his past statements as well as policies they say have disadvantaged blacks or removed legal protections against discrimination. "Donald Trump has shown our community his true self through his words and inaction," said Brandon Gassaway, the committee's spokesman. "All the rest is just hype."
Mr. Trump received about 8 percent of the black vote in 2016 and has an approval rating of about 10 percent among African-Americans. A poll by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research last month found that 81 percent of African-Americans believe he has made things worse for people of color while just 4 percent say he has made them better.
The president pointed to the record-low unemployment and poverty rate among African-Americans, his support for opportunity zones to promote development of impoverished areas, his financing for historically black colleges and university and the passage of the First Step Act expanding job training and early-release programs and modifying sentencing laws for nonviolent drug offenders.
"We're undoing the damage inflicted by decades of corrupt Democrat rule," Mr. Trump said.
He was correct in saying that African-American unemployment had fallen to a low, but what he did not mention was that the drop began under President Barack Obama. From a high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 as the economy was recovering from the Great Recession, it fell to 7.7 percent in January 2017 when Mr. Obama left office. Since Mr. Trump took office, it has continued to fall to 5.4 percent, meaning that it came down by just over nine percentage points under Mr. Obama and more than two percentage points so far under Mr. Trump.
Likewise, Mr. Trump's boast that African-American poverty is at a record low is true. But again, it is a trend that started under his predecessor. The poverty rate among African-Americans fell from a high of 27.4 percent after the recession to 21.8 percent in 2016, Mr. Obama's last full year in office, according to census data. It has continued to fall under Mr. Trump to 20.7 percent last year.
But there was no guarantee it would continue when Mr. Trump came to office and he has claimed the progress as among his proudest achievements. Seeking a second term, he promised to do more. "I just want to tell you very, very strongly," he said, "the best is yet to come."

Texto completo: What to Watch This Weekend
SOCCER Major League Soccer's season wraps up on Sunday with M.L.S. Cup. It is a familiar pairing: Seattle and Toronto, who faced off in the final in 2016 and 2017, each winning one title. This time, the game will be in Seattle, and that might be enough to give the Sounders the edge (Sunday, 3 p.m., ABC). Earlier, it is first versus second in the Premier League as Liverpool hosts Manchester City (11:30 a.m., NBCSN). A game that is just as big on Saturday in Germany: Borussia Dortmund's visit to Bayern Munich in Der Klassiker (12:30 p.m., FS2).
COLLEGE FOOTBALL In a late-season battle of unbeatens, Louisiana State, No. 2 in the initial College Football Playoff rankings, meets No. 3 Alabama in Tuscaloosa (3:30 p.m., CBS). It could be a battle of quarterbacks, with Tua Tagovailoa of Alabama, returning from an ankle sprain, against Joe Burrow of L.S.U.
N.F.L. The unbeaten 49ers play Monday night, and the Patriots, who lost for the first time this season last week, have a bye. That leaves a slightly less attractive slate than usual, with only two Sunday games, Panthers-Packers (4:25 p.m., Fox) and Vikings-Cowboys (8:20 p.m., NBC), featuring two teams with winning records.
TENNIS The year-end ATP Finals begin Sunday, and the eight singles players who qualified represent the driving story line in men's tennis: the Big Three (Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer) vs. the Kids. Four players age 23 or younger, including Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Matteo Berrettini, are in the event for the first time. Djokovic opens play on Sunday against Berrettini (9 a.m., Tennis Channel); Federer faces Dominic Thiem later (3 p.m., Tennis Channel).
AUTO RACING Martin Truex Jr. and Kevin Harvick have clinched spots to contend for the NASCAR title next weekend. The other two spots will be claimed Sunday in Phoenix (2:30 p.m., NBC).
ONE MORE WATCH In yoga, where sweaty bodies mix in tight spaces, what sort of touching is considered O.K., and what is not? "The Weekly," The New York Times's TV show, explores the grayest of gray areas on FX (10 p.m. Sunday) and Hulu (available Monday).
Times are Eastern.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
Warren endorsed by Pressley, Black women activist group
Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, the only member of the group of progressive first-term congresswomen nicknamed "the squad" who had not yet backed a Democratic presidential candidate, has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a longtime ally.
Pressley announced her decision in an email to supporters on Wednesday afternoon and released a corresponding video announcement.
"Elizabeth has made it her life's work to pursue justice for working families and put economic and political power in the hands of people," Pressley said in the statement. "We find ourselves in a fight for the soul of our nation, and I know Elizabeth can win it."
In choosing Warren, Pressley provided her home-state senator with her most high-profile congressional endorsement to this point and avoided ruffling feathers in the closely knit Massachusetts Democratic Party.
She also split from her congressional cohort, as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan all endorsed the race's other ardent progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, last month.
Pressley was elected to Congress last year, after a grassroots, multiracial coalition lifted her to victory over Rep. Michael E. Capuano in Boston's only majority-minority district.
She was the first Black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, and her endorsement gives Warren a prominent Black surrogate in a campaign that must gain traction with Black voters in order to overtake former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination.
Warren has done significant outreach to Black progressive groups and Democratic leaders over the past year - more than any other white candidate in the race. She earned the endorsement of the group Black Womxn this week.
The group calls Warren a "leader" and "partner" with a proven track record and understanding of structural racism and inequality who is willing to be held accountable.
The group's director, Angela Peoples, said she hopes the endorsement will encourage other Black women to support the Massachusetts senator publicly.
However, recent polls still show her trailing Biden among Black voters by almost 30 points, and she lags in South Carolina, the early primary state where Black voters make up more than 60% of the electorate.
"I have seen Ms. Warren in small church basements and in packed gymnasiums," Pressley said in her video. "And she is consistent. She never loses sight of the people.
"You've all heard about the senator's plans - but here's the thing," she added. "Her plans are about power: who has it, who refuses to let it go and who deserves more of it."
Pressley's endorsement was a must-have for Warren, who has risen sharply in polls and fundraising over the last six months but has lagged in some traditional measures of party support, including endorsements from governors, big-city mayors or fellow senators outside Massachusetts. In recent weeks her campaign has sought to reverse that trend by lining up endorsements from anti-establishment progressive champions popular among the party's left wing.
Rep. Katie Porter of California endorsed Warren over her home-state legislator, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia announced his support for Warren's campaign last month, her first endorsement from a big-city mayor.
Warren also recently rolled out endorsements from two of the country's most progressive district attorneys: Larry Krasner of Philadelphia and Rachael Rollins of Suffolk County in Massachusetts.
Krasner, who supported Sanders in 2016, received some blowback for endorsing Warren over Sanders, who remains in striking distance in most polls.
"I have not forgotten and no one should forget that Bernie Sanders, early in his prior campaign for president, said the only reason he ran was that he couldn't persuade his friend Elizabeth Warren to run for president," Krasner said in response. "I heard what he said, and I remembered what he said."
While Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib have become household names partly out of their willingness to upset the Democratic establishment, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Pressley has gained a reputation as a cautious Capitol Hill operator.
Pressley, 45, was the first nonwhite woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009 and had a robust local constituency before being elected to Congress. Unlike newcomers like Ocasio-Cortez, who speaks about how Sanders' presidential run in 2016 helped motivate her to seek elected office, Pressley was a delegate for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and has close relationships with the party's traditional power brokers. She is also considered a prospective candidate for Warren's Senate seat should Warren win the White House.
Some in Massachusetts have speculated that Pressley could play the role of television surrogate for Warren, serving as a progressive ally who would implicitly counteract perceptions of her campaign as geared toward white elites. Ocasio-Cortez., Omar and Tlaib are helping play a similar role for Sanders, and have held rallies with him in their respective home districts of New York City, Minneapolis and Detroit.
In Massachusetts, where the congressional delegation only comprises Democrats and where a contentious Senate primary is currently underway, Pressley's endorsement speaks to the high-stakes political game of who to back - and when. Pressley was not a part of the initial round of home-state endorsements during Warren's campaign launch earlier this year, leading to speculation that she would sit out the presidential primary or back Harris, the 2020 race's only Black woman.
Instead, Pressley joined Warren's cause, politically cementing the informal friendship that has existed among them for years.
In 2018, when Pressley announced plans to run against Capuano, Warren stayed out of the race - a sign the grassroots campaign Pressley had built was exceeding expectations. Now, it's Pressley playing power broker, as Warren seeks to usurp the establishment herself.

Uber’s CEO Really, Really, Really Doesn’t Like WeWork Comparisons

Texto completo: It seems everyone is distancing their business models from WeWork these days. And it’s not just real estate unicorns like Compass out to prove their sound strategy.
During The New York Times ‘ DealBook conference on Wednesday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi discussed the fate of unprofitable tech unicorns, where at one point he stressed his company’s differences from the We Company.
SEE ALSO: Uber Money Is Company’s Latest Attempt at Profitability
Khosrowshahi spoke of investors’ shifting expectations of over-valued startups going public in 2019. Like the We Co., Uber is also a money-losing unicorn with major backing by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. However, when interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin asked if Uber’s IPO in May helped it avoid WeWork’s fate, Khosrowshahi insisted that the two companies’ business models are incomparable.
“We are very, very, very different from WeWork,” Khosrowshahi said with a laugh during the interview. “Fundamentally the rideshare market is of scale, is global, is an attractive business and it’s only going to get better in a competitive market.”
The interview took place just days after Uber’s Q3 earnings revealed another quarter marred with $1.16 billion in net losses. Though in the company’s defense, the figure was lower than analysts’ expectations of $1.45 billion but caused a subsequent drop in the company’s already-struggling shares.
Following the earnings report release, Khosrowshahi assured investors that Uber is on its way to profitability. However, the rideshare company’s week continued to worsen with the news that Uber is still using self-driving startup Waymo’s technology, which was stolen by a former executive working for both companies four years ago.
During the conference interview, Khosrowshahi also said that the pressure to turn a profit has prompted Uber to pick up the slack after years of burning cash and to “perform better.”
It’s unclear how long the road will be for Uber. But as the comparisons to WeWork continue, the unicorn will need to stabilize its earnings and thus, stock value, in order to impress the public markets.

Texto completo: Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week, a new Minnesota Democratic primary poll, Omar and Sanders take to the arena and Klobuchar qualifies for the December debate. Let’s get on with this.
A new Minnesota primary poll
A new poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report is out. And with it, we get a better sense of how Democratic-leaning voters in Minnesota are feeling.
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren: 25%
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar: 15%
* Joe Biden: 14%
* Sen. Bernie Sanders: 13%
* Pete Buttigieg: 7%
* Andrew Yang: 4%
* No one else above 1%.
The last Minnesota primary poll, conducted by Change Research, had Warren at 21%, Biden at 20%, Sanders at 19% and Klobuchar at 16%. (The margin of error on the Kaiser poll is ± 2%. The margin of error on the Change poll is ± 2.5%.)
Omar-Sanders rally
Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ilhan Omar held a rally at the University of Minnesota’s Williams Arena this week, following Omar’s endorsement of the senator’s presidential campaign.
“What we are building is a multi-racial, multi-generational, working-class movement,” Sanders said to the crowd. “We are tired of the exploitation of working people of this country.”
Omar praised Sanders: “I am beyond honored and excited for a president who will fight against western imperialism and fight for a just world.”
The Sanders campaign said it would cover all expenses related to the event, which is slated to cost a total of $40,275. This comes after President Trump’s campaign said they would not pay $530,000 for police time and traffic control after his rally in the city.
New Power Generation , Prince’s longtime band, endorsed Sanders and performed at the rally.
On Saturday, Sanders will be talking climate change in Iowa. And not by himself. He will be joined by people like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), co-author of the Green New Deal, and Isra Hirsi , the co-founder of Youth Climate Strike. Hirsi is also Omar’s daughter.
Sanders aims to focus the next 100 days of his campaign in Iowa on the impacts of climate change, and what he intends to do about it if elected President.
The president next door
Klobuchar has qualified for the sixth Democratic debate, having received four polls over 4 percent. Quinipiac’s latest Iowa poll placed her at 5 percent — still well behind Sanders’ 17 percent or Buttigieg’s 19 percent — but enough to qualify and stay afloat.
The debate was supposed to be hosted at the University of California, Los Angeles on Dec. 19th, but the event was pulled due to the three year labor dispute between The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the University of California.
And something else: In the Atlantic, a story about how Klobuchar would be poised to capture the moderate crowd, if not for Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
In other news
* Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) on Wednesday announced her endorsement of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president.
* The trash battle in St. Paul is over. Amid the excitement, the crowd chants “Trash, trash, trash.” In the end, the voters decided: they will keep the coordinated trash services offered by the city.
* “Does the Minnesota Secretary of state get to decide what information about voters is public?” Read more at MinnPost.com
Quote of the week
“During a confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, Ms. Klobuchar asked Ms. Kagan whether she was on team Jacob or Edward, a reference to the ‘Twilight’ series that was popular with teenage girls at the time. Ms. Klobuchar was simply trying to lighten the mood, but Ms. Kagan looked at her blankly and replied ‘I wish you wouldn’t.’” — The New York Times on Klobuchar’s use of humor.

What I’m reading

The Washington Post Guild: A Study of Pay the Washington Post
The Washington Post’s union found that women as a group are paid less than men, and that, on average, women of color in the newsroom receive $30,000 less than white men. This is following a trend of pay studies at media organizations that are not sanctioned by the outlets, but by their unions. Interesting for many reasons, but worth asking: How can you expect coverage to be reflective of the country if you’re paying certain journalists less?
Karl Evers-Hillstrom for Open Secrets: Maxine Waters’ blue seat isn’t up for grabs. But the lucrative chance to challenge her is
Running as a Republican in a deeply blue district is unlikely to yield an electoral win. But if you can fundraise, it does lead to some nice dinners and hotel stays.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: gschneider@minnpost.com. Follow at @gabemschneider . And don’t forget to become a MinnPost member.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg is hedging his 2020 bets.
The billionaire former city mayor will file paperwork Friday to qualify for Alabama's Democratic primary, taking his first official step toward running for president while still leaving himself an escape hatch to opt out of the race, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The sources stressed Bloomberg hasn't completely made up his mind about running, but said the 77-year-old has dispatched staffers to Alabama this week to gather signatures in order to make it onto the primary ballot.
"They've totally geared up over the last few days and they're doing 'round the clock meetings," a former Bloomberg administration official told the Daily News on Thursday.
Alabama's primary isn't until March, but the state has a Friday deadline to qualify for the ballot. A candidate needs 500 signatures to make the cut.
The former administration official said Bloomberg "appears enthusiastic." However, even if Bloomberg qualifies for the Alabama primary, he doesn't have to launch a campaign, and the sources noted that he's not totally on board yet.
Top Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson claimed his boss is the ideal Democrat to "take the fight to Trump and win."
"Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that," Wolfson said in a statement. "If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America's biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America's toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist."
Some of Bloomberg's fellow 2020 hopefuls believe the ultra-wealthy New Yorker is out of touch with the modern Democratic Party.
"The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared," Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted in a not-so-subtle dig at Bloomberg amid news of his Alabama move.
Sanders' like-minded Senate colleague, Elizabeth Warren, piled on.
"Welcome to the race, Mike Bloomberg! If you're looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here," Warren tweeted, along with a link to a widget on her campaign website that allows billionaires to calculate how much they'd pay under her proposed wealth tax.
If he ultimately decides to join the race, Bloomberg would likely pose a challenge to Joe Biden, who espouses similar centrist views but has recently dropped in the polls and struggled to raise cash.
But Bloomberg's moderate policy ideals and aversion to big government solutions to health care and other kitchen table issues could make him a progressive punching bag.
He'd also join the race with less than three months to go until February's Iowa caucuses, leaving him a narrow window for campaigning and assembling a political base.
Bloomberg, who began flirting with a White House bid nearly a year ago, has faced heat from fellow Democrats over his legacy in New York, which includes the controversial stop-and-frisk policing strategy that targeted young black and Latino men.
In September 2018, Bloomberg drew a barrage of criticism after he disputed the credibility of some #MeToo victims in an interview with The New York Times.
"The stuff I read about is disgraceful - I don't know how true all of it is," Bloomberg told the newspaper.
In another head-scratcher, Bloomberg publicly announced in March that he wasn't going to run for president - a declaration he's now apparently reconsidering.

Texto completo: In his continuing support of arts education, music icon Billy Joel will be a panelist before an audience of local educators Tuesday at the Long Island High School for the Arts in Syosset.
The private event, "An Afternoon with Billy Joel and Guests," will feature the Hicksville-raised Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Long Island Music Hall of Famer speaking alongside his band's keyboardist, David Rosenthal; musician and visual artist Andy Friedman, class of 1993, a New Yorker cartoonist who also has written for The New York Times, Rolling Stone and other publications; recently retired Paul Taylor Dance Company principal dancer Michael Trusnovec, class of 1992; the American Ballet Theatre's Artistic Coordinator for Educational Outreach, Richard Toda; and Cheri Walsh, executive director of the organization Exploring the Arts, founded by Tony Bennett and his wife, Susan Benedetto.
Moderating is Robert Dillon, District Superintendent of the Nassau Country branch of BOCES, the state's vocation-oriented Board of Cooperative Educational Services, to which the high school belongs.
"We're going to have a conversation with them about arts education and why a school like Long Island High School of the Arts is a viable and important thing to have," said Theresa Schaefer-Bell, a Nassau BOCES spokeswoman. The New York Times in 2002 referred to LIHSA as "a suburban version of New York City's 'Fame' schools," a reference to the 1980 movie about students at what was then Manhattan's High School of Performing Arts.
LIHSA, founded in 1973, has programs in theater, dance, music, special effects, digital media, fine art and film. The panel discussion will be preceded by a video of successful alumni, which have included actress Heather Matarazzo ("The Princess Diaries"), of Oyster Bay.
In January 2016, six-time Grammy Award-winner Joel pledged $1 million from his foundation to help save the then financially troubled school.

World News: American Diplomat Faults U.S. on Turkish Intervention

Texto completo: The senior U.S. diplomat for northeast Syria asserted in an internal memo that the Trump administration didn't try hard enough to dissuade Turkey from intervening militarily in northeast Syria, a person familiar with the assessment said.
The memo was written by William Roebuck, a veteran diplomat who previously served as the U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, and was sent Oct. 31 to James Jeffrey, the U.S. special envoy on Syria issues, as well as to Pentagon, State Department and White House officials.
In a lengthy analysis, Mr. Roebuck acknowledged that a more forceful policy of threatening economic sanctions against Ankara and a stepped-up military presence might not have deterred Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
from ordering a military intervention in Syria.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not," Mr. Roebuck wrote in the unclassified memo, the person said. "But we won't know because we didn't try."
He also said that Turkish-backed Arab fighters that were used in the intervention have carried out "war crimes and ethnic cleansing."
The memo comes to light as Mr. Erdogan is planning to meet with President Trump on Wednesday at the White House. The memo was earlier reported on by the New York Times.
The State Department declined to comment on Mr. Roebuck's assessment. "We will not confirm or deny alleged private internal communications," said Morgan Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman. "That said, we have made clear that we strongly disagreed with President Erdogan's decision to enter Syria and that we did everything short of a military confrontation to stop it."
Turkey's intervention in Syria was preceded by an Oct. 6 phone call between Messrs. Trump and Erdogan in which the Turkish leader expressed impatience with American efforts to work with Ankara to set up a safe zone to ensure that Kurdish fighters couldn't threaten Turkey.
After the call, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of about 50 U.S. troops from two outposts near Syria's border with Turkey, and later directed the departure of the approximately 1,000 troops from the northeast part of the country.
U.S. lawmakers complained that Mr. Trump effectively gave Turkey a green light to intervene militarily, creating a vacuum that Russian and Syrian forces would move to fill, diminishing American influence in the Middle East. Administration officials have said that Mr. Trump acted prudently to remove American troops from a volatile situation.
As criticism of Mr. Trump's withdrawal decision mounted, including from Republican lawmakers, Mr. Trump directed that some U.S. forces be sent to protect an oil field in northeast Syria.
Mr. Roebuck noted in his memo that this policy switch would mitigate some of the consequences of Mr. Trump's initial withdrawal decision. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces would have some territory to use and American forces could continue to work with them in confronting Islamic State militants.
But Mr. Trump's assertions that the U.S. "keep the oil" and perhaps bring in large American companies to develop it raised another problem. Mr. Roebuck cautioned that statements about protecting the oil would reinforce suspicious in the region that Washington was secretly plotting to take over the Middle East's resources. The diplomat advised that the Trump administration instead stress that the oil belongs to the Syrian people.
On Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman signaled a change in the administration's message on Syria's oil. "The revenue from this is not going to the U.S., this is going to the SDF," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.
Mr. Roebuck, who didn't respond to a request to comment, has spent more than two decades working on Middle East issues for the State Department and has been based in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Israel and Bahrain.
He now serves as special adviser to Mr. Jeffrey and has spent much of his time as the top diplomat -- and in recent weeks, the only -- on the ground in northeast Syria.

WASHINGTON -- When officials at a government weather forecasting office assured Alabama residents that a September hurricane would not hit their state, they did not intend to contradict President Trump's insistence that it would, according to newly disclosed documents.
Instead, they were answering a deluge of questions from Alabama residents whose concerns had been raised by Mr. Trump's statements.
Hundreds of emails and other documents obtained this week through public records requests shed new light on how the weather can turn political in an administration that demands loyalty to Mr. Trump even when his positions are at odds with scientific facts. They show that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the National Weather Service, was fully aware that Hurricane Dorian was not headed for Alabama even though they issued a statement days later chastising scientists for saying just that.
"I wanted to let you know that the forecasters in Birmingham who made the clarification post for Alabama was unaware of the POTUS tweet when they made their post," Susan Buchanan, director of public affairs for the National Weather Service, wrote to NOAA officials the morning after scientists posted their Twitter message on Sept. 1 saying that "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from Dorian." Potus is shorthand for president of the United States.
"They had started getting a lot of calls from partners and the public out of the blue, asking about the hurricane and local impacts," Ms. Buchanan wrote. "They didn't know what prompted these calls, but felt they needed to clarify from an operational perspective. I hope this info helps."
It apparently did not help much. The White House continued to engage in a whisper campaign against the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., suggesting that officials there were intent on embarrassing Mr. Trump when they posted their message on Twitter.
The president then demanded aides intervene and have the agency "clarify" the scientists' position, according to people familiar with the events.
What followed was an unusual, unsigned rebuke of the Birmingham office from NOAA on Sept. 6 saying that staff members there had been wrong to categorically dispute the president's warning.
That outraged some staff members and many citizens, who emailed public relations officials at NOAA calling the rebuke a debasement of the federal government's scientific integrity, the documents show.
One NOAA meteorologist, Alex Krautmann, emailed the communications staff shortly after the statement was posted. "This statement is deeply upsetting to NOAA employees that have worked the hurricane and not fully accurate based on the timeline in question," he wrote. "Please raise this in feedback through proper channels."
Some citizens were sharper. "You have lost all credibility," one wrote to the Weather Service's office in Portland, Ore., which forwarded on the note to top agency officials.
Another asked: "Do you have any idea the damage you have done to NOAA's reputation and credibility? Do you care?"
The emails and other documents, which were reviewed by the White House before NOAA made them public, do not offer new clues about top administration officials' actions. A NOAA spokesman, Scott Smullen, said the documents demonstrated "a professional communications office handling media inquiries and normal agency operational email chatter, in addition to employee and public reaction to the issue."
The Sept. 6 NOAA statement came after Mr. Trump insisted groundlessly for five days that Hurricane Dorian would hit Alabama.
The New York Times reported that Mick Mulvaney, the White House acting chief of staff, directed Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who oversees NOAA and the National Weather Service, to have NOAA publicly rebut the forecasters. Mr. Ross warned NOAA's acting administrator that top employees at the agency could be fired if the situation was not addressed, according to multiple people briefed on the discussions.
Mr. Ross's spokesman has denied that the secretary threatened firings, and Mr. Trump denied that he gave his chief of staff instructions to disavow the forecast.
"I never did that," Mr. Trump said last month. "That's a whole hoax by the fake news media. When they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida and they talk about Alabama, that's just fake news."
But Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of NOAA, told congressional investigators that Mr. Mulvaney played a key role, according to Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Science Committee, which is leading one of three separate federal inquiries into the statement.
In a letter this month to Mr. Ross, Ms. Johnson noted that the interview with Mr. Jacobs revealed that top Commerce Department political appointees, not NOAA officials, had drafted the statement and that Mr. Mulvaney was "involved in high-level conversations" about it.
According to Ms. Johnson's letter, Mr. Jacobs also confirmed a New York Times report that he was first contacted about issuing the statement before dawn on Sept. 6. The Commerce Department officials involved in drafting the letter -- David Dewhirst, deputy general counsel; Earl Comstock, director of policy; and Julie Kay Roberts, Mr. Jacobs' deputy chief of staff and communications director -- are all political appointees. None holds a scientific degree.
The episode began the night of Sept. 1 as Dorian gathered strength over the Atlantic and headed toward the East Coast. Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Alabama, among other states, "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated."
A few minutes after Mr. Trump's tweet, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, caught off guard by worried calls from residents, posted its own message on Twitter declaring that "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama." The forecasters were correct; Alabama was not struck by the hurricane.
Mr. Trump was furious and insisted for days that he had been correct. He displayed or posted outdated maps, including one that had been apparently altered with a Sharpie pen to make it look like Alabama had been in the path of the storm.

Every year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art‘s Costume Institute Gala provides celebrities with an opportunity to adhere (or not adhere) to the prescribed dress theme, and provides civilians with the chance to ogle at the possibilities of fashion attached to a limitless budget. The Met Gala, of course, is always tied to an exhibition that commemorates the institution’s continued existence: this year’s theme nodded to the notion of camp that was first popularized by Susan Sontag. On Thursday, the museum announced that the Costume Institute’s spring 2020 exhibition will “explore how clothes generate temporal associations that conflate past, present and future.” The title of this extravaganza? About Time: Fashion and Duration .
If time as a theme sounds a little vague and open-ended, that’s because it’s supposed to. “Fashion is indelibly connected to time,” Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton told the New York Times . “It not only reflects and represents the spirit of the times, but it also changes and develops with the times.” Technically speaking, the exhibition will provide a retrospective of more than a century of fashion, beginning in 1870 and ending in the present. It will be structured around the conceptual thinking of the French philosopher Henri Bergson, who conceived of time as a thing that flows and accumulates and is resistant to the process of being fractured.
SEE ALSO: The Strokes’ Fabrizio Moretti Wants You to Invest in Old Master Paintings
In order to illustrate this “counter-chronological” mode of seeing things, garments in the exhibition will be paired with other, complimentary or juxtapositional garments from entirely different time periods. For example, a Comme des Garçons dress from 1997 could find itself paired alongside 19th century bustle ensemble. To cap things off, the Met’s press release states that none other than Virginia Woolf will serve as the “ghost narrator” of the exhibition, which essentially means that her writings will be used to give About Time: Fashion and Duration more context.
Illustrating the cyclical nature of time is a lovely conceptual idea, and it’s also a great deal of fun to imagine how the world’s most famous people will attempt to honor this through their Met Gala outfits. In an ideal world, our elegant superstars of the 21st century would show up in full, Edith Wharton-era regalia; dressed like the opera-going characters who populate novels like The Age of Innocence . However, since nuance is lost on most people, it’s more likely that Katy Perry will show up dressed like a giant clock.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said pro-lifers 'have no place' in New York — a federal judge agrees

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew Cuomo once said that pro-lifers “have no place” in New York.

On Wednesday, a federal judge moved to make that recommendation a legal reality.

“A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed for healthcare workers to refuse to provide or refer to sterilizations, abortions, and medically assisted suicide if doing so violated their faith,” the Washington Examiner’s Kimberly Leonard reports.
She adds that the order, which was handed down Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in New York, “Blocks the rule from going into effect on its scheduled Nov. 22 enforcement date.”

The Department of Health and Human Services' conscience rule, Engelmayer claims in his 147-page order, violated “administrative procedures.” Moreover, the judge adds, HHS ignored public comments.
The conscience rule "represents a classic solution in search of a problem," Engelmayer's order reads.
The HHS conscience rule makes no changes to religious liberty laws already on the books, Leonard explains. Rather, the rule creates an enforcement mechanism by which healthcare professionals can report to the Office for Civil Rights if their employer compels them to “provide, discuss, or refer” abortions. The Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, which was added to HHS in 2018, has been tasked with investigating religious liberty violations. Healthcare organizations found in violation of religious liberty laws stand to lose their federal funding.
Engelmayer objects to the Trump administration’s characterization of the enforcement mechanism as “mere housekeeping,” arguing that the HHS rule would make it difficult for employers to avoid “inefficiencies and dislocations.” Because that is obviously the most important consideration here — not that healthcare workers may be forced to violate their consciences, in violation of federal law.
Take a bow, Gov. Cuomo. You are one step closer to realizing a New York free from all those pesky pro-lifers.

Texto completo: El exalcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York, Michael Bloomberg, entre a competir a las primarias demócratas de 2020 en Alabama , según han hecho público varios medios este jueves.
El multimillonario neoyorquino dijo en mayo que descartaba concurrir a las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 pero The New York Times lanzó recientemente que Bloomberg lleva semanas sopesando su posible candidatura. Aunque el diario dejó claro que el exalcalde no ha tomado una decisión final, un vocero suyo le dijo a CNN este jueves que “es de esperar” que el hombre se presente a las primarias de Alabama.
De acuerdo al Times, un equipo de Bloomberg se ha dirigido a Alabama para recoger allí las firmas necesarias para las primarias . Aunque las primarias de Alabama no es una de las primeras, la fecha límite que tiene el candidato para presentarse es, según el diario neoyorquino, este viernes.

Michael Bloomberg Preparing to Enter 2020 Democratic Race; Former New York City mayor's decision comes as some in the party—especially wealthy donors—grumble about the leftward lurch of the party

Texto completo: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is taking steps to enter the 2020 presidential race as a Democrat, one of his advisers said, months after saying he wouldn't run.
The former New York City Mayor is preparing a possible bid out of concern that the current candidates may not be able to defeat President Donald Trump, said his adviser Howard Wolfson.
"Mike believes that Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to our nation," Mr. Wolfson said.
"Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that," Mr. Wolfson said. "If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America's biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America's toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist."
Mr. Wolfson said Mr. Bloomberg was making preparations to appear on Alabama's primary ballot. The filing deadline is Friday, and Alabama is one of 14 states holding contests on March 3, known as "Super Tuesday."
Mr. Bloomberg's move toward running comes as some in the party—especially wealthy donors—grumble about the leftward lurch of the party, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on the rise and former Vice President Joe Biden faltering in early states.
The New York Times first reported Mr. Bloomberg's plans .
If he moves forward with a presidential run, Mr. Bloomberg would join 16 other candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, including another billionaire, Tom Steyer. Mr. Bloomberg, 77, will also add to the septuagenarians in the field.
Mr. Bloomberg's possible entry comes as a Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found the majority of those surveyed—74%—were satisfied with the current field, and only 16% said they wanted another candidate to run.
Mr. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, flirted with the idea of running late last year. He'd invested tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections and made several stops in December 2018 in Iowa, where the nomination season begins with the Feb. 3 caucuses.

* Who's Running in the 2020 Race
During his three terms as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg was a registered Republican and an independent. He re-registered as a Democrat a month before the 2018 election.
Mr. Bloomberg announced in March he wouldn't run for president because of the difficulty in winning the Democratic Party's nomination.
"I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election," Mr. Bloomberg wrote. "But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field."
In August at a gun-control event that he helped finance in Iowa, Mr. Bloomberg criticized Ms. Warren for her aggressive tone toward corporations and Wall Street.
"I just said to Sen. Warren on the way out, 'Senator, congratulations, it was a nice talk, but just let me remind you if my company hadn't been successful, we wouldn't be here today,' so enough with this stuff," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Mr. Bloomberg has been a frequent critic of President Trump. "Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business? God help us," Mr. Bloomberg said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention where he endorsed Hillary Clinton. "I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one."

U.S. Didn't Try Hard Enough to Stop Turkey's Assault in Syria, Diplomat Says; Internal memo acknowledges Turkey's Erdogan might not have been stopped by more forceful policies

Texto completo: The senior U.S. diplomat for northeast Syria asserted in an internal memo that the Trump administration didn't try hard enough to dissuade Turkey from intervening militarily in northeast Syria , a person familiar with the assessment said.
The memo was written by William Roebuck, a veteran diplomat who previously served as the U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, and was sent Oct. 31 to James Jeffrey, the U.S. special envoy on Syria issues, as well as to Pentagon, State Department and White House officials.
In a lengthy analysis, Mr. Roebuck acknowledged that a more forceful policy of threatening economic sanctions against Ankara and a stepped-up military presence might not have deterred Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from ordering a military intervention in Syria.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not," Mr. Roebuck wrote in the unclassified memo, the person said. "But we won't know because we didn't try."
He also said that Turkish-backed Arab fighters that were used in the intervention have carried out "war crimes and ethnic cleansing."
The memo comes to light as Mr. Erdogan is planning to meet with Mr. Trump on Wednesday at the White House. The memo was earlier reported on by the New York Times.
The State Department declined to comment on Mr. Roebuck's assessment.
"We will not confirm or deny alleged private internal communications," said Morgan Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman. "That said, we have made clear that we strongly disagreed with President Erdogan's decision to enter Syria and that we did everything short of a military confrontation to stop it."
Turkey's intervention in Syria was preceded by an Oct. 6 phone call between Messrs. Trump and Erdogan in which the Turkish leader expressed impatience with American efforts to work with Ankara to set up a safe zone to ensure that Kurdish fighters couldn't threaten Turkey and said he wouldn't tolerate the situation.
After the call, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of about 50 U.S. troops from two outposts near Syria's border with Turkey, and later directed the departure of the approximately 1,000 troops from the northeast part of the country.
U.S. lawmakers complained that Mr. Trump effectively gave Turkey a green light to intervene militarily, creating a vacuum that Russian and Syrian forces would move to fill, diminishing American influence in the Middle East. Administration officials have said that Mr. Trump acted prudently to remove American troops from a volatile situation.
As criticism of Mr. Trump's withdrawal decision mounted, including from Republican lawmakers, Mr. Trump modified his plan and directed that some U.S. forces be sent to protect oil field in northeast Syria.
Mr. Roebuck noted in his memo that this policy switch would mitigate some of the consequences of Mr. Trump's initial withdrawal decision. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces would have some territory to use and American forces could continue to work with them in confronting Islamic State militants.
But Mr. Trump's assertions that the U.S. "keep the oil" and perhaps bring in large American companies to develop it raised another problem. Mr. Roebuck cautioned that statements about protecting the oil would reinforce suspicious in the region that Washington was secretly plotting to take over the Middle East's resources. The diplomat advised that the Trump administration instead stress that the oil belongs to the Syrian people.
On Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman signaled a change in the administration's message on Syria's oil. "The revenue from this is not going to the U.S., this is going to the SDF," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.
Mr. Roebuck who didn't respond to a request for comment, has spent more than two decades working on Middle East issues for the State Department and has been based in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Israel and Bahrain.
He now serves as special adviser to Mr. Jeffrey and has spent much of his time as the top diplomat—and in recent weeks, the only—on the ground in northeast Syria. A U.S. official said that Mr. Roebuck is considered a professional who has carried out his duties in an apolitical manner.
One striking portion of Mr. Roebuck's assessment is an accusation that Syrian Arab Islamist groups backed and paid by the Turks have carried out war crimes as part of a deliberate effort to scare Kurds into leaving northern Syria.
Ms. Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman, said that the U.S. has had concerns that Turkish-supported militias may have killed unarmed civilians and prisoners, among other abuses.
"We have raised them with the highest level of the Turkish government," she said. Turkey has said it would investigate the allegations.
Mr. Jeffrey, who is now in Ankara, is leading a U.S. delegation for talks with Turkish officials there on Friday and Saturday.
One focus of American concerns involves a push by Turkish-backed forces toward the Syrian town of Tal Tamar, which is a largely Christian area.
Turkey has said that it wouldn't take the town, but the U.S. had raised its concerns with senior Turkish officials and is monitoring the situation, a senior State Department official said Wednesday.

Texto completo: Grandparents chastising you for your ripped jeans? OK, boomer. Telling girls they can't play football? OK, boomer. Too hooked on technology? OK, boomer.
The short video clips emerging all the time on the exceedingly popular video app TikTok are always different. But the retorts — and the title of the gritty, bass-heavy song that often accompanies them — are the same: “OK, Boomer."
Those two simple words have become a favored riposte among frustrated and fed-up members of Generation Z. On social media, “OK, boomer" is used as a flippant dig against anyone young people perceive as haughty, close-minded, or unwavering in outdated points of view.
And behind the thousands of videos being created, liked, shared, and watched on TikTok, there is Peter Kuli, the 19-year-old from Lexington who produced a remixed song that's become the flash-in-a-pan anthem for his age group.
“It's been really incredible," said Kuli, a student at Champlain College in Burlington, Vt. “I didn't think I'd be at this moment when I started making music five years ago."
It's unclear where the phrase “OK, boomer" got its official start. But according to Know Your Meme, a sort of Wikipedia for documenting online catchphrases and other viral content, it's existed in nooks and crannies of the Internet for some time. You don't have to be part of the baby boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, to be on the receiving end of an “OK, boomer" insult. But it doesn't help.
“For me, saying 'OK, boomer' is essentially like a digital middle finger," Kuli said. “The people who have the power are the boomers, basically, who just aren't willing to budge" on certain political and cultural issues.
“OK, Boomer" arrived in song form in July, when Jonathan Williams, a college student from California, shared it to Twitter. It featured biting lyrics accusing older people of being racist and judgemental against kids with tattoos and piercings. The chorus is him shouting “OK, boomer" repeatedly in response.
By October, the song's music files and a capella lyrics were made available so others could make remixes. Kuli, who studies music and graphic design, stepped up to the challenge, and created his own original music that he paired with Williams' lyrics.
“I thought it would just be fun to make a rap song that just sounded really [bad] on purpose," said Kuli, who made the song in 30 minutes on a laptop.
Kuli shared his version to Soundcloud. He also enlisted Distrokid, a music distribution service, to get it on TikTok and other platforms — with Williams' blessing. It didn't take long for his rendition to get shared by others and sprout like an invasive weed, its defiant limbs branching out across the video app.
One TikTok post became two, and two became 10, he said. By the end of the first few days, there were 100 videos using his song. One hundred became 400, which soon became 700, and so on.
“It was just out of my control at that point," Kuli said. “I really didn't expect any of this to happen."
As the term's popularity with a younger generation has bloomed — most notably on TikTok — the emergence of “OK, boomer" as a “rallying cry" for Gen Z, born between 1995 and 2015, was covered by the New York Times and NBC News, furthering its usage by a larger audience and igniting tensions online between age groups.
The spotlight on the phrase as a generational motto has helped further elevate Kuli's musical persona and the song's appearance online. While hard to quantify, a cursory glance of the app Monday showed Kuli's “OK, Boomer" being used in at least 21,000 videos on TikTok, most of which mock older folks for their treatment of Gen-Zers.
“They're definitely tongue-in-cheek and they're definitely not meant to be taken too seriously, entirely," Kuli said.
Videos tagged #OkBoomer on the app have been watched 44.6 million times, though not all use Kuli's song. More appear each day.
Kuli has a manager now. The song is on Apple Music and Spotify, where it's generating modest revenue. Kuli and Williams are splitting the profits, he said. There's even a music video. And on the campus of his small private college, Kuli has earned a reputation as the kid from the New York Times article.
“This girl who was walking on the sidewalk in front of me turned around, and she was like, 'How . . . did this happen to you?"' he said. “Word got out fast. I've just been really grateful for all of it."
But the term's sudden fame will almost certainly spell death for “OK, boomer," entombed alongside phrases like “the bomb dot com" or “all that and a bag of chips."
Adam I. Cooper, an associate teaching professor in the linguistics program at Northeastern University, said in an e-mail to the Globe that “OK, Boomer" is compelling because it stands out from other slang terms for its “direct acknowledgment of this generational power imbalance."
However, he added, slang is inherently an ephemeral phenomenon — and this case may be no different.
“As awareness — if not also usage — of this expression increases over time, across multiple groups, I'd expect its potency to wane," Cooper said. “As for the sentiment underpinning it, this may be longer-lasting, until the Gen-Z community finds themselves in positions of power."
One Twitter user put it like this:
At this point, what becomes of “OK, Boomer" for Kuli is as out of his hands as how the remix spread like it did in the first place. He's just relishing in this viral moment.
“I have gotten a lot out of it and learned a lot from it and I'm seeing how people share music online and seeing how and where internet culture and music cross paths," he said. “All of this — as crazy and surreal as it's been — it's made me a lot more confident in sort of knowing where to go next."

Texto completo: There are many eco-conscious steps to take around your tech, says John Schwartz, a climate reporter. Tech can also help us see the scope of climate change.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? John Schwartz , a climate reporter, discussed the tech he's using.
What does your tech setup look like for work and at home?
It's pretty messy, and it's all about the laptop. I use a MacBook Pro that I carry back and forth. At work, The Times gives me a big second monitor and a dongle to charge the phone and tie in the backup drive. At home, I have a desk but do much of my evening research and writing in an easy chair in the living room with the laptop propped up on the chair arm.
More important than the way my system is set up is what I do with it. I have configured my computer system at work so that along with whatever stories I'm dealing with, the big extra monitor shows me a stream of photos of my grandkids, my children and my folks.
It's no news to readers that the technologies we use can make us jittery, angry and sad. There's Twitter outrage, Facebook and Instagram FOMO, and the constant nagging of email and Slack. And let's face it, writing about climate change for a living isn't exactly cheerful. So that stream of photos brings me little bursts of pleasure throughout my day, a regular lift. Similar images show up on my Apple Watch and iPhone. Why shouldn't technology bring us joy along with all that angst?
You're a climate reporter and self-proclaimed Apple lover. Many Apple fans buy every new iPhone every year. Does your knowledge of the environmental impact of yearly upgrades change your tech consumption habits?
I've been an Apple guy since buying my first ][+ in 1983. But I've never had the money to buy a new machine every year, and that kind of consumerism just isn't for me, despite my Apple fanboy ways.
I'm cheap. My car is 11 years old, and I'll drive it until it dies. I wear clothes until they get so ragged that my wife sneaks them over to the donation bin or into the trash. Even though my employer now provides my laptops, I don't push for the latest and greatest. (I've even written a book about reaching financial security.)
So my understanding of the environmental cost of replacing tech hasn't changed my habits, though it's definitely a factor people should consider when the tech press starts trumpeting the latest toys.
Buying gadgets or using any kind of online service consumes carbon and energy. In a looming climate crisis, is it possible to be an ethical tech consumer? If so, how should we go about it?
The environmental and climate costs of the technology we use are stunning. But you can minimize your carbon footprint by buying refurbished goods instead of new, holding on to them a bit longer, repairing them instead of replacing them, and resell or recycle so that your old electronic devices are less likely to show up in landfills. I have been very happy with refurbished computers from Apple instead of buying new.
If you want to incorporate ethical sourcing and low waste into your purchasing plans, there are companies like Fairphone, the Dutch social enterprise.
What is some of the most interesting tech being used to monitor climate change?
Science is so wonderfully accessible; some of the most fascinating work is there for you to read for yourself.
All you need is a screen, an internet connection and a browser to see what satellites tell us about the extent of ice loss in Greenland or river levels during spring flood season along the Mississippi River Basin.
You can find out the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the Keeling Curve site, and the extent to which the planet, or even your state, has warmed at the Ed Hawkins "Show Your Stripes" site (or check out this amazingly simple feature that shows you how much your hometown has warmed since you were born).
You can watch Katharine Hayhoe's amazing "Global Weirding" video series or be stunned by the amazing stories about climate change here at The Times.
Outside of your job, what tech products are you personally obsessed with?
For someone who loves technology, I don't have much of it in my house. My wife is a proud Luddite, and doesn't like tech for tech's sake; we don't have Alexa or HomePod or any of the talking gewgaws, no camera at the door. She yanked out all the wires for the security system that came with the house after it kept going off when the power went out.
I'm still semi-Luddite in some ways myself. I was recently visiting my daughter and son-in-law, and my granddaughter asked me to turn on "Aquanauts" for her. I couldn't even figure out how to turn on the TV. (It required the game controller to choose among the channels and subscription services.) It was a good excuse to read books instead.
Having said that, I love my Apple Watch, which has worked its way into my consciousness in ways I hadn't expected: It tracks my exercise and lets me see my notifications without having to pull the phone out of my pocket and spend way too much time on my phone.
The unobtrusive tech that gives me the most pleasure is my Jabra earbuds, which I use when I'm running and seem to be just about impervious to sweat. And the camera on my iPhone is my constant companion. I take daily pictures on my morning run and post them to Twitter and Instagram.
There's been a lot of talk about recycling, but some of it seems futile. Lots of plastics can no longer be recycled. What should we do?
Recycling is great in concept and fraught in practice. Like so many of the personal actions people try to take to address climate change, it can only do so much.
The most effective action on climate has to come from governments through major policy shifts, so the single most important personal action people can take is to vote their principles and work for candidates whose policies they favor -- not just at the presidential level, but up and down the line, since even policies at the local level can have an effect on greenhouse gas emissions and the environment.
Does that mean personal action is worthless? Absolutely not. For one thing, it reinforces that save-the-planet state of mind and serves as an example to others. For another, small things add up.

Lawmaker Seeks to Purge 'Opportunity Zones' From Wealthy Areas

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats are calling for investigations and legislative fixes in the wake of reporting by The Times.
Lawmakers are voicing mounting concerns about a federal tax incentive, known as an "opportunity zone," that is supposed to encourage investors to pump money into the nation's poorest neighborhoods.
Leading Democrats in the House and Senate have sent a flurry of letters demanding answers and action by federal agencies after recent New York Times articles detailed how wealthy investors and real estate developers, including those with ties to the Trump administration, are poised to profit on the initiative.
In August, The Times highlighted how tax-advantaged money was beginning to flow to development projects that were underway in affluent neighborhoods even before the opportunity-zone incentive was enacted as part of President Trump's tax cuts at the end of 2017. The initiative enjoyed broad bipartisan support.
An article last month described how the financier Michael Milken, a longtime friend of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's, is among the investors who stand to benefit from the way the Treasury Department is writing the rules governing the tax incentive.
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he was introducing legislation this week that would eliminate hundreds of opportunity zones in relatively wealthy neighborhoods.
Other lawmakers have written letters, citing The Times's reporting, to Mr. Mnuchin and called for investigations by the Treasury Department's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office.
The tax incentive is supposed to help struggling communities by attracting new businesses, housing and other real estate projects. If investors with capital gains -- profits on stocks, real estate or other assets that have increased in value -- invest them in one of nearly 8,800 opportunity zones, they get a discount on their capital gains tax bill, as well as the potential to avoid any future capital gains taxes if the new investment increases in value.
While the incentive has driven money into economically ailing cities including Erie, Pa., and Birmingham, Ala., much of the money has gone to projects that were already planned or being built in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods in places like Houston, Miami and New Orleans.
Two Democrats and a Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee introduced a bill on Wednesday to require funds that invest in opportunity zones to file annual reports with the Treasury that disclose details of their development projects and any new businesses.
The bill would impose $ 500-a-day penalties for failure to file the report and require the Treasury to make the reports public. The Treasury also would have to release an annual report on job creation and poverty reduction attributable to the tax break.
"It's our job to conduct oversight and ensure the zones work as intended everywhere," said Representative Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, a co-sponsor of the bill.
Mr. Wyden's bill would go much further. It would make it harder for developments that were underway before the tax break to qualify for the incentive. It also would disqualify about 200 zones that are adjacent to low-income census tracts but are not themselves poor.
"We're seeing examples that are enormously troubling" among designated zones, Mr. Wyden said in an interview, citing the Times articles. "I am proposing to terminate those zones until we get out in front of this."
A number of industries are already not permitted to benefit from the tax break, including liquor stores, massage parlors and racetracks. Mr. Wyden's bill would expand that prohibition to self-storage facilities and luxury housing, which have been popular destinations for opportunity-zone money.
Some of the loudest calls for changes in the tax incentive are coming from members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who in many cases represent poor urban areas that were supposed to see some of the biggest opportunity-zone investments.
Representatives Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, both Democrats, said they were extremely disappointed with how the opportunity-zone initiative was playing out, though they acknowledged that the results might improve over time.
Mr. Cleaver said he had spent many weekends organizing meetings in his district to bring together business leaders and local officials to try to lure opportunity-zone dollars to distressed neighborhoods in Kansas City and Independence, Mo.
"We thought the companies would be beating on our doors, saying, 'Please, please, we want to build this or build that,"' Mr. Cleaver said. "But it just hasn't happened."
Mr. Clyburn said that when a real estate project did come to his district, it was to serve college students, not poor residents.
"The program needs to be tweaked -- or it needs to experience its funeral," said Mr. Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat.
Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, one of the original sponsors of opportunity-zone legislation, said he wanted to at least make sure that the measures forcing greater transparency were passed into law.
"There seems to be unanimity and bipartisan agreement that would be nice to move the reporting requirement bill forward," he said in an interview.
But Mr. Kind said he was troubled by the heavy investment that appeared to be taking place so far in "shovel ready" real estate projects that would most likely have been built even without the tax break.
Lawmakers asked the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to evaluate the tax break, including how various census tracts were designated as opportunity zones. And at least two House committees are planning to hold oversight hearings into the tax incentive.
On Monday, the top Democrats on the two congressional tax-writing committees, Mr. Wyden and Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, wrote a letter to Mr. Mnuchin asking questions about The Times article on Mr. Milken and Mr. Mnuchin. The congressmen said it was "deeply troubling" that Mr. Milken appeared to receive special treatment.
Mr. Milken, in a five-page letter posted on his website after the article was published, said he had played no role in recommending to any government official that a county in Nevada where he had invested be designated an opportunity zone. He said he had never discussed his investment with Mr. Mnuchin.

Texto completo: To defend against shareholder lawsuits over its handling of sexual harassment, Alphabet, the parent of Google, has hired a law firm and is investigating allegations involving executives.
SEATTLE -- Alphabet's board of directors is investigating allegations of sexual misconduct and inappropriate relationships by current and former executives as part of its legal defense against shareholder lawsuits over its handling of the matters, according to documents viewed by The New York Times.
The internet giant's board formed a Special Litigation Committee of independent directors this year and hired the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore to investigate the allegations made in one such shareholder lawsuit, according to the documents.
In a statement, Alphabet confirmed that its board had formed a committee "to consider claims made by shareholders in various lawsuits relating to past workplace conduct." It did not elaborate further.
The board's actions show how it is continuing to grapple with the fallout from the way it previously handled sexual harassment at Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The shareholder lawsuits followed a New York Times article last year that revealed Alphabet's board had approved a $ 90 million exit package for a star executive, Andy Rubin, even though an investigation into a sexual harassment claim against him was deemed credible. The lawsuits accused the board of enabling the misconduct.
As part of the inquiry, Cravath's lawyers have reached out to women who made accusations against Google executives, according to the documents.
The lawyers are also looking into relationships involving David Drummond, Alphabet's chief legal officer and one of the company's most senior executives, who had an extramarital relationship with a woman who worked for him and recently married another woman from Google's legal department.
CNBC earlier reported the investigation by Alphabet's board.
News of the payouts to Mr. Rubin and other executives accused of wrongdoing, along with the continued employment of male executives who had acted inappropriately with women at Google, touched off outrage across the company and prompted a 20,000-person employee walkout a year ago.
In August, Jennifer Blakely, a former senior contracts manager in Google's legal department, published an essay on Medium about her relationship with Mr. Drummond. She wrote about how she was forced out of her position in the legal department after the birth of their son made it impossible to hide the relationship. Ms. Blakely was part of the Times article.
Ms. Blakely also said that after the two split, Mr. Drummond had affairs with other people at the company. Alphabet has not responded to Ms. Blakely's comments, but Mr. Drummond said at the time that he had never started a relationship with "anyone else who was working at Google or Alphabet."
Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, said in October 2018 that Google had fired 48 people over a two-year period in response to claims of harassment and that none had received an exit package.
The employee anger over the payouts has also pushed Google's work force to speak out about a wide range of issues, including the company's policies toward contract workers and doing more to fight climate change.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — How can we miss Joe Biden if he won’t go away?
It’s beginning to look as if Democrats don’t want him to go away at all. The betting odds, along with many of my fellow pundits, assess Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to be the likely nominee. So why, then, does Biden continue to hold a substantial lead in the national polls? And why, at the moment, is that lead growing?
The clear and simple answer has little to do with the Democratic Party’s progressive-vs.-moderate divide, which is more a theoretical chasm than a practical one. Biden’s staying power has everything to do with President Trump — and the imperative that the incumbent be defeated next November.
It now appears overwhelmingly likely that Trump will be impeached by the House and face trial in the Senate. The chance that 20 Republican senators will join with Democrats in voting to remove him from office is not zero — especially if public airing of the evidence against the president weakens his support among the GOP base — but remains, at this point, somewhere between small and minuscule.
We have no way of knowing how an incumbent president marked with the stigma of impeachment would fare in a bid for reelection, since such a thing has never happened before. But we’re likely to find out.
Hypothetical matchup polls taken over the last month show any of the leading Democratic contenders beating Trump in the general election. But almost all of them have Biden beating him by the biggest margin. A Fox News poll released Sunday, for example, showed Biden leading Trump by 12 points, while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., led him by 8 points and Warren led him by 5.
It follows that the question is how risk-averse Democratic voters will prove to be. As long as Biden looks like the surest bet to beat Trump, he’s going to be hard for any of his rivals to knock off.
A set of New York Times polls of likely voters in battleground states, released Monday, offered more good news for the Biden campaign — and bad news for his nearest competitors. They showed him beating Trump narrowly in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona, tying him in Michigan and losing by a whisker in North Carolina. In every one of those states, Biden was seen as faring better than Warren or Sanders. Warren was shown as beating Trump only in Arizona, and either losing to him or tying him in the other state matchups.
Numbers like those may be why Biden continues to lead the Democratic field in the Real Clear Politics national poll average, with 29.1%, followed by Warren with 20.6%, Sanders with 16.6%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 7.1%. At this point, everybody else in the race is basically hanging around, waiting for lightning to strike.
That is not what anyone would call a commanding lead. But it has been remarkably durable, and I see no reason to doubt it reflects the reality of the contest.
It is true that Biden’s fundraising has been anemic compared to that of Sanders and Warren. If money and passion were dispositive, Biden would already be toast. Yet something else — I believe it’s his numbers against Trump’s — keeps him in front.
What, exactly, is going to prompt the Biden collapse that so many knowledgeable observers seem to think is coming? A lousy debate performance? He has survived several of those just fine. Some kind of off-the-wall utterance at a campaign stop? Biden has been a reliable source of flubs and non sequiturs for decades, and his supporters are unbothered.
Here is another way to look at the race. If all of today’s Real Clear Politics poll averages are borne out — they won’t be, but humor me — Biden would lose to Warren in both Iowa and New Hampshire, but then beat her in Nevada and South Carolina. That would set up a showdown on Super Tuesday, March 3, when 14 states hold their primaries, including California, Texas and five Southern states where the African American vote — perhaps Biden’s greatest strength — will be crucial.
The necessity of sending this historically bad president home to Trump Tower — or now, I guess, Mar-a-Lago — so overshadows the Democratic campaign that voters are commitment-shy. A recent poll in Iowa showed that the number of undecided Democrats there increased sharply over the summer. I admit that I don’t know what’s going to happen.
But anybody who hopes to win has to get past Biden. So far, nobody has.

Biden running fourth place in Iowa: Poll

Texto completo: Joe Biden is in fourth place in Iowa, a new poll shows, offering a sobering assessment for the former vice president's candidacy less than 100 days before the nation's first nominating contest.
The Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday gives Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren 20% support, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg 19%, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 17%, followed by Biden at 15%.
The poll echoes national surveys showing Warren leading the 2020 Democratic pack, with Biden slipping further down. It's also a boost for Buttigieg, who has mired in the single digits in national polls but is now seeing investment of time and resources in Iowa pay off.
"It’s a race that is up for grabs," Quinnipiac polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement. "Half of likely Democratic caucus-goers who support a candidate say they may change their minds before February 3rd."
The Quinnipiac survey is the second this month that placed Biden in fourth in Iowa. A New York Times/Siena College poll released on Nov. 1 found Biden with 17%.
In multiple conversations with reporters, Biden's campaign team has repeatedly tempered expectations about his chances in early primary contests such as Iowa and New Hampshire. They see a path to victory in states such as South Carolina with a heavy black population. Despite outlining that strategy, a number of Biden's donors and supporters have expressed concern that early losses could spell the end of his campaign.
With the addition of the latest Quinnipiac's survey, Biden's position in the Iowa caucus has fallen further in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. He now sits six points behind Warren, two points behind Buttigieg, and is in a statistical tie with Sanders for fourth place.
The Quinnipiac poll also found Biden trailing much of the front-runners in support from young voters. Only 6% of Iowa Democrats age 18-49 support him, with 28% supporting Sanders and 24% backing Warren.
In the poll, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota sits at 5%, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4%. Other candidates earned 3% or less.
Quinnipiac surveyed 698 Iowa likely Democratic caucusgoers from Oct. 30 through Nov 5. The margin of error was +/- 4.5 percentage points.

Texto completo: Bill Gates said he remains unsure if he could get Elizabeth Warren to have a conversation with him because of his personal wealth.
In an interview at the New York Times DealBook Conference, Gates explained his criticism of a tax structure that is too liberal and damages the economy.
“I do think if you tax too much, you do risk the capital formation, innovation, ‘U.S. is the desirable place to do innovative companies,’ I do think you risk that,” he said.
Gates acknowledged that he is a “primary beneficiary” of the current tax structure but said he would be concerned if that system changed too much.
“If I had to pay $20 billion, it’s fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,” he joked.
He said that he has not spoken to Warren about her proposed wealth tax, but noted that he is not sure she would be willing to speak to him.

“You know, I’m not sure how open-minded she is,” Gates said. “Or that she’d even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.”
He was asked if he would vote for Warren over President Trump but refused to say.
“I’m not gonna, you know, make political declarations,” he said, later adding, “I hope the more professional candidate is an electable candidate.”

DNC: 2019 elections a ‘repudiation of Trumpism’

Texto completo: The Democratic Party is crowing over its victories in Tuesday’s elections in several states around the country, claiming it was a continuation of wins driven by voter concerns about President Trump.
Party Chairman Tom Perez said that elections showing Democratic gains in 2017, 2018 and 2019 prove that there is a growing voter disgruntlement with Trump.
“There have now been three elections, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and every single election has been a repudiation of Trumpism,” Perez told a media roundtable hosted by the Christian Science Monitor Wednesday morning.TweetWhile the administration pointed to a handful of wins in Tuesday’s election, it was the Democrats who came away with the biggest prizes, including taking control of Virginia’s legislature and likely the Kentucky governorship.
Perez highlighted Kentucky, where Trump just three years ago beat Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton by 29.8 points, nearly double her support.
“Donald Trump wins a state by 30 points, and he can’t drag a Republican across the finish line in that state,” he said of Kentucky Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent loss by 5,333 votes to Democrat Andy Beshear. The results could lead to a recount.TweetThe results, he added, could also lead to a new wave of House GOP retirements, which would ease the pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi going into the 2020 election.
“I think one effect of last night’s elections is that you are going to see more retirements,” said Perez, adding, “they can see the handwriting on the wall.”
And he pointed out that the Democratic Party did well in suburbs, coal country, and in presumably pro-gun areas like the counties surrounding the National Rifle Association’s northern Virginia headquarters.

Cabin crew strike grounds Lufthansa flights Lufthansa cancelled about 1,300 flights on Thursday and Friday because of a planned strike by a union representing cabin crew in Germany. The UFO union has called members out on a 48-hour strike as part of a bitter dispute with Germany's biggest airline about pay and the union's legal status. Lufthansa said Wednesday it is putting together a special flight plan and passengers will be able to check their flight's status on its website. It said that it would be able to operate 2,300 of Thursday's 3,000 planned flights and 2,400 of those planned for Friday. Around 180,000 passengers will be affected by cancellations. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
WORKPLACE
Productivity down for first time in four years American workers were less efficient in the July-September quarter, pushing down productivity for the first time since late 2015. The Labor Department said Wednesday that productivity, a measure of economic output for each hour worked, fell 0.3 percent in the third quarter. The drop comes after two quarters of healthy gains. The Trump administration promoted its 2017 corporate tax cut as a policy that would raise productivity by encouraging businesses to invest in more computers, machinery, and other equipment. Productivity did pick up in the first half of this year after growing modestly in 2018, but it now appears to be dropping back to the slow growth that has occurred since the Great Recession ended. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
APPAREL
The queen's new clothes will be adorned with fake fur Buckingham Palace says new outfits designed for Queen Elizabeth II will not use real fur. The palace said Wednesday the decision does not mean the queen will dispose of all the fur outfits she has. The palace statement says "the queen will continue to rewear existing outfits in her wardrobe." The decision pleased animal rights activists, who have sometimes criticized the monarch for the fur pieces in her collection of designer clothes. Claire Bass, director of the Humane Society International/UK, says "we are thrilled Her Majesty has officially gone fur-free." She says the queen's decision will send a positive message that fur is no longer considered fashionable. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
New York Times added 273,000 digital subscribers in quarter Readers continue to shower The New York Times with money. Advertisers, not so much. The publisher added 273,000 online subscribers in the third quarter, for a total of 4 million digital readers, the company reported Wednesday. The number of total subscribers, including print and digital, hit 4.9 million, a high. Advertising was the weak spot, falling 6.7 percent overall, with digital ad revenue dropping 5.4 percent. The decline in print advertising was not unusual, as readers continue to prefer getting their news on screens. The drop in digital ads, however, was more surprising for The Times, an established publisher with a growing base of online readers. The company also revealed for the first time the size of its international readership: 500,000 digital subscribers, mostly from Britain, Canada, and Australia. The company said it was still on a pace to reach its previously stated goal of having 10 million total paying readers by 2025, with “at least 2 million" coming from outside the United States. In December, the company expects to buy back its headquarters building, at 620 Eighth Ave. in Manhattan, for $245 million. — NEW YORK TIMES
PHARMACIES
CVS revenue soars after buying insurer CVS Health revenue surged more than 36 percent in the third quarter, nearly a year after acquiring one of the nation's largest health insurers. The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefit manager also said Wednesday that it filled more prescriptions as net income climbed 10 percent to $1.53 billion in a performance that topped analyst expectations. The Woonsocket, R.I., company runs about 9,900 retail locations and processes over a billion prescriptions annually as a pharmacy benefit manager. Late last November, it added health insurance for more than 22 million people when it completed a roughly $69 billion acquisition of Aetna. That deal helped push revenue to $64.81 billion, while adjusted earnings totaled $1.84 per share in the quarter.

Papa John's rebounds, with an assist from Shaq Shaquille O'Neal's new ads for Papa John's promise a brighter day at the struggling company. At the very least, it was a brighter third quarter. The Louisville-Based pizza chain said its North American same-store sales grew for the first time in two years in the July-September period. Sales at locations open at least a year — a key metric of a retailer's health — were up 1 percent. Papa John's announced in March that O'Neal would serve as a pitchman. The move was part of a larger effort to repair the damage after the company's founder and namesake, John Schnatter, made racially insensitive remarks. Schnatter resigned as CEO and chairman in 2018. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
ONLINE DATING
Match stock falls after missed forecasts Romance may still be in the air, but on the balance sheet, things are not quite matching up for one of the online dating industry's top sites. Shares for Match Group Inc. plummeted after it gave quarterly forecasts that missed Wall Street estimates, due to mounting legal costs and economic factors that are denting sales growth. The shares slumped the most in a year. The Dallas-based company said fourth-quarter revenue will be $545 million to $555 million. Wall Street was expecting $560 million. In 2018, the company spent about $15 million on legal costs. This year, legal bills have climbed to around $40 million. Match is involved with three high-profile lawsuits. The company is suing rival dating app Bumble over allegedly stealing intellectual property from its star performer, Tinder. At the same time, Tinder's founders are suing Match for allegedly misleading them about the app's valuation. And last month, the Federal Trade Commission sued Match, accusing it of deceiving consumers by using messages from fraudulent accounts to encourage users to sign up for subscriptions. — BLOOMBERG

Texto completo: Fort Myers Beach got a little healthier this summer.
Sarah Strickland and Joshua Golter, who own the Fresh Connection location inside the Lani Kai Island Resort, opened a second shop a few blocks south on Estero Boulevard.
"We call it our closet at the Lani Kai," Strickland said of the shop's original location.
"When we saw this place become available, we jumped on it."
The new Fresh Connection is open year-round (the original Lani Kai location is seasonal), and serves an expanded menu of acai bowls, fresh fruit cups, smoothies, and coffee and tea beverages. The menu also features plant-based snacks and breakfast treats, including whole-wheat waffles, avocado toast, organic bagels, oatmeal and guacamole.
It's one of only a few vegan-friendly options on the beach, which is famous for its grouper sandwiches, conch fritters and other deep-fried delights.
"There's nothing wrong with fried food," Strickland said, "but you've got to have a balance sometimes."
She's seen a steady stream of customers since the location opened, locals and visitors who stop by to check out the shop's plant-based menu.
"The reception has been great," she said.
"A lot of people that come in are just relieved. Fort Myers Beach has that party aspect — we love that, it's fun — but it can be hard when you're drinking and eating crappy food and you have to get up and go to the beach all day."
Customers are drawn in by the promise of something different, such as smoothies made with frozen fruit blended with coconut milk or pineapple juice. The atmosphere of the shop has an easy-going vibe that's perfect for relaxing, socializing — or nursing a spring-break level hangover.
Strickland has puzzles and games for people to play. She keeps a steady playlist of chill music on the stereo, and she has National Geographic playing on the TV instead of news or sports.
"We're trying to create relaxed human interactions," she said.
Originally from Delaware, Strickland vacationed with her mother on Fort Myers Beach as a child. Her mother eventually moved to the beach full-time, and one day she spotted the Lani Kai space available.
Strickland had been living in California, where she discovered a wide range of plant-based food options, including the acai bowl. When she heard about the Lani Kai spot, she hopped on a plane from California to RSW, ready to launch her healthy-food eatery.
"This is my first business," she said, "but my dad raised my brothers and I on a produce stand. I know fruit very, very well."
With Fresh Connection, she works more than 100 hours a week, but she doesn't mind the hard work.
"It takes courage to start your own business," she said. "It would be easier to just get a pay check every week."
The experience has been worth it, she said, especially when it comes to bringing healthier food options to the beach.
"My goal is to make something just as tasty but way more wholesome and sustainable."

Texto completo: For the Monitor
I am a proud descendant of the Blackfeet Nation. Like many of you, my upbringing allows me to be keenly aware of the sacred circle of life. Right now this circle is broken, and it affects our planet, ecosystem, food system, biodiversity, humanity, all species and Mother Earth.
We live in a time of dangerous change, and it is time to join together and save our one planet. Right now we are in the sixth mass extinction. It sounds overwhelming, but it is the truth.
David Festa shared this in his Environmental Defense Fund article headlined, “Humans are causing 1 million species to go extinct.” People may debate the exact number, but the fact that we are in this stage of loss is tragic. We need to stop our current trajectory to lessen the damage in the future or there will not be future generations.
The New York Times reported Nov. 27, 2018, on “the insect apocalypse.” It's a part of the current worldwide loss, known as the sixth extinction, which is the sixth time in the Earth's history that large numbers of species disappear in unusually rapid succession.
In the past, various studies have estimated the amount of time for us to try to overcome this is 10 to 12 years; another study stated that we have five years. Most recently Matt McGrath, a BBC environmental correspondent, wrote a story headlined, “Climate change: 12 years to save the planet? Make that 18 months.”
This time the extinctions are not caused by asteroids but humans. Insects and especially pollinators, native and nonnative, are in danger. They are crucial to our survival. Pollinators support one in three bites of food we eat each day. We need these amazing pollinators to support and sustain our food system.
Alarmingly, the U.S. government is developing drone to technology to pollinate crops. In a 2012 article by Dave Goulson headlined, “Decline of Bees forces China's apple farmers to pollinate by hand,” he shared that some orchards are being hand pollinated. To my knowledge this is still happening. This is a crisis, and the fact that humans need to do this is an alert to humanity and Mother Earth. In our country the EPA has just approved use of pesticides that are more harmful to bees, while in Europe a fourth neonic is being banned.
Sadly, in New Hampshire the rusty patched bumblebee is believed to be locally extinct. New Hampshire lawmakers are now working to pass legislation to address the crisis: House Bill 646-FN: “The Saving New Hampshire's Pollinators Act.” Members of N.H. Save Our Pollinators Coalition and Non Toxic N.H. have collected more than 2,500 signatures in support of the bill. It recently passed the House Environment and Agriculture subcommittee. This was a first victory and now it moves to the executive session for a vote on Thursday at 10 a.m. in Legislative Lobby Room 303 in Concord.
Please attend and support the bill by wearing yellow and sharing your posters. This bill is championed by state Rep. Catherine Sofitikis, D-Nashua. We hope the bill passes this step and moves forward.
We need to take vital steps to protect our biodiversity and environment, especially pollinators. We must peacefully raise awareness and take positive action to preserve and protect all species, especially pollinators in the United States and globally.
As a fellow human being on this incredible planet, I implore all of you to take notice and action to help stop this extinction. We are indeed a threat to ourselves. I still believe in the innate goodness in humanity to care for all living things, including ourselves and our world.
(Fawn Gaudet of N.H. Save Our Pollinators Coalition lives in Rumney.)

Texto completo: Readers condemn the president's action, and two teenage climate activists call on adults to "listen to science before it's too late."
To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Gives Notice of Intent to Quit Paris Agreement" (front page, Nov. 5):
The notice to withdraw from the Paris climate accord formalizes an ill-considered decision made by an American president who has called global warming a hoax and who refuses to accept the risks his policies pose.
Responsible presidential leadership would acknowledge the essential role of the United States in addressing climate change and would recognize that politics has no place in the sound decision-making required to deal with the urgency of this crisis. President Trump, by withdrawing the United States from this historic consensus agreement, is handicapping the efforts of nearly 200 participating countries in pursuit of his reckless policy of departure from decades of participation in beneficial international agreements and alliances.
Hopefully, responsible leadership will soon emerge in this country and renew America's commitment before time runs out.

To the Editor:
Re "Erased by Rising Seas by 2050" (news article, Oct. 30):
We are teenage climate activists from Fridays for Future USA, a youth-led, intergenerational climate strike movement, and we need adults to listen to the climate scientists.
Scientists repeatedly warn the public of the threat of climate change. According to the 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Plan on Climate Change, we have only until 2030 -- just over 10 years -- to drastically reduce our carbon emissions to have a 50 percent chance of avoiding runaway climate change.
Now a new report states that more cities will be underwater by 2050 because of climate change than previously thought. These reports, despite being terrifying and worrisome, receive minimal reaction from the general public.
If people aren't awakened by these alarming scientific reports, what will it take for us to realize that we are in the middle of a climate emergency?
We young people are sick of waiting for adults to listen to the facts. We must listen to science before it's too late.

Sorry, Kamala supporters: Harris isn't Biden's successor if he craters

Texto completo: According to Politico's autopsy of Kamala Harris's bid for the Democratic presidential ticket, Christopher Cadelago reports that the California senator's advisers have held forth hope in her campaign as "a possible consensus fallback" if front-runner Joe Biden begins to crumble.
"If Biden crashes, these people argue, it’s not an ideological moderate like Buttigieg or Klobuchar who stands to inherit his base of senior citizens and black voters (a good majority of them women)," Cadelago writes. "It’s Harris, if she can overcome her jitters and remind Americans what got her here."
If this is the logic Harris's brain trust is employing, she should stand down now and depart this race with dignity. Harris is no one's second choice, or at least, she's not the second choice for the lane where a second choice is needed.
Although Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's base is as sticky as President Trump's, it's hard to imagine that the majority — perhaps a very large majority — wouldn't easily transfer to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The left lane of the primary doesn't need a new alternative. There's reason to believe that the center lane does, but it won't be Harris.
For starters, she's an ex-prosecutor who has repeatedly beclowned herself in attempting to win over the Left. Her entire campaign has read like a poorly interpreted focus group, with her positions twisting wherever the political winds seemed to blow. At various points in her campaign, she has emphatically endorsed and disavowed "Medicare for all," the Green New Deal, decriminalizing illegal immigration, banning private health insurance, and federally forced busing.
And that ignores a career's worth of 180-degree reversals on prostitution, sanctuary cities, marijuana legalization, civil asset forfeiture, and the death penalty.
She's already made herself toxic to the liberal lane of the party, and the polling demonstrates it.
Sanders and Warren are tied for Biden supporters' second choice if he falls, according to Morning Consult's latest polling, but third place after that isn't Harris: It's Pete Buttigieg. And if the South Bend, Indiana, mayor were to fall, his supporters would gravitate to Warren then Biden and then Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. In Iowa, the New York Times found that Buttigieg follows Warren and Sanders with the third-highest support for being likely caucusgoers' first and second choice.
Harris's national RealClearPolitics average has plummeted from the double digits in August to 3.6%. She is now less than a point ahead of Andrew Yang and exactly 1 point ahead of Klobuchar, who has seen a significant bounce in the polls over the past month. If you were going to bet on a backup for Biden, why wouldn't it be Buttigieg, who's built incredible early state ground games and maintained stable support? Or even Klobuchar, a Democrat who won her swing state by more than 20 points just two years after Clinton won it by 1 point?
Biden is old. Sadly, it shows. But if the Democrats' single best hope for defeating Trump does crumble in the polls, it won't be Harris taking his place. She should bow out now and salvage what remains of her credibility for a future run.

Obama's former EPA chief takes the helm of environmental group that's sued the Trump administration nearly 100 times

Texto completo: An environmental group that's sued the Trump administration nearly 100 times announced Tuesday that it has hired Gina McCarthy, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, as its new president and chief executive officer.
In a phone interview Tuesday, McCarthy, who headed the EPA from July 2013 until January 2017, said she was joining the Natural Resources Defense Council to fight for stronger environmental protections and address the challenge of climate change.
"I really didn't want to sit on the sidelines. So the question was where to go," she said, adding that the current administration "is trying to undo not only fundamental protections that have been in place under multiple administrations, but it's undermining the science and the work of scientists to protect the environment and the public."
She added that she's particularly concerned about policies aimed at limiting the kind of scientific studies that can be used in rulemaking and those that change the makeup of scientific advisory boards, as well as plans to relocate agencies outside Washington. "It's not as much about the rollbacks, but it's diminishing the capacity of federal agencies to do their job."
McCarthy, who served as the EPA's air policy chief for four years before becoming administrator, helped craft many of the landmark climate policies that the current administration is unraveling. She also worked on the 2015 Paris climate accord, which the United States formally began withdrawing from Monday.
Since Donald Trump has taken office, the NRDC has emerged as one of the most aggressive groups challenging his administration's work to roll back federal climate rules and bolster policies aimed at promoting energy exploration and other forms of development. It has sued the federal government 96 times on issues such as endangered species, energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs, and more. According to the group, it has won 54 of the 59 cases that have been resolved so far.
McCarthy, a 65 year-old Massachusetts native who was hailed by conservationists but denounced by many energy industry officials during her time in office, has criticized President Trump and his deputies.

Library denied New York Times subscription, officials cite 'fake news'
The librarians of Citrus County, Fla., had what seemed like a modest wish: a digital subscription to the New York Times. For about $2,700 annually, they reasoned, they could offer an easy way for their roughly 70,000 patrons to research and catch up on the news.
But when their request came before the Citrus County Commission last month, local officials literally laughed out loud. One commissioner, Scott Carnahan, declared the paper to be "fake news."
"I agree with President Trump," he said. "I will not be voting for this. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
In a move that is now generating intense online backlash, all five members of the commission agreed to reject the library's request. The discussion took place on Oct. 24, the same day when the Trump administration announced plans to cancel federal agencies' subscriptions to the Times and The Washington Post. While there's no apparent connection — the Citrus County meeting began several hours before the Wall Street Journal broke the news of the new edict — the controversy unfolding in central Florida highlights how politicians nationwide are parroting the president's disparaging rhetoric about the media.
While the Citrus County Commission is technically nonpartisan, the area, located amid the swamps and springs north of Tampa, is deeply conservative. At the Oct. 24 meeting, the proposal to budget several thousand dollars for a Times digital subscription was met with immediate disapproval and suspicion.
"Do we really need to subscribe to the New York Times?" Commissioner Ron Kitchen Jr. asked.
The other men seated at the dais chuckled.
"I actually was going say that," Carnahan responded. He had seconded a motion to hear the item only so that they could have a discussion about the Times, he said, volunteering his opinion: "I don't agree with it, I don't like 'em, it's fake news, and I'm voting no."
Suggesting that a lack of resources wasn't the problem, Carnahan said that the library could take the thousands of dollars that an institutional subscription to the Times would cost and ″do something else with it." And community members who really wanted to read the paper could simply sign up for home delivery. "I support Donald Trump," he concluded.
Afterward, two commissioners who hadn't spoken up during the meeting told the Citrus County Chronicle that they worried that agreeing to pay for the Times would lead to requests for subscriptions to more "radical publications."
The Chronicle noted that the four commissioners who agreed to be interviewed said that they did not read the Times.
As the paper also pointed out, the Citrus County library system spends about $3,000 annually on a print subscription to the Times. Two of the county's four branch libraries get the paper only on Sunday, however, and library officials had hoped to broaden its reach. Unsurprisingly, the commission's decision came as a disappointment.
"Someone's personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county," Sandy Price, the chairwoman for the library's advisory board, told the Chronicle. "Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented."

Texto completo: The board of commissioners in Citrus County, Florida, says it will no longer pay for the county library's digital subscription to The New York Times, citing the newspaper's "fake news. "
At the meeting Oct. 24, the five-member commission was asked to approve a $2,700 expenditure for the annual subscription. The motion was seconded and appeared to be bound for approval when three commissioners spoke up.
"Do we really need to subscribe to the New York Times?" Commissioner Ron Kitchen asked.
That set off Commissioner Scott Carnahan, who had seconded the motion less than a minute earlier.
"I actually was going to say that," Carnahan said. "I am going to be voting no for this. Fake news. I agree with President Trump. I won't be voting for this. I don't want the New York Times in the county. "
Carnahan was unmoved when reminded the library had sought approval to provide the subscription to its 70,000 cardholders.
"I understand, but they can take that money and do something else with it," he said. "Those (Times readers) can subscribe and have it come to their homes. I support Donald Trump. "
The latest on Trump: Trump's phone records back details of 'Apprentice' contestant's assault claim, lawyer says
Kitchen said he wouldn't support it either, citing a readership estimated at about 140.
"I won't go into all the details, but when I saw $2,700 a year for digital format for a newspaper," he said. "(Not) many people are actually reading that for $2,700 a year. "
The motion was withdrawn, drawing praise from Commissioner Jimmie Smith.
"I truly appreciate that because I have to ask why the heck we would spend money on something like that," he said.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly railed against the "failing" New York Times and other news outlets, citing "fake news. "
Sandy Price, chairwoman of the Citrus County Special Library District Advisory Board, said she was disappointed in the decision, adding that the board will discuss it at a meeting this month.
“Someone’s personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county,” Price told the Citrus County Chronicle. “Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented. ”
'You don't have this problem': Trump vents to Putin about frustration with reporters
Most of the commissioners stood by the decision this week. Commissioner Brian Coleman, however, said the decision should be reviewed.
“Do I think I made a mistake? Yes,” Coleman told the Chronicle. “Our decision should have been impartial, instead of having it become a personal thing. ”

Texto completo: Man, 27, charged in alleged plot to bomb Colo. synagogue
DENVER -- A man who repeatedly espoused anti-Semitic views has been arrested in a plot to bomb a historic Colorado synagogue, federal officials said Monday.
The co-conspirators in the plot turned out to be undercover agents, who arrested the man shortly before he planned to bomb the synagogue early Saturday, according to court documents.
Richard Holzer was arrested Friday in Pueblo just after the agents brought him what he believed were two pipe bombs along with 14 sticks of dynamite to blow up Temple Emanuel. The explosives were incapable of causing damage, authorities said.
Holzer, 27, described what he thought were explosives as "absolutely gorgeous" and said they should go ahead with the attack overnight to avoid police, the court document said.
Holzer, who lives in Pueblo, briefly appeared in court Monday in handcuffs. He told U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen Mix that he understood the charge against him, and she scheduled his next court date for Thursday. She granted his request for a public defender.
The foiled plot is the latest attempted attack against a synagogue in the U.S. in just over a year.
In October 2018, a shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh killed 11 people and became the deadliest attack on Jews in modern U.S. history.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, Holzer's arrest is the 13th time someone has been arrested on accusations of plotting attacks or making threats against the Jewish community since then.

Border Patrol agent shoots, kills gunman who opened fire
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. -- A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed a gunman who opened fire about a mile from the border with Mexico, immigration officials said.
The agent approached a group of four people early Monday, and one of them pulled out a gun and started shooting, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The agent fired back, hitting the man, who died at a hospital. No agents were hurt during the shooting in Sunland Park, a suburb of El Paso, Texas.
No additional information was released, including the names of the agent and gunman. The CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating the shooting.
New Mexico State police and FBI also are investigating, Albuquerque FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said.

DOJ sends letter to publisher of book by anonymous writer
NEW YORK -- The Justice Department has sent a letter to the publisher and literary agency of the anonymous government official whose book is scheduled to come out Nov. 19. The letter raises questions over whether any confidentiality agreement has been violated and asked for information that could help reveal the author's identity.
The publisher, Hachette Book Group, responded by saying it would provide no additional information beyond calling the author a "current or former senior official."
The book, "A Warning," is by the official who wrote an essay published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of President Donald Trump.

Advice columnist sues Trump for calling sex assault claim a lie
NEW YORK -- An advice columnist for Elle magazine who has accused President Donald Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s sued him Monday, saying he defamed her by calling her a liar whom he had never even met.
E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit, filed Monday in New York, says Trump "smeared her integrity, honesty and dignity -- all in the national press" when he responded to her allegations, first broached in a New York magazine article this past June.
A message requesting comment was sent to a law firm that has represented Trump in other cases.
Carroll is among over a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or sexual assault, or both, predating his presidency.

Texan in school shooting said to be unfit for trial
HOUSTON -- The trial for a teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a Texas high school will be delayed while he receives mental health treatment, his attorney said Monday.
The news comes after three experts -- one for the defense, one appointed by the court and one picked by prosecutors -- found Dimitrios Pagourtzis incompetent to stand trial, said Nick Poehl, one of Pagourtzis' attorneys.
Kevin Petroff, the first assistant district attorney for Galveston County, said his office was working to meet with all families of the victims before making any statement.
Pagourtzis, 19, is charged with capital murder in the May 18, 2018, attack at Santa Fe High School, which is 50 miles southeast of Houston. His trial was set to start Feb. 18. Because he was 17 at the time of the attack, he is not eligible for the death penalty.

'King Perry' pleads guilty in $115 million Ponzi scheme
SCRANTON, Pa. -- The fraudster called himself "King Perry," and for a while he lived like royalty.
Perry Santillo masterminded an investment scam that collected more than $115 million from 1,000 investors around the country, using some of the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle of cars, casino junkets and houses in multiple states, according to federal securities regulators.
The Ponzi scheme collapsed, and Santillo, of Rochester, New York, is likely to trade his fancy duds for prison attire when he is sentenced on criminal conspiracy and fraud charges.
He appeared Monday in federal court to plead guilty to a federal fraud charge, having already entered a guilty plea last month to similar charges in Rochester. Each charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.
In Oklahoma: A jury Monday found an Oklahoma City police officer guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a suicidal man who was threatening to set himself on fire.
The jury deliberated 5 1/2 hours before finding Sgt. Keith Sweeney guilty in the Nov. 15, 2017, death of Dustin Pigeon, 29, and recommending a 10-year prison sentence. Second-degree murder is punishable by 10 years to life in prison.
Sweeney was among officers who found Pigeon doused in lighter fluid and threatening to set himself on fire in a courtyard. Prosecutors say Sweeney shot Pigeon after another officer fired a bean bag. An affidavit says Pigeon was unarmed and did not pose a threat when he was shot.

"I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going:
The Art Scene and Downtown New York
in the 1980s"
By Peter McGough
In his memoir, artist Peter McGough tells of that almost-mythical time in New York's pregentrified Lower East Side in the 1980s, when he fell into the East Village's art scene, getting to know artists like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and frequenting mythic locations like Studio 54 and the Chelsea Hotel.
When McGough first moved to New York in 1980, he met and fell in love with another artist, David McDermott, and has collaborated with him ever since. McDermott and McGough became as well-known for their work in painting and photography as much as their lifestyle, which embraced a Victorian aesthetic in all they did, including wearing top hats and detachable collars and living in a converted townhouse lit only by candlelight.
Their paintings were backdated to various decades, depending on the subject, adding a highly conceptual element to the work, and their photography was produced in historical processes such as cyanotype, gum bichromate and salt prints, leading the duo to became hugely successful, and showing in three Whitney Biennials. Told with humor, McGough looks back at their professional and romantic partnership and struggles. $29.95

Writer who accused Trump of sexual assault sues him

Texto completo: A writer and longtime women's advice columnist sued President Trump on Monday, accusing him of defaming her this summer after she claimed he sexually assaulted her two decades ago in an upscale New York City department store.
E. Jean Carroll publicly described the alleged assault for the first time in June, in a published excerpt of a memoir. At that time and in the new lawsuit, she said that after running into the then-real estate developer at Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996, they chatted and shopped together before he attacked her in a dressing room. She said he knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before she pushed him off and ran out.
Trump has denied ever meeting her and has said she was trying to promote her book. The White House did not provide immediate comment after the suit was filed Tuesday morning.
"I am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed and belittled," said Carroll, who is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, in a statement. "No person in this country should be above the law — including the president."
One year before the 2020 election, Trump is grappling with a number of legal challenges, including the impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill and lawsuits targeting his businesses and finances. Carroll filed her lawsuit in New York State Court, where another defamation suit against Trump has cleared some key hurdles.
In that case, Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's reality TV show, "The Apprentice," says Trump groped her and kissed her without permission in 2007.
Zervos was among more than a dozen women in the weeks before the 2016 election who accused Trump of sexual impropriety, following the disclosure of a videotape in which he boasted about grabbing women's genitals. Trump called the women who accused him of wrongdoing "liars," prompting Zervos's suit.
But another defamation case against Trump did not survive. Adult-film star Stormy Daniels sued the president last year after he suggested she had lied about being threatened to keep quiet about their alleged affair. A federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed the suit last October, ruling that Trump's "rhetorical hyperbole" was ­political and ordering Daniels to pay the president's legal fees.
Carroll's assertion in the lawsuit that Trump "brutally raped her" stands apart from less violent allegations regarding Trump's treatment of women. Under New York law, the ­alleged incident occurred too long ago to try to press criminal charges.
Washington Post
Progressive group to spend $75m on 2020 campaign
A progressive organization is plunging itself into the presidential campaign, unveiling plans to spend $75 million on digital advertising to counter President Trump's early spending advantage in key 2020 battleground states.
The effort, by a nonprofit group called Acronym and an affiliated political action committee, is an outgrowth of growing concern by some Democratic officials that Trump could build an insurmountable edge in those key states through massive early advertising efforts. Trump has spent more than $26 million so far nationally just on Facebook and Google, more than the four top-polling Democrats — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg — have spent in total on those platforms.
“The gun on this general election does not start when we have a nominee; it started months ago," said David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and was a key adviser to him in 2012, and who recently joined Acronym's board. “If the things that need to happen don't happen in these battleground states between now and May or June, our nominee will never have time to catch up."
Plouffe and Tara McGowan, the founder and chief executive of Acronym, said their digital campaign would kick off immediately with a heavy focus on shaping how the public views Trump and the Democratic Party during the primary season, well before a nominee emerges.
The campaign, which the organization is calling “Four is Enough," will focus initially on key swing states: Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Ex-NAACP leader to run for Cummings's House seat
Former NAACP chief and US lawmaker Kweisi Mfume said Monday that he will run for the Maryland congressional seat most recently held by his friend, the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings.
Considered an elder statesman in Baltimore politics, Mfume, 71, occupied the ­Seventh District seat from 1987 to 1996, when he stepped aside to lead the NAACP. Cummings then ran for the seat and won.
Mfume's up-from-the-streets story is well known in the ­district.
He dropped out of high school, was a teenage father, and turned to crime after his mother, who raised him in poverty, died of cancer in his arms when he was 16.
Inspired by her memory, he says, he returned to school, earning degrees from Morgan State University and later Johns Hopkins University.

Texto completo: There are lots of metaphors for mass surveillance. The most common one is failing us.
Seven decades after the publication of George Orwell's "1984," "Big Brother" remains the go-to metaphor for surveillance, big and small. "Fried onion meets 1984," read the header of a Wired article on Outback Steakhouse's surveillance cameras. "China's Cryptocurrency Plan Has a Powerful Partner: Big Brother," a New York Times headline announced last month.
As surveillance technology grows more complex, it outpaces public understanding of the threats it poses. The future of surveillance looks far more expansive and invasive than the Big Brother metaphor can capture. Where we're headed, we're going to need better metaphors -- ones that accurately capture the diffuse, discriminatory and often secretive nature of both government and private surveillance.
When we talk in simple terms about complicated topics, metaphors are tremendously helpful. But they can often carry with them an implicit solution: If something is an "enemy," it must be defeated; if something is "cancer," it must be eradicated; and so on. Precise metaphors can lead to appropriate solutions, while imprecise metaphors can lead us to the wrong course of action (or to apathy).
In "1984," Big Brother never actually appears. Rather, he is the figurehead of a totalitarian political party that tries to break citizens of their free will, partly through warnings of persistent surveillance. "Big Brother is watching you" goes the (sinister) refrain. While chilling, this doesn't quite capture what we're up against today. In Orwell's Oceania, citizens don't also face the threats of privately funded drones, for example, or apps that spy on them, or police lineups containing their driver's license photos. In the real world, we face a panoply of surveillance threats that go beyond even the most frightening coordinated government surveillance. Big Brother captures only a slice.
In terms of usage, "1984" and Big Brother stomp other surveillance metaphors: In 2014, a study from PEN America found that in more than 100 blog posts and articles about surveillance, "1984" was the sole literary metaphor employed.
Little wonder that "1984" had a 7,000 percent swell in popularity on Amazon after revelations of cybersurveillance conducted by the National Security Agency in 2013. Yet even as many Americans visit (or revisit) the text, its ubiquity in media suggests that the metaphor has long since taken on a life of its own. (The reality television show "Big Brother" may have played a role, too.)
When it comes to proposing better metaphors, even heterodox thinkers have to kiss the ring before throwing down their takes.
Shoshana Zuboff, author of "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power," created "Big Other." The sociologist William G. Staples warned of the proliferation of "Tiny Brothers."
Imagine: "China's Cryptocurrency Plan Has a Powerful Partner: Tiny Brothers." That's sort of alarming.
Others take a wide -- even metaphysical -- view. Benjamin Saltzman, an assistant professor of English at the University of Chicago, thinks that a helpful way to understand contemporary surveillance is to compare it to a medieval conception of an omniscient God.
Both require citizens (whether they have opted in or not) to operate in a society structured around a mysterious, all-seeing force. In the Middle Ages, God could even be brought in as a witness to court cases. Mr. Saltzman wrote in a recent article, "God knew all human secrets, yet God's secrets remained fundamentally unknowable to human beings." That's getting closer to a network of devices that are constantly gathering data and trying to predict human behavior.
"The idea of 'God's eye' is frequently used as a metaphor for surveillance. It speaks of a gaze that is all-seeing and, because it is God's eye, all-powerful," wrote David Lyon, director of the Surveillance Studies Center at Queen's University in Ontario. "For some, this implies fearful if not actually violent undertones, suggesting a God whose primary task is one of moral overseer who invisibly scrutinizes humanity for failure and transgression."
"China's Cryptocurrency Plan Has a Powerful Partner: God's Eye." Yikes.
Other metaphors capture the loss of control over personal information in a surveillance state. Franz Kafka's "The Trial," in which a man is told he's guilty but is never told of what, and plods under endless, uncoordinated bureaucracy, is more useful than Big Brother to describe our big-data reality, said Daniel Solove, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. Mr. Solove does not think that one metaphor is inherently better or worse; he just wants whatever we use to get an accurate diagnosis since, he said, "if you don't depict and understand and capture the problem well, you can't get a good solution to it."
Noah Berlatsky, a journalist, made the argument in The Atlantic that using "Big Brother" is actively misleading the public to think that the weight of the surveillance state falls equally on all citizens, rather than more heavily on vulnerable and marginalized people. He thought Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" presented this truth better than "1984." In the book, androids are more heavily surveilled than people. "The surveillance apparatus and the murderous force of the state are targeted, specifically, towards those defined as different," he wrote.
In their 2013 Slate article "The Eye of Sauron Is the Modern Surveillance State," David Rosen and Aaron Santesso wrote that it's the vulnerabilities of J.R.R. Tolkien's Sauron that make him a good metaphor.
"China's Cryptocurrency Plan Has a Powerful Partner: Sauron." Boom!
Andrew Ridker, the editor of "Privacy Policy: The Anthology of Surveillance Poetics," warned, "If we can't devise a way to talk about what's going on in a new and unnerving fashion, we'll just become completely inured to it." Poets in his volume engage a wide range of metaphors, from more obvious ones like light and windows to God.
What if a proliferation of new, untested metaphors confuses people further? Overselling the intrusive capabilities of a particular technology isn't helpful, either. "Choose the wrong story, and you can overstate the risk," the author Deji Bryce Olukotun wrote in his analysis of the PEN study.
Unless overselling is the point. "Gorgon Stare" is the name of a surveillance drone flown by the Pentagon over battlefields like Afghanistan and Iraq. Designed to track insurgents, it has nine camera sensors that can both monitor entire cities and zoom in on multiple moving targets at once. Its dystopian edge is no accident: Its engineers appear to have been inspired by the 1998 blockbuster movie "Enemy of the State," in which Will Smith's character is persistently (and wrongly) surveilled.
The choice of this nefarious name, plumped up by a sinister Greek mythology reference (the Gorgon turns people that gaze upon it into stone), was no accident, either, said Arthur Holland Michel, a co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College. "Part of the goal of surveillance is to give your adversary the impression that you're constantly watching them," he said.
In the civilian sphere, creators of mass surveillance often take the opposite approach. In Baltimore, when the city started secretly surveilling citizens a few years ago using technology similar to Gorgon Stare, the company providing the technology put a sign on its door reading "Community Support Program."
As surveillance technology reaches dystopian dimensions, the use of apt, specific language and sharper metaphors can better inform the people who live under its gaze. It could even inspire action to rein it in.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- The Justice Department has sent a letter to the publisher and literary agency of the anonymous government official whose book is scheduled to come out later this month. The letter raises questions over whether any confidentiality agreement has been violated and asked for information that could help reveal the author's identity.
The publisher, Hachette Book Group, responded Monday by saying it would provide no additional information beyond calling the author a "current or former senior official."
The book, "A Warning," is by the official who wrote an essay published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of President Donald Trump. News of the Justice Department letter was first reported by CNN.
Stelter
"A Warning" has a release date for Nov. 19. The DOJ letter, dated Monday, is from Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt and addressed to Hachette general counsel Carol F. Ross and to Keith Urbahn and Matt Latimer of the Washington, D.C.-based Javelin literary agency.
"If the author is, in fact, a current or former 'senior official' in the Trump Administration, publication of the book" might violate "that official's legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements, including nondisclosure agreements that are routinely required with respect to information obtained in the course of one's official responsibilities or as a condition for access to classified information," reads the letter, which Hachette shared with The Associated Press.
"We request that you immediately provide us with your representations that the author did not sign any nondisclosure agreement and that the author did not have access to any classified information in connection with government service. If you cannot make those representations, we ask that you immediately provide either the nondisclosure agreements the author signed or the dates of the author's service and the agencies where the author was employed, so that we may determine the terms of the author's nondisclosure agreements and ensure that they have been followed."
Ross wrote back that the publisher was not "party to any nondisclosure agreements" that would require pre-publication review. Ross added that "Hachette routinely relies on its authors to comply with any contractual obligations they may have" and that it was committed to maintaining the official's anonymity.
"Hachette respectfully declines to provide you with the information your letter seeks," she wrote.
reply
Other recent books have drawn attention from Trump and the DOJ. In September, the U.S. government filed a lawsuit against former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, alleging he violated nondisclosure agreements by publishing the memoir "Permanent Record" without giving the government an opportunity to review it first.
In 2018, a Trump lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to the publisher of Michael Wolff's inflammatory account of the Trump White House, "Fire and Fury." The letter was ignored, and the book became a million seller. As of midday Monday, "A Warning" was No. 50 on Amazon.com's best seller list. It briefly topped the list after its announcement last month.

Nancy Pelosi gives Democrats some much-needed advice

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a fair, stern warning for the Democratic candidates vying for the presidency: “Remember November. You must win the Electoral College.”

To Pelosi, the 2020 election isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. And that means Democrats need to think long term, especially when it comes to their party platform.

“What works in San Francisco does not necessarily work in Michigan,” Pelosi told Bloomberg, adding that “what works in Michigan” does in fact “work in San Francisco,” especially when it comes to “workers’ rights and sharing prosperity.”

Other policies, however, such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, tend to isolate the voters Democrats need to win over in the general election.

“As a left-wing San Francisco liberal I can say to these people: What are you thinking?” Pelosi said. “You can ask the left — they’re unhappy with me for not being a socialist.”

Pelosi seems to understand what Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren doesn’t: The Democratic base to which she is currently appealing for support is not representative of the rest of the country, and neither is President Trump’s base, for that matter. Warren’s plan-for-everything agenda might be enough to secure the Democratic nomination, but it won’t help her win the general election. In fact, Warren would lose to Trump in five of the six key swing states, a recent New York Times poll suggests.

Change, then, must be gradual. On healthcare, Pelosi suggests stepping away from Medicare for All and all of “its complications” and instead returning to the Affordable Care Act, which provides a “path to healthcare for all Americans.”

Pelosi is a pragmatist and on this she’s right. Instead of focusing on the race against Trump, Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and the other liberals are focusing on their inner race against each other to see who can get the furthest to the Left without dropping out. This isn’t a winning strategy. Pelosi knows this, and more importantly, the voters do, too.

Justice Department Issues Warning to Anonymous Trump Administration Author; The department suggests the writer of a forthcoming book risks violating nondisclosure agreement

Texto completo: The Justice Department issued a warning that the anonymous writer of a coming book about the Trump administration could be violating nondisclosure agreements, requesting information from the author's agents and publisher that they said they wouldn't provide.
At issue is a book by a writer described as a senior Trump administration official whose op-ed piece in the New York Times last year caused controversy by suggesting that administration insiders were intentionally working to blunt the impact of some of the president's decisions. The book, "A Warning," is slated to hit bookshelves on Nov. 19. It isn't known whether the writer still works in the administration.
In the letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt raises questions about the writer, saying that if he or she is "in fact, a current or former 'senior official' in the Trump Administration, publication of the book may violate that official's legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements."
Adds Mr. Hunt: "Such agreements typically require that any written work potentially containing protected information be submitted for pre-publication review."
The letter goes on to ask for evidence that the author didn't sign a nondisclosure deal or have access to classified information. If such evidence can't be provided, the department asks for the nondisclosure agreements that were signed or when and where the author worked for the federal government.
A Justice Department official described the letter as part of a "fact-gathering" process and said no final determination had been made on next steps. The letter was first reported by CNN.
The letter is directed to Carol Ross, the top attorney for the Hachette Book Group, and to Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of the literary agency Javelin.
Ms. Ross, in a letter responding to Mr. Hunt's, declined to turn over any information to the Justice Department. Hachette, she wrote, "routinely relies on its authors to comply with any contractual obligations they may have. Hachette has, however, made a commitment of confidentiality to Anonymous and we intend to honor that commitment."
Javelin, in its own statement, wrote, "[W]e support the publisher in its resolve that the administration's effort to intimidate and expose the senior official who has seen misconduct at the highest levels will not prevent this book from moving forward."
The book is being published by Twelve, an imprint of Lagardère SCA's Hachette Book Group. Javelin sold the book on behalf of the author to Twelve.
The op-ed piece, which ran in September 2018, was headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration." In the essay, the author said that while he or she wanted the administration to succeed, "the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic."
The Trump White House has reportedly asked top administration officials to sign nondisclosure agreements, but it isn't publicly known which aides signed them or whether any such agreements could be legally enforced.

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
Lindy West's first book, "Shrill," was named one of the best books of 2016 and is now a Hulu series with actress Aidy Bryant playing West. The Seattle-based writer co-founded the #ShoutYourAbortion reproductive rights movement and is a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times.
In "Shrill," West wrote personally and politically about fat-shaming, her family of origin, why rape jokes are never funny, her abortion, confronting internet trolls and finding love.
Her new collection of 18 essays, "The Witches Are Coming," is less personal than polemical. When she's good, she's very, very good -- bracingly original, biting and funny -- and when she's not, the reader still finds brilliant nuggets.
"The Witches Are Coming" takes its title from "witch hunt," a pet phrase of our president, who, as West points out, has tweeted it hundreds of times. Lindy West adopts the witch invocation as a badge of courage, a call to change prevailing norms that countenance structural sexism as well as racism and economic inequality. If certain men are frightened, West argues, perhaps they should be in this time of #MeToo "cultural reckoning."
A throat-tuggingly effective essay for me was "Gear Swap." West takes a squabble on a Facebook music gear-swapping and sales website her husband uses, and illuminates achingly relevant issues of economics, class and race. West's husband, who is black, desperately wanted to play the trumpet as a child but living in Section 8 housing in Seattle with a single mother without a dime to spare it seemed like an impossible dream. Then a neighbor posted a flier selling an affordable trumpet and his mother received her tax refund, setting him on his path as a gifted musician in a city where at present, white net worth is 20 times more than black net worth.
In another powerful essay, "What Is an Abortion, Anyway?," West argues against silence. A third of all women have had abortions, yet because of stigma and shame, they do not talk about them. West is all for breaking the silence, arguing for women to "exist as our whole selves in public, unapologetically."
The essays in which West deconstructs cultural icons -- such as Adam Sandler or Joan Rivers -- who are not touchstones for me, were less effective. Yet even these pieces contain incisive, memorable passages. In the pop culture category, she does a deft takedown of the creators of "South Park," who dislike liberals and conservatives alike, choosing a spiky amorality instead.
Unapologetic, salty, tired of making nice, West gives us another refreshingly nervy essay collection. While not as poignant or funny as her first book, this one is fueled instead by a righteous anger. Let the witches come.

Texto completo: Kanye West has had it with "cancel culture." He's sick of the woke mobs that take people down for what they deem transgressions. "I've been canceled," the hip-hop artist told a Los Angeles radio station this month. "I've been canceled before they had cancel culture." His sins include sporting a MAGA hat and disparaging Taylor Swift, but also, more seriously, calling slavery a "choice" and chanting misogynistic lyrics.
Kanye isn't excusing his behavior, but he announced that he converted to Christianity and has started hosting gospel-music "Sunday Services." Woke folks see it as a transactional trick. "These performances have helped grant Mr. West a certain grace that . . . has not been afforded to artists who have been maligned for similar sins of a smaller scale," Shamira Ibrahim writes in the New York Times.
Whatever the state of his soul, Kanye has revealed something important: Cancel culture doesn't understand redemption. There's no hope for the canceled but to avoid further cancellation, which requires capitulation to the canceling furies. Witness Laurence Fink, the BlackRock CEO who's in trouble with progressives for the companies he invests in. He's hoping his past acts of social responsibility will cover his sins, but it's not working. Student activist Kyle Kashuv apologized for bigoted remarks he made at 16, but Harvard still pulled his admission offer. When an Iowa security guard stumbled into money and gave it to a children's hospital, a local reporter dug up and published two racist tweets from seven years ago. Canceled.
Some are immune. Bill Clinton is only mildly canceled; Al Franken is toast. Many canceled people have committed wrongs for which it's fair to expect an apology or resignation. But woke culture is bitter. It demands penance but doesn't forgive, encouraging cynicism more than uprightness.
Kanye appears to have adopted a more demanding code of conduct. His pastor says Kanye no longer swears, and he reportedly asked people working for him to abstain from premarital sex. He sings about the value of family and prayer, and in interviews he remarks on the evils of porn.
Paradoxically, this stricter code makes him freer than woke rules would. His newest album, "Jesus Is King," is a joyous tribute to deliverance. Lines include "He saved a wretch like me" and "I know God is the force that picked me up." A gospel choir sings "hallelujah" almost shrilly, like someone so relieved he can only scream. Unlike the woke mob, Christianity understands that everyone sins—but it offers unmerited grace.
Kanye's Christian turn prompts reflection on the way in which we condemn misdeeds. In Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov," one of the brothers, Dmitri, looks up to God even as he laments his own base sensuality: "When I fall into the abyss, I go straight into it, head down and heels up. . . . And so in that very shame I suddenly begin a hymn," he says.
Kanye is likewise singing a hymn. Music aesthetes can debate the merits of "Jesus Is King," but grace is a sweet sound to those who know they need it.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Debate on Tyler Perry's turf isn't about the 'Medea' vote

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee has decided to locate the fifth presidential debate at Tyler Perry's studio complex. There's more to this than a bid for the "Madea" vote -- though that's worth chasing, too.
Not everyone gets it.
After word of the decision leaked out (as of this writing, no formal announcement has been made), the person in charge of the Twitter account of the Cobb County GOP tapped out the accusation that "the DNC has chosen a venue that showcases elite Hollywood values." In a word, no.
Tyler Perry isn't Hollywood. He has become the foremost African American alternative to Hollywood. It is the point of his operation, as he explained at the BET Awards ceremony in June -- to an audience frustrated by Hollywood's on-again, off-again attempt to diversify.
"While everybody else is fighting for a seat at the table, talking about '#OscarsSoWhite, #OscarsSoWhite,' I said, 'Y'all go ahead and do that. While you're fighting for a seat at the table, I'll be down in Atlanta building my own,'" Perry told the crowd. "Because what I know for sure is that if I could just build this table, God will prepare it for me in the presence of my enemies."
Moreover, bringing nine presidential candidates --
maybe more -- to south Atlanta is more than an acknowledgment that black voters hold the key to Democratic fortunes in Georgia, next year and beyond.
The debate will bestow national recognition on an African America media/ entertainment complex that could become the greatest legacy of Gov. Nathan Deal's decision to dangle substantial tax credits to lure film and TV productions away from the West Coast.
Perry is now the only African American who is the sole owner of a major studio. As many a movie magazine has pointed out, his 12 sound stages make his operation larger than Disney, Paramount and Warner Brothers.
Perry has bankrolled himself with the creation of a series of successful stage plays, several TV sit-com families and his 14-year portrayal of a pistol-wielding, big bosomed black matriarch -- which he retired early this year. The first 10 "Madea" movies alone generated more than $500 million.
But it would also be wrong to say Perry has done this wholly on his own.
Fort MacPherson, a hub of military activity during the Vietnam War and beyond, closed in 2011, in the midst of the Great Recession. An entire sector of Atlanta -- never the most prosperous side of town -- suddenly needed rescuing.
A local governmental authority known as Fort Mac LRA took control of the 488-acre property and sold 330 acres to Perry in 2015 for $30 million.
Kasim Reed, then mayor of Atlanta, had much to do with the transaction. He's the one who first showed Perry the Fort Mac property. (People forget that Reed got his start as an entertainment lawyer.)
His successor, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, this summer became an early advocate for locating the Nov. 20 Democratic debate in Atlanta, specifically on Tyler Perry's turf. At the same time, Bottoms was advocating for the remainder of the Fort Mac property to be purchased by Perry. The deal didn't gel. Or hasn't yet.
For his part, Perry has found that creating the core of an industry still dependent on the tax-credit largesse of a GOP-controlled state Legislature imposes some restraints.
Throughout the debate over House Bill 481, the "heartbeat" measure that would ban nearly all abortions after about six weeks, Perry held his tongue -- even after Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill into law.
Finally, in a Sept. 25 interview with the Associated Press in Los Angeles, Perry made two points. First, he said he wouldn't participate in any boycott of Georgia over the new law, as other actors and directors on the West Coast have called for.
"Atlanta has been the dream. It has been the promised land," he said. "So when I got here, this whole state and city has been amazing to me and I wouldn't trade that for anything," Perry said. "Also, I put $250 million in the ground here and in the studio. So when you have a quarter of a billion dollars sat down in the ground, you can't just up and leave."
When pushed, Perry also said he opposed Georgia's new abortion law -- a likely requirement for snagging that Democratic debate. "I don't believe any man should be able to tell a woman what she can do with her body or reproductive organs," he said.
That brings us back to the aforementioned Republican accusation, that Perry is Hollywood and vice versa.
Perry told my AJC colleague Rodney Ho that many in the California film industry are unhappy that so much production has left that state. The abortion debate is a form of counterpressure, he told Ho. "There is a financial interest in California having an issue with Georgia," he said.
I did not go to the grand opening of Tyler Perry Studios on Oct. 6. My invitation was lost in the mail.
But if you study the photos and video clips from the event, which featured famous faces from politics, movies, the media and even religion, you can tell this was a celebration of something new, different -- and apart from the West Coast.
State Sen. Leroy Johnson died this week at age 91. In 1962, he became the first African American elected to the Georgia Legislature since Reconstruction. In 1970, he rescued the boxing career of Muhammad Ali, a conscientious objector facing down the Vietnam War. Other cities boycotted the boxer. Johnson rallied an African American community on the verge of coming to power in Atlanta.
The match here pitted Ali against Jerry Quarry.
"It was the greatest collection of black money and black power ever assembled until that time. Right in the heart of the old Confederacy, it was 'Gone With the Wind' turned upside-down," according to the late boxing historian Burt Sugar.
Tyler Perry's grand opening had that kind of look.
If Democrats are smart, they will use Tyler Perry Studios as more than a location for a debate. They'll use it as an example.
In the past, Perry's "Madea" character -- with her mixture of outrageous behavior and morality -- has brought him a deal of criticism. "Buffoonery" was one of the kinder words used. "Minstrelism" was another. In fact, "Madea" movies were a variety that Hollywood refused to make -- and so Perry did. Very successfully.
Perry has argued, convincingly, that the disapproval showered upon him was a matter of class, not race. "I understood very early on that this mostly blue-collar African American audience was feeling inspired," Perry wrote in The New York Times -- in a kind of obituary for Madea.
If there's a current white parallel to Madea, it might be Larry the Cable Guy -- of "git 'er done" fame.
Democrats are in the process of picking up more support among the college-educated and losing the support of those who stopped at high school.
Tyler Perry and his studios are a reminder that lectures aren't always the best way to persuade an audience. Some moviegoers -- and voters -- need to be addressed emotionally, not intellectually. And that kind of story-telling often requires the occasional belly laugh.

Texto completo: First of all, please show me where any liberal column writer has ever gone against Obama. I've yet to see it. Ross Douthat (New York Times, need I say more?) is a true liberal hack, just like Paul Krugman was when you carried his column. Douthat has been constantly wrong, which he admits in his Oct. 22 column ( "A weak president among strongmen poses risks to U.S.," Opinion). Regardless of being wrong for three years, he thinks he may in the future be correct on Trump being the evil one. Douthat needs some serious counseling. The AJC can do better!

Heartbreaking to watch people back autocrat
One of the most heartbreaking phenomena of the Trump era has been watching Republican friends, and even a few who proclaim to be independents, make excuses for Donald Trump's inexcusable behavior because they "like his policies." The cult of a business cheat and failure and TV personality has overwhelmed the basic common sense of 35% to 40% of Americans and almost destroyed the Republican Party. Until now, I had never understood how the good people of Germany in the 1930s got taken in by Adolf Hitler. Sadly, I now see how the dynamics of constant lies and propaganda and enablers in high positions try to protect an unfit man with autocratic tendencies. I am so grateful to the many people of integrity and good conscience in our government and media who shine a light on who Trump really is. It is not too late for us.

Medicare for All plan sheer fiscal insanity
The Economist magazine recently analyzed Elizabeth Warren's proposed new government programs relative to expected additional taxes from her proposed net worth tax and expanded Social Security taxes. It concluded that her new taxes would roughly cover her new programs other than Medicare for All (MFA). She has not explained how MFA would be paid for. According to the article, the projected cost over the first decade for MFA would be roughly $34 trillion, an amount roughly 10 times the average total federal revenue for the past three years. Warren's other tax additions aside, that means current taxes would need to be roughly double what they now are to pay for MFA. Proposing something so costly with no specific means of paying for it should disqualify Warren from serious consideration. However, we live in a country where financial sanity is unwelcome.
ALLEN BUCKLEY, ATLANTA
Georgians shouldn't tolerate voter purge
Deny the vote to 300,000 voters, merely because they haven't voted for a couple of years? That's what the Georgia secretary of state plans to do. This is blatant voter disenfranchisement, fearing that young people and people of color and the newly registered will come out and vote in large numbers in 2020. Why isn't the Secretary of State's Office spending time on programs to urge people to register, and investigating ways to make voting easier? Why is it not pursuing ways to encourage counties to have more polling places rather than closing them, especially in areas where populations are largely people of color? Georgians should not tolerate this. After the record-breaking purge of 2017, and the impact that had on the 2018 election, we all need to contact legislators and the secretary of state to urge them to correct this terrible strategy for preventing people from voting.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will name Chad Wolf to be the next acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the fifth person in the administration to lead the agency responsible for securing the country.
Who is he?
Wolf was the chief of staff to Kirstjen Nielsen, who was the homeland security secretary until she was replaced this year by Kevin McAleenan, who said last month he would resign.
As Nielsen's chief of staff, Wolf helped enforce the administration's "zero tolerance" policy to prosecute families who crossed the border illegally, which led to thousands of children being separated from their parents. Many of those children are still separated from their families.
Why it matters
The agency has not had a Senate-confirmed leader since April, when Nielsen stepped down. The chiefs of the agencies responsible for Trump's immigration agenda -- Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services -- are all serving in an acting capacity.
The tumult has extended to the White House's search to find a leader for a sprawling agency of more than 240,000 employees, a search that does not appear to be over. Even when Wolf is officially named as acting secretary, he is not expected to be nominated to the position, according to two administration officials.
What's next
McAleenan will step down from the position after Nov. 11, Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for the White House, said Friday. "As the president has said, Kevin McAleenan has done a tremendous job," Gidley said. "After he departs, Chad Wolf will serve as acting capacity in the interim."
He declined to say whom the president would nominate to lead the department on a permanent basis.

Texto completo: The New York Times asked readers to send their queries.
Most people on Medicare report that they are very satisfied with their health care coverage -- but the program is complicated. Medicare features an alphabet soup of plans, coverage choices, premium levels and enrollment rules.
The New York Times recently invited readers to submit their questions about Medicare. Today, we're responding to some of the most frequent ones.
What kind of monthly premiums for either original Medicare or Advantage can I realistically plan on budgeting, especially considering inflation?
Health care inflation has been running about double the rate of general inflation. HealthView Services, a research and consulting firm, expects annual health care inflation to run an average of 5 percent to 5.5 percent through most of the coming decade.
The standard monthly premium for Part B (outpatient services) this year is $ 135.50; Medicare's trustees forecast annual increases averaging 5.9 percent through 2028. Enrollees in traditional Medicare can expect inflation of 6 percent if inflation for Medigap premiums is included.
Among Medicare Advantage plans (Part C), 49 percent of plans that include drug coverage will charge no additional premium beyond Part B next year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Plans that do have additional premiums for drugs will charge an average of $ 36 next year, Kaiser says.
According to HealthView, a 65-year-old couple using original Medicare this year will spend around $ 10,300 on premiums for prescription drugs and Medigap, and various out-of-pocket costs. In 20 years, their costs are projected to be around $ 33,000 annually (future dollars).
"The compounding effect of inflation is significant," said Ron Mastrogiovanni, HealthView's chief executive.
How can I get insurance for dental care? I am 78 years old and this is my largest uncovered medical expense.
Dental care is a critical component of preventive health care; research has shown clear links between poor oral health and chronic diseases like diabetes, as well as pain, chronic infection and reduced quality of life. Yet over all, nearly two-thirds of Medicare enrollees have no dental insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means a majority pay for their care out of pocket or go without.
Original fee-for-service Medicare does not cover most dental care, and it also does not cover hearing or vision care. Dental care is covered only in very limited circumstances, for example, if it is necessary as part of a covered procedure.
Many Medicare Advantage plans -- the managed-care private alternative to the original program -- include some level of dental coverage. Next year, 90 percent of Advantage enrollees will have access to some level of dental benefits, according to Avalere Health, a research and consulting firm. Sixty percent will have access to a plan covering restorative services; 78 percent will be able to get coverage for X-rays and cleanings.
Like other dental insurance, Advantage plan coverage levels have caps. "'Limited' would be a good word to describe it," says Sean Creighton, a managing director in the policy practice at Avalere.
The percentage of Medicare Advantage plans covering hearing and vision care is rising by similar percentages, he adds.
In most cases, these services are being offered without an additional premium. Plans are paid based on a benchmark per-capita rate Medicare uses to pay for original Medicare enrollees; when Advantage plans bid below that rate for matching original Medicare benefits, they are permitted to use the difference to offer extra benefits.
"Advantage plans are growing as a share of total enrollment, and they are trying to attract members from original Medicare and in competition with each other," he added. "Dental, vision and hearing benefits are very popular."
Original Medicare enrollees have the option of adding a commercial stand-alone dental policy. For example, a Delta Dental P.P.O. plan offered in New York City carries a monthly premium of $ 48, with an annual deductible of $ 50 and an annual per-person payment limit of $ 1,500.
Many of the current Medicare for All proposals would add coverage of dental, vision and hearing care.
Someone called me claiming to be from Medicare and I gave out my Medicare number. Should I be concerned?
Medicare generally does not initiate calls to enrollees -- with a couple of exceptions. Medicare health or drug plans can call current members. And customer service representatives from Medicare (1-800-MEDICARE) may call if you have left a message, or if a representative indicated that you would receive a return call.
Never give out your Medicare -- or Social Security -- number to anyone who calls you on the phone, sends email or makes a personal contact. Your personal information, including your Medicare number, should be shared only with health care providers, your insurers or trusted counseling services, such as the State Health Insurance Assistance Program.
"Any unexpected call from someone claiming to be from Medicare is a huge red flag, especially if you didn't call first," says Amy Nofziger, director of fraud victim support at AARP.
AARP's fraud help line (877-908-3360) has noted a recent increase in phone schemes, usually aimed at persuading people to order equipment or services that are then billed to Medicare. "A big one lately has been DNA genetic testing kits," Ms. Nofziger said. The Medicare program isn't the only victim of the phony bills, she said. "Sometimes, Medicare will deny the claim and then the perpetrator mails a bill to the enrollee. You might get a bill for up to $ 10,000, which is pretty scary for people."
If you suspect you've been victimized by fraud, alert Medicare that a scammer may have your identifying number so that your account can be flagged and monitored. And, keep a careful eye on the monthly explanation of benefits that Medicare sends, looking out for any suspicious charges.
"If Medicare feels the problem rises to the level of needing to provide you a new Medicare number, they can do that," Ms. Nofziger added.
Issuing new numbers became easier recently after the government revamped its system. The old Medicare cards used Social Security numbers, but those were phased out as part of a federal anti-fraud initiative. New cards that were mailed to all enrollees during 2018 and 2019 use a unique, randomly assigned number.
Why does Medicare set my 2019 premium cost using my 2017 income? I am newly retired as of August 2019 and my Part B premium is $ 433 a month. I'm also paying more for my prescription drug plan. My income in 2019 is much lower than it was in 2017.
High-income Medicare enrollees have been paying surcharges on Part B and Part D premiums since 2007. These so-called Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) affect a relatively small share of the Medicare population -- about 7 percent this year, according to federal data -- but they are steep.
The standard Part B premium requires enrollees to pay 25 percent of the government's total per-capita program costs; the surcharges require high-income enrollees to pay anywhere from 35 to 85 percent more, depending on their income. The Part D income-related surcharge is calculated as a percentage of the national average cost of the standard drug benefit, using the same percentages and income thresholds used for Part B IRMAA.
IRMAA is determined by your modified adjusted gross income, which includes the adjusted gross income reported on your tax return, plus tax-exempt income.
For many retirees, the big surprise is the look-back that determines whether IRMAA is owed -- income often declines in retirement, but your initial premium could be set using pre-retirement income levels. The Social Security Administration determines whether surcharges are owed from data in the most recently available tax return it obtains from the I.R.S.; for 2020 premiums, the agency will use income tax data provided this year from 2018 tax filings.
"The sticker shock comes in the form of the Social Security benefit," Mr. Mastrogiovanni adds. "Not only is the Part B premium deducted, but also the surcharges. So people go through their planning to see what Social Security will generate, but people in these high-income brackets could lose up to half of their gross Social Security benefit."
In your recent discussion of limitations of Medicare Advantage plans , you did not include information about improper claims denials and the difficulty people have pursuing appeals. That certainly should be part of your coverage.
A report last year by federal investigators did find that Advantage plans have a pattern of inappropriately denying patient claims. The Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services found "widespread and persistent problems related to denials of care and payment in Medicare Advantage" plans. The report examined appeals filed by patients and health care providers from 2014 through 2016, and found that Advantage plans themselves overturned the denials in 75 percent of cases.
However, very few claim denials are appealed -- just 1 percent during the three-year period reviewed in the inspector general's report.
The Advantage payment model reimburses plans a preset amount per patient; that may be incentivizing plans "to deny preauthorization of services for beneficiaries, and payments to providers, in order to increase profits," the report concluded.
"We see plenty of denials by Advantage plans that shouldn't be denied, and wouldn't be if the patient had been enrolled in original Medicare," says David Lipschutz, associate director and senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.
Among the most common problems, he says, are early hospital discharges, denial of care in a skilled nursing facility or home health care.
I had an accident this year that has required bilateral knee surgery -- I was in the hospital for a week and a residential rehab facility for physical therapy and treatment of related problems for one month. Now I am home with a home health nurse weekly, and visits from a physical therapist five days a week. I also have adaptive equipment. My recovery process will be at least five more months, carrying over into 2020. Can my Plan G Medigap supplemental insurance provider cancel me for 2020?
Original Medicare enrollees often add a Medigap supplemental plan to cap out-of-pocket expenses -- and that comes in especially handy when a major medical problem arises. You can choose among a dizzying array of standardized plan options with varying degrees of coverage; Plan G is one of the most comprehensive, covering hospital and doctor co-insurance costs, hospice care, coinsurance for skilled nursing facilities and hospital deductibles.
Fortunately, Medigap coverage does not disappear when you need it.
"No Medigap plan can cancel you for spending too much," says Chris Hakim, senior vice president of Medicare at eHealth, an insurance exchange. "The only way you can lose coverage is if you don't pay your premiums."

Texto completo: Mr. Flannery took over as chief executive in 1980, when the company was in its "darkest hour." He then fended off a hostile takeover bid by Carl Icahn.
Joseph P. Flannery, a corporate executive who saved the rubber company Uniroyal from financial collapse and later thwarted a hostile takeover bid, died on Oct. 20 at his home in Wellesley, Mass. He was 87.
The cause was kidney disease and lymphoma, his daughter Mary Flannery said.
Mr. Flannery took over as chief executive of Uniroyal in February 1980, when the company, based in Middlebury, Conn., was in financial distress. It had lost $ 119.7 million the previous year after a strike by rubber workers shut down 12 plants for 40 days.
"It was this company's darkest hour," Mr. Flannery said later. "I said to myself, 'This company must not collapse!"'
He was true to his word. Within 18 months, he had turned the company around, closing factories and selling off its tire business in Europe and Australia to focus on the domestic market. Some on Wall Street declared the company's revival a "miracle."
"He always said that people need to make tough decisions," Mary Flannery said. "He was somebody who wasn't going to hem and haw and think he could kick the can down the road."
But there were more difficulties to come. The climax of Mr. Flannery's tenure arrived in April 1985, when Carl Icahn, the Wall Street raider, made a bid for a hostile takeover, proclaiming in newspaper advertisements that he intended to buy more than half the company's 33.9 million shares.
"I feel challenged," Mr. Flannery said in an interview then with The New York Times. But over the next few months he managed to fend off the bid. In September 1985, stockholders approved a leveraged buyout by a group of the company's managers and the New York investment firm Clayton & Dubilier.
It was a relief. But also a disappointment. "He did not anticipate in any way having his company taken away from him," Ms. Flannery said. "And because of Icahn's attempt, he was sort of forced to set that ball in motion."
Joseph Patrick Flannery Jr. was born on March 20, 1932, in Lowell, Mass. (He did not use the suffix Jr.) His father, who died when his son was 4, was a printer; his mother, Mary (Egan) Flannery, was a teacher.
As a child, Joseph liked to spend the summers outdoors, and at 13 he became the youngest Eagle Scout in Lowell, his family said. He went on to receive a bachelor's degree in textile chemistry in 1953 from the Lowell Textile Institute and a master's of business administration from Harvard Business School.
Mr. Flannery joined Uniroyal in 1959 as a research chemist before moving into sales and marketing. Throughout his career he would have dinner with his wife, Margaret Flannery, every night and then keep working until late, his daughter Mary said.
A year after the leveraged buyout, Uniroyal merged with Goodrich to form the Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Company, which was eventually subsumed by the French tire manufacturer Michelin.
After the buyout, Mr. Flannery served on the boards of Kmart, Amstar and other companies. He became a partner at Clayton & Dubilier, the private equity firm that had helped him wrest control of Uniroyal from Mr. Icahn.
In addition to his daughter Mary, he is survived by his wife; two other daughters, Elizabeth Flannery and Diane Knight; three sons, Joseph, James and David; and 13 grandchildren.
Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.

Polarized by White House visits

Texto completo: They say history repeats itself and it's hard to argue when looking at the events that have unfolded in this country over the last week.
The Washington Nationals won the World Series and are scheduled to meet President Trump on Monday. The first time the Washington Nationals went to meet the president was in August 1865 when they-- along with the Brooklyn Atlantics -- met President Andrew Johnson, in what is widely believed to be the first time a sports team was invited to the White House.
Johnson ascended to the highest office following a president from Illinois. Trump, the same. Johnson would go on to become the first United States president to be impeached, avoiding removal by the Senate. Trump, as I'm sure you are well aware, has similar difficulties in the House and a Senate that is unlikely to remove him.

Trippy, right?
The only wrinkle is Johnson, along with fellow impeachment-facing presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, dealt with bipartisan chastisement. In the case of President Trump, not one of the 194 House Republicans who voted on Thursday's resolution to formalize the impeachment investigation voted "yes."
It's a clear snapshot of how the country is perhaps just as divided politically as it was when Johnson became president shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War.
All of which leads to this question: When it's all said and done, will the tradition survive?
Over the course of the 154 years between the Nationals first visit and the pending one, teams would accept White House invitations if for no other reason than out of respect for the office of the presidency.
Yes, we've always had players skip the celebration for a variety of reasons, but for the most part those reasons did not overshadow the occasion. That no longer feels true. Who declines the White House invitation -- and more importantly, why -- have become far more compelling than awkward photo ops.
From Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora choosing not to attend the celebration because of how the Trump administration handled Hurricane Maria relief to Puerto Rico to U.S. women's soccer star midfielder Megan Rapinoe saying she's "not going to the ... White House" in protest, we are inching closer to the point in which accepting an invite from the president is conflated with accepting the president.
It's an unfortunate but understandable development. Historically sports was one of those aspects in American life in which fans from various walks of life could find common ground, if only for nine innings or four quarters. But now not even the euphoria of winning a championship appears powerful enough to overcome the divisive sludge that is oozing out of our smartphones, televisions and radios.
It's hard to paint Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle as anything other than a decent person. He volunteers to help displaced military veterans, he hosted Thanksgiving dinner for Syrian refugees and he listens to his mom and dad, telling the New York Times, "when I was a kid, I remember my parents would say, 'Baseball is what you do, but that's not who you are' -- like that might be my job, but that's not the end-all, be-all."
When Trump tried to characterize his infamous "grab [women] by the ... " remark as locker room talk, Doolittle took to Twitter to say, "As an athlete, I've been in locker rooms my entire adult life and uh, that's not locker room talk."
Yet despite these and other examples of his humanitarianism, his choosing to not visit the White House in protest of Trump's rhetoric is going to place him in a bad light for a lot of people. They will view his actions as disrespectful, even unpatriotic. Maybe Trump will call him a son of a bitch the way he referred to NFL players who were protesting police corruption.
Again, this isn't the first time an athlete has declined such an invitation in protest. But this is the first time in recent memory that the lines being drawn are authored by the president himself, thus posing a dilemma for his supporters -- are you with me or with them?
And now that this precedent has been set, will we be able to recover?
Regardless of what happens with the impeachment inquiry, the partisan hostility is requiring athletes, teams and universities to think beyond travel logistics with each White House invite. Now they must consider the message being sent.
Once upon a time the message was about respecting the office. Increasingly it has become about the person in the office. Today team's are skipping the visit because they don't like Trump. Tomorrow perhaps teams skip because they don't like the policies or rhetoric of the new guy ... or gal.
Remember there was a time in which the White House Correspondents' Dinner was the hottest ticket in town. Three years of poisonous rhetoric and hostility later, it is barely an afterthought. That is the same trajectory the sports invitation is headed. It is becoming a PR nightmare for the White House and more trouble than what it's worth for teams with vocal athletes -- and that was before the impeachment inquiry.
Face it, Doolittle's absence for political reasons is the new normal and so for a segment of people looking for an escape, they may want to try another route. This, sadly, leads to a dead end.

Texto completo: Political scientist on a Ukraine-born White House official
President Trump's supporters were quick to challenge the patriotism of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the alarmed National Security Council official who testified Tuesday about the July phone call between Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Vindman was born in Ukraine, when it was part of the Soviet Union; his family left when he was 3 years old, as Jewish refugees from Soviet persecution. "I don't know about his concern [for] American policy," said CNN commentator Sean P. Duffy. ". . . We all have an affinity to our homeland, where we came from." After the New York Times reported that Ukrainian officials had turned to Vindman for advice on how to deal with Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, Giuliani himself tweeted: "A U.S. gov. employee who has reportedly been advising two gov's? … End of impeachment."
Trump and his supporters often suggest that first- or second-generation Americans - from federal judge Golanzo Curiel, whose parents were Mexican immigrants, to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a former refugee from Somalia - are really loyal to their ancestral countries. Supposedly, these people possess "dual loyalty," a charge that historically has most often been lodged against Jews. The slander that Jews prioritize Israeli interests over American ones has come from politicians in both parties this year. Omar herself suggested that American Jews "push for allegiance to a foreign country," and Trump bizarrely complain ed that they demonstrate "great disloyalty" to Israel by not loyally supporting him.
These views are spurious and bigoted, and some Republicans have risen to Vindman's defense. (Omar apologized for her comments; Trump didn't.)
Dual loyalty doesn't have to mean disloyalty. In denying these false accusations, it is easy to concede too much to an overly rigid, nationalist conception of belonging. But people in complex modern societies have loyalties to their religions and identity groups, their families, their cities and states, their parties and political causes, their associations or unions or professions. They balance these all the time. Political membership in a nation-state doesn't - and shouldn't - eliminate subnational, transnational and international attachments of many kinds. These loyalties may require trade-offs, but they rarely come into real conflict.
The perspective that rejects such pluralism maintains that we must prioritize one membership, one attachment, absolutely and unconditionally over all others: We cannot be American and Catholic, British and European, Muslim and French. It casts free-traders and supporters of liberalized migration policies as sinister "globalists" who undermine the countries to which they should be loyal - a supposed ideological dual loyalty that is often used as a dog-whistle for anti-Semitism.
This error rests in part on worries about extreme cases of conflict: When the sacrifice that loyalty calls for is killing or dying in the national defense, which side are you on? But these instances are exceptionally rare. Most of the time, people make complementary choices and sacrifices for their plurality of allegiances.
The notion that disagreement and pluralism are problems, diseases of the body politic, has been dressed up in various ideological languages over the centuries. Some political theorists, like Locke and Rousseau, conceived of politics as resting on a social contract that requires unanimous consent, a pre-political "people" that is so naturally unified that each and every person will endorse the same terms of constitutional founding. Nationalists cling to the idea that each sovereign state naturally shares a homogeneous ethno-cultural community. And recently, we've seen a resurgence of populism, which limits who counts as the real national people and casts political opponents as invaders, elites and parasites.
Eighteenth-century civic-republican thinkers, including many of the American founders, thought political parties contributed to something like dual loyalty; they distinguished the "common good" from the interests of "factions." George Washington's farewell address denouncing parties and partisanship included an attack on "excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another," such as Democratic-Republicans' tilt toward revolutionary France and the Federalists' toward monarchical Britain. The imagined connection between domestic division and something like treason outlasted that particular dispute.
This skepticism of political differences wasn't exactly the same as 19th-century ethnic and cultural nationalism, but the concepts blended easily enough. We can hear the combination in the Pledge of Allegiance, created in 1892 to teach immigrant children loyalty to both "the [political] republic" and "one [cultural] nation, indivisible." The author of the pledge, Francis Bellamy, was concerned about the ideas of "fanatical" immigrants such as anarchists and about the arrival of members of "races which we cannot assimilate without a lowering of our racial standard" - that is, southern and eastern Europeans.
Political experience quickly taught Americans that Washington was wrong, that democratic government in modern states requires parties. They organize different groups' interests and ideas into competing perspectives on the common good; they make opposition, disagreement and contestation normal parts of a political system. But as the Harvard political theorist Nancy Rosenblum has shown, the founders' anti-party spirit persists in the obsession with independent voters and the perpetual fantasy of an unaffiliated president riding to the rescue (Ross Perot, Michael Bloomberg). And anti-partyism provides an ideological weapon that can be used against the other party: Since our side is obviously in the right, the other side must be a divisive special interest, opposed to the common good - a view Trump has embraced with zeal. Democrats are "bad people," he said at a rally in October , "on a crusade to destroy our democracy."
In addition to parties, a healthy pluralistic democracy draws on its citizens' diverse attachments to religions or causes as sources of different perspectives and knowledge. Socialists and Catholics can disagree with a particular government, not because of "disloyalty," but because they bring distinctive ideas about what the right thing for America is.
This holds true even when the attachments are transnational. An environmentalist, free-trader or human rights activist might criticize her country's actions around the world, arguing, for instance, that the United States is wrong to abandon the Kurds in Syria or withdraw from a pact to slow global warming.
The sympathy and attachment that many Americans have to their ancestors' countries is another source of such perspective. Such attachments don't prioritize some other part of the world over American interests but offer varied insights on what those interests are . They provide knowledge, understanding, moral motivation and reasons for advocacy for a wide range of positions: that the United States should boycott Cuba, defend Taiwan, accept refugees from Venezuela or Honduras - or take seriously the Russian threat to Ukraine. Emigres from tyrannical regimes can bring a particular understanding of those regimes' injustices.
This was commonly understood during the years when Irish Americans pressured politicians with respect to British policy in Northern Ireland, but the same understanding is too often denied to American Jews making the case for the alliance with Israel. Trump's defenders seek to deny it to Vindman as well. While there's no evidence that Vindman cared about anything other than U.S. interests, it's certainly possible that he felt a special commitment to work on Ukrainian affairs because of his past. If so, surely that perspective improved rather than diminished his contributions to the National Security Council. Perhaps it strengthened his willingness to make the hard choice to speak up on behalf of a security relationship Congress had endorsed, in the face of a president trying to undermine it.
Transnational and ideological commitments provide distinctive perspectives on a country's interests and ideals. The monist view attacks them both. This is perhaps most obvious in the ways that suspicion of Jews' transnational sense of cultural community has gone hand in hand with denunciation of the transnational political causes - socialism, liberalism, globalism - Jews are imagined to dominate. Embrace of such causes is often painted as secret, illegitimate, foreign.
The point is not that there's no such thing as a traitor. Confederates turned on the United States from within to defend slavery, and Julius Rosenberg betrayed his country to the Soviet Union. But the extremes of war (civil or international, hot or cold) are not the normal conditions of democratic life. The nationalist always exaggerates how homogenous we are, and how different we are from them outside our borders. Those of us who reject that pernicious image shouldn't accept the terms of debate that it sets. We will be better off when the phrase "dual loyalties" ceases to be an epithet - but instead a simple recognition of the pluralism all of us bring to political life.

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

Republicans question why Schiff is running impeachment

Texto completo: Under normal circumstances, the House Intelligence Committee would not have jurisdiction over the string of witnesses who have filed into the impeachment proceedings in the Capitol basement, or the subject matter they are talking about.
None of the material is classified, and those who have appeared before the panel are mostly diplomats whose testimony about a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would more suitably be scrutinized by the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
Both the Foreign Affairs and Oversight panels have been invited to participate in the closed-door inquiry, but it is Schiff and the Intelligence Committee staff Democrats who run the proceedings and who will write the final report that will determine whether the House votes on articles of impeachment.
Republicans say the mismatch raises questions about how Democrats are proceeding with the impeachment inquiry and why Schiff, and Intelligence, was chosen to run it.
“There is absolutely nothing whatsoever in the whistleblower complaint that has any kind of intelligence component at all,” a top GOP aide told the Washington Examiner. “A presidential phone call with a foreign leader is not an intelligence matter.”
The whistleblower complaint shifted the impeachment proceedings to the control of Schiff and away from the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Jerry Nadler who had declared he was running impeachment proceedings without the blessing of Pelosi.
While the Judiciary Committee has traditionally handled impeachment inquiries and has held those hearings in public, Nadler had run afoul of Pelosi over his handling of the investigation and his decision to hold a series of highly partisan public hearings that were criticized by both parties.
Republicans believe Democratic leaders were looking for a way to transfer control to Schiff, who is more closely aligned with Pelosi and runs a committee that traditionally holds hearings behind closed doors.
Schiff, an outspoken Trump critic, first accused him of colluding with the Russians ahead of the 2016 election and appears determined to impeach the president.
“Soon, the American people will see new evidence of the President's abuse of power,” Schiff tweeted Friday. “Every Member of Congress will have to answer: is soliciting foreign interference in our elections acceptable? The answer must be no. Americans decide American elections.”
The whistleblower complaint prompted Pelosi to give Schiff total control over impeachment proceedings that he has so far conducted mostly out of the public’s view.
“This is a different set of rules that Chairman Schiff and Speaker Pelosi have embarked upon, but why?” Rep. Mark Meadows, a member of the Oversight Committee, said. “Because it wasn't working with Jerry Nadler when everybody go to view it.”
In the coming weeks, Schiff will be tasked with completing a report on the findings from the impeachment investigation, which began in late September after an anonymous whistleblower complained about the Trump-Zelensky call. Details of his report to an inspector general were leaked to the media.
Schiff first told reporters his office had no prior contact with the whistleblower but acknowledged through a spokesman in an Oct. 2 in a New York Times article that “the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community.”
Republicans suspect Schiff or his committee staff directed the whistleblower to file his complaint specifically with the inspector general of the Intelligence Community, Michael K. Atkinson.
The move would ensure Schiff maintained jurisdiction over the whistleblower testimony and ultimately the impeachment process, Republicans believe.
Democrats have positioned Schiff to act as a special investigator, akin to former special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated alleged Trump-Russia campaign collusion, or Independent Counsel Ken Starr, whose investigation of Bill Clinton led to his impeachment.
“I call it faux impeachment,” Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told the Washington Examiner recently. “By running it in the House Intelligence Committee, they’re trying to keep all of the information from the American public. And I understand why, because every witness we have that comes in bombs out for them."
A spokesman for Schiff has not responded to questions about the role committee Democratic staff played, if any, in funneling the whistleblower complaint to Atkinson.
Schiff has since declared he will not seek testimony from the whistleblower, which Republicans believe is aimed at preventing GOP lawmakers from asking the whistleblower about his coordination with the intelligence panel.
According to the New York Times and other media reports, the whistleblower is a CIA officer who was at one point detailed to work at the White House. While the contents of the call might not fall under the Intelligence Community, the whistleblower’s employment with the agency justified reporting the complaint to Atkinson and ultimately authorizing the oversight of the intelligence panel, Democrats have argued.
Democrats believe Republicans are attacking Schiff’s role because they do not want to talk about the underlying complaint that Trump sought Ukraine’s help investigating his chief political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
“I don’t think there is any process we could propose that Republicans, who prefer to circle the wagons around the president, would accept,” said Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern.

'So sad!': Beto O'Rourke campaign 'cheer guides' uncovered in Des Moines arena

Texto completo: A reporter disseminated a picture of fliers that gave crowd instructions for Beto O'Rourke supporters at an Iowa conference center.
New York Times politics reporter Katie Glueck noticed the papers abandoned on a table at the Des Moines, Iowa, conference center where O'Rourke had been scheduled to speak before abruptly dropping out of the race Friday. "A stack of these Beto cheer guides were in a box on an abandoned table at the arena here in DSM [Des Moines]," she tweeted. "There were rolls of stickers, too— passersby stopped to grab some. 'So sad! It’s so sad!' one woman said."Tweet
O'Rourke ended his campaign under financial duress, which would likely have meant laying off campaign workers in the near future. The former Texas congressman was never able to duplicate the momentum he gained during a run for Senate in 2018, a race that he narrowly lost to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in his bid for reelection.
O'Rourke started his campaign on a strong note with more than $6 million raised on the first day, but he was never able to consistently poll above more than 1% or 2%, leaning heavily on proposals for stricter gun control, more liberal abortion laws, and punitive taxes for churches that do not endorse gay marriage.
[Related: Beto O'Rourke says churches should be taxed if they refuse to support gay marriage]
O'Rourke ended his campaign via Twitter on Friday, becoming the latest Democrat in the large pool of candidates to bow out of the race. "Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively," he said in a tweet. "In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee."

Burlas y críticas a Donald Trump por mudarse de Nueva York a Florida

Texto completo: Los críticos del presidente Donald Trump se burlaron en internet y lo acusaron de intentar aligerar su factura de impuestos después de que anunció el jueves que su residencia permanente sería Palm Beach, Florida, en lugar de la Torre Trump en Nueva York.
“Donald Trump no quiere que el estado de Nueva York vea sus impuestos, me pregunto por qué. Digamos esto como es: corrupción, simple y llanamente”, tuiteó el jueves la senadora Elizabeth Warren , candidata presidencial para las elecciones de 2020.
Trump, un neoyorquino de toda la vida, presentó una “declaración de domicilio” ante el Tribunal de Circuito del Condado de Palm Beach en septiembre, renunciando a su residencia en Nueva York y designando el resort Mar-a-Lago de la familia como su residencia principal, según The New York Times. El diario, que informó por primera vez el cambio de residencia de Trump, dijo que la medida tiene motivos fiscales: Florida en particular no tiene impuestos estatales sobre la renta o la herencia.
En Nueva York, Trump enfrenta el escrutinio tanto del fiscal general del estado como del fiscal de distrito de Manhattan sobre sus declaraciones de impuestos.
“Los estadounidenses de a pie no son dueños de resorts que pueden enumerar como direcciones alternativas para modificar su obligación tributaria”, tuiteó el jueves la representante Nita Lowey, demócrata de Nueva York. “Las familias de clase media hoy enfrentan más cargas impositivas mientras el presidente esquiva las consecuencias del proyecto de ley republicano”.
Dan Pfeiffer, exasesor de Obama, bromeó en un tuit el jueves: “El presidente huye a Florida para evitar pagar impuestos”.
Trump tuiteó el jueves por la noche que apreciaba su ciudad natal y “odiaba tener que tomar esta decisión”, pero “a pesar del hecho de que pago millones de dólares en impuestos municipales, estatales y locales cada año, los líderes políticos me han tratado muy mal, tanto de la ciudad como del estado “.
Agregó que Nueva York “siempre tendrá un lugar especial en mi corazón”.
La exrepresentante Gwen Graham, demócrata de Florida, reaccionó a la noticia con solo cuatro palabras: “Nosotros. No. Lo. queremos”.
Y Michael Steele, ex presidente del Comité Nacional Republicano, tuiteó: “Maldita sea, habrás sacado a Trump de #NYC”. #PobreFlorida “.
El alcalde de Nueva York, Bill de Blasio, demócrata y ex candidato de 2020, también opinó.
“No dejes que la puerta te golpee al salir o algo así”, tuiteó el jueves. De Blasio hizo un seguimiento temprano el viernes con otro mensaje: “Nuestro más sentido pésame a la buena gente de Florida mientras Trump intenta escapar de su pasado (y futuro cercano)”.
En un monólogo burlón el viernes por la mañana, Pat Kiernan , presentador de noticias matutinas durante mucho tiempo en NY1, también criticó duramente al presidente por la mudanza, específicamente el costo y las molestias que la ciudad ha soportado para proteger el perímetro de la Torre Trump en Manhattan.

Buttigieg surges ahead of Biden in Iowa polling

Texto completo: Following his breakout debate performance, presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has surged into striking distance of a win in Iowa, putting up his best showing in recent polls in the state with the first nominating contest.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday morning, the mayor of South Bend is polling at 18%, behind Elizabeth Warren at 22% and Bernie Sanders at 19%. He edged out Joe Biden, who entered the race at the top of the polls in Iowa, but slipped to fourth place at 17%.
The poll has a margin of error of 4.7%, meaning the race remains tight, with the top three in a statistical tie. The remaining candidates are polling at 4% or less.
In some ways it's no surprise. Pundits think Buttigieg is positioned to contend in mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, but caution his continuing struggle in South Carolina, a state with a larger African American population, might be more noteworthy.
"He's bound to do well in Iowa," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. "He's Midwestern and Iowa is 90 percent white. I'm still very skeptical that he can go on to win the nomination (given his lack of support among African Americans). I just don't see how he does it."
Buttigieg has had a sometimes bumpy relationship with African Americans in South Bend, most recently thrust into the spotlight when a white police officer shot a black man wielding a knife this summer.
It's not his only obstacle. Acceptance of marriage equality and LGBTQ rights among African Americans and Latinos is growing, but isn't as high as among other groups, a potential problem for the first openly gay Democratic candidate for president.
Still, pundits say a win in Iowa would give him more time to win over those voters. And if Biden continues to stumble, many might be looking for a more moderate candidate than Warren and Sanders, a point Buttigieg reinforced again and again at the October debate.
"If he can be successful in Iowa and in New Hampshire that gives him more time and opportunity to really reach out to voters and try to get them on his side," said Laura Merrifield Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis.
In fact, the national takeaway from the recent polls has been the continuing collapse of Biden, pundits say, which is leaving the door open for other candidates like Buttigieg.
"Biden is now, I think you can make an argument that he's out in Iowa and New Hampshire," Sabato said. "That ought to be a concern for him, though he has a chance to recover in South Carolina (where he remains popular with African American voters)."
The poll had more good news for Buttigieg, who has been positioning himself as a moderate alternative to the former vice president. The South Bend mayor is the second choice of 31% of caucus goers, behind only Sanders at 34%.
Buttigieg fared somewhat better with older voters than younger voters, according to the poll.
There was some bad news for him, too. Among the top four candidates, voters were the least confident in his chances of defeating President Donald Trump, at 70%. Warren was at 81%, Biden at 80% and Sanders at 76%.
The poll of 439 Iowa Democratic caucus goers was conducted Oct. 25-30.
Buttigieg has been a leader in collecting campaign money, and he appears to be putting it to good use, said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics.
"It's being put to work in Iowa and in New Hampshire and in South Carolina and we'll see if the same sort of thing can happen (elsewhere)," Downs said.
The survey comes just a week after Buttigieg polled at 20% in the latest Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, behind only Warren at 28%.
Sanders was at 18% and Biden at 12% in that poll of 598 likely Democratic caucus attendees surveyed between October 18-22. The margin of error was 5%.
Buttigieg moved up from fourth place in the same poll in September.
There was trouble for the mayor in this poll, too, foreshadowing his issues in more diverse states.
Among non white voters in Iowa, Buttigieg was at fifth place at 9%, behind Biden, Warrem, Sanders and Kamala Harris. The mayor also ranked poorly as a second choice, ranking behind Warren, Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The ascension of Paula White as an official member of Donald Trump's White House highlights how closely the president is relying on his inner circle of evangelical Christian supporters as he fights an impeachment probe during his reelection bid -- while giving liberal evangelicals a new opening to push back at his administration's mingling of religion and policymaking.

White is a televangelist who has sparked division among fellow Christians over her association with the so-called "prosperity gospel," an assertion that God rewards believers with personal as well as financial success. She's also frequently identified as personal minister to the president and is now set to become an adviser heading Trump's Faith and Opportunity Initiative, according to a White House official.

In some ways, White's new position only formalizes her long-standing influence in the White House. The 53-year-old has known Trump for more than 15 years and frequently meets with the president alongside fellow evangelical Christian advisers, including a White House visit this week where the group laid hands on Trump in prayer. But White is a more contentious figure within her faith than other pro-Trump evangelicals and was the subject of a years-long investigation into her finances by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.

That profile makes White, who uses her married name White-Cain, a compelling symbol for liberal Christians who are making an increasingly vocal appeal to religious Americans who do not align with Trump's broader political agenda.

"The rise of the religious left has been given a shot in the arm every time Trump doubles down on his white evangelical base," said Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons, a religious activist on the left who created an anti-Trump network called The Resistance Prays. "Yes, he may score short term political points. But in the long term, he really is energizing and mobilizing this whole swath of people who are religious and are astonished by what's happening with the Paula Whites of the world."

Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, a liberal evangelical preacher who works with the progressive group Red Letter Christians, said White's use of her ministry "to exploit the poor ... should be of real concern to all people of faith."

"While we often frame religion in public life as progressives to conservatives, it's important to say that even within that frame, Paula White is an extremist and always has been," Wilson-Hartgrove said.

The White House role for White, whose ministry did not immediately return an interview request, was first reported by The New York Times. White distanced herself from the prosperity gospel in a 2017 statement that said she would "reject any theology that doesn't affirm or acknowledge the entirety of scriptural teaching about God's presence and blessing in suffering as much as in times of prosperity."

The Florida-based White's website features a pitch for followers to purchase a $130 "Favor Seed" in order to help battle "an enemy of debt, depression, a job, or a health issue prevailing against you."

The White House initiative she will advise was created by the Trump administration last year to help faith-based groups partner with the federal government. White's advisory role, according to the executive order setting up the initiative, empowers her to suggest "changes to policies, programs, and practices that affect the delivery of services by faith-based and community organizations."

Beyond White's new position, Trump's meeting this week with his closest conservative evangelical supporters included some discussion of how they would try to energize their contacts on the president's behalf, according to attendee Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. Perkins said that while the Tuesday meeting with Trump was not entirely "a planning session," attendees did perform "a quick inventory" of their own networks to determine what "we can do" to help the president.

"Several of us have daily radio programs and some of us have TV programs and some of (us) lead very large churches and ministries," Perkins said. "It was more looking around the room and how do we be more intentional about getting this out there and using the platforms that we already have."

Texto completo: She was a 20-year-old sprinter when she made history by lighting the caldron at the Summer Games in Mexico City in 1968.
Enriqueta Basilio, a Mexican sprinter who at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City became the first woman to light the Olympic flame, died on Oct. 26. She was 71.
Her death was confirmed by the Mexican Olympic Committee, which did not specify where she died or the cause.
The 1968 Olympic Games were memorable for a number of reasons, starting with Basilio's appearance in the opening ceremonies. A 20-year-old member of the Mexican track and field team, she created a stir in the international press after she was selected to light the Olympic caldron and greeted the honor with aplomb.
The New York Times quoted her as saying, through a translator, that she thought she may have been selected because Mexican men and women had "the same rights," and that her country hoped to demonstrate this equality to the world.
"The days we live in, it's difficult to depend on a man," Basilio said. "They must be iguales -- the same."
On Oct. 12, 1968, Basilio ran into the Olympic stadium in Mexico City holding the Olympic torch, which had been carried over land and sea from Greece by a succession of more than 2,775 torchbearers. She jogged around the track, climbed 90 carpeted steps and dipped the torch into a massive metal caldron, igniting gas burners and officially starting the Games as some 100,000 spectators roared.
"Anyone with acutely sensitive ears could then hear a spectral sound," the Times sports columnist Arthur Daley wrote. "It would have been the ancient Greeks spinning madly in their crumbling mausoleums. They never permitted a woman to come near their Olympic Games but had summary punishment for every female intruder detected. She was promptly tossed off a seaside cliff onto the rocks below."
He continued: "Here was a woman in a focal role a couple of thousand years later. She handled it well."
The Mexico City Olympics had several more unforgettable moments, among them when the American track and field athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised black-gloved fists on the winners' podium to protest racism during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," and when the American Bob Beamon shattered the long jump world record by leaping 29 feet, two and a half inches -- nearly two feet farther than the previous record.
Basilio competed in the 400-meter, the 80-meter hurdles and the 400-meter relay. But she was eliminated in each event and never again competed at the Olympics.
Several women have since lit the Olympic flame at Winter and Summer Games. But Basilio and the Australian sprinter Cathy Freeman, who lit the caldron at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in 2000, are the only two to ignite the flame at the Summer Games by themselves.
Norma Enriqueta Basilio Sotelo was born on July 15, 1948, in Mexicali, the capital of the state of Baja California, to a large family of cotton farmers. She attended college in her home city and became a national champion in the 80-meter hurdles before her turn in the Olympics.
Information on her survivors was not immediately available.
In 2004 Basilio carried the Olympic torch once again, this time as it passed through Mexico City en route to the Summer Games in Athens.

Texto completo: Ms. Warren said "complacency does not win elections," as she pushed for big changes, while moderates like Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden vowed they could unite the country.
DES MOINES -- Displaying a new assertiveness toward her Democratic opponents, Elizabeth Warren laced into her chief political rivals, warning on Friday night that the country was in a "time of crisis" and arguing that Democrats would lose in 2020 if they nominated "anyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight."
Speaking to thunderous applause during the party's biggest Iowa political event of the year, Ms. Warren denounced candidates in the presidential race who opposed bold ideas in favor of more moderate solutions, in veiled attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Pete Buttigieg.
"Complacency does not win elections," she said at the Iowa Democratic Party's fund-raising dinner. "Hope and courage do not win elections. I'm not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone."
Befitting her front-runner status, Ms. Warren was the target of heated attacks from three of the first five speakers on the stage: Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. None of the candidates mentioned one another by name, though Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg both presented themselves as more capable of uniting the country.
"We will fight when we must fight but I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think that fighting is the point," Mr. Buttigieg said.
Mr. Biden, who spoke directly after Mr. Buttigieg, extended the theme, saying, "If you can't bring the country together we're in real, real, real trouble."
Even Ms. Harris, whose campaign is lagging to the point that she may not qualify for the party's December debate, attacked Ms. Warren personally for the first time.
"I've only had one client in my life -- the people," Ms. Harris said of her career as a prosecutor. "Unlike others, I've never represented a corporation."
The sharp exchanges underscored the urgency motivating the candidates as the race enters its final phase ahead of the Iowa caucuses three months from now.
The dinner occurred on one of the most consequential days of the race so far, with Ms. Warren, under pressure from other candidates over how she would pay for "Medicare for all," finally introducing a long-awaited, $ 20.5 trillion proposal that immediately drew a fierce attack from her chief rival, Mr. Biden.
Mr. Biden declared that under his health care plan, there would be "no increase in taxes for the middle class. None, none, none," a shot at Ms. Warren's delay in articulating whether such taxpayers would see tax increases. Instead, Mr. Biden promised an opportunity to "buy into a Medicare-like proposal."
The Biden, Buttigieg and Warren campaigns each bought large sections of the 16,000-seat Wells Fargo Arena here for supporters to cheer on their candidates. Mr. Buttigieg's section was particularly enthusiastic, clapping thundersticks and waving flashing lights throughout his address. Ms. Warren's fans were also spirited, unfurling a banner during her speech with the words, "Win with Warren."
Mr. Sanders, while speaking at the event, brought no supporters, electing to lead them in a march outside instead, part of a pattern of the independent senator's antipathy toward Democratic Party functions.
At the same time, the candidates have been wooing voters with bus tours, rallies and town hall-style events. Ms. Harris, the California senator who is trying to revive her campaign, has taken to cooking Sunday night dinners in supporters' homes and plans to spend Thanksgiving in the state.
The surge in attention on Iowa coincides with a more contentious phase of the race, marked by aggressive campaigning and an increased willingness to go on the offensive.
Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, and Mr. Biden, the former vice president, have resumed their attacks on each other, with back-and-forth sniping in the last week about Medicare for all and super PACs. Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have shown an increased willingness to go after Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts.
Hours before the dinner was to begin, Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas announced the end of his presidential campaign. His departure was so sudden that supporters had already planted scores of his signature black-and-white campaign signs outside the arena.
Lower-tier candidates looking to energize their campaigns have also been more pugnacious: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for instance, has amped up her criticisms of the Democratic National Committee, the news media and even Hillary Clinton, who is not in the race.
But nowhere has the battle been more intense than at the event on Friday, with candidates trading barbs less on specific policies, and more on political ideology.
"We need big ideas, and here's the critical part: We need to be willing to fight for them," Ms. Warren said. "It's easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on big ideas, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by those ideas."
Of the top-tier candidates, only Mr. Sanders -- the sole candidate to stand stationary and speak from note on a lectern -- did not attack his opponents, instead delivering a version of his standard stump speech that championed the working class and took aim at corporate interests and the rich. He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and Nelson Mandela and provided please for his signature policy proposals, including Medicare for all and tuition-free public college.
He also announced his campaign was donating $ 20,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party in a symbolic show of solidarity even as he continues to eschew traditional party politicking.
The crowded and diverse field -- there are still 17 candidates -- has proved challenging for contenders outside the top tier. While nine have qualified for the party's November debate in Atlanta, just four are guaranteed a spot for the December debate in Los Angeles.
A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in an extraordinarily tight race. Ms. Warren held a narrow advantage, with the support of 22 percent of voters, while Mr. Sanders drew 19 percent and Mr. Buttigieg 18 percent. Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner, had the backing of 17 percent of likely caucusgoers, much weaker than his position in national polls.
For Democrats who had been inclined to support Mr. Biden but now find themselves shopping around, that means the moderate choices are limited to Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Ms. Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, with other would-be options like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey falling out of the conversation.
Susan Swift, a 58-year-old yoga teacher from Dubuque, said at a Biden event Wednesday that even after watching nine months of campaigning she was still trying to decipher the field.
Ms. Swift said she liked the former vice president for "his experience," but had become more impressed with Mr. Buttigieg the more she had seen him.
"Did you see the pluck that that guy had in the last debate?" she said. "Seriously? I was like, 'You just won my heart."'
Conversations this week with 24 of Iowa's 99 Democratic county leaders revealed moderate Democrats moving from Mr. Biden toward Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who the county officials said had benefited from strong debate performances and repeated trips to the state.
Mr. Sanders, who fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa four years ago, has struggled to retain support in the party's most liberal pockets. Some of his anti-establishment backers have gravitated to candidates even more outside the mainstream, like the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Ms. Gabbard.
Zach Simonson, the Democratic chairman in Wapello County, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 and said he was now torn between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.
"I was all in for Bernie in 2016, but with Warren in the race, some of the weaker parts of his candidacy are magnified," Mr. Simonson said. "He's got a very reasonable critique of the national Democratic Party institution, but from campaigning so much on the outside, I don't know if he'll be ready to take the role of national standard-bearer for all Democrats after the convention."

Texto completo: The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, a figure that would have been higher without the General Motors strike and other factors.
The American jobs engine has been beaten and battered, but it just keeps chugging along.
Employers added 128,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department said Friday, and revisions to prior months' data tacked on another 95,000. The figures for October would have been stronger had it not been for the strike at General Motors, which shaved close to 50,000 workers from the employment rolls, and for the layoff of some 20,000 temporary census workers.
The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6 percent, still near a half-century low. Stocks rose Friday after the report reassured investors about the health of the economy, with the S&P 500 reaching a record high.
All told, the report and other recent data paint a picture of a job market that is weathering the storm of trade tensions and a cooling global economy. The manufacturing sector is in a slump, business investment is falling, and overall economic growth has slowed this year. But consumers are still spending, employers are still hiring, and fears of an imminent recession, which reached a fever pitch over the summer, have quieted for now.
"It helps reduce the concern that the slowdown was becoming more broad-based and recession risks were right around the corner," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays. "I think most people have a slightly more positive view of the U.S. economy now than even two or three weeks ago."
The report was good news for President Trump, who has made the strength of the economy a selling point in his bid for re-election. He hailed the "blowout JOBS number" in a Twitter post on Friday. October was the 109th consecutive month of job growth, more than double the previous record.
The strong job market is creating opportunities for workers who were left out of earlier stages of the recovery. The unemployment rate for African-Americans hit 5.4 percent in October, a record low, and the labor force participation rate, which measures the share of the population working or actively looking for work, hit a six-year high. Desperate to fill jobs, companies are recruiting stay-at-home parents, retirees and people with disabilities and criminal records.
"One of the beauties of the tight labor market is that people who once wouldn't have been considered get a second chance at jobs," said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton.

Until a few weeks ago, Joann Fields was cobbling together a living delivering meals for DoorDash. But last month, Ms. Fields, 50, finished a driver-training course at Austin Area Community College in Texas, and immediately got a job driving a truck for Swift Transportation -- her first regular job in three years.
"I'm excited, I'm really excited," Ms. Fields said. "I'm ready for the road."
The trucking industry has been working to recruit more women in a bid to broaden its hiring pool. Companies in other industries are making similar decisions.
Right at Home, a provider of in-home elder care services, is struggling to keep up with surging demand as the population ages and more people need care. So it is casting a wider net, aiming its recruiting efforts at retirees, nursing students and immigrants. And it is stepping up retention efforts by offering more predictable schedules and opportunities for professional development.
Michael Flair, a vice president at the company, pointed to a recent study that found that annual employee turnover in the industry recently hit 82 percent, up 15 percentage points from a year earlier. He said he often lost workers to e-commerce warehouses, fast-food restaurants and other industries that offer more than the $ 12-an-hour wage that is typical in the home health industry.
"A lot of people say, 'Just pay more money,"' Mr. Flair said. "But you can pretty quickly price yourself out of business and make that care that is already not cheap more of a burden for that family that is struggling to pay for their parent's cost."
Becky Frankiewicz, president of Manpower Group, the staffing firm, said she often heard stories like Mr. Flair's. Companies are willing to eliminate degree and certification requirements, improve perks and benefits and even offer cash bonuses. But they are reluctant to raise base pay.
"It continues to perplex me," she said. "The defining challenge for economic growth is going to be bringing people in from the sidelines, and I absolutely believe that's going to require wage acceleration."
Wage growth has been anemic for much of the recovery, and has stalled again recently. Average hourly earnings were up 3 percent in October from a year earlier, down from a peak of 3.4 percent earlier this year. Wage growth for nonsupervisors has held up better, but is also not seeing the acceleration that would suggest a red-hot job market.
The overall pace of job growth has slowed this year, although the revisions for August and September mean the slowdown was milder than it previously appeared. Employers have added an average of 176,000 jobs per month over the past three months, down from 222,000 over the same period a year ago, a slowdown only partly explained by the G.M. and census effects.
In his Twitter post celebrating the report, Mr. Trump said the economy had added 303,000 jobs, a figure much bigger than the official Labor Department total of 128,000. The Council of Economic Advisers broke down that figure in a blog post later in the day, explaining that it accounted for the revisions (95,000 jobs), the laid-off census workers (20,000 jobs) and the effect of the G.M. strike, which it estimated at 60,000 -- larger than most independent estimates.
For policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the jobs report could be a sign that their bid to shore up the economy and prevent a recession was working. The Fed cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, but the bank signaled it would probably pause to assess fresh data before cutting again.
Still, Mr. Trump's trade war is taking a toll on manufacturing and other sectors that are exposed to the global economy. Job growth in manufacturing was weak even accounting for the G.M. strike, and separate data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the sector contracted in October for the second straight month.
MSC Industrial Supply, a distributor of metalworking products, has seen demand slow this year, and last week said it expected sales in the current quarter to fall outright. In a conference call with investors last week, Erik Gershwind, the company's president and chief executive, attributed the decline to the "overhang of uncertainty due to tariffs" and a cooling global economy.
"The weakness in industrial demand is broad-based, with some acute pockets of softness in areas like automotive, heavy truck, oil and gas and agriculture," Mr. Gershwind said.
In response, the company has cut more than 100 jobs, and says it expects to reduce employment further this quarter.
Economists worry that as companies like MSC cut jobs, consumers could grow wary, allowing the weakness in the industrial economy to spill over into the much larger service sector. So far, however, that has not happened. Consumer spending was strong in the third quarter, and measures of consumer confidence, though down from a year ago, remained high.
Hotels and restaurants added more than 50,000 jobs in October, and even the struggling retail sector posted a second straight month of gains after months of steady losses. And revisions to earlier data erased hints that the slowdown was spreading.
"We could accept data that shows weakness in manufacturing," said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Where it becomes a lot more problematic is if that weakness is spreading. We were starting to see indications of that the last few months, but they've now been revised away. It's painting a brighter picture of the service sector of the economy."
That divergence -- between confident consumers and wary businesses -- cannot continue forever. Eventually, either businesses will start to cut jobs, a sure way to erode consumers' confidence, or free-spending shoppers will set executives' minds at ease and encourage them to ramp up production again.
So far, consumers appear to be prevailing.
"As long as confidence remains pretty elevated, as long as job gains continue albeit at a slower pace," said Ben Herzon, an economist for Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, a forecasting firm. "And as long as those job gains continue to deliver wage growth, consumption should continue to drive the economy."

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Martin Scorsese's crime epic "The Irishman" landed in theaters Friday, but not nearly enough of them for theater owners.
John Fithian, president and chief executive of National Association of Theater Owners on Friday lamented Netflix's rollout of one of the year's most acclaimed films, from one of cinema's top filmmakers.
"Martin Scorsese deserved better," Fithian said in a statement.
Netflix was unable to come to terms with the largest movie theater chains on "The Irishman." The traditional theatrical window is 90 days, something Netflix has declined to follow.
That has left Netflix films essentially boycotted by the majority of multiplexes. Netflix has instead carved out a roughly three-week exclusive run in independent theaters.
"The point of an exclusive theatrical window is for movies to reach their full commercial potential. Netflix chose to artificially limit 'The Irishman's' theatrical release," Fithian said. "That sends a message to filmmakers who are not Martin Scorsese. If you want a full theatrical release, take your film to their competitors."
Netflix and theater chains, including AMC and Cineplex, negotiated extensively earlier this year on a compromise but ultimately failed to reach agreement.
A Netflix executive who spoke to The New York Times about its "Irishman" strategy said the company cares about box office, but also wants viewers to watch films the way they want.
"The Irishman" is opening this weekend on eight screens in New York and Los Angeles, including Broadway's Belasco Theatre. It begins streaming on Nov. 27.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - He was a 14-year-old boy playing basketball at dusk before curfew. Just another night, on his usual court, focused on the game he envisioned as his future.
Then came the gunshots, splintering the fall air. From 100 yards down the block, a bullet sailed across a parking lot, slipped through a fence and struck the teenager - a neighborhood jewel whom everyone knew - Aamir Griffin.
A boy and a dream crumpled to the concrete. Not the target, but the victim.
Some would chalk it up to wrong place, wrong time. But Aamir had been where he was meant to be: outside his apartment building in Jamaica, Queens, shooting hoops, staying far from the trouble that had lured away so many of his peers.
"Aamir was not like these little kids out here running around and trying to gangbang for fun," said his friend Isis Eastman, 16. "Aamir just played ball. That's all he did."
Crime is at an all-time low across New York City, dropping to levels not seen for nearly seven decades. But gun violence still flares in some pockets, shattering worlds and igniting despair. Officials have attributed recent bursts to gang conflicts.
Northern Brooklyn has seen a rise in shootings this year, with six in one weekend alone. So have several precincts in Manhattan and Queens. The 113th Precinct, where Aamir was killed Saturday, has had more than 20 shootings this year, compared with 13 for the same period in 2018.
Police officials acknowledge the uptick and say they plan to deploy extra resources to certain areas and create "safe corridors" for students going to and from school.
Two days after Aamir's death, a 16-year-old girl in Jamaica was struck in the arm by a stray bullet when a fight erupted during dismissal at New Dawn Charter High School II.
The episodes are believed to be related.
Chief of Detectives Dermot F. Shea said the shootings appeared to stem from a feud between two gangs. "These are young kids with guns," he said. "Sometimes they forget what they were fighting for."
A male teenager was questioned Tuesday about both shootings but not charged in them, Shea said. Instead, he was arrested on an unrelated robbery charge.
Frustrated residents are unable to reconcile such brazen acts with the heavy police presence in their neighborhood. Next to the basketball court where Aamir was shot is a security camera. Across the street, a Police Department watchtower.
The shootings are a symptom of the dearth of resources for youth, said Erica Ford, an area activist who founded LIFE Camp, a nonprofit that aims to stem gun violence.
"There are pockets with no investments in certain neighborhoods," Ford said. "There is nothing for these kids to do. It's like a third-world country."
But Aamir was an outlier, a boy who had found his calling and built his life around it. He had become one of the brightest fixtures in his corner of Jamaica, a tight-knit community where neighbors watch out for one another.
They knew his grin, the one he flashed that made his deep-set dimples appear. Playful and lighthearted, he had one of those belly laughs, so infectious, even if you didn't know what was funny. He was charismatic, easy to be around, but took care to show others respect. When he stopped by the local convenience store to order a chopped cheese with jalape�os, he would offer to help the owner stack the shelves.
"He was nothing but joy," said his friend Daja, 15, who declined to give her surname.
Aamir liked to dance and play video games. But he defined himself through basketball.
He had been a chubby child, round cheeks, short stature. It didn't matter. He played as if he were tall and lithe, always working drills, challenging friends, entering tournaments. He walked around with a basketball tucked in the crook of his arm, and passersby knew to ask him about his game. He idolized Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Stephen Curry.
The love of the sport had come from his father. The fire that drove him was all his.
"He was more determined than all of us," his friend Billy Jeanfrancois, 14, said. "He was like, 'I'm going to lose and come back stronger.'"
Aamir was thrilled to make his middle school team. When they lost their first game, he cried. At a matchup later in the season, the team was again close to defeat.
"Then Aamir started draining threes," recalled Shamel McCallum, 14, who lives in the same public housing complex as Aamir did. "He was the clutch player."
By then, Aamir had slimmed down and sprouted to nearly 6 feet.
He applied and got into Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, wanting to learn from its storied coach, Ron Naclerio.
"He was a sponge, he wanted to work," Naclerio said. "He really had no ego. Kids today that are good, you can see a bravado like, 'I'm the bomb, I'm the best.' They'll put stuff on Facebook or their social media like they're the next LeBron. He was not like that at all."
Aamir was being prepped to be the shooting guard for the junior varsity team. He kept up his grades so he could stay eligible. He spoke often about the NBA.
"He had tunnel vision," his stepfather, Larry Hawkins, said. "It's just so rare at that age. He already had his mind made up."
If the goal of going pro was too lofty, too impractical, no one told him. And he could make people believe.
They liked how basketball centered him. He earned the nickname "Buddy," because of his welcoming demeanor and how he enjoyed teaching others to play. If you were looking for a game, you only had to track down Aamir.
"We definitely had big dreams for him, but for him to be a good person was overall the best thing," said Shaun Lilly, 35, the fiance of Aamir's aunt. "That's what it really was about at the end of the day."
Aamir had two older sisters and a younger brother and lived in the Baisley Park Houses with his stepfather and his mother, Shanequa Griffin.
"He was passionate, he was amazing, he was great - he was everything a mother could ask for in a kid," Griffin said.
Aamir would tell her that once he became a star, he was going to buy her a house and a flashy car.
"He used to always say, 'Ma, you're my best friend,'" she said.
On Saturday, Aamir had risen early to warm up for a tournament. He led his team to a victory by hitting a last-minute 3-pointer.
When he arrived home, he headed to the court to play with his friends. Just after 8 p.m., several shots were fired near the intersection of Foch Boulevard and Long Street, the police said.
Aamir slumped to the ground with a bullet in his torso. He was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Surveillance video showed two people fleeing the area, one in a red hooded sweatshirt, the other in dark clothing. On Monday afternoon, community members flocked to that same blue-gray court, the crowd increasing with each hour as the temperature dropped. They were friends and neighbors who had no words to heal a family broken by violence. But they wanted to be near to help bear the weight of the loss. Aamir had been theirs, too.
Items were added to the memorial of flowers and teddy bears and balloons. "Rest easy young king, you're too good to be forgotten," read a message on a poster with Aamir's photo. On the ground, a giant heart had been created with candles. Within it, a logo written for a brilliant boy: "E4A." Everything for Aamir.

Electric bike craze coming to Montana?

Texto completo: In the last years of the 19th century, a bicycling craze swept the United States. At that time horses remained the most common means of personal transportation. Automobiles were rare and unaffordable; more a plaything for the rich than a way of getting from one place to the next.
With a chain drive, inflatable tires and equally sized wheels, all technological improvements developed in the 1880s, the bicycle became the first affordable means of conveyance that didn't require feeding or cleaning up after.
"...the bicycle promises a splendid extension of personal power and freedom, scarcely inferior to what wings would give," gushed an 1896 article from the New York Times.
More than a century later, a new bicycling craze is sweeping the nation once again. Electric bicycles have arrived, carrying with them the potential to vastly expand the number of people who choose a bicycle as their primary means of transportation. Riders who have already converted to an e-bike frequently describe their experience in terms no less effusive than those of the New York Times.
"The most fun I ever had on a bike was on my uncle's Turbo DEVO," said Jason Rosales, speaking of one of his first encounters with a high-end electric mountain bike. "It's a blast when you don't have to struggle to go uphill. You're constantly going that fast – get your adrenaline going and your heart pumping the whole time, instead of just trying to get up the hill."
Rosales, who manages the Knicker Biker bike shop in Great Falls, still prefers his traditional mechanical bicycle for his daily commute.
"I like the exercise (of a muscle bike), and an e-bike takes it away," Rosales said.
But he's quick to endorse e-bikes as a perfect alternative for people who want to experience the pleasures of riding without being physically tested on every slope.
"There are older riders, and there are younger people who want to get around town without a lot of exercise," Rosales said. "And then there's the hard cores who don't want to slow down going up the hills or have to walk their bikes on the single tracks (trails) around Great Falls."
The basic concept of an electrically propelled bicycle is nearly as old as the bicycle itself. In 1895, Ohio inventor Ogden Bolton Jr. received a U.S. patent for an electric bicycle with no gears and a 10-volt battery attached to its frame. However, e-bikes did not become commercially practical until the development of high storage density batteries in the 1990s.
Generally speaking e-bikes, also referred to as "pedelecs," are bicycles equipped with a battery-powered motor that engages while pedaling, or in some cases through the use of a throttle. As classified in the United States, e-bikes are "pedal assist" only, meaning they can not be propelled exclusively by their battery.
Depending upon the jurisdiction in which it operates, the motor of an e-bike is required to automatically disengage once the bike attains a speed of either 20- or 28 miles-per-hour. Electrically powered vehicles that do not require pedaling, or which continue to supply power in excess of 28-mph are legally classified as either mopeds or motorcycles and are, by definition, prohibited from traveling on paths and trails where traditional mechanical bikes are commonly found.
The intent of an e-bike is not to blast cyclists down the road without any effort at all, but instead to make their cycling experiences easier and more enjoyable.
"I always emphasize that it's fun, fun, fun," Kern Lee said of his e-bike riding experience.
Lee has been an avid cyclist and mountain biker for decades, but as he aged into his mid-60s, Lee found that he couldn't attack the steep grades as aggressively as he had in the past, and that it took longer for his body to recover. The experience wasn't as enjoyable as it once had been.
Last May, Lee bought an e-bike after riding a friend's electric mountain bike. In just more than four months, he's already put more than 800 miles on it.
"They're making bikes now that are both nimble and capable," Lee said of high-quality mountain e-bikes. "I'm riding rough stuff, doing jumps. These bikes really perform."
At 67, Lee is more fit and has greater endurance than most people half his age. The pleasure he finds in e-biking is closely connected to the exercise he continues to obtain from riding them.
"My average rides before on a regular bike were 10 to 12 miles," Lee said. "I felt like I could ride about as fast as I have ever ridden, but I couldn't sustain it. If I went too hard for too long, I wasn't riding the next day. My body just couldn't recover that fast."
"Now, I'm out riding longer, and I'm riding faster," he continued. "My average ride now is around 25 miles, and the next day I wake up feeling good."
Production line e-bikes are typically equipped with hand controls that adjust the amount of mechanical assistance the battery delivers to the bike. Range is a factor of the battery's storage capacity, the amount of assistance the rider dials up and the terrain over which they are traveling.
A fully charged e-bike delivering maximum assistance over steep terrain may have a range of fewer than 20 miles. Riding across a flat course with minimal assistance, the same bike could travel more than 100 miles without fully discharging. If the battery dies completely, the bike remains rideable, but since e-bikes are typically 15- to 20 lbs. heavier than comparable muscle-powered bikes, the ride would be sluggish.
Kern Lee's wife, Beverly, was never as avid a cyclist as her husband. Around town, running errands, a leisurely ride down a paved bike path were the bike rides Bev was most comfortable in. But as time went by, Bev's traditional bike began spending more time in her garage and less time on the road.
"I just kind of quit riding," she said. "I kept thinking, I've got to get back into this because it's good exercise, but it wasn't fun. It wasn't something I wanted to do anymore."
Shortly after buying his own mountain e-bike, Kern Lee bought Bev a commuter style e-bike more appropriate for the type of riding she was accustomed to doing. Bev soon rediscovered her enthusiasm for biking.
"At first, I was a little nervous because I hadn't been riding for a long time," she said. "But then it was so easy, it's so care free. It makes you feel like a kid again. It's fun. It's not work."
Americans have been comparatively slow warming up to e-bikes; Montanans even more so.
According to the market analytics firm Mordor Intelligence, global production of e-bikes topped $17. 7 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to $18.7 billion by 2024. China is both the world's largest producer and the largest consumer of e-bikes, where 210 million are ridden daily. In European countries like Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, e-bikes now make up nearly a quarter of all bike sales. City planners applaud their growing popularity, heralding e-bikes as a zero-emissions transportation alternative that helps reduce traffic congestion. Six e-bikes will easily fit in a parking space designed to accommodate a single automobile.
Compare this to the United States where just 263,000 e-bikes were sold in 2017, with only 48,000 of those (18 percent) manufactured domestically. While American interest in e-bikes may be lagging, it's growing rapidly.
E-bike sales in the U.S. increased 83 percent between May 2017 and May 2018, with e-bikes making up 10 percent of all bike sales for that period. Most major U.S. bicycle brands now sell e-bikes, with manufacturers positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing market.
Knicker Biker has been selling e-bikes at its Great Falls store for a little more than three years, and according to Rosales, both inquiries and sales have grown rapidly in the past year.
"I don't see it as a fad at all," he said of the future of e-bikes. "I think Great Falls is slow to catch up with other markets. I know for a fact it's far bigger in other areas, even close by like Missoula and Bozeman."
Perhaps the greatest deterrent to increased e-bike sales is their cost. Low end e-bikes start at around $1,400, while a specialized performance model can run as high as $14,000. E-bike advocates note that the high cost of an e-bike can be justified if the buyer is willing to replace short trips typically made by a car, thus realizing reduced costs in fuel and maintenance.
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, half of all driving trips in the United States are less than three miles in length, a distance easily covered by e-bikes. Students at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science found that on average e-bike owners replaced 46 percent of their car commutes and 30 percent of their driving errands with e-bike rides.
However, e-bikes are not without their critics. The most common source of concern focuses upon the potential safety risks of introducing a vehicle capable of a sustained speed of 28-mph onto paths and bike lanes already crowded with pedestrians, motorists and other cyclists.
In October 2017, the New York City Mayor's Office issued a news release boastfully announcing how the city had more than doubled the number of e-bikes it had seized over the preceding year.
"E-bikes are illegal to operate on New York City streets," the release states. "According to the City Administrative Code, an 'e-bike' constitutes a 'motorized scooter' and 'no person shall operate a motorized scooter in the City of New York. So far this year the NYPD (New York Police Department) has seized 923 e-bikes compared to the 341 it confiscated this time last year."
New York's crack down on e-bikes was short lived. It came in response to a sharp increase in the number of restaurants using e-bikes to make food deliveries in the crowded urban center. Fast and virtually silent, e-bikes were identified as the source of a sudden rise in pedestrian versus cyclist crashes.
"Electric bikes are dangerous nuisances in my Senate district for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers," New York State Senator Brad Holyman asserted. "Moreover, they're illegal, so it's outrageous that some irresponsible businesses in Manhattan brazenly flout the law by using e-bikes to make deliveries."
Delivery riders took to New York's streets to oppose the e-bike ban, arguing that city was unfairly impeding their ability to make a living. The impasse was resolved less than a year later when state lawmakers amended New York law to permit throttle-trolled bikes with a top speed of 25 mph.
A similar dispute has recently played out in the nation's national parks. Until a few weeks ago, the National Park Service was inconsistent on whether e-bikes were permitted on established bike paths. Some parks prohibited their use, classifying e-bikes as motorized vehicles. Others did not differentiate between path use by traditional muscle-powered bicycles and e-bikes.
In August 2019, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt issued a directive compelling all national parks to give greater access to e-bikes on trails designated for traditional muscle-powered bike use. The move prompted the following response from one cyclist writing to National Parks Traveler digital magazine.
"Mixed use bicycle and pedestrian paths are dangerous enough without adding any propelling device," the respondent wrote. "Changes as suggested will open rental companies to pressing the limits of the motors and throttling. The simplest and safest solution is to maintain these paths as non-mechanical only. At Yosemite I was required to walk from the parking lot on mixed use paths. While I was trying to dodge groups of pedestrians who covered the width of walkways, the bicycles created a definite hazard."
Jeff Mow, superintendent of Glacier National Park, recently told the Great Falls Tribune that there are only a handful of trails in Glacier that currently allow bikes of any type, and so the prospect of negative e-bike/pedestrian interactions is limited. Mow did say, however, that there are concerns about the safety of inexperienced cyclists overestimating their skills on Glacier's roads, particularly in the Spring when Going-to-the-Sun Road is opened to cyclists before motorized traffic is allowed.
"The roads haven't been cleared of rocks necessarily, so your dodging them," Mow said of the park's spring biking experience. "In some places the guard rails for cars haven't' been put up. It's not necessarily a place for the inexperienced."
"We already have these issues with traditional bikers - with people maybe not stopping to think, 'Am I really prepared for what is up ahead," he continued. "We will continue to address these issues in the future."
While the growing popularity of e-bikes may present some regulatory challenges, they are a mode of transportation with the potential to change how Americans commute and recreate. The "splendid extension of personal power and freedom" promised by mechanical bicycles more than 100 years ago could ultimately be realized by electric bikes in the 21st century.

Texto completo: America will cease to be America if Congress fails to impeach President Trump, according to top Democrats and their allies in the press.
Just ignore all those other "tipping points." Now it is for real.
"When we have a president who says, 'Article Two says I can do whatever I want,' that is in defiance of the separation of powers. That's not what our Constitution says," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week on the floor of the House.
She added, "What is at stake in all of this is nothing less than our democracy. What are we fighting for? Defending our Democracy for the people."
There is a broad consensus in the press that Pelosi is right. If Congress does not impeach the president, American democracy itself and the republic will cease to exist.
“We don’t live in the American republic that existed from 1787 until 2017,” MSNBC regular Steve Schmidt declared Thursday. “It’s a different type of country. And that’s why this is such a grave day because the question that’s coming is one of the most important questions that the country has ever faced.”
“This will cause even worse division in the country. And it’s hard to imagine we could be more divided,” he added, apparently forgetting all about 1861-1865.
Writing for the Washington Post, CNN host Fareed Zakaria drew comparisons between Congress' failure to impeach Trump and the rise of the Third Reich.
“Were Trump’s position to prevail, the U.S. president would become an elected dictator,” he warns. “A democracy can turn into a tyranny not all at once, with a bang, but over time. … Liberty is eroded slowly but steadily. The Weimar Republic was a well-functioning liberal democracy that, within a few short years, using mostly legal processes, became a totalitarian dictatorship.”
New York Times contributing writer Will Wilkinson claimed essentially the same thing in early October.
“Impeachment is … imperative,” he declared, “not only to protect the integrity of next year’s elections but to secure America’s continued democratic existence.”
The always-good-for-a-laugh Independent stated earlier last month, “If Democrats don't impeach Trump now, there's no point in having impeachment at all," adding, “Our democracy depends on it.”
“The cost of allowing such a person to remain in office is far greater than the bitterness his removal is bound to cause,” Princeton University professor Sean Wilentz writes for Rolling Stone magazine. “Trump’s war against the U.S. government, his rage to turn every federal institution into an instrument of his own self-aggrandizement, aims to void government of any other purpose.”
Lastly, there are those Democrats and media pundits who say the quiet part out loud.
“I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected. If we don't impeach him, he will say he's been vindicated,” Rep. Al Green of Texas, said in May of this year.
He added, "We have a constitutional crisis. We must impeach this president. If you don’t, it’s not the soul of the nation that will be at risk only, it is the soul of the Congress that’s at risk."
Then there is the press’s favorite “ethicist,” Richard Painter.
“It's critically important that the House not only start impeachment investigations formally," he said in September, "but that they vote on articles of impeachment. All of the evidence is already there. We don't need more to impeach this president and if they don't do it, I think the Democrats are going to lose in 2020, and probably deserve to lose."
MSNBC’s Ari Melber responded, "Wow.”
Wow indeed.

Política migratoria de Trump: Crueldad como política de estado

Texto completo: Abundan las evidencias de que la política migratoria del país está en manos de gente extremadamente cruel e inepta.
En una entrevista de radio hace años, Ken Cuccinelli comparó a las familias hispanas con “ratas”, “mapaches” y otras plagas. Hoy, Cuccinelli —cuyos ancestros italianos escaparon pobreza y miseria emigrando a Estados Unidos— es el director interino del Servicio Federal de Ciudadanía e Inmigración. Y la facción más cruel sobre política migratoria en la Casa Blanca quiere convertirlo en el nuevo Secretario de Seguridad Nacional.
Según el libro “Guerras Fronterizas: Dentro del Asalto de Trump a la Inmigración” del New York Times, un frustrado Donald Trump llegó a ordenar a sus consejeros clausurar la frontera con México, disparar a los migrantes en las piernas, y fortificar el muro con un foso lleno de caimanes y serpientes.
Trump no logró realizar su sueño medieval, pero su cruel racismo sigue causando estragos en la frontera . La Unión de Libertades Cívicas informó recientemente que la administración separó a más de 1.500 niños inmigrantes de los que se tenía constancia, elevando así el total a más de 5,400 menores arrancados de los brazos de sus padres en la frontera.
Otro reporte de Human Rights First reveló que la política de Trump de forzar a los solicitantes de asilo a que esperen en México —hasta el momento unas 50,000 personas— ha generado más de 350 casos de violación, secuestro, tortura y otros crímenes en ese país. Un informe similar del Centro de Política Inmigratoria que entrevistó a más de 600 solicitantes a la espera en México confirmó esta nueva crisis innecesaria de la administración. Uno de sus autores expresó al The Washington Post que “estamos literalmente enviando a personas a su muerte potencial” , agregando que al hacerlo Estados Unidos incumple sus compromisos internacionales de derechos humanos.
En medio de este caos y crueldad, la construcción del muro medieval de Trump avanza con devastadoras consecuencias para el medio ambiente . Hasta el momento ha diezmado más de 600 acres de terrenos públicos, arrasando plantas autóctonas, interrumpiendo corredores migratorios de la fauna y malgastando cruciales recursos hidráulicos en el Suroeste.
El daño causado en Arizona incluye la destrucción de cactus y sitios arqueológicos en el Monumento Nacional de Organ Pipe Cactus. Bombear agua subterránea para mezclar concreto para esta construcción amenaza con secar frágiles humedales del desierto en Quitobaquito Springs y el Refugio Natural de Vida Silvestre de San Bernardino, en Arizona.
Al mismo tiempo, en Texas, empezó la construcción del muro en lugares adyacentes al Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre del Bajo Río Grande, al sur de una sección de 3,300 acres de Las Palomas, hogar de la paloma de ala blanca y muchas otras especies nativas de esa región.
Aún así, dejando a un lado todo atisbo de vergüenza profesional, el director en funciones de la Oficina Federal de Gestión de Terrenos (BML), William Pendley , mintió diciendo que el muro fronterizo “está solucionando la crisis ambiental que impacta los terrenos más vulnerables de nuestro país”. Este ecologista de opereta —un acérrimo negacionista climático— defiende la catástrofe ecológica que es el muro fronterizo argumentando falsamente que la frontera “está abrumada por ilegales, gente con armas, gente que trafica drogas”.
En realidad, la frontera, sus maravillosos parajes y, sobre todo, las personas que la habitan y transitan están abrumados por la insensata y racista política migratoria de Trump, Cuccinnelli, Pendley y tantos más.
Sus palabras sobre ratas, mapaches, caimanes y serpientes dejan claro que, para ellos, la crueldad es política de estado.

By Tik Root
It's Halloween on Thursday, so we thought we'd take a look at something scary that's probably lurking in your home: energy vampires.
Also known as phantom power and ghost load, the term refers to items plugged into an outlet that draw power even when they aren't being used.
"It may not seem like a big problem," said Michael Goldschmidt, a housing and environmental design expert at the University of Missouri. But an average home, he said, racks up roughly a whole month's worth of vampire power annually. "It's a really big deal."
The Natural Resources Defense Council puts the cost at about $ 165 per United States household, or $ 19 billion nationally. That translates to around 44 million tons of carbon dioxide, or 4.6 percent of the country's total residential electricity generation. In an office, things like printers, computers and phone chargers can consume a quarter of a building's energy.
You can get a general sense of the vampire power in your home by checking your energy meter during low-use times like late at night or early morning. Then, to see which household items are frequent phantoms, you could try a free smartphone app called Dr. Power. It has a library of more than 100,000 appliances and devices. Another option is a Kill-a-Watt meter, which measures how much energy individual appliances are using. They're available at most hardware stores and can sometimes be borrowed at public libraries.
When it comes to reduction, Lisa Schmidt, chief executive of Home Energy Analytics, a California-based start-up that develops energy analysis software, recommends focusing on the higher consumption items first. "You may find one device is taking up 30 percent of the phantom load," she said. "That's the one you want to focus on."
Home entertainment systems are a common energy suck, Ms. Schmidt said, especially surround-sound stereo systems. Heated towel racks are an increasingly common electricity hog. There are also things that people rarely use but keep plugged in, like the set-top box in the spare bedroom. Older items, like VCRs, also tend to be less energy efficient.
In the case of those power-hungry devices, the savings can be surprising. Shutting-down a computer, for example, can cut energy use by 65 percent compared with leaving the device in idle mode.
Because unplugging and re-plugging devices can be tedious and difficult, Ms. Schmidt recommends smart power strips. There's a whole range of options, including motion-sensing versions and strips that can be controlled remotely on your phone.
There are limits to what can be unplugged or managed. Your main refrigerator, for instance, should be kept on. Some older internet routers and TV cable boxes can crash when unplugged, though that's fairly uncommon. And safety devices like smoke detectors should always be on.
Overall, though, slaying those energy vampires can lead to significant energy savings and that means lower greenhouse gas emissions. And, according to Mr. Goldschmidt, any investments in strips, plugs or other energy-management technology should have a very quick payback.
"It saves you money and you're helping the environment," he said.

One of the central planks in Donald Trump's campaign in 2016 was his promise to save coal. So you might think that the bankruptcy filing this week by Murray Energy, one of the largest privately owned coal mining operations in the United States, would hurt the president in coal country in next year's election.
Murray Energy, after all, was the latest in a string of coal companies to go belly up amid a shift to renewable energy and cleaner-burning gas. One respected analyst placed a big share of the blame for those bankruptcies squarely on the president's shoulders.
"Trump failed. It's that simple," said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit research firm that supports the shift to renewable power. "They had the keys to the kingdom, the coal industry did, and they couldn't fix it."
But will that translate into lost votes for President Trump in coal country? Maybe not, other analysts said.
"Politically in West Virginia I don't think it's going to change things," said John C. Kilwein, an associate professor of political science at West Virginia University.
"The narrative has been created in a pretty shrewd way," Professor Kilwein said. "It's, 'Look we're struggling against these liberals and these environmentalists. At least Trump is trying for us."'
"I can almost guarantee he's going to win the state," he said.
Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels, agreed. "Symbolically it's frustrating," he said of the Murray Energy bankruptcy.
But, he added: "I don't think it impacts Trump's standing in coal country at all. And, more importantly, where are they going to go?"
Mr. Sanzillo said coal workers were realistic about the future of the industry but wanted to hear about concrete plans for job creation in a post-coal world.
"I think people in coal country know that the industry is in decline and that's pretty permanent. The question for whether or not that hurts Trump is really a question for the Democrats," he said. "What are they offering?"

Texto completo: The Treasury Department says the Obama-era regulations are unnecessary after the 2017 tax overhaul.
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department said on Thursday that it was rolling back regulations issued under the Obama administration that were enacted to prevent American companies from moving their official residence abroad to reduce their tax bills.
The regulations are no longer necessary, Trump administration officials say, because of changes made in the tax overhaul that President Trump signed in 2017. The changes reduced taxes on American companies and included provisions meant to discourage these so-called inversions. In an inversion, an American company merges with a foreign firm and becomes its subsidiary, effectively moving its headquarters abroad for tax purposes.
The previous regulations, issued over the course of President Barack Obama's second term, were credited by many tax analysts with reducing inversions. Business groups criticized the regulations, and the United States Chamber of Commerce sued to block one set of the rules, calling them "unauthorized and unlawful."
In a news release, the Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, referred to the 2017 law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, saying that it "leveled the playing field for American businesses."
"Because tax cuts made our business environment more competitive, we are now able to remove regulatory burdens that have been rendered obsolete, further reduce costs for job creators and hard-working Americans, and protect the U.S. tax base," Mr. Mnuchin added.
Democrats criticized the move.
"The corporations that got a massive taxpayer handout are getting another gift from Donald Trump," Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a statement. "The Obama administration had essentially shut down inversions -- transactions whose only purpose is to help big multinational corporations move overseas to avoid paying taxes. Weakening these rules only provides an opening for corporations to again dodge their taxes."
The 2017 law reduced the corporate income tax rate in the United States to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent. It included provisions meant to discourage companies from shifting profits, headquarters designations or actual economic activity overseas to minimize their tax bills.
Thus far there is little evidence, in spite of Mr. Trump's promises, that the law has reversed a flow of outsourcing that saw many American companies move factory production and jobs to lower-cost countries in recent decades. But supporters of the tax law have claimed at least one victory regarding inversions: the purchase this year of the Irish pharmaceutical company Allergan by its American rival AbbVie.
Mr. Obama's anti-inversion regulations had effectively scuttled in 2016 what would have been a merger between Allergan and the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which would have resulted in Pfizer's moving its declared headquarters overseas.
In beginning to undo the Obama-era rules, Treasury officials on Thursday withdrew a set of documentation requirements issued in October 2016 and proposed to replace other regulations relating to inversions with more "streamlined and targeted" rules regarding when certain corporate debt is treated as stock.

Texto completo: The results are in, people, and it’s a landslide. Your choice for Worst Trump Cabinet Member is...
Attorney General William Barr! Barr was cited for multiple non-achievements. There was his misrepresentation of the findings of the Mueller report. And the decision to respond to Robert Mueller’s warning about Russian intervention in American elections by — as one voter put it — “opening investigations into the investigators.”
The bottom line was a quaint conviction that the attorney general is supposed to work for the public, not the president.
“I cannot believe I am stating this, but Jeff Sessions had more respect for the law,” wrote Diana from Centennial.
Second place went to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “Silence on Ukraine, sycophant to Trump, continues to demoralize the State Department, lack of support for his ambassadors,” wrote Isabelle Stillger, launching off in a very long list of complaints about Pompeo’s failure to ... pretty much everything.
“First in his class at West Point and he ends up polishing Trump’s boots,” added Phyliss Dalmatian.
Still, the results weren’t even close. Besides his dedication to protecting the president from, um, criminal justice, Barr unnerved readers with his war against secularism. “The chief enforcer of the Constitution recently gave a speech decrying those who would interfere with Christian religious control of our government,” noted Sharon from Montana, who predicted Barr “will go down in history as the worst attorney general.”
Maybe it was partly the name. So many possible Barr rhymes.
“The new star — By far — Is Billy Barr,” announced Stephen Glynn. “Where’s the tar and feathers?”
We can skip tar and feathers. Our goal is not physical torture. Just humiliation.
As usual, we got a lot of complaints about the Worst Cabinet Member contest from people who said it was impossible to pick just one. (“There is a dead heat with all of them tied at the bottom.”)
Nobody, however, claimed there was a problem of shortage of possibilities.
Perpetual contender Betsy DeVos finished third. Readers pointed out that the secretary of education was recently held in contempt of court for refusing to support students victimized by crooked for-profit schools. But the bottom line was that Donald Trump’s top education official doesn’t like public schools. End of story.
On the plus side, DeVos has always gotten a bit of a slide from those who argue she’s too incompetent to be a major threat. There are several Cabineteers in that category. “I’ve been thinking that Ben Carson must be in the Witness Protection Program,” wrote a voter from Nashua, New Hampshire, about our secretary of housing and urban development. “Really, has anyone seen him in the last several months?”
The last Worst winner, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, dropped down to the middle of the pack despite his heroic bid for attention by threatening to fire officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who had the temerity to reassure the public that Trump’s do-it-yourself weather map threatening Alabama with a hurricane was fictional.
“The meteorology thing was awesome,” wrote John Merrill.
Perhaps our respondents have decided that Ross, for all his awfulness, also is too inept to pose much trouble. Nearly three years into the job, “he appears to be perpetually stuck on Level One of the learning curve,” theorized John Evans.
Still, there were a few whimpers about lack of achievement by officials like Elaine Chao, secretary of transportation and wife of Mitch McConnell. “The secretary, who would have never gotten a Cabinet job without her spouse, has made Infrastructure Week into a punch line,” wrote a voter who gets extra credit for bringing infrastructure into the conversation.
A number of people suggested a Worst shout-out to Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, plus acting White House chief of staff. (Mulvaney is also winner of Longest Title award.) You’ll remember that famous interview in which Mick announced that Trump wanted to host the G7 summit at his hotel because “he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.”
Rick Perry may be departing as energy secretary, but he’ll be hard to forget. His role as one of “the three amigos,” federal officials allegedly charged with handling Ukraine, would be enough. But Perry voters also seemed bathed in nostalgia for ineptitudes past. “Who are the three amigos? If he says ‘me, Volker and oops,’ he’s my guy,” wrote LJR from South Bay.
The Cabinet members regarded as truly terrible were the non-inept ones. “He’s both energetic and fiendishly clever,” complained Edith Frick, casting her vote for Barr. Frick added, however, that if Worst had the “normal meaning of incompetency, clear winner is Ben Carson.”
It’s amazing how familiar you readers are with Trump’s top officials. Especially since they come and go so quickly. William Barr has only been attorney general since February, and you’re thinking about him all the time.
A lot of our correspondents seemed torn between Barr and the duo of Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt and Andrew Wheeler, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Penny White wavered back and forth, then finally decided she had to go with Bernhardt/Wheeler “from a sheer survival viewpoint.” She also wondered if anyone had contemplated Cabinet-level Halloween masks.
Prize to the first person who goes trick-or-treating as the attorney general.

Texto completo: "It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised."
Ken Rosenberg
Applied conservation scientist, Cornell University
When a team of Cornell University researchers and others published a bird study in the online journal Science on Sept. 19, they didn't expect the worldwide reaction that followed.
The findings: North America has lost 2.9 billion birds in the past 50 years — 29% of the avian population.
The impact: An ecosystem is losing a key component and it's a sign of a quickly changing environment that will affect other wildlife, plants and more.
The spotlight: Once the study was released, the New York Times picked up the story and highlighted a startling statement from David Yarnold, president and chief executive of the National Audubon Society, who called the findings "a full-blown crisis." Other major media outlets picked up the story, and conservationists around the world were shocked and inspired to take action.
"The reaction to the study has been phenomenal. We were hoping for a big response," said Ken Rosenberg, an applied conservation scientist at Cornell, the study's lead author and a leader of research and planning on joint initiatives by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology Lab and the American Bird Conservancy.
"We expected some response, but this is the biggest thing we've seen for a bird paper. It was amazing to see the findings on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington Post. All of networks talking birds for one day was so great. The trick now is how to keep the interest and keep the momentum going so it is not a headline that disappears."
From Ithaca and beyond To publish the study, the team of scientists tracked birds for decades, and parts of the study came from Ithaca's backyards and skies, as countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers submitted their observations to databases and helped carry out studies of bird populations every year.
Some of the most fascinating parts of the study came from weather radar maps as the researches found some types of birds were declining in population, but others, such as waterfowl and raptors, were increasing in numbers.
"It was quite overwhelming," said Adriaan Dokter, a research associate at Cornell. "It reached Europe, too. It went all over the world. It was more than what we expected."
Dokter noted he and Rosenberg were interviewed by Australian, Dutch and Spanish media.
"People see this trend not just here, but in Europe," Dokter said. "It's not just a local U.S. phenomenon, but a trend all over the world."
To Dokter, the confirmation of the population decrease across hundreds of bird species is like a canary in a coal mine.
"It's a decrease in the vitality of the ecosystem that we see. Birds depend on insects. Insects are important to the ecosystem of plants," he said. "It means something fundamental in our environment ... It's a warning sign that we have to be careful. Things are rapidly changing."
How scientists researched the decline in birds Surveying: Scientists and amateurs observed birds to complete censuses.
Weather radar: Scientists examined weather radar maps to determine the cumulative weight of birds in the sky.
Research: Researchers examined hundreds of different surveys.
Analysis: After finding the best data from the surveys, scientists conducted statistical analyses to determine how much populations have decreased.
The team at Cornell partnered with the American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies, Canadian Wildlife Service, the Georgetown University Georgetown Environment Initiative, United States Geological Survey and the Smithsonian National Zoological Park Conservation Biology Institute.
"'Were there declines or shifts?'" Rosenberg said about the questions researchers had years ago. "Someone never did this comprehensive work."
Researchers then obtained answers they were searching for — there's been an overall decline in the bird population, and the largest declines have been in the most common species.
"It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised," Rosenberg said.
Using weather radar, Dokter was able to pick up the cumulative weights of birds migrating, which he later analyzed. The birds he researched tended to be long-distance migratory birds, which contribute more to the bio-life on radar maps.
"The U.S. has a very large network of radars that cover ... anything in the sky — not just weather, but also wildlife," Dokter said. "Birds give strong signals. More and more have realized this, and it's an important data source for biologists. If you look at it on your iPhone, you don't see the individual bird, but a blob of bio-life moving. That's what is used for birds.
"We don't see the numbers, but the kilograms of birds in the skies. What we did see recently is the amount of migration that has changed. It's a nice complement to what's seen on ground. Radar gives really good coverage. With radar, we can count many more birds than what we could count on the ground."
Bird biomass in the skies has decreased by about 14% since 2007, Dokter told the Cornell Chronicle, Cornell University's in-house publication.
"The decline in night skies might be steeper than what we see on the ground. It's migratory birds, especially birds that travel long distance ... they seem to be not doing too well," Dokter said. "It's what I want to document next, and the why and what we can do to turn it around. Where do they face the most problems and challenges?"
Outside of weather radar data, scientists looked through more than 500 surveys, Rosenberg said. They then used a statistical model to analyze the data.
Locals get involved in tracking bird population The primary data source was the North American Breeding Bird Survey, which started in 1966 as a collaboration between scientists and bird-watchers.
While there have been studies on the changes of bird populations on the continent, the most recent study was the first time anyone has ever collected and analyzed 50 years' worth of data and findings in North America.
For decades, countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers have submitted their observations to databases. In the new research, professionals examined those studies to estimate the populations of 529 species from 2006 to 2015.
"The study published in Science was shocking to me, with its report of just how deeply bird populations have crashed since 1970," said Diane Morton, president of the Cayuga Bird Club. "The paper let us know that it is not just our subjective impression that there are fewer birds now, but that hundreds of different bird species really are much, much less abundant than they used to be.
"Among other alarming declines, the authors reported that forest birds like warblers, and grassland species like meadowlarks and sparrows, now number hundreds of millions fewer than in the 1970s."
The Cayuga Bird Club's annual Christmas Bird Count contributed to the findings. In addition, the club also counts birds for the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas.
"It was rewarding for those of us who participate in the annual Christmas Bird Count to know that the numbers we gather in our bird counts year after year were useful for these analyses," Morton said. "We did not provide any direct input, but our participation in citizen science projects generated some of the data that this extensive study used."
Surveys by Rosenberg and other local scientists contributed as well.
"The birders are the eyes of the world," he said. "You need to have all the eyes and ears out there because scientists can't do it alone. But it's not just the observation of amateurs. It's data collected for the purpose of the survey."
Birds that have seen the largest decrease The research shows most of the birds lost belong to 12 families, including warblers, finches, sparrows and swallows.
Birds associated with farmlands have seen the largest decline in numbers and percentage.
"Some birds in our backyards are the steepest in decline that we see," Dokter said. "Hopefully, it will lead to action take care of nature."
Out of all of the bird families, the largest decline was among larks. There are 70 million fewer Eastern meadowlarks, 60 million fewer Western meadowlarks, and a 67% decline for all larks.
"We're seeing this loss of abundance, because birds are integral parts of ecosystems. They perform ecological functions like seed dispersal," Rosenberg said. "The loss of this chunk of birds is causing ecological consequences. Because we have this data on birds, the fear that is happening with birds is happening across the board with other animals."
What's being done for North American birds The National Audubon Society has responded strongly to the report and is mobilizing its 1.65 million members to urge lawmakers to act on bird conservation.
The organization is pushing for the passing of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act and implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Both plans focus on providing an optimal environment and water for birds in the regions.
The group also wants lawmakers to defend and reinforce the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which the Trump administration has been trying to weaken. Conservationists say the Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects close to 1,000 species of North American birds and is the most import bird conservation law in the U.S.
How you can help the birds Individuals can take a variety of actions to help, including making windows safer, reducing plastic use, keeping cats indoors, using native plants and avoiding the use of pesticides. To learn more, visit 3billionbirds.org/.
What's next for the bird population The Cayuga Bird Club will census birds for the next New York Breeding Bird Atlas, which will have five years of surveys starting from January 2020.
"The Science paper is a call to action," Morton said. "It has sparked more urgent discussion about how to address the decline of bird populations — through conservation management, changing the developed landscape to provide better habitat for birds, and taking individual steps to reduce the threats that birds face. Continued monitoring of bird populations will also be important for prioritizing conservation efforts."
Because the study did not state the reasons for the decrease in bird populations, Rosenberg said he and the researchers are assembling a group of experts early next year to investigate the causes of the declines.
"The most important thing is that this doesn't become a news flash," Rosenberg said "We want people to pay attention and to track birds.
"People who love birds have to speak up. ... We won't reverse the declines unless people who love birds demand action."

Texto completo: AMHERST — Most people remember the photographer Jerome Liebling for his black-and-white photographs: workers, children, people going about their lives. A boy spreads his overcoat like two wings, poised to fly. A mother on the streets of Málaga, Spain, clutches her child as a bike whirs past. A slaughterhouse worker spattered with blood steadies himself on a wall and glances down.
But type “Jerome Liebling" into Getty Images's search engine, and color pops into view: lush greens and reds of an apple orchard, turquoise stripes on Art Deco apartments in Miami Beach, orange-and-pink swirls on a patterned dress in Brooklyn. There are famous faces, too: politicians, writers, filmmakers.
It's a surprising selection, and it's no accident. When Rachel Liebling, the photographer's daughter and primary manager of his estate, decided to make 640 of her father's photographs available for licensing through Getty Images, she had a plan.
“I was like, 'I'm putting out the work that no one knows,"' Rachel said, sitting at the kitchen table in her late father's Amherst home this summer.
Born in 1924, Jerome Liebling worked early in his career with the Photo League, a group that pioneered socially conscious street photography in midcentury New York City. His work is featured in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, New York's Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to name a few. He also was widely known as a teacher, especially in photography circles. “But you'd think he'd died in 1960," Rachel said with a laugh.
With control of an artist's archive comes control over his or her legacy. Unless the artist has a large foundation — think Picasso or Dalí — the responsibility usually falls to heirs. Since her father's death in 2011, Rachel has managed his archive with a mind to showcasing later and lesser-known works. She hopes to reframe his artistic legacy, to avoid “this idea of one Liebling," she said.
Rachel was thrown into archive management sooner than she anticipated. Just a few days after her father died, she got a call from The New York Times asking for photos for a memorial article. She was already busy grieving and preparing for her father's service. “Right away, I was dealing with, 'What body of work are we going to put out?' " Rachel said. “I hadn't really thought about it."
When Liebling died, he left behind 15,000 images, stored as prints and negatives in his Amherst study — proof of an active, six-decade-long career. Liebling cared deeply about social issues, a passion informed by his childhood during the Great Depression and service in World War II. He took pictures, he said, to “figure out where the pain was, to show things that people wouldn't see unless I was showing them."
Before he died, Liebling placed his archive in a family trust managed by his widow, Rebecca Nordstrom, and four daughters from a previous marriage. Rachel, the youngest, had experience working in the art world, so she was the logical choice to spearhead the management of her father's archive. In the next years, she helped organize a handful of retrospective exhibitions.
Then, in February 2018, René Aranzamendez contacted Rachel about licensing her father's photos through Getty Images. Aranzamendez is the senior editor of Getty Archive, a branch of the gargantuan online photo library dedicated to licensing editorial photographs taken before the year 2000. He had seen Liebling's photographs online.
“A lot of these folks digitize their content, and it's going on a website that's fairly local. So they're spending their resources and a lot of energy into content that's fantastic, but the reach is never going to be 20-offices' worth," Aranzamendez said in a phone interview, referring to the more than 20 locations that Getty has around the globe. Photographic estates that have licensed with Getty include those of Ansel Adams, Berenice Abbott, and Andreas Feininger.
An inherited photography archive is “a wonderful legacy, but a huge responsibility,"' Mary Engel said in a phone interview. Daughter of the well-known photographers Morris Engel and Ruth Orkin, Engel is founder and president of the American Photography Archives Group, a nonprofit organization that educates its members about the preservation and management of privately-owned photography archives.
Since Engel founded APAG, in 2000, new ways have emerged to promote a photographer's legacy. Through social media, websites, online licensing, and online galleries, archive managers can increase exposure, build audiences, and monetize more works. But they also risk losing control of the images and how they're used and circulated on the Web. “You know, it's scary, because anything that gets out on the Web gets out," Rachel said. “People just think they're public domain."
Pursuing legal action against every Pinterest account or blog that uses your image without permission just isn't feasible, Engel said — especially when the archive is handled by family members. Archivists can either make their photos viewable online and vulnerable to improper use, or not put photos online at all. “A lot of this is about: How much control do you want to keep?" Engel said.
The Lieblings and Nordstrom talked over the offer from Getty Images before deciding to go ahead with the project. “It was definitely an opportunity that we saw for getting Jerry's images out there in the world," said Nordstrom, Liebling's widow.
After seven years of fielding individual requests, Rachel also looked forward to handing over some of the responsibility for licensing. Her contract with Getty would be nonexclusive, meaning she could still handle some requests herself. But it would free up time and extend the archive's reach.
Rachel was still careful to impose limits. The Liebling estate's contract with Getty allows photos to be licensed only for editorial use — meaning images can run in newspapers, but not on mugs or T-shirts. Some archivists, like Engel, will produce posthumous prints; Rachel decided against it, which means all Liebling works are “lifetime prints," produced while he was alive.
The Lieblings receive a small percentage of the profits from each image they license through Getty. They're not expecting to get rich from the deal, Rachel said. The most important thing is increasing exposure and rewriting the narrative about her father's career.
Liebling's well-known works were of anonymous people — workers, children, every-men and -women. “Most people don't know he actually did a lot of portraits, too," Nordstrom said. The archive includes many recognizable faces: the novelists Chinua Achebe and James Baldwin, the photographer Paul Strand, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, candid portraits of a young Ken Burns from when the filmmaker was a student of Liebling's at Hampshire College, to name just a few.
“There was so much material there that other people — other than family, our close friends — haven't ever seen. And some of it is extraordinary work," Nordstrom continued. She found negatives from Liebling's travels to Spain, which she had never seen — although Rachel remembers trailing after her father at bullfights as a girl. There were also street scenes, like one featuring three young women leaning against a car in Holyoke.
Liebling, they said, knew about the growing importance of new technologies. He always shot on film but experimented with digital printing techniques late in life. “Jerry embraced the change, because he knew it was a way for people to see his work," Nordstrom said. “So I think he would be very much in support of this initiative that we've taken."
But Rachel and Nordstrom agree that Liebling wasn't thinking much about posterity before he died. He was just too busy. “Even at the end of his life, he was he was still working and still wanting to publish and get more of his images out there," Nordstrom said. “He was going a mile a minute."

Texto completo: A reader says they should be criminally liable for the deadly crashes. Also: A new capitalism; gender transition and loss; America's overstay in Afghanistan; being alone isn't bad.
To the Editor:
Re "Boeing C.E.O. Had Warning Before a 2nd Crash" (front page, Oct. 30):
Will we never learn? Or do we just not care enough?
This time it was hundreds of lives snuffed out -- not just money lost and lives economically devastated. It is painfully obvious to anyone with an objective eye that Boeing's executives made deadly decisions with their bottom line as their primary interest.
"The marketplace will self-regulate." How many times have we heard that nonsense being used as a tactic against government regulation? Enron, Volkswagen, Wells Fargo and Wall Street, ad nauseam.
This will stop when the executives of these companies are prosecuted criminally and, if convicted, imprisoned and fined not with company money but with seizure of their personal assets.

Social Capitalism
To the Editor:
Re "We Need a New Capitalism" (Op-Ed, Oct. 14):
I couldn't agree more with Marc Benioff's article on the need for a new capitalism. It should be called social capitalism. This new capitalism's underlying aspiration should be the enrichment of the society at large, not the few individuals.
This can be achieved with tax, economic and educational policies that empower the working class. This should include not taxing income earned by work at a higher rate than the income from capital gains. Also, companies should share the profits fairly with the workers who made that income possible, not paying 300 to 400 times more to chief executives.
Stable inequality is an illusion. History shows that inequalities polarize society, leading to dysfunctional governance, and in the long run to riots and violence.

A Child's Gender Transition: Love and Loss
To the Editor:
Re "I Wish My Dad Had Celebrated My Transition," by Meredith Talusan (Sunday Review, Oct. 20):
That a parent struggles with the news of his or her child's gender transition is not a measure of cisgender privilege but of the very human reaction to loss. And when your child changes gender, wipes out a shared past and transforms inside and out from what parents lived and experienced, it's a loss whether you like it or not.
You can bully parents and family about their emotions all you want, and hurl accusations that their grief is transphobic, but it won't change the fact that parents often need to grieve this news whether or not Ms. Talusan or the transgender community approves.
Grief is grief. It has its own timetable.
Patricia Garrison
Union, N.J.
To the Editor:
Meredith Talusan's troubling take on the emotional reactions of others to her life choices strikes me as sad, naïve and judgmental. She expects her own feelings about herself, her life and her choices to be honored and respected by others, but she refuses to grant others, whom she claims to love, the same autonomy of feelings, thoughts and selfhood.
Respect and love are always granted without self-interest, or not at all. Those things cannot be commanded or coerced by others, regardless of the history of the relationship or the need a person may feel for those kinds of connection with another person.
In the hope for a world that welcomes all, regardless of their suffering, shortcomings, gifts or appearance, each of us must recognize that love and respect are precious treasures that we can only hope for and be grateful for when we receive them.

The Limits of American Power
To the Editor:
Re "Making Deals, and Mistakes" (news analysis, front page, Oct. 22):
After 18 years of an American military presence in Afghanistan, lamentations about the loss of "leverage" now that President Trump has ordered the removal of 2,000 troops seem woefully misplaced.
It should be obvious by now that this military presence has done nothing to advance United States objectives, nor has it made Afghanistan more stable. And while the particulars vary, the reliance on military power has not ended the Syrian civil war, nor has it brought a peace settlement to the Koreas.
The overriding need is for improved diplomacy, which was shamefully absent when the president impetuously pulled troops from northern Syria. But successful diplomacy might also require more modest goals and recognition of the limits of American power.

Being Alone Isn't a Burden
To the Editor:
Re "There Are Benefits to Spending Time Alone" (Smarter Living, Oct. 28):
A lifelong Francophile, I often travel to France to visit friends and do photography.
Having lunch one day in a small restaurant in a medieval village, the other diners, all older women like me, asked if I was traveling by myself. When I said yes, one said: "Oh, that's sad. You're alone." I replied: "I'm not alone. I'm free."
With that, all the women applauded!

H.I.V. Scandal Puts Focus on Pakistan's Health Care System

Texto completo: After the reuse of syringes infected hundreds of children in a small city, health workers say the entire system needs to be revamped.
A pediatrician accused of reusing syringes and infecting scores of Pakistani children with H.I.V. is now practicing in a government-run hospital after his private clinic was shuttered, in a case that is raising widespread questions about the integrity of Pakistan's health care system.
The pediatrician, Muzaffar Ghanghro, was initially the sole focus of blame in an H.I.V. outbreak that has hit more than 1,100 people -- so far nearly 900 of them are children -- in the small city of Ratodero.
But government officials believe that he is not the only cause there, and that the bad practices he is accused of, including reusing syringes and IV needles, are so widespread across Pakistan that the entire health care system needs better regulation.
Health workers say the government needs to revamp the national medical syllabus to prioritize infection control, currently a minor part of doctor training. And they say hospitals often scrimp on the sterilization process for tools.
"The only good thing about the outbreak has been that it laid bare the multiple flaws in the system that the government with support of U.N. agencies needs to address," said Dr. Fatima Mir, a pediatric infectious disease expert working at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. She was one of the first medical workers to help with the outbreak in Ratodero.
"What the outbreak in Ratodero says about Pakistan's health care is that infection control is poor or nonexistent. Pakistan's health care system is now trying to integrate infection control as a formal part of the system," Dr. Mir added.
She said that Pakistan's medical practitioners often lack the logistics and supplies necessary to prevent and contain infections. When she was in Ratodero to help, Dr. Fatima said it was a challenge finding clean water to wash her hands with while seeing patients.
"With the lack of infection control, this outbreak is not unexpected. What is unexpected is that this time, children are the main victims, and there are a lot of them," she said.
Of the nearly 36,000 residents in Ratodero tested since late April, 1,112 have tested positive for H.I.V., 889 of them young children. With not even a quarter of Ratodero's population tested, officials worry the real numbers are much higher.
The police investigation into Dr. Ghanghro is continuing, and he has been cleared only of the charge that he intentionally spread the virus, the district inspector general in charge of the case said in an interview. Dr. Ghanghro's court case for medical malpractice is still continuing, said the district inspector general, Irfan Ali Baloch.
Dr. Ghanghro has denied that he reused syringes, which is illegal.
"A team of medical experts came and interviewed him," Mr. Baloch said. "The medical board determined that he did not intentionally spread H.I.V., but his clinic was in such a condition that the protocols were not being maintained."
Dr. Ghanghro still faces criminal charges, making it unclear how he is able to continue practicing, and why he was recently posted to a government-run hospital near Ratodero.
Provincial health care officials in Sindh Province, who would be responsible for reassigning Dr. Ghanghro, said that he has not been given the permission to resume practicing medicine and that his medical license was not recently renewed.
But Dr. Ghanghro said in an interview with The New York Times last week that he recently renewed his license, and was practicing in a government hospital with a stream of patients waiting to be seen by him, questioning the government's ability to regulate the system.
"He has applied to us to start practicing again," said Abdul Sami, an official from the Sindh provincial health care commission. "But so far, we have not allowed it."
"If he has already started practicing, it is not to our knowledge," added Mr. Sami, who is based in the district of Larkana, where Ratodero is.
Officials from the governing Tehreek-e-Insaf party blamed the outbreak on the poor governance and corruption of the local government of Sindh Province.
Other observers said the outbreak is more about systemic failure.
Zaigham Khan, a development expert who writes a column for the newspaper The News, noted that Pakistan spends less than 1 percent of its G.D.P. on health care, and that only one doctor is available for every 6,000 people, mostly concentrated in urban areas.
"Pakistan is facing a full-blown public health crisis, mainly rooted in ineffective governance and dominance of special interests," Mr. Khan said.
"Pakistan is one of the two countries in the world where polio persists, the other being Afghanistan," and treatable conditions like rabies and dengue contribute to dozens of deaths annually, he added. "In rural areas, most people are treated by quack doctors. As if that was not enough, even doctors often administer expired medicine. Doctors are hardly ever made accountable for these practices in the legal system."
Dr. Baseer Khan Achakzai, the program manager of the central government-run National AIDS Control Program, said that Ratodero's conditions were not unique, and that much of Pakistan was struggling to combat the spread of H.I.V., which causes AIDS. Unregulated clinics were continuing to operate, he said, and used syringes are frequently repackaged to sell as new, although they are supposed to be incinerated after use.
From 2010 to 2018, the number of H.I.V.-positive people in Pakistan nearly doubled, to about 160,000, according to estimates by U.N.AIDS, the United Nations task force that specializes in H.I.V. and AIDS. During that time, the number of new infections jumped 38 percent in those 15 to 24. And only about 10 percent of people thought to be H.I.V.-positive are being treated.
"With the help of U.N. agencies, a state-of-the-art AIDS control center is being established," Dr. Achakzai said. "It will ensure that contaminated syringes will not be used and all medical waste would be put in the incinerator."
With the exception of the capital, Islamabad, medical laboratories across Pakistan are not under any regulatory framework, Dr. Achakzai said.
"There is no check and balance," he said.

Texto completo: Halloween is nigh. These screamers are bound to get your blood curdling.
Netflix has done a fine job in recent years of stockpiling horror films -- from established classics to newer pictures discovered at international film festivals. But which are the scariest? It's a pleasure to watch a smart, artful and culturally relevant fright flick. But it's even better when it spooks you into leaving the lights on after bedtime. Looking to be thoroughly terrorized this Halloween season? Here are 13 devilish films that will have even the most stoic souls jumping at shadows.
'The Blackcoat's Daughter' (2017)
Stream it here .
The writer-director Osgood Perkins sets his atmospheric feature filmmaking debut, "The Blackcoat's Daughter," at a mostly empty private Catholic girls' academy, where a worldly senior played by Lucy Boynton reluctantly looks after a timid freshman played by Kiernan Shipka. While the two young ladies wait for their parents to pick them up, they investigate strange noises around the building. Meanwhile, in a separate story line, a mysterious woman (Emma Roberts) races toward that same school. Perkins brings these pieces together for a gruesome final act, rooted in the idea that one bad choice in youth can haunt a person forever. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Candyman' (1992)
Stream it here .
Based on a Clive Barker short story, this disquieting riff on urban legends has become a model for countless horror movies about supernatural monsters who emerge when their names are repeatedly called. Tony Todd plays the vengeful ghost of a man lynched by a racist mob. Virginia Madsen plays a grad student who traces the "Candyman" legend to a crime-ridden Chicago neighborhood, and inadvertently becomes the killer's accomplice. The British writer-director Bernard Rose offers some sly comments here on superstition and prejudice, in a complicated thriller with a sharp hook. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Carrie' (1976)
Stream it here .
In the director Brian De Palma's gore-soaked adaptation of Stephen King's debut novel, "Carrie," Sissy Spacek plays a misfit telekinetic teen who gets bullied by her classmates at school and abused by her Bible-thumping mother at home. De Palma plays up the adolescent angst in the film's first half but cranks up the suspense in a shattering climax, which is set at a prom where a mean prank goes horribly awry. The innovative cinematic style -- involving split-screens and slow-motion -- gives this movie's frightening finale the feel of an inescapable nightmare. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'The Conjuring' (2013)
Stream it here .
The most dominant horror subgenre of the 2010s has been a relentless take on the haunted house picture, in which pleasant American families are tormented by objects and locations with tragic histories. The first film in the "Conjuring" franchise is one of the most effectively spooky of this lot, telling the loosely fact-based story of two paranormal investigators (played by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) who try to purge the ghosts from a Rhode Island farmhouse. A terrific cast (which also includes Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) and the director James Wan's crafty deployment of jump-scares make this movie as entertaining as it is spine-tingling.

'Creep 2' (2017)
Stream it here .
"Creep" -- the first found-footage horror collaboration between the director Patrick Brice and his co-writer and star, Mark Duplass -- is also available on Netflix, and is deeply unsettling. But it's O.K. to jump straight to the superior "Creep 2," in which Desiree Akhavan plays a YouTuber named Sara who agrees to spend a day shooting video of a man who claims to be a prolific serial killer. Duplass plays Sara's subject, who may be lying for the sake of soaking up this young woman's attention ... or who may be luring her to her doom. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'The Eyes of My Mother' (2016)
Stream it here .
The writer-director Nicolas Pesce's short-but-stunning debut feature opens with a sequence of stomach-turning violence, as a nomadic psychopath terrorizes a farming family. What follows over the next hour is less visceral but is in some ways even more upsetting, as Pesce tells the story of a reclusive young woman (played by Kika Magalhaes) whose personality has been shaped by the horrors she witnessed as a girl. From its stark black-and-white imagery to its unflinching scenes of vivisection, this film is a sometimes strikingly beautiful study of a damaged soul, told with an unusual attention to visual texture.

'Hush' (2016)
Stream it here .
Netflix helped establish the reputation of the smart genre filmmaker Mike Flanagan by providing a home for several of his features, along with the acclaimed horror series "The Haunting of Hill House." Flanagan's most pulse-pounding film is the home-invasion thriller "Hush," co-written by his wife and leading lady, Kate Siegel. With minimal dialogue -- but dynamic sound design -- the movie follows a masked serial killer (John Gallagher Jr.) as he stalks a deaf-mute writer in a remote country house. By shifting perspectives, Flanagan cleverly keeps the audience on its toes -- and more aware than both the predator and his prey about what's happening. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Scream' (1996)
Stream it here .
Here's a rarity: a slasher parody as terrifying as what it mocks. In "Scream," the director Wes Craven and the screenwriter Kevin Williamson affectionately pick at the clichés of the eternally popular "attractive teens get picked off by a costumed maniac" genre. The filmmakers set their violent murder-mystery among a group of hip high school students who know the "rules" of horror movies. This likable cast of youngsters keeps the film fun and energetic, making it all the more alarming each time the "Ghostface" killer strikes. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Train to Busan' (2016)
Stream it here .
One of the more thoughtful and thematically rich films to emerge from the zombie glut, the South Korean post-apocalyptic action picture "Train to Busan" documents an epidemic of the undead right as it begins, as one infected passenger spurs an outbreak across a commuter train. What follows is an exciting monster movie. But like the similarly rail-bound "Snowpiercer," "Train to Busan" is also a commentary on how social divisions can hasten the breakdown of order, as passengers quickly condemn their fellow citizens to a misery that eventually consumes everyone.

'Under the Shadow' (2016)
Stream it here .
In the writer-director Babak Anvari's politically charged ghost story "Under the Shadow," a doctor's wife (played by Narges Rashidi) and her young daughter try to survive both missile attacks and an insidious evil spirit in a mid-1980s Tehran apartment building. The film starts as a character study about an educated woman who put her dreams aside to play house in a conservative religious society. By the final 20 minutes, when mother and child are all alone and being chased around their home by a demon, viewers understand that the world outside the heroine's door is in some ways as hostile as the one within.

'Under the Skin' (2014)
Stream it here .
Like an art-house deconstruction of "alien predator" science-fiction movies like "Alien" and "Predator," director Jonathan Glazer's adaptation of the Michel Faber novel "Under the Skin" stars Scarlett Johansson as a deadly hunter who uses her sex appeal to lure men into a bizarre extra-dimensional slaughterhouse. Glazer puts the audience in the anti-heroine's shoes, using a combination of gritty docu-realism and visual abstraction to illustrate what the world might look like to a curious creature who barely understands human behavior -- beyond what it takes to entrap her next meal. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'The Witch' (2016)
Stream it here .
Colonial America's lonely, haunted wilderness provides a backdrop for Robert Eggers's dark folk tale about a deeply religious farmer (played by Ralph Ineson) whose family destroys itself after a baby disappears. Unsure whether God is punishing them for their sins or a satanic cult is to blame, they are left to punish each other. Add a suspiciously alluring teenage daughter (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) and a possibly evil goat, and "The Witch" has all the right elements for a nerve-racking creepshow. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Would You Rather' (2013)
Stream it here .
A sick spin on a popular party game, "Would You Rather" carries an idle thought experiment to its most wonderfully appalling extreme. When a group of cash-strapped folks accept a dinner invitation from an eccentric millionaire, they find themselves attempting gross, life-threatening dares. Will they slice open their own eyeballs? Hold firecrackers in their hands? Murder their fellow guests? In this provocative and wince-inducing shocker, the director David Guy Levy and the screenwriter Steffen Schlachtenhaufen expose the perversity of the American class system, which allows the decadent rich to buy the complicity of the needy.

Texto completo: Things have changed, they agreed, since President Bill Clinton's 1993 nomination of the justice was approved by a vote of 96 to 3.
WASHINGTON -- President Bill Clinton, who put Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court in 1993, joined the justice on Wednesday for a public conversation. So did Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, who might have named Justice Ginsburg's eventual successor had she won the 2016 presidential election.
The conversation, at Georgetown University Law Center, focused on what the participants said was a radical change in federal judicial nominations. Mrs. Clinton, without naming names, said the Trump administration has been appointing unqualified judges.
"We've seen people largely chosen on the basis of age, and therefore longevity, and political ideology being pushed through despite having no relevant experience," she said. "Before the last several years people took seriously the selection of judges. Even if they were trying to find somebody who would get to the result they wanted, they wanted to be able to say that this was a distinguished lawyer, that this was a judge with experience."
By contrast, Mr. Clinton said, he was taken by Justice Ginsburg's career as a pathbreaking women's rights litigator when he was considering her for the Supreme Court. He said he was also struck by her forthrightness when they met in 1993 for an interview.
"I knew after about 10 minutes that I was going to give her the job," he said.
They discussed abortion, Mr. Clinton said. Justice Ginsburg, then a federal appeals court judge, had been critical of aspects of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
The Supreme Court had moved too fast, Justice Ginsburg wrote in 1992. It would have sufficed, she wrote, to strike down the extreme Texas law at issue in the case and then proceed in measured steps in later cases to consider other abortion restrictions.
Mr. Clinton said Judge Ginsburg talked freely about all of this. "She made a heck of a case," he said. "We were just two people alone, and she was telling me what she honestly thought."
He recalled thinking, he said, that "this woman is completely on the level."
Justice Ginsburg, now 86, was 60 when she was nominated. "Some people thought I was too old for the job," she said. "Now I'm into my 27th year on the court and am one of the longest-tenured justices. So if you worried about my age, it was unnecessary."
Justice Ginsburg's appearance with the Clintons was part of her remarkably busy public schedule since the Supreme Court announced in August that she had been treated for pancreatic cancer.
That was Justice Ginsburg's fourth brush with cancer, after surgery in December to remove two malignant nodules from her left lung, surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009 and treatment for colon cancer in 1999.
Some liberals had hoped she would retire under President Barack Obama, but she stayed on, indicating that she expected a Democrat to succeed him.
"I think it's going to be another Democratic president," Justice Ginsburg told The Washington Post in 2013. "The Democrats do fine in presidential elections; their problem is they can't get out the vote in the midterm elections."
President Trump, whose election proved her wrong, has been critical of Justice Ginsburg, saying in 2016 that "her mind is shot" and suggesting that she resign. His sharp words came after Justice Ginsburg criticized Mr. Trump in a series of interviews. She later said she had made a mistake in publicly commenting on a candidate and promised to be more "circumspect" in the future.
In 1993, she was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3. "Our Senate was working the way it should and the way I hope it will again in my lifetime," Justice Ginsburg said on Wednesday.
Mrs. Clinton said one thing had surprised her in the intervening years. "I always knew Justice Ginsburg would be a great Supreme Court justice," she said. "I did not know she would be a really popular cultural icon."
Mrs. Clinton said she had given her husband "The R.B.G. Workout," a book on the justice's exercise routine.
Both Clintons said they had completed the workout, but at a cost. "It was a problem," Mr. Clinton said. "It was a real struggle."

Apple Forecast Is Upbeat as Profit Falls

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple said on Wednesday that its profit shrank for the fourth consecutive quarter -- the longest such streak since 2016 -- but it forecast that better days were ahead.
The tech giant said its profit fell 3.1 percent to $ 13.69 billion in the latest quarter, from $ 14.13 billion a year ago, largely because of continued declines in iPhone sales. Yet the results beat analysts' expectations and were quickly cheered by investors because of indications that its new iPhone models would be a hit.
Apple reported a 9 percent fall in iPhone sales in the quarter, smaller than the declines in other recent quarters. More important, the company said it expected strong sales in the current holiday quarter -- news that seemed to confirm Wall Street expectations that people like the iPhones introduced last month.
Apple also showed signs of recovery in China, a crucial market where the company had struggled for months. After a drop in sales of roughly 20 percent in the region over the previous nine months, Apple said sales there were down 2.4 percent in the last quarter.
The results suggested that the issues causing Apple's business to shrink in China and elsewhere in recent months had been resolved -- or at least temporarily patched.
Apple had blamed some of its struggles in China on the country's slowing economy and its trade war with the United States. Luca Maestri, Apple's finance chief, said in an interview on Wednesday that those issues were subsiding.
"These trade tensions have not been helpful to the Chinese economy and to our business, and we think that as you've seen from our results, the peak of those tensions were at the beginning of the year," he said.
Apple got off to a rocky start this year when it cut revenue forecasts because of slow sales in China, prompting a sharp sell-off of its stock. Since then, Apple's financials have improved and its market value has rebounded. Apple shares rose about 2 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.
"The company is still benefiting from low expectations, from when they set the bar really low" in January, said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. "And since then, they've been telling a different story, which is that they're pivoting to be less dependent on the iPhone."
Apple became a $ 1 trillion company on the back of the iPhone, one of history's most successful products. But as the smartphone market became saturated, Apple increased iPhone prices to keep growing.
The strategy worked for a time. But as prices went up, sales of new phones slowed, particularly in markets like China. In recent months, Apple has propped up iPhone sales in places like China with price cuts and financing.
Apple's latest iPhones -- the iPhone 11 family -- seem to be bucking the trend. The latest quarter represents just nine days of sales of the iPhone 11, but the drop in iPhone sales were lower than in the previous three quarters. "It's obviously a bit early," Mr. Maestri said. "But the initial signs are very positive."
Apple's overall revenue increased 1.8 percent to $ 64 billion in the quarter ending in September. Apple predicted $ 85.5 billion to $ 89.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, compared with $ 84.3 billion a year prior.
Many analysts had increased their estimates for iPhone sales in recent weeks after certain signs, including reports from factories in China, suggested that demand for the new phones was strong. Analysts attributed some of that success to Apple's decisions with the latest phones, including dropping the price of its flagship phone while adding an additional camera lens to its higher-end models.
Apple has made up for the declines in iPhone sales with growth in other areas, such as wearable devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as its business of selling apps and other services like music and news.
Wearables revenue grew by 54 percent to $ 6.5 billion and services revenue increased by 18 percent to $ 12.5 billion in the quarter. Apple is trying to bolster that business with a gaming service introduced last month and a streaming service set to start on Friday.

Never Forget: A Look at the Legacy and Work of Congressman John Conyers, Jr. a Political Legend

Texto completo: When the legendary actor, playwright, and producer Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy for Malcolm X on a cold February day 54 years ago, he spoke movingly of Malcolm's commitment to the uplift of the race.
Davis lauded the Black Muslim leader's uncompromising demand that black men and women; "Afro-Americans" as he demanded to be called, be respected and treated fairly and with dignity on our terms, not anyone else's.
"Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood! This was his meaning to his people. And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves," Davis exclaimed.
Now, nearly six decades later, another legendary African American leader, Detroiter, and contemporary of Malcolm X has departed. And like Malcolm, the late Congressman John Conyers Jr., was uncompromising in his blackness and demand for fairness, equity, and respect within the political process.
And by recognizing his importance to the advancement of people of color in the United States and all over the world; including South Africa where he played a critically important role in dismantling apartheid and freeing the late South African freedom fighter, Nobel-Prize winner and President, Nelson Mandela, we also honor ourselves.
The fact is, other than former President Barack Obama, John Conyers Jr. was arguably the most influential African American politician of the late 20thcentury. Having won office in 1964, he was the longest-serving African American congress-person in the history of the United States and was consistently among the most progressive politicians in Washington, D.C.
According to The New York Times:
Worked with Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Howard H. Baker in the 1960s and defeated legislation to undo Supreme Court decisions requiring congressional districts in any state to have roughly equal populations.
In 1968 days after the the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. began a long and ultimately successful effort to make Dr. King's birthday a national holiday, which was declared in 1983.
In 1970 began a long campaign for a government-run, single-payer system of national health insurance and he proposed banning private ownership of handguns after assassination attempts against President Gerald R. Ford.
In the 1980s Mr. Conyers opposed the Reagan administration's missile defense plans and its policy of "constructive engagement" with the apartheid regime in South Africa. He criticized the death penalty and began a series of hearings on police the brutality that angered New York's mayors, Ed Koch in 1983 and Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1997. But he also worked to create and enlarge federal death benefits for police officers and firefighters who died in the line of duty.
The newspaper also noted that throughout his 53 years in Congress, Conyers had more than a 90 percent lifetime rating from the liberal watchdog group American for Democratic Action.
Distilled to its essence, that simply meant Conyers remained consistent in his strong support for social, economic and racial justice, regardless of who was president. Unlike many of his fellow Democrats, he never felt the need tone down such basic demands for equality even as many white Americans grew weary of African American demands for equal rights and justice.
Indeed, right in his backyard, in Macomb County, an the entire population of white voters came to symbolize white voter backlash and resentment to the gains of African Americans during the height of the civil rights movement. They began demanding white politicians oppose such fundamental rights as integration, Black voting rights, affirmative action, criminal justice reform, and even labor rights although though many of these same voters were working-class and union members themselves.
By 1972 enough white voters in the Michigan Democratic Primary in Michigan voted for arch-segregationist and racist George Wallace that he won the primary. Eight years later they voted for Republican Ronald Reagan - whose views on race were only marginally more moderate - and who deliberately opened his 1980 presidential campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi calling for "state's rights" where three civil rights worker were murdered in cold blood for registering
Black Americans to vote.
These people came to be known as Reagan Democrats and were slavishly catered to by Republicans and many Democrats, often at the expense of their most loyal voters, African Americans. They were so influential, that many of the hardest fought civil rights victories became imperiled as these white voters mobilized to vote for far-right politicians on a state and federal level and who subsequently have viciously gone after minority voting rights, affirmative action in education and the workforce, and even efforts at equal access to healthcare.
Thus, to understand John Conyers Jr. is to understand that he came into Congress fighting for the most basic rights of African Americans in Detroit, Michigan, and the entire country. And for years was one of only a small handful of Black congresspeople battling racism on all fronts. He even co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus to help those few Black congresspeople to leverage their power.
As the racial backlash to Black progress metastasized and spread throughout Congress and the federal courts, Conyers remained committed to the cause of social and racial justice; even as he grew elderly, would become harassed by allegations of personal improprieties and eventually feel betrayed by many of those he thought were allies.
"John Conyers was much bigger, much larger than the CBC that he founded which subsequently has fallen into political disrepair, said Sam Riddle a close family friend and consultant to the congressman. "For decades he was not just the Black congressman for Detroit, he was forced to be the congressman for Black America because we only had a handful of black congresspeople any-where."
He ended leaving Congress in 2017 under a cloud following several accusations of his sexually harassing female subordinates. Conyers adamantly rejected such allegations but lost the confidence of the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives.
Riddle, who is also the host of the popular Detroit radio talk show Riddle at Random on 910 am said during his tenure, Conyers was able to get more things done with a simple phone call than most politicians today with all their social media platforms and press people.
"John Conyers believed in the law of the land while understanding the importance of civil disobedience," Riddle said. "He introduced Jesse Jackson to Dr. Martin Luther King. We have to look at his serving for over a half a century and as a Korean War vet. You can't just dismiss that over spurious allegations."
Regardless of where you come down on Conyers personal behavior, one thing can never be denied, John Conyers Jr., for all of his career carried the torch of justice for Black folks in the United States and all over the world. He never gave up on the struggle even in the face of white backlash and personal turmoil.
If the meaning of Malcolm X was to recognize that he represented our manhood to the nation. Then John Conyers Jr. represented our citizenship to this nation. And he fought every single day of his life, to ensure it was valued by this nation.

Texto completo: Our fancy new internet-based home or office phones are the communication tool of the future cheap, efficient and versatile.
They're also, in a power outage, about as useful as a brick.
All over the Bay Area, residents who rely on these digital landline phones are feeling angry and betrayed during PG&E's shutdown, unable to get even a simple dial tone.
Those with old analog phones on quaint copper lines are, in general, doing just fine.
But the growing number of consumers with new digital Voice over IP (VOIP) systems, which use the internet to make calls, are finding them maddeningly unreliable.
No power means no internet. And no phone. Ironically, the only way to fix your high-tech phone is to buy a low-tech backup power source, like a battery or generator.
With no working landline, internet or cell service, Charlotte Gibb of Lafayette drove to a high hill Sunday night to get a cell signal and watch a frightening blaze that had erupted on nearby Acalanes Ridge.
"What was terrifying is that no one in our neighborhood would be alerted to evacuate," she said. "All I could do was look for the tell-tale sign of fire a red glow."
In the high-tech Bay Area, the old system dubbed POTS, for "Plain Old Telephone Service" doesn't get much respect.
For consumers, it's expensive.
The phone is a relic, stuck into a jack in the wall and cluttering a room. Sure, it gets great reception. But it rarely rings, and even when it does, it's usually the dentist, a robocaller or someone wanting to sell you life insurance.
VOIP, in contrast, is cheap. Plans are flexible, so you can customize and change them over time. It's easy to add new features. The phone service offers video calls and other features.
The VOIP-based phones are supported by fiber networks that use light instead of electricity. This allows for much faster data transmission, broader bandwidth, quicker access to cloud-based services and better support of streaming video.
The traditional landline system is especially unpopular with the telecom industry, because its aging infrastructure is bothersome to keep up. The industry dreams of the day when it is abandoned, and the companies can invest instead in technologies like 5G and fiber optic cables.
The telecom industry also prefers VOIP for financial reasons. It isn't regulated like traditional phones, so there's no obligation to guarantee universal access and fair prices to consumers, according to the nonprofits Electronic Frontier Foundation and The Utility Reform Network.
AT&T, Verizon and other companies are pushing consumers hard to get them to shift away from landline service. In 2012, after Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the copper infrastructure in western Fire Island, New York, Verizon didn't want to fix the phone lines. Instead, it proposed replacing them with Voice Link, a substitute that connects to the cellular network, according to The New York Times. In Pennsylvania, Verizon was fined for refusing to repair an elderly couple's copper phone lines.
To persuade consumers to switch, the telecom industry often offers "Triple Play" packages of services, like television with internet and phone, and other incentives.
"They should have to make a point of informing you of this when they talk you into changing," said Candy Promes, who switched to a VOIP phone, then was frustrated when she lost service.
But in emergencies, the traditional system is a robust and fairly bulletproof way to deliver phone calls. No bells, no whistles. They just work.
That's because the lines carry their own power. This power low voltage, posing no risk comes from the company's central office. And that's backed up by a generator.
"When power goes out, those generators are powered by diesel. And there is enough fuel to last several days," said Regina Costa, telecom policy director of TURN. "And they're in locations where it's easy to refill."
Old-fashioned landlines go down only when they're served by a longer line in a rural area that depends on the phone company's remote "terminal." That terminal is supposed to have backup power, but many don't.
That's what is happening in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where customers of Frontier Communications are without service.
"When commercial power is shut off, the remote terminals remain in service until batteries are depleted," said Javier Mendoza of Frontier. "When utility power is restored, disrupted Frontier services should also restore soon after."
In contrast, VOIP phone services that are delivered using internet technology over fiber optic lines require commercial power to operate. You need to plug in your modem, router or other hardware for it to work.
There's nothing wrong with the VOIP system, said Ernesto Falcon, senior legislative counsel with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
"The transition is happening," he said. "That's just where the technology is going."
The problem, said Falcon and Costa, is that phone companies aren't required to provide batteries or other backup. This is confusing to consumers; different phones have different batteries, costing from $20 to $35, plus shipping. Batteries age, and fail. Where should these batteries live? In the garage? Near the phone jack? No one knows.
"It is a very dicey situation," Costa said.
On Jan. 1, an old law will expire and the California Public Utilities Commission has the opportunity to mandate power backup,Falcon said.
"It is a matter of public safety," he said. "The old copper phone line has had a long history of these protections. We need the same for the new technologies."

Texto completo: BY MATT O'BRIEN
The Associated Press
BOSTON - Concert promoters in the U.S. are stepping back from plans to scan festivalgoers with facial recognition technology, after musicians and others gave it some serious side-eye.
Although it remains entirely possible that music venues will eventually take a second look at the controversial technology.
Live-entertainment giants AEG Presents and Live Nation both recently disavowed any plans to use facial recognition at music festivals, despite earlier indications to the contrary. Their public pronouncements have led a group of musicians to declare victory after a months-long campaign to halt the technology's use at live shows.
Advances in computer vision have enabled businesses to install cameras that can recognize individuals by their face or other biometric characteristics. Venue operators have talked about using the technology at gateways to secure entry for select groups or to offer perks for repeat customers.
Privacy advocates worry that such uses might also pave the way for greater intrusions, such as scanning audience members to analyze their behavior.
Both concert organizations seemed to be edging toward remembering more faces. AEG, which operates the Coachella festival in southern California and other major events, updated its online privacy policy earlier this year with language stating that it may collect facial images at its events and venues for "access control," creating aggregate data or for "personalization."
Now, however, both organizations have done an about-face. AEG's chief operating officer for festivals, Melissa Ormond, emailed activists earlier this month to say: "AEG festivals do not use facial recognition technology and do not have plans to implement." AEG confirmed that statement this week but declined further comment.
Live Nation said in a statement that "we do not currently have plans to deploy facial recognition technology at our clients' venues." The company insisted that any future use would be "strictly opt-in," so that non-consenting fans won't have to worry about potentially facing the music.
Facial recognition isn't seen in many musical venues. The biggest location known to employ it is New York City's Madison Square Garden, which confirmed this week that facial recognition is one of the security measures it uses "to ensure the safety of everyone" in the arena. It declined to say what it looks at and why. The New York Times first reported its use last year.
While the music industry paused, Major League Baseball stole a base by rolling out biometric ticketing in the U.S., usually involving fingerprints or iris scans to get into ballparks. Authorities in some parts of Europe have bounced around the idea of using either facial or voice recognition to keep tabs on unruly soccer fans, such as those participating in racist chants. Police agencies in China have used facial recognition at concerts featuring pop singer Jacky Cheung to identify and arrest people wanted as criminal suspects.
American music event promoters this fall have been pressured to disclose their facial recognition plans by digital rights group Fight for the Future, which asked dozens of festival organizers to pledge not to use a technology it describes as invasive and racially biased.
Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello co-authored an opinion column in BuzzFeed last week that described the pledge as the "first major blow to the spread of commercial facial recognition in the United States."
The CEO of Blink Identity says opposition to its Ticketmaster partnership is misguided.
"They're talking about mass surveillance," said Mary Haskett, who co-founded the Austin, Texas startup. "We're against mass surveillance.... Nobody's talking about doing what they're protesting against."
Haskett said Blink's system allows concertgoers to opt in by taking selfies with their phones, which the company transforms into mathematical representations and deletes. The system might offer access to a shorter line or a VIP section.
But protesting musicians fear their fans' mugshots could still end up in the hands of law enforcement or immigration authorities.
"Of course it's going to be used by security," said Joey La Neve DeFrancesco, a guitarist for Rhode Island punk band Downtown Boys, which played Coachella in 2017. "Of course it's going to be used by law enforcement."
Punk rockers aren't the only ones fixing the technology with a death stare. A June survey by the Pew Research Center found that while people are generally accepting of facial recognition used by police, only 36% said they trust tech companies to deploy it responsibly. Just 18% trust advertisers.

Texto completo: For childhood trauma, we need much more than the resilience advised by the keynote speaker at the recent Behavioral Health Community Forum. Though she pointed out that causes of trauma included racism and poverty, she left out other important factors. When a mother gets riled up because she is about to be evicted again, do we just give her a tranquilizer? When a child whose parents are stressed by continually shifting schedules throws tantrums at school, do we just get him some counseling?
Lets not lose sight of the systemic problems. How about encouraging local employers to stop unpredictable scheduling and have social service agencies devote more time and money to making sure families have a stable place to live? As the Shift Project found, hourly workers described going hungry, not being able to pay bills, scrambling to arrange child care, losing housing, losing sleep and feeling stressed and unhealthy. Unpredictable schedules were a major predictor of hardships. Parental stress affects the children who are much more likely to exhibit anxiety, guilt or sadness than children of parents with stable schedules. Such children are prone to destroy things and have tantrums (New York Times, Oct. 16).
Lets help those who have experienced adverse childhood events by all means! But lets not see this as just a question of improving the family dynamics, but also as a systemic societal issue that has public policy dimensions we might address. We need to find ways to reduce the stressors, not just helped the stressed!

Texto completo: Two interesting things have been happening in the world of film over the last month. A relatively low-budget, no-special effects movie that places Batman's Joker in a version of Martin Scorsese's decaying 1970s-era New York City has become one of the most successful American movies of the year . And everyone on the internet is yelling at, about, or in defense of Scorsese himself, because the aging director told an interviewer that superhero movies aren't real cinema.
We often talk about unexpected political controversies in terms of their relationship to an established order, an existing regime.The success of "Joker" and the outrage around Scorsese are both disturbances that matter because of their relationship to thecurrent pop-cultural regime.
That order is built on the commercial exploitation of what was once called "genre" entertainment - the comic-book movie especially, the Marvel empire above all, with a wider range of science fiction and fantasy blockbusters .
Strikingly, this regime is a marvel of corporate capitalism, a machine for global moneymakingthat is also intensely defended by people who think of themselves as rebels, outsiders, weirdos, freaks. The Western in its Ford-Wayne heyday knew itself to be mainstream and middlebrow, but even in its gazillion-dollar apotheosis the world of "genre" still maintains a fan base that imagines itself eccentric and disrespected and oppressed.
This nurtured sense of grievance explains the online anger every time somebody like Scorsese dares to doubt the aesthetic merits of the new regime. And it may be a strength of the superhero order, a source of resilience, that so many of its fans continue to answer Andrew O'Hehir's 2012 question, "at what point is the triumph of comic-book culture sufficient?", with a zealot's absolutism: Not until the last film snob shuts up; not until Scorsese breaks down and makes a Batman sequel.
But maybe that zeal hides an uneasy conscience, a buried knowledge that while "genre" cinema can be as great as any other formits complete commercial takeover has been obviously bad for popular culture and pop art.
The superhero regime has wasted far too much talent on stories that are fundamentally unworthy of the actors and directors making them. It has empowered and interacted with corporate consolidation. And it has habituated adult audiences to stories that belong - with, yes, exceptions - to the state of arrested development in which far more of Western culture than just Hollywood is trapped.
I say "arrested development" because a common critique of these movies is that they are childish . But that seems not quite apt: Children and their stories are much stranger and more interesting than the superhero industry, which sells a mix of grandiosity, moral certainty and performance anxietythat belongs essentially to early adolescence.
And this is where the success of the Joaquin Phoenix "Joker" becomes especially interesting. My initial take on the movie was hostile, because I don't think "Joker" is really about any of the thingsthat its admirers and enemies have read into its story. Instead it's a competent Scorsese simulacrum whose success exposes both the frustrated desire for movies that are more politically and morally adult  and the tragedy of a movie system that can only simulate grown-up art inside the comic-book machine.
But a more sympathetic reading might say that the character of Arthur Fleck, the Joker-to-be in the movie, is a kind of Dorian Gray's picture for the entire comic-book universe: A damaged man-child with pre-sexual romantic attachments and fantasies of secret lineages and untapped greatness, whose destructive arc is far closer to what perpetual adolescence really looks like than the sexless godhood of the Marvel heroes or the eternal school days of Hogwarts.
In which case its audiences aren't just getting an imitation of the better movies that the age of genre has displaced. They're experiencing a work that is genuinely subversive - maybe not of progressivism or neoliberalism, but at least of the all-conquering, imagination-shrinking cultural juggernaut to which "Joker" ostensibly belongs.
Ross Douthat writes for the New York Times. His syndicated column appears on Wednesdays.

One could be forgiven for concluding that the widespread national security panic following President Donald Trump’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from northeastern Syria was overstated.
As that withdrawal was happening, we now know, U.S. special forces were homing in on the location of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State’s leader and founder, in al-Qaida controlled territory near the Turkish border. Trump himself said the intelligence that led to his capture came together in those fateful weeks as Kurds and Turks briefly fought and dozens of Islamic State prisoners escaped.
What’s more remarkable is that as the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces concluded that they were being betrayed by Trump, they nonetheless continued to track al-Baghdadi and work closely with their U.S. counterparts in the operation that killed him.
Kurdish spies began to focus on al-Baghdadi’s location last spring, after the last Islamic State stronghold in Syria fell. “We began to investigate the presence of Baghdadi, where he was located, in March,” said Ilham Ahmed, the president of the Syrian Democratic Council, in an interview Sunday.
“Our intelligence units were always following his movements. They were in a high-level coordination with American intelligence.”
Ahmed said the chaos of the initial Turkish invasion did not stop Kurdish spies in the anti-terrorism unit of the Syrian Democratic Forces from continuing to gather and analyze information gleaned about Baghdadi’s location. The New York Times reported that the initial tip about al-Baghdadi’s location came in the summer, following the arrest of one of his couriers and one of his wives.
Ahmed is now in Washington to make the case for repairing a partnership that frayed dramatically after the Turkish army invaded that region earlier this month. Despite Trump’s public comments that he sees no reason why U.S. forces should stand between Kurdish fighters and the Turkish army, Ahmed said she hopes Trump will use America’s vast political and economic leverage to deter Turkey from trying to resettle the 3 million Syrian Arab refugees in historically Kurdish areas.
For now, she said, the Syrian Kurds have received guarantees from Russia to protect some 2 million Kurdish civilians in the area from the Turkish army and allied Islamist militias. She finds this Russian assurance cold comfort. The Kurds would prefer U.S. protection, she said, but “this is our only option.”
Part of the new arrangement for Syria’s Kurds means they will have to rely on Syrian regime forces to provide protection. This is particularly dangerous in light of recent Syrian history. Syrian leader Bashar Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad, launched campaigns to cleanse Syria of Kurds.
And while there has been a pause in the Turkish-Kurdish war in the last week, Ahmed is still deeply worried about the long-term prospects of the Kurdish people. She still wants the U.S. to play a role in the Syrian peace process, she said, and to defend Kurdish autonomy within Syria. “America promised us support for negotiations with the Syrian government,” she said. “They should keep that promise.”
The Syrian Kurds have kept their promise. They have continued to assist the U.S. war against Islamic State, even as they had to seek protection from Russia. The least the U.S. can do now is to use its remaining leverage to deter Turkey — and to advocate for an autonomous Kurdish region in Syria.

Texto completo: Fewer people might have died in a 2017 fire in a London high-rise if they had not been told to stay put, a government analysis concluded.
LONDON -- Some of the 72 people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 would have survived if firefighters and emergency operators had not told them to stay in their apartments, according to a government report to be released on Wednesday.
The 1,000-page report, which comes more than two years after the deadliest fire in recent British history, is harshly critical of the London Fire Brigade, calling it dangerously unprepared for such a tragedy, according to multiple British news organizations that gained access to the conclusions before their release.
The fire on June 14, 2017, began on the fourth floor of the 24-story building and spread rapidly upward because of flammable exterior cladding and insulation that had been added to the building the year before.
Those outer layers would not have been allowed on a high-rise in many countries, including the United States, because of the fire danger they posed.
The report is to be released to the public on Wednesday. The work of an official inquiry led by Martin Moore-Bick, a former appellate court judge, it does not go in depth into the tower's renovation and the materials used in it.
The next phase of the investigation is expected to do so, but firefighters and survivors of the blaze have criticized the investigation for not tackling those questions first. They contend that the unacceptable level of danger built into the tower outweighed any mistakes made on the night of the fire.
In recordings made that night, firefighters arriving at the scene expressed horror at how fast the flames were spreading, and bewilderment at how it was possible.
Matt Wrack, the chief of Britain's main firefighters' union, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that "firefighters did not put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower," but risked their lives in it. He accused the government of doing "nothing substantive" since then.
Britain had lax construction standards compared with many other countries -- a decision approved by successive governments to let builders save money. Tests conducted to determine whether materials met fire safety rules were also lax, allowing products that had undergone limited testing in laboratories -- but then failed under real-world conditions.
In 2005, Britain stopped requiring certifications from government inspectors that a building complied with fire codes, allowing builders and owners to police themselves.
Mr. Moore-Bick found that the fire brigade had no evacuation plan for Grenfell, that it had failed to instruct firefighters on the risk created by the cladding and insulation, and that it was too slow to deploy crews with breathing apparatuses. There were not enough emergency operators to handle all the calls they received.
But the report found that the biggest failing once the inferno began was that for nearly two hours, residents were instructed to stay in their apartments with their doors closed. The first emergency call went out at 12:54 a.m., and it was not until 2:47 a.m. that the decision was made to evacuate.
"That decision could and should have been made between 01:30 and 01:50 and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities," the report states, according to the BBC.
The report was shown in advance to relatives of the dead and people who escaped the fire, but they declined to comment on Tuesday, because they had agreed not to discuss it until its official release.
The tower, built in 1974 in the North Kensington neighborhood, lacked fire alarms, sprinklers or fire escapes, and had just one internal staircase. Residents had complained for years that it was unsafe.
The advice to shelter in place is common in buildings with inner and outer walls made of concrete, which is expected to slow the spread of fire within the structure.
But at Grenfell the fire spread from the outside in, leaping up the sides of the building on the cladding and into apartments through the windows.
The fire brigade has acknowledged some of the mistakes made that night. Andrew Dismore, the chairman of the fire and emergency planning committee of the London Assembly, the elected panel that oversees city governance, has said that "significant progress is being made with new training, equipment and policies."
After the Grenfell tragedy, hundreds of high-rise buildings around Britain -- apartment blocks that are home to thousands of people, college dormitories and hospitals -- were found to have similar cladding and insulation.
The government said it would all be removed and replaced, but more than two years later, many people are still living in buildings sheathed in the same kind of flammable material.
Other buildings are clad in nothing more than bare concrete, because their dangerous exteriors were removed, but owners, residents and government officials continue to fight over who will pay to replace it.

Missett: One of my dearest friends, I've never met in person

Texto completo: I have a friend I’ve never met in person. She is one of my dearest friends, and would immediately fit in with all my friends in Cheyenne. I began corresponding with her four years ago, via email, and something just clicked between us.
She is Sy Montgomery, a New York Times bestselling author. She writes about wild, and not so wild, animals, and travels all over the world to do so. Her bestseller about her pet pig, Christopher Hogwood, who grew to more than 700 pounds, is hilarious and endearing. Reading “The Good, Good Pig” was probably sufficient unto itself, but I was highly motivated to continue reading Sy’s books.
I cannot remember the order in which I read them, but my two favorite books by Sy are “Journey of the Pink Dolphins” and “Spell of the Tiger.”
The pink dolphins live in the mysterious Amazon River, which is actually two rivers that don’t combine; one is brown, and one is blue. There is a high degree of mythology that the people who live beside the river impart to the pink dolphins. It is said they take on the form of a man and join humans along the riverbank, seducing a woman and taking her to live with them under the water. That’s a dizzily marvelous piece of mythology; it would be wonderful to know how it came to be. Do people from the villages actually disappear?
At the end of this book, Sy actually got to swim with the dolphins at the mouth of the Amazon River. I told her that the book should have ended with her permanently swimming with them, and she said that if the book is ever made into a movie that is the way she imagines ending it, too!
“Spell of the Tiger” is terrifying – and funny, too. The subtitle is “The Man-Eaters of Sundarbans.” Sundarbans is the largest tidal delta in the world. From Wikipedia, I learned the following:
The Sundarbans is a mangrove area in the delta formed by the confluence of Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers in the Bay of Bengal. It spans from the Hooghly River in India’s state of West Bengal to the Baleswar River in Bangladesh. It comprises closed and open mangrove forests, agriculturally used land, mudflats and barren land, and is intersected by multiple tidal streams and channels.
It is here that tigers hunt and kill people, not just on land, but in the water, as well.
I said that the book is funny, too. It is undoubtedly a conundrum that a book about man-eating tigers could be funny, but the red tape Sy encountered in getting access to the Sundarbans reminded me of Major Major in the book and movie “Catch-22.” The “catch” was that if someone went to Major Major’s office, and Major Major was in his office, the person wanting to see him was told that the Major was out. If Major was out of his office, the person was told he was in.
And that’s what the bureaucracy in Calcutta was like for Sy and her companion. After waiting for hours to meet someone in the Forestry Department, they were finally “seen” by someone who totally ignored them and read a newspaper instead.
It struck me as funny, and I felt guilty for laughing about a passage in a book about man-eating tigers. Sy assured me it was meant to be funny, and that she was glad I “got” it.
But I didn’t really get the gist of the book until weeks later. It was one of those “aha” moments! I recently gave a copy of this book to a friend to see if he would also find the hidden message of this book. It’s not a spoiler for you to know it ahead of time, but it is a magnificent reward to find it yourself. If you really want to know what it is before you read the book, email me, and I’ll tell you the message.
It took me years to find this soulmate of mine, but we traveled along similar paths, although mine was through books and hers was through doing. Years before I met Sy through her books, we both developed a love for octopuses. I bought a paperback book about these gentle, intelligent creatures, only to find out that Sy had written a blurb for its hardback edition and knew the author. I bought another book about Kanzi, the bonobo chimp who taught himself how to verbally interact with people using symbols, and told Sy about it; she replied that she knew all about Kanzi.
She is friendly and witty and funny. I also have a preoccupation with spiders (I had a cat-faced spider living above my back door all last summer), and I jokingly said to Sy, “What are the odds? Spiders and octopuses?” She replied, “I’d say about 8 to 1!”
I have tried and failed to meet with her, but I may have another opportunity in June when I travel with a friend who is attending a college reunion. The reunion is in Middlebury, Vermont, and Sy lives in Hancock, New Hampshire, a distance of less than 150 miles.
Even if all I get to do is hug her while crying tears of joy to be finally meeting her in person, the extra miles will be worth it.

There's a piece of Delaware in New Jersey

Texto completo: The Delaware River is the official border between the First State and New Jersey, right?
Yes and no.
Unbeknownst to many residents, the two states actually share two land borders, one of which is nearly 2 miles long.
Not only does Delaware own a small chunk of Artificial Island, where the Hope Creek Nuclear Power Plant is, but there's a weird swath of land just outside Pennsville, New Jersey, that belongs to the Diamond State.
The entire thing is only about 580 acres, but it and rights to the nearby Delaware River have been the subject of not one, but three U.S. Supreme Court cases, the most recent of which concluded in 2008.
Local residents call it "The Point" or "The Baja."
"It's weird, and it has been weird for a long time," Pennsville Mayor Robert McDade said of property's existence. "Most people wouldn't even know that it's out there."
So why is the tiny piece of land such a big deal? And why does it exist in the first place?
The answers to both questions are surprisingly complex.
How was the border established? The answer to the second question, which we'll tackle first, lies with Delaware's northern border, which is curved instead of a straight line.
Its existence dates from a deed to William Penn from the Duke of York on Aug. 24, 1682, which granted Penn all the land west of the Delaware River within a 12-mile compass circle beginning at the courthouse in New Castle.
Unlike other territorial boundaries, however, where rivers are essentially split in half between two states, the deed gave Penn rights to the entire waterway up to the low-tide mark on the east side.
Originally, that also gave Delaware ownership of a marshy wetland just outside Pennsville, which was designated a federally protected bird habitat in the 1930s.
It was called Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge.
But then, in the first part of the 20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the river and depositing silt at Killcohoook, eventually turning it into solid land.
Tim Boyle, a spokesman for the Corps, said the process took several decades.
Dredging helps keep the river deep enough for shipping traffic, and during and after World War II preserving nature took second priority to finding an easy place to dump silt and mud, according to The News Journal's archives.
The wetland was transformed into fields of tall plume grass and dusty hills, and Killcohook's status as a refuge was revoked in 1998. Conservationists cried foul and raised concerns about chemicals and pollution from the mounded dredge spoils.
Thousands of geese, mallards, ducks, teal and pheasants were replaced by empty beer bottles and junked cars. On a recent Thursday, the only sound one could hear at The Baja was that of the wind racing through invasive phragmites, a species of reed that crowds out native vegetation.
The New York Times, which wrote about the dredge-spoil dumping in 1985, said the failed wildlife area was perhaps one of New Jersey's "ugliest ecological secrets."
Ownership and management of Killcohook was "a real ball of wax," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the newspaper.
The land is part of Delaware, is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been managed as hunting grounds by wildlife agencies in both New Jersey and Delaware.
"It was a bastard within the national wildlife system," an official later told The News Journal in 1998. "It really has been kicked back and forth between its parents."
Today, Boyle said the land isn't used for anything specific. McDade, Pennsville's mayor, said dredge spoils are still routinely dumped there.
The Army Corps of Engineers has since become more environmentally conscious and uses dredge spoils to create or restore wildlife habitats, replenish beaches and more, according to its website.
What were the court cases about? New Jersey has long argued that the small strip of land created by dredging shouldn't be Delaware's in the first place.
There have been three Supreme Court cases between the two states over its ownership and rights to the Delaware River.
The first was resolved in 1905 with a compact between the two states that addressed fishing rights but didn't define the border. The second lawsuit, in 1934, concluded that Deleware owned "the river and the subaqueous soil" up to the low tide mark.
A third case in 2007 was sparked by a liquid natural gas plant. In 2005, a fight erupted between the two states over British Petroleum's then-proposal to build a $500 million LNG import facility just across the river from Claymont.
Under the plan, New Jersey would have built a delivery pier that jutted into Delaware's territorial waters. While New Jersey saw jobs and economic development, Delawareans feared potential explosions of the condensed fuel.
In 2006, Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington, co-sponsored a bill, likely in jest, that would have authorized then-Gov. Ruth Ann Miner to send the Delaware National Guard across the river to physically block construction of the port's bulkheads and piers.
New Jersey jokingly threatened to bring the Battleship New Jersey down.
By 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Delaware's laws could, in fact, prevent the plan from progressing.
No man's land While Delaware hasn't ceded the small strip of land outside Pennsville to New Jersey, it has relied on the other state to help maintain order there.
It's a bit of a no man's land, referred to by some local residents as "The Baja," Pennsville police Chief Allen J. Cummings said. He's not sure what inspired the nickname but said it's been referred to as that since he was a kid.
In the past, New Jersey police had no jurisdiction over the property, which means people would go there to commit crimes, according to a 1990 Baltimore Sun story.
Teens could do drugs and drink there without fear of arrest.
Then, in 1987, Pennsville police found the body of a 45-year-old hunter who had been shot in the head.
The department had to call Delaware coroner's office to pick up the body because no one in New Jersey was authorized to do it. The man was only 10 feet over the state line, authorities said.
The death, which was eventually ruled a suicide, highlighted jurisdictional issues over the land. Eventually, the two states agreed that the Pennsville Police Department could enforce laws on the property.
That doesn't mean Cummings and his officers patrol The Baja, the police chief said. They only go out there if they get a call about something.
"We've had a few fatalities up there, kids on four-wheelers or motorcycles or dirtbikes," Cummings said.
The mayor said for a time, after word got out that the land was a good place for off-roading, people were coming from nearby states like Pennsylvania with big trailers full of ATVs.
Accesses to the property are blocked off by iron gates, but they can be circumvented by small recreational vehicles, Cummings said. There are fewer off-road vehicles now, thanks to enforcement efforts, but teens likely still use the area to party.
Even so, it's better than it used to be when he was in high school. He said the department hadn't gotten any calls from the area in a couple of years, though if you walk along the shoreline there are signs of recent bonfires and drinking.
"We don't have to drive up there and check it every night," Cummings said. "It's not like that anymore."
The department also gets calls about human remains found in The Baja. Sometimes, when someone takes their own life by jumping off the Delaware Memorial Bridge, they will wash up on its shores.
Years ago when Cummings was a detective, a child even found a human skull on the beach, which he brought into the police department in a milk crate.
Near the site it was found, police found a pair of pants with a set of car keys in the pocket, which were matched to a vehicle found abandoned near the bridge.
When there are fatalities or human remains are found in the water or the land belonging to Delaware, Pennsville officers call the Delaware State Police Department, which recovers the bodies and heads up any subsequent investigations.
"It's an interesting place," Cummings said. "There's a lot of history there."

Texto completo: Misinformation, spin and false claims have been part of politics since America's founding.
To secure the 1800 presidential election, Thomas Jefferson infamously hired a hatchet man named James Callender to spread false rumors about John Adams wanting a war with France. The American approach to political speech has always been to promote more speech to counter such attacks, with the media tasked as the institution responsible for informing the public of the truth. But some appear ready to try a new approach.
As Facebook has been updating its policies regarding ads, it's met with backlash focused on its refusal to ban political ads with false content. Some in the media, and many Democrats, are demanding that Facebook police the content of political ads on their platform. Facebook responded with proposals of its own - including a planned policy of labeling false posts as such and providing users with links to other sources - but that wasn't enough for its critics. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren accused the company of "taking money to promote lies."
News organizations have framed the story as one in which Facebook is allowing politicians to lie to voters on its platform. That narrative relies on the dubious presumption that the platform should be tasked with determining the veracity of political speech, and that has never been the way we have treated political ads.
In fact, some of the people complaining about Facebook's treatment of political ads work for networks such as ABC, NBC and CBS, which often run political ads that can be considered false or misleading. Of course, they don't really have a choice: The FCC has interpreted the Federal Communications Act to mean that stations cannot generally reject political ads because they believe them to be false.
So why the outrage over Facebook's applying the same standards that those television networks do?
First, right-leaning news sources have been very successful at spreading their message on Facebook. Outlets such as Fox News and the Daily Wire regularly place among the most shared news outlets on Facebook.
Second, many Democrats (and their allies in the media) view the Facebook kerfuffle as an opportunity to outsource censorship of their political opponents to a private company. That became rather obvious during the testimony of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a congressional hearing this week. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., used her time to badger him, insisting that Facebook was choosing to allow politicians to use their platform to spread falsehoods. She also demanded to know what Mr. Zuckerberg said to allegedly "far-right figures" at private dinners, using her platform as a member of Congress to shame him for associating with people she disagrees with politically.
Some of the people whom the congresswoman attempted to portray as beyond the pale include mainstream conservative media figures such as Townhall's political editor Guy Benson, former Washington Free Beacon editor Matt Continetti and CNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham.
The exchange was telling. The real source for the pushback against Mr. Zuckerberg on the left is the desire to force online platforms such Facebook to censor their political opponents.
It is worth noting that those attempting to cajole Facebook to censor political speech do not want these same standards applied to themselves. After all, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is the same congresswoman who, when confronted with several examples of her false statements, famously asserted that being "morally right" was more important than being "factually accurate." Mainstream-media fact-checkers have noted her falsehoods on numerous occasions. Yet, when it comes to these claims, there's been silence among the members of the media outraged over Facebook's current approach.
In keeping with the American tradition, Facebook is taking the right approach by providing users with more speech instead of trying to police speech it does not believe is accurate. More speech is always the answer to bad speech. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez or her media allies will be hard to convince of that bedrock proposition, because it forces them to debate people they disagree with. One could be forgiven for thinking that all they really want to do is silence their political opponents.

Texto completo: Catch Rob Zombie's unmasking of Michael Myers, and stream an experimental silent film about the history of witchcraft.
What's on TV
HALLOWEEN (2007) 9 p.m. on AMC. In his New York Times review of John Carpenter's 1978 slasher film "Halloween," Jason Zinoman wrote that Michael Myers isn't like other movie monsters: "He never speaks and offers no hint of a motivation for his killing spree. He is not a character so much as an absence of one, an abstraction in the middle of a mundane slice of suburban life." But this take on that film, directed by the heavy metal singer Rob Zombie, upends that idea by exploring Myers's back story and unmasking his motive to kill. It follows his childhood as a socially awkward, bullied boy with a stressful home life, which fuels his rage, leading him to enact his first murderous rampage on Halloween night at just 10 years old. He's then locked away in a mental institution and breaks out 15 years later in an attempt to reconnect with his younger sister, who's now a teenager. In his review for The New York Times, Matt Zoller Seitz wrote that "the case study part of the film re-establishes Mr. Zombie's status as modern American horror's most eccentric and surprising filmmaker."
FRONTLINE: FIRE IN PARADISE 10 p.m. on PBS. Last fall, the deadliest wildfire in California's history tore through the town of Paradise, killing more than 80 people and destroying nearly 19,000 homes. This documentary looks at the aftermath of that blaze through interviews with survivors and emergency medical workers. It also explores the chain of events that caused the fire, which was sparked by power lines.
What's Streaming
HAXAN Stream on the Criterion Channel; Rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. Witchcraft has long been a source of fascination in pop culture, and is even currently enjoying somewhat of a feminist resurgence. But its thorny history serves as the inspiration for this ambitious silent film directed by Benjamin Christensen, which draws from a 15th-century treatise on witchcraft called "Malleus Maleficarum." In the early 1920s Christensen, a Danish director, used innovative lighting and staging techniques to create macabre scenes of grave robbing, torture, possessed nuns and satanic rituals. He even makes a cameo as the Devil. In exploring the origins of witchcraft, Christensen also confronts the ways in which the misunderstanding of mental illness fueled the hysteria of witch hunts, victimizing an overwhelming majority of women often at the hands of powerful men. The film, which was also released under the English title "Witchcraft Through the Ages," faced censorship at the time for its controversial content, but a New York Times critic still found it "fantastically conceived and directed, holding the onlooker in a sort of medieval spell."
ARSENIO HALL: SMART & CLASSY Stream on Netflix. This comedian has starred alongside Eddie Murphy in "Coming to America," hosted his own late-night talk show and even won a season of the "Celebrity Apprentice," but he's never had his own stand-up special until now. Hall will use the stage to examine today's comedy climate, touching on Roseanne Barr, Bill Cosby and his former TV boss, President Trump.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. government said Monday that it is extending protections for more than 200,000 citizens of El Salvador who have been living in the country under temporary protected status, in a boost for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.
U.S. Ambassador Ronald Johnson, appearing in a video with Bukele, said that agreement "extends the (temporary protected status) for Salvadorans who are in the United States for one more year."
Later, Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to contradict the ambassador, saying via Twitter that the actual TPS program for Salvadorans wasn't being extended in legal terms: "That's not what happened."
The effect, however, appeared to be essentially the same: Salvadorans who have been living in the U.S. under the TPS program - safe from deportation and allowed to work legally - will continue to do so for at least a year after courts resolve a challenge to the Trump administration's attempt to end TPS for El Salvador and several other countries.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Salvadorans with TPS will have the validity of their work permits extended through Jan. 4, 2021.
"This is recognition of the achievements and good work of the government of Nayib Bukele," Johnson said.
The DHS statement said there was concern that "the sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border."
Man arrested in Texas shooting that left 2 dead, 12 hurt at party
GREENVILLE, Texas - A man suspected of opening fire at an off-campus college party in Texas, killing two people and injuring 12 others, was arrested Monday.
Brandon Ray Gonzales, 23, of Greenville, was taken into custody less than 48 hours after Saturday's shooting, Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said. Gonzales, who was arrested at the auto dealership where he worked, was booked into the Hunt County jail on a charge of capital murder of multiple persons. Bond was set at $1 million.
The shooting happened around midnight Saturday outside Greenville, 15 miles southwest of a satellite campus of the Texas A&M University System. Authorities believe the shooter may have been targeting one person at the party of about 750 people, and that others may have been shot at random, Meeks has said.
Air Force's mystery space plane lands, ends 2-year mission
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - The Air Force's mystery space plane is back on Earth after a record-breaking two-year mission.
The X-37B landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Sunday. The Air Force is mum about what the plane did in orbit after launching aboard a SpaceX rocket in 2017. The 780-day mission sets an endurance record for the reusable vehicle.
It looks like a space shuttle but is one-fourth the size at 29 feet.
Officials say this latest mission successfully completed its objectives.
This was the fifth spaceflight by a vehicle of this sort. No. 6 is planned next year from Cape Canaveral. According to Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett, "Each successive mission advances our nation's space capabilities."
Pope declares Secret Archive of Vatican not so secret anymore
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has declared that the Vatican Secret Archive isn't so secret after all.
Francis on Monday officially changed the name of the Holy See archive to remove what he said were the "negative" connotations of having "secret" in its name.
From now on, the vast trove of documents, manuscripts and papyrus of popes past will be officially known as the "Vatican Apostolic Archive."
In a new law, Francis noted that the archive has long been open to scholars.
He said the name change better reflects the archive's reality and "its service to the church and the world of culture."
The archive contains the documentation on the life of the universal Catholic Church from the eighth century to the present.
Students join Iraq protests as clashes kill 3
BAGHDAD - Thousands of students joined Iraq's anti-government protests Monday, as clashes with security forces firing tear gas canisters killed at least three demonstrators and wounded more than 100.
The students skipped classes at several universities and secondary schools in Baghdad and across Iraq's majority-Shiite south on Monday to take part in the protests, despite the government ordering schools and universities to operate normally.
One of those killed was a 22-year-old female medical student, the first woman to be killed since the protests began this month.
In a separate development, three rockets struck a large military base north of Baghdad that houses U.S. and Iraqi forces, according to a senior Iraqi security official who said there were no casualties.
NC judges throw out congressional map for 2020
RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina judges on Monday blocked the state's congressional map from being used in the 2020 elections, ruling that voters had a strong likelihood of winning a lawsuit that argued Republicans unlawfully manipulated district lines for partisan gain.
The panel of three Superior Court judges issued a preliminary injunction preventing elections under the district lines, starting with the March 3 primary.
In the ruling Monday, the judges - Paul Ridgeway, Alma Hinton and Joseph Crosswhite - agreed that "there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of this action by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2016 congressional districts are extreme partisan gerrymanders" in violation of the state constitution.
In Silicon Valley: Hundreds of Facebook employees have signed a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives saying they oppose the social network's policy of letting politicians lie in advertisements.
The New York Times reported Monday that more than 250 workers have signed the letter urging Facebook leaders to change the policy that they say is a "threat to what FB stands for." While that's a small fraction of Facebook's workforce of more than 35,000, it's a rare showing of employee dissent.
Facebook spokeswoman Bertie Thomson said the company appreciates its employees voicing concerns but it "remains committed to not censoring political speech."

Shifting Course, Democrats Plan First Floor Vote on Impeachment Inquiry

Texto completo: NEW YORK — The House plans to take its first formal vote Thursday on the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Democratic leaders said Monday, ushering in a new phase as they prepare to go public with their investigation into his dealings on Ukraine.
Democrats described the vote, which will come more than a month after they launched the inquiry, as a necessary next step to lay out the rules for conducting it in public, rather than a response to accusations from Republicans and the White House that the process has violated precedents and denied the president due process rights.
It marks a shift for Democrats, who have resisted for weeks the idea of holding a vote on the impeachment inquiry, arguing that doing so was unnecessary to authorize their work, and privately worrying that doing so could put politically vulnerable Democrats in a difficult position.
But in scheduling the vote, Democrats were effectively challenging Trump and his congressional allies who have called the inquiry an unfair sham of a process but avoided any substantive discussion of the president's conduct. Whether they can pick up the votes of moderate Republicans remains to be seen.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the vote in a letter to colleagues Monday afternoon.
“This resolution establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the president and his counsel," Pelosi said in a statement.
Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat from Massachusetts, chairman of the House Rules Committee, said he would introduce the resolution, which has not yet been finalized, Tuesday. His panel plans to consider it Wednesday, followed by a vote of the full House on Thursday.
The rules will also allow for staff aides of the House Intelligence Committee to question witnesses directly during public hearings, according to an official working on the inquiry who described the measure on condition of anonymity because it had yet to be made public. It was not immediately clear if the two other panels contributing the inquiry, the Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees, would also convene public hearings.
So far, the impeachment inquiry has played out almost entirely behind the closed doors of the Intelligence panel, where Republican and Democratic staff and lawmakers have questioned a string of witnesses. But Democrats leading it had long forecast that they would begin to move some witness testimony and a presentation of facts gathered in private into public view.
“We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives," Pelosi wrote
Republicans signaled they would oppose the measure en masse. Shortly after the vote was announced, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican, said Democrats called the announcement “an admission that this process has been botched from the start," and said Republicans “will not legitimize" it.
Similarly, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that Pelosi "is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew — that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding . . . "
In another shift in strategy, House Democrats will forgo using the federal courts to try to compel testimony from recalcitrant witnesses in their impeachment inquiry, and warned that lawmakers would instead use the lack of cooperation to bolster their case that Trump has abused his office and obstructed Congress's investigation. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, confirmed the plan after Charles M. Kupperman, the former deputy national security adviser and one of Trump's “closest confidential" advisers, defied a House subpoena for testimony that had been scheduled for Monday morning.
The White House on Friday said that Kupperman was absolutely immune from testifying and directed him not to appear in defiance of a subpoena. That prompted the former official to file a lawsuit against Trump and congressional Democrats asking a federal judge whether he could testify, raising the prospect of a drawn-out legal battle over weighty questions about the separation of powers that could effectively stall the impeachment inquiry for months.
“We are not willing to let the White House engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts, so we press ahead," Schiff told reporters outside his secure hearing rooms.
In earlier oversight disputes, House Democrats have turned to the courts with some frequency, but those lawsuits have already eaten up valuable months of time without signs of resolution any time soon. Schiff indicated Democrats now did not have the luxury of waiting, given the gravity of the allegations that Trump abused his power to enlist help from Ukraine in smearing his political opponents.
“If this witness had something to say that would be helpful to the White House, they would want him to come and testify," Schiff said. “They plainly don't."
Schiff acknowledged that the White House would most likely try to invoke similar privilege to try to block other high-level witnesses, including John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser said to be alarmed by Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Doing so would only fuel another article of impeachment charging Trump with obstructing Congress's fact-finding, he said.
The remarks came as impeachment investigators braced for a busy week, which will include testimony from another five or more witnesses.
Around the time Schiff was speaking, the Justice Department said that it would appeal a Federal District Court ruling handed down on Friday that said the House's effort was a legally legitimate impeachment inquiry, and ordered the executive branch to provide secret grand jury evidence to the House Judiciary Committee collected by the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 elections.
The Trump legal team has argued that the impeachment inquiry is illegitimate because the full House has not voted to formally authorize one. The ruling by Chief Judge Beryl Howell undercut a key argument the White House has invoked to justify its orders to executive branch officials to defy congressional subpoenas about the Ukraine affair.
Judge Howell had ordered the department to turn over the grand jury evidence by Wednesday. In notifying the court that it would appeal the order to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the administration asked Judge Howell to suspend that deadline while the higher court weighs the issues.

Texto completo: The House plans to take its first formal vote Thursday on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Democratic leaders said Monday, ushering in a new phase as they prepare to go public with their investigation into his dealings with Ukraine.
Democrats described the vote, in which they plan to “affirm” the inquiry, as a necessary next step to be able to push it forward, rather than a response to sustained criticism from Republicans and the White House, who have accused them of throwing out past impeachment precedents and denying the president due process rights.
But it will be the first time that the full House has gone on record with regard to an inquiry that has been underway since late September. And it comes after Democrats have insisted for weeks that they did not need a formal vote of the full House to authorize the proceedings.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the vote in a letter to colleagues Monday afternoon.
“This resolution establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the president and his counsel,” Pelosi said in a statement.
Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., chairman of the House Rules Committee, said he would introduce the resolution, which has not yet been finalized, Tuesday. His panel plans to consider it Wednesday, followed by a vote of the full House on Thursday.
“We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,” Pelosi wrote.

DUI driver took away my family

Justice was not served when the woman who killed my daughter and her family was sentenced to only 50 years in prison for driving drunk and causing a crash on the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway. She should have been sentenced to life in prison. A life sentence is what my family now has to serve. When that driver drank and then got behind the wheel, she knew it was wrong and that she had the potential to kill someone, in this case our family  my daughter Rita Felipak, her husband, Luiz, and their 8-year-old daughter  our granddaughter  Giorgia.

Time and time again society is told that drinking and driving dont mix, but we are supposed to accept the outcome and call it manslaughter. But, no, we dont accept it. DUI is unacceptable. This driver should be in prison for life, and even that isnt good enough.

We want our family back. Nothing else could ever give us peace, but we will never see our loved ones again. Our daughter, Rita, was our world. She was kind, she was loving, and she was the best mother anyone could ever have. We were so proud to be her parents. And as parents, that is all we can ask for from our kids.

Our granddaughter, Giorgia, was one of a kind. Her love for her grandmother was unlike anything I have ever seen. The two together were a pair to behold.

We will never forget them. They will be in our hearts forever.

Old solutions dont work

Florida should be leading the charge on climate change mitigation. But instead the road builders are developing a plan to make things worse. They are offering a 20th century solution for a 21st century problem: how to provide transport in the era of global warming and sea-level rise. A recent New York Times article says that the Federal Reserve Bank is already worried about decreasing property values in flood-prone areas, suggesting that flood-prone properties have already decreased in value by 15 percent. New roads mean the burning of more fossil fuels and even more carbon dioxide and can only make matters worse. All flood-prone communities should be up in arms about this plan. It will put Florida financially underwater and eventually, physically underwater. Any analysis of the cost/benefit of these roads must include the toll on all of Floridas communities, especially those that worry about flooding.

Heres what ails me

I am fairly new to the Medicare supplemental program, having just signed up for the first time last year. It was absolute torture. I had to compare a plethora of policies with varying coverage and fees while trying to discern (guess) what types of ailments and prescriptions I might need in the coming year. I told my agent at the time that if I could see into the future with any certainty I would be at the blackjack tables in Las Vegas, not sitting at my kitchen table sweating the details. I had no idea that I would have to do it again this year and next year, and the year after that because each plan changes.

Texto completo: The killing of the founder and leader of the Islamic State by United States commandos operating in Syria should certainly further weaken the most vile and deadly Islamist movement to emerge in the Middle East in the modern era.
The world is certainly a better place with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi dead and a measure of justice meted out on behalf of all the women ISIS raped, all the journalists ISIS beheaded and the tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis it abused. Good for President Trump for ordering it, for the intelligence agents who set it up, for the allies who aided in it and for the Special Forces who executed it.
But this story is far from over, and it could have many unexpected implications. Let's start at home.
President Trump was effusive in his praise for the U.S. intelligence agencies who found and tracked al-Baghdadi to the lair in Syria where he blew himself up to avoid being captured. In his news conference, Trump went on and on about just how good the men and women in our intelligence agencies are.
Well, Mr. President, those are the same intelligence agencies who told you that Russia intervened in our last election in an effort to tip the vote to you and against Hillary Clinton (and are still intervening). When our intel agencies exposed that reality, you impugned their integrity and quality.
And the same intelligence agencies who tracked down al-Baghdadi are the same ones who produced two whistle-blowers high up in your White House -- who complained that you, Mr. Trump, abused the power of your office to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, touching off this impeachment inquiry.
And those same intelligence agencies whom you hailed as heroes for tracking down al-Baghdadi, Mr. Trump, are the same "deep state," the same agencies and whistle-blowers whom your White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, just smeared as "radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution."
So thank you, Mr. Trump, for clearing up this confusion. We now know that the same intelligence services who have been heroic in protecting us from those who want to attack our constitutional democracy from abroad are the same heroes who have stepped up to protect our constitutional democracy from within. Unlike you, Mr. Trump, they took seriously their oath to do both.
As for the future of the Middle East, let's not forget that ISIS was the Sunni Muslim jihadist organization that emerged after President Barack Obama's administration eliminated the previous holder of the worst-person-in-the-world title, Osama bin Laden. But al-Baghdadi's death -- a very good thing in and of itself -- is not the end of our troubles in and from the Middle East.
Trump's effort to play down the significance of President Obama's killing of bin Laden -- while playing up his killing of al-Baghdadi as the key to creating the peace to end all peace -- only shows how ignorant he is about the region.
ISIS emerged in 2014 as the product of three loose factions or movements, as I pointed out in a column back in 2015.
One faction comprised the foreign volunteers. Some were hardened jihadists, but many were losers, misfits, adventure seekers and young men who had never held power, a job or a girl's hand and they joined ISIS to get all three. ISIS offered a paycheck, power and sexual release to men and women coming from closed societies or cultures where none of that was available.
ISIS's second faction -- its brains and military backbone -- was composed of former Sunni Baathist army officers and local Iraqi Sunnis and tribes, who gave ISIS passive support. Iraqi Sunnis constitute about a third of Iraq's population. They had ruled Iraq for generations, and many Sunnis in the Iraqi military were enraged, humiliated and frustrated by how the U.S. invasion of Iraq had overturned that order and put the Iraqi Shiite majority in charge.
ISIS also derived a lot of passive support from just average Iraqi Sunnis after Iran and pro-Iranian Shiites in power in Baghdad, led by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki -- whom the Bush administration tragically installed -- used their power to further abuse Iraqi Sunnis and keep them from jobs and out of the military.
For many Iraqi Sunni villagers under ISIS control, ISIS was just less bad than the brutality and discrimination they experienced under Iraq's pro-Iranian Shiite-led government back then. Google "Iraqi Shiite militias and power drills" and you'll see that ISIS didn't invent torture in Iraq.
Fortunately, we and the Iraqis finally figured that out, and Iraq has a much better government today. But the U.S. keeps repeating the same mistake in the Middle East: overestimating the power of religious ideology and underappreciating the impact of bad governance.
As Sarah Chayes, who long worked in Afghanistan and has written an important book -- "Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security" -- puts it: "Nothing feeds extremism more than the in-your-face corruption and injustice" that some of America's closest Middle East allies administer daily to their people.
The third ISIS faction was composed of the true religious ideologues, led by al-Baghdadi. They have their own apocalyptic version of Islam. But it would not have resonated so far and wide were it not for the first two factors listed above.
And that leads us back to Trump and his foreign policy. Trump has never met a dictator he did not like. He is blind to the fact that the next al-Baghdadi is being incubated today in some prison in Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom Trump once actually called "my favorite dictator," is not only rounding up violent Jihadists but liberal nonviolent journalists, activists and politicians. Their only crime is that they want to have a say in their country's future and help to create an environment where they can realize their full potential -- so they will not have to look for dignity, power, a job or a girl's hand from extremist groups like ISIS.
When Trump praises Baghdadi as his favorite victim and el-Sisi as his favorite dictator, all he is doing is walking in place. We're actually getting nowhere.
And that brings me back to Syria. Syrian Sunnis supported ISIS for the same reason Iraqi Sunnis did. Iran, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia, the Shiite-Alawite Syrian regime of Bashar Assad and Russia have all collaborated to create a pro-Iranian Shiite minority government in Damascus. Of course they gave Trump a free pass to kill Baghdadi! His death just makes it that much easier for them to rule Syria without sharing power with the Sunnis. As long as that's the case, there will be no stability there.
Finally, Trump kept going on and on in his news conference about how he, in his infinite wisdom, was keeping U.S. troops in Syria to protect the oil fields there so maybe U.S. oil companies could exploit them. He even boasted that while he was against the Iraq war, we should have taken over all of Iraq's oil fields to pay for it.
This is disgusting talk, and again, a prescription for trouble in the future. If America has any role in the Middle East today, it is not to protect the oil wells, but to protect and enhance what I call the "islands of decency."
These are places like Iraqi and Syrian Kurdistan, Jordan, the U.A.E., Oman, Lebanon and the frail democracies in Tunisia and Baghdad. None of these are developed democracies; Oman, Jordan and the U.A.E. are monarchies. But perfect is not on the menu in the Middle East right now. And these countries do promote more moderate versions of Islam and religious tolerance, they do empower their women and they do encourage modern education.
These are the necessary but not sufficient antidotes to ISIS. They are worth preserving and enhancing in hopes that they can develop one day into something better for all their peoples. Just look at the democracy protests in Lebanon. You can see where the young people want to go.
Only Trump would boast of defeating ISIS and thinking that all that needs to be done now is to protect the Middle East's oil wells and America's favorite dictators -- and not its wells of decency.

Apps Parse Data to Point to Health Risks

Texto completo: Flo and Clue, two popular period-tracking apps, recently introduced health tools that evaluate a woman's risk for the hormonal imbalance known as polycystic ovary syndrome.
In September alone, more than 636,000 women completed the Flo health assessments, said the app's developer, Flo Health. The app then recommended that 240,000 of those women, or about 38 percent, ask their doctors about the hormonal disorder. (BioWink, the developer of Clue, declined to provide similar usage statistics.)
But what many women who used the Flo and Clue health tools may not have known is that the apps did not conduct high-level clinical studies to determine the accuracy of their health risk assessments or the potential for unintended consequences such as overdiagnosis. As a result, some experts said, the new tools could lead some women to be labeled with a hormonal imbalance they did not have or that may have no significant repercussions for their health.
"You could be making a lot of people concerned they have a problem that they don't know will have absolutely no clinical consequences for them," said Dr. Jennifer Doust, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Bond University in Queensland, Australia, who has studied polycystic ovary syndrome, which is known as PCOS.
Flo's and Clue's health assessments are part of a broader shift in digital medicine. Health tracking apps have for years helped people collect and chart data on their heart rates, moods, sleep patterns and menstrual cycles. But now some of these apps are going further by using that data to predict an individual's risk for problems like heart conditions. In other words, they are moving from simply quantifying consumers' health data to medicalizing it.
While some of the apps' new evaluation tools may be useful and helpful, determining whether they are accurate can be difficult. Of the several hundred thousand health apps available globally in major app stores, most lack high-level evidence on their outcomes, according to a recent study in Nature Digital Medicine. And as long as consumer health apps make vague health promises -- like improved well-being -- and do not claim to diagnose or treat a disease, they are not typically required to submit effectiveness evidence for vetting by the Food and Drug Administration.
"It's certainly become confusing as a consumer if you go onto these app marketplaces and these apps are making claims about helping you learn about mental health, PCOS, heart disease, diabetes," said Dr. John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, one of the authors of the Nature study. "Do we know this helps or it doesn't help?"
Flo, which has more than 30 million active monthly users, and Clue, with more than 12 million, have good intentions. Their developers each said they had worked with medical experts to develop the assessments and had based them on international medical guidelines for identifying PCOS. The apps also include prominent disclaimers saying that their assessments for PCOS should not be construed as diagnoses.
But in a recent news release, Flo described its service as a "digital, pre-diagnostic tool" to help women "discover if they have PCOS and also bring peace of mind to others who may suspect they have it." Clue said its "probabilistic statistical model" for the hormonal imbalance offered a "smart assessment that can be shared with doctors."
One woman, a product manager in the San Francisco Bay Area, interviewed by The New York Times who used Flo said it gave her more information about PCOS than her doctor had. But Sasha O'Marra, a copywriter in Toronto who tried a beta version of Flo's health risk feature in July, said she found the assessment irresponsible.
The app said Ms. O'Marra's symptoms -- acne and menstrual cycle changes -- "may indicate a hormonal imbalance which is probably a manifestation of PCOS." She took the company to task on Twitter, explaining that her period had changed because she had just changed birth control pills.
"It's very concerning to me," Ms. O'Marra said in an interview. "Telling people they might have something like PCOS without understanding the context behind their symptoms is a slippery slope."
The company responded on Twitter: "Here at Flo, we use medically approved algorithms." It explained that its algorithm considered multiple factors. "If some symptoms match, we encourage a user to visit a doctor just to make sure that everything is fine."
In an email, Flo said the app includes a disclaimer that its PCOS assessment is not designed for women who use long-term birth control methods.
Polycystic ovary syndrome is a prevalent health problem among women of childbearing age. Its symptoms can include elevated testosterone levels, irregular periods and abnormal facial hair growth. The syndrome can make conceiving without fertility treatments more difficult for some women.
The apps' PCOS risk assessment tools are easy to use. They ask women a series of questions about possible symptoms, adapting to certain answers with follow-up questions. After people complete the questionnaires, the apps tell them whether their symptoms seem suggestive of the hormonal imbalance and may recommend they ask their doctors about it.
Professional medical groups disagree over which symptoms are needed to identify the hormonal imbalance -- and whether it is overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed. One 2017 study of about 1,400 women who eventually received a PCOS diagnosis, for instance, reported that about one-third of them consulted at least three physicians before the syndrome was identified.
Women who have been misdiagnosed with PCOS said the experience could be jarring.
"I was really stressed during that time because I really thought maybe I wasn't going to be able to have kids," said Sabrina Wisbiski, a human resources coordinator in the Detroit area, who said she was erroneously told by an endocrinologist a few years ago that she had the disorder. She said she later discovered that she had a different hormonal problem set off by intensive bodybuilding.
"I feel like a lot of doctors did not have the right knowledge or experience with women who lose their periods from overtraining and they turned to PCOS as a blanket diagnosis," she said.
Clue and Flo each said their assessments did not make definitive health judgments. If the apps detect a risk, Flo tells its users that their symptoms "could be a manifestation of PCOS," while Clue tells its users that PCOS is "a possible cause" of their irregular periods.
Clue also said it had tested its risk models for the hormonal disorder on nine hypothetical patients who were assigned different symptoms. The prediction models incorrectly detected PCOS in one to two of the virtual patients -- and also typically assigned the virtual test subjects a risk score more than 15 percentage points higher than a physician did.
"We err on the side of caution," said Daniel Thomas, Clue's head of data science. "Even if we think it's more likely that they don't have PCOS than having PCOS, but it's one of these gray zone cases, we would also still ask them to see the doctor."
Dr. Torous, who has published studies on the evidence supporting health apps, said the validation method could skew Clue's health risk assessments.
"If you're training a model on virtual patients, the model learns how to treat virtual patients," he said. "But a virtual patient is not you or me or a real person."
Flo offered its PCOS assessment tool to all of its users last month, but it has now limited it to women with irregular periods who have logged at least six menstrual cycles on the app. Kamila Staryga, vice president of product at Flo Health, said the system aims to make more women aware of PCOS and help them "weed out whether a condition is something that they should call the doctor" about.
But the Flo app -- unlike Clue -- did not ask about eating disorders or workout routines, factors that could explain irregular periods. Flo said its assessment didn't ask users about them because international medical guidelines for identifying PCOS did not include those criteria. The Flo app also frames certain questions in ways that could tilt women's responses toward the hormonal disorder.
"Irregular periods may be a symptom. Do your periods always start in the same timeframe?" one question on the Flo app said. Another said: "Plenty of acne in more than six months that usual skincare fails to cure could mean a hormonal imbalance caused by PCOS. Do you experience acne?"
"It's kind of suggesting the answer, isn't it?" said Dr. Doust of Bond University. "If you were in any way thinking in your head already, 'Oh, I must have PCOS,' then it's kind of suggesting what you have to say to get that answer."

Texto completo: At 21, Duluth bookkeeper Henry Carlson got a crazy idea 100 years ago. He saved up about $300 to buy a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, complete with a sidecar and a V-twin engine that engineer Bill Harley had first designed 10 years earlier.
In September of 1919, Carlson and co-worker Harvey MacFarlane quit their staid accounting jobs at Standard Oil Co. and headed west on a 1,400-mile odyssey across the unpaved plains of North Dakota and the mountains of Montana. The roads were awful, the bike broke down often but they had a blast with the 6-foot-3 MacFarlane squeezed into the sidecar and Carlson straddling the roaring V-twin.
"Henry is some pilot and I just sit and look on (when I am not two or three feet in the air) of course," MacFarlane wrote in a postcard from the Aitkin Hotel after Day 1 to Carlson's girlfriend, 18-year-old Louise Nelson, back in Duluth.
Before embarking, Henry had taken some test runs from Duluth to his hometown of South Range, Wis., 15 miles to the south -- with Louise in his sidecar. "I am not as enjoyable ballast as he had on those trips to South Range," MacFarlane quipped in his postcard.
Wearing tightfitting breeches known as jodhpurs tucked in high boots, Carlson and his buddy visited Yellowstone National Park and made it to Spokane, Wash., where they landed jobs at the Great Northern Railroad for a while before returning to Duluth.
Three years after the long ride, Henry sold his Harley to pay for an engagement ring. He and Louise were married 61 years, raised two kids and launched a long successful career in the Duluth grain milling business.
"I'm bitten with regret that none of us seem to have asked Grandpa more about the trip before he died" in 1983, said Kathryn Oakley, 72, Carlson's granddaughter in St. Paul. "The 1919 trip was probably the most adventurous thing he did in his very responsible, hardworking life."
Carlson's hearing loss in later years inhibited the storytelling, but he loved to repeat the tale of hocking the Harley for an engagement ring, according to his 91-year-old sole surviving child, Dick Carlson.
Luckily for Oakley and other descendants, Louise kept a book with 15 blurry black-and-white photographs from the 1919 trek -- along with postcards and telegrams. Some of the images show bleak dirt roads, others include Carlson and MacFarlane with the Harley loaded down with their bedrolls, duffel bags and kitchen supplies.
Sifting through the stories and pictures, Oakley devised a theory about what might have inspired her grandfather to trade in his desk job for the bumpy open road.
In the summer of 1919, just before Carlson's epic ride, the U.S. Army embarked on the first transcontinental motor convoy -- sending 81 trucks, cars and motorcycles cross-country from Washington D.C. to San Francisco. The New York Times called it "the largest aggregation of motor vehicles ever started on a trip of such length."
It took two months to cover the 3,251 miles and test wartime military mobility along what was then known as the Lincoln Highway and is now Interstate Hwy. 80.
Among the drivers was a 28-year-old Army officer, Lt. Col. Dwight Eisenhower.
"In Nebraska, the first real sand was encountered," the future World War II hero and 34th U.S. president wrote of his journey.
"From Orr's Ranch, Utah, to Carson City, Nevada, the road is one succession of dust, ruts, pits and holes."
Ike marveled at the German autobahn network as he led the U.S. military against the Nazis in World War II. Along with that 1919 trip, he grew convinced that the United States needed to construct an interstate highway system -- one of his signature initiatives during his two presidential terms in the 1950s.
We don't know for sure if that's what sparked Henry Carlson and Harvey MacFarlane to make their own trip a month later. Carlson's granddaughter used the distances between towns mentioned in the postcards to estimate the pair averaged about 30 mph and 250 miles a day -- taking about 10 days to make it to Spokane.
"All these years later," Oakley said, "it's hard to know whether Spokane was their ultimate goal or whether they were just tired of bouncing along the road."
A roll of adding machine paper, with notes from 20 co-workers back in Duluth, is among the artifacts her grandmother saved. One note on the paper mentioned Mildred Coleman, MacFarlane's girlfriend, who was doing "fine but sure she is lonesome."
A photo in her grandmother's album shows Mildred and Louise in the wide-brimmed, feathered hats of the era -- looking somewhat forlorn.
Like Henry and Louise, Mildred and Harvey wed not long after the motorcycle journey west. He enjoyed a long career in the insurance business in Green Bay, Wis.
"The two couples met at least yearly in Duluth or Green Bay to renew their long friendship," Oakley said, "and to reminisce about that motorcycle trip out west in 1919."

Texto completo: The Trump administration faced a bevy of accusations that a Situation Room photo showing President Trump watching a raid by U.S. special operations forces in Syria that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after his predecessor's White House photographer pointed out a small detail.
On Sunday, the White House shared a photo of the president and a handful of his advisers monitoring the Saturday raid.
Tweet
White House photographer for former President Barack Obama, Pete Souza later noted on Twitter the raid took place at 3:30 p.m. Washington, D.C., time, but that the timestamp on the photo was marked over an hour and a half later at 17:05:24, or 5:05 p.m.
Tweet
Critics were quick to pick up on Souza's tweet and began questioning the authenticity of the photo as well.
Tweet
Others compared the picture to the famous Situation Room photo depicting Obama watching the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, noting that one appears less staged than the other.
TweetTweet
Souza later clarified his observation, tweeting, "Just to be clear, I didn't say it was staged. Trump himself said he didn't arrive to the Situation Room until 'around 5pm'. So it's definitely possible the photo was taken during the raid."
Tweet
He also noted that the New York Times reported "the helicopters left Iraq at 5PM (Washington time), and they reported it was about a 70-minute flight to Syria. So actual raid had to happen some time after 6:10PM."
Tweet
While the timeline is unclear, Trump's schedule indicated that he was at his golf club in Virginia at 3:30 p.m. and arrived back at the White House at 4:18 p.m. on Saturday.
Photo Caption:In this photo provided by the White House, President Donald Trump is joined by from left, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary mark Esper, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Brig. Gen. Marcus Evans, Deputy Director for Special Operations on the Joint Staff, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019, in the Situation Room of the White House in Washington.

The Silent Heart Attack You Didn’t Know You Had

Texto completo: When my Aunt Gert had a heart attack in her mid-70s, the examining doctor told her that it was not her first. Tests done to assess the damage to her heart revealed a section of dead muscle from a previous unrecognized heart attack. Sometime in the past, she had had what doctors call a “silent myocardial infarction,” or SMI - silent in that any symptoms she might have had at the time did not register as related to her heart and were not brought to medical attention.
My aunt was lucky. She survived her second attack and, by keeping cardiac risk factors under control, lived two decades more without further heart-related problems.
There are millions of people in this country who, like my aunt, are oblivious to the fact that they have had an SMI and face an increased risk of having another, more obvious one that could cause severe heart damage and possibly death.
You might think a silent heart attack is better than a recognized one: “What you don’t know can’t hurt you.” Unfortunately, it can. Although knowing you’re at risk of a heart attack can be emotionally distressing, not knowing can have much more serious consequences, prompting you to continue living in ways that endanger the health of your heart and your life.
A recognized heart attack is a warning to adopt medical and lifestyle measures that can minimize cardiac risk, like normalizing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, quitting smoking, losing weight if you’re overweight, getting regular exercise and controlling Type 2 diabetes. If diet and exercise are not sufficiently protective, there are medications that can help nature along.
Helping yourself
Even without medication, if everyone at increased coronary risk adhered to a heart-healthy lifestyle, “the incidence of heart disease would be reduced by 80%,” Dr. Rekha Mankad, cardiologist and director of the Women’s Heart Center at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told me.
Recent studies conducted in Iceland and Finland, which maintain excellent medical records on all citizens, have helped to determine how often SMIs occur and the long-term consequences associated with them. The findings, published in JAMA Cardiology last October, highlight the critical importance of not waiting until your heart sends a clear message that its life-sustaining ability has been compromised; instead, acknowledge the presence of coronary risk factors and take preventive measures to bring them under control before it’s too late.
Perhaps most revealing was the very thorough study conducted in Iceland among 935 men and women initially aged 67 to 93 who were followed for up to more than 13 years. When they enrolled in the study, each participant underwent a noninvasive test called cardiac magnetic resonance imaging that can most reliably show whether a silent heart attack had already occurred. Initially, 17% were found to have had an SMI and 10% had had a recognized attack.
After the first three years of follow-up, there was no difference in death rates between those who had an SMI and those who did not. The death rate in both groups was 3%, significantly lower than the 9% mortality rate among participants who had a recognized heart attack.
But as time went on, those with an SMI fared increasingly worse. By 10 years after their enrollment, half the participants with silent heart attacks had died, a death rate no different from that of men and women who entered the study with a history of a recognized heart attack.
While death was the most serious result after an SMI, there was also an elevated risk of developing congestive heart failure, which leaves people increasingly short of breath and excessively fatigued. Legs swell, fluid collects around the heart, exercise tolerance is greatly reduced and patients are ultimately dependent on supplemental oxygen. Half of those who develop congestive heart failure die within five years of diagnosis, a death rate similar to some cancers.
The second recent study, published in JAMA Cardiology in July, involved autopsy findings among 5,869 men and women, average age 65, who had died suddenly in northern Finland, where autopsies of such deaths are done automatically. Evidence of an SMI was apparent in 1,322 individuals who had no prior history of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, those who succumbed to sudden cardiac death during physical activity were more frequently found to have enlarged hearts, a sign of abnormal strain.
Making it worse
An enlarged heart by itself is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death, the authors noted, but when combined with heart muscle scars from a prior SMI, the prognosis is worse.
“Individuals with SMI were unaware of their disease and presumably did not limit their physical exertion when unrecognized symptoms occurred,” the authors from the University of Oulu in Finland and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine wrote. They suggested that a scarred heart can trigger abnormal heart rhythms and result in sudden death during exercise.
“A silent heart attack is not always so silent, but its symptoms - mild chest discomfort, heartburn, nausea, shortness of breath - happen to lots of people and are typically attributed to other causes and not brought to medical attention,” Dr. Robert O. Bonow, a cardiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told me. Women, whose symptoms are often vague, are especially unlikely to realize they are having a heart attack.
Screening large groups of people for evidence of an SMI is not economically or practically feasible. Although an electrocardiogram, often done before surgery and sometimes by one’s personal physician, can show heart scarring in some people, “it is not as sensitive as a cardiac MRI that was used in the Iceland study,” Bonow said.
“While screening with cardiac MRI is not recommended, identification of risk factors certainly is,” he wrote in an editorial accompanying the Iceland study.
“It’s important for doctors to recognize people at risk and prescribe appropriate treatments to reduce that risk,” he said. “Although it’s human nature to ignore certain things until you have an event, adherence to preventive treatment can be lifesaving. In the United States, a heart attack is the leading cause of sudden death in people 65 and older.”
For people at high risk or who are suspected of having had a silent heart attack, doctors may recommend an imaging test, like a resting echocardiogram, nuclear stress test or, for people capable of exercise, an echocardiogram with a stress test, Mankad suggested.

Texto completo: Hawaii’s M&M stars — that would be Bette Midler and Bruno Mars — have been grabbing headlines in recent weeks.
Midler is selling her New York lair, a trilevel vertical mansion on the Upper East Side of the Big Apple, for $ 50 million. Reason: The Tony winner (“Hello, Dolly!”) and her husband, Martin van Haselberg , are downsizing, since their daughter, Sophie , no longer lives in the 14-room home the Divine Miss M calls “a country house in the city,” since the family moved in in 1996, combining two apartments for the mega-space.
The Midler property is an entertainment showcase with 7,000 square feet, renovated for partying, according to the New York Times. The penthouse on the top floor boasts a 900-foot garden and a mammoth floor-to-ceiling library plus a fireplace and full bathroom; the private living area has a master bedroom with park views and the space can be configured into seven bedrooms. The kitchen, with wood cabinets and marble countertops, boasts high-end appliances. Certainly, a palatial pad for a queen of song, stage and films.
Mars, who has been a New Year’s Eve attraction in Las Vegas for a couple of years, is going global this year, heading to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. He’ll headline a festive Resolution by Night event on Yas Island on Dec. 31; tickets start at about $ 95. A family-friendly Resolution by Day follows on Jan. 1 at Du Arena.
Mars previously has toured the UAE capital so the year-end countdown will be a homecoming becoming of an international star like the multi-Grammy Award winner. Clearly, Abu Dhabi spared no expenses to attract its global crowd to ring in the New Year in style.
Further, Mars evidently is in the midst of recording a new album (he’s posted a Twitter image himself, showing his Vans footwear atop a keyboard) and the buzz is that the project will be released in 2020. Wonder if he’ll another record-breaker; Mars’ “Uptown Funk,” in collaboration with Mark Ronson , has just been named the No. 1 Vevo clip in America and the United Kingdom, and No. 2 globally. Vevo monitors video streaming hits. …
THOROUGHLY THEROUX
I love this quote, from travel writer Paul Theroux , who has residences in Hawaii, Cape Cod, Mass., and Maine; the author often has a reputation of being a grouch, but rejects it thusly: “I often get criticized for being overly critical, but all I’ve done is write about the world as it is, rough around the edges. All I’ve ever done is try to see things as they are.”
Sage advice for all, including journalists; say it as you see it, write it as you feel it.
The comments are from a conversation with Joshua David Stein , for New York magazine’s One Great Story online feature, about the globetrotting, storytelling, culinary critic and book-writing wizard. The quote emerged over a meal that demonstrated Theroux’s gusto — in chronicling life, meals and travels. …
JACOB’S LADDER
Hawaii actor Jacob Batalon , a fixture in the current revival of “Spider-Man” adventures, climbs the Christmas tree ladder in Netflix’s “Let It Snow,” one of a series of yuletide streamers this fall.
The teen comedy, based on a young adult novel, drops Nov. 8. It’s about teens in a small town, who become trapped together during an unexpected snowstorm on Christmas Eve.
Batalon was last seen on the big screen in “Spider-Man: Far From Home.” The film’s young cast includes Netflix regulars Kiernan Shipka (“Chilling Adventures of Sabrina”), Odeya Rush (“Dumplin’”), Liv Hewson (“Santa Clarita Diet”) and Anna Akana (“You Get Me”) and teen flick stars Shameik Moore (“The Pretenders”), Matthew Noszka (“Star”), Mitchell Hope (“Descendants”), Isabela Moner (“Instant Family”) and Miles Robbins (“Halloween”). …
LOUNGES GONE, TOO …
A couple of readers emailed, “Why aren’t there lounges with island entertainment anymore?” This, after I recently reflected on the disappearance of main showrooms.
Lounges were not as spacious as supper clubs but also became an endangered species. Not surprising, since most hotels shuttered nightclubs in the past three decades, eliminating the cozy performance spaces thereby cutting back on show amenities. Freestanding spaces, too, were closed — not sure if the reason was operational costs or wavering crowd support.
Remember Jimmy Borges at Trappers, Loyal Garner at the Canoe House, the Kahauanu Lake Trio at the Royal Hawaiian’s Surf Room, Kit Samson’s Sound Advice at the Kahala Hilton’s Maile Lounge, the Makaha Sons at Hank’s Place and the Ranch House and Carole Kai at the Hilton Hawaiian Village’s Garden Bar? Those joints were jumping in the height of lounge-hopping.
More casual sounds were provided by Myra English and Martin Denny at the Outrigger Waikiki’s Blue Dolphin Room, Jay Larrin at the Gangplank Lounge, and Al Lopaka and Iva Kinimaka at the Cock’s Roost. Those were the days.
The scarcity of lounges — training ground for entertainers seeking a Waikiki spotlight — also explains why there are virtually no main attraction “name” headliners anymore. …
And that’s “Show Biz.”

Texto completo: Now in its sixth year, the Foo Foo Festival continues its sweeping survey of local arts, culture and entertainment. Spanning 12 days from Oct. 31-Nov. 11, the festival bridges incumbent events like the Blue Angels Homecoming show with newer ones like "StompFest" and "3D Printsacola."
"Pensacola is highly regarded in the arts and culture community and is quickly becoming the culture capital across the Southeast," said Maria Goldberg, Foo Foo Fest Committee Chair.
The festival is a flagship effort by Art, Culture, and Entertainment, Inc., or ACE. The non-profit group distributes federal, state, and local funding to local organizations and promotes "cultural tourism." "Foo Foo" refers to the impromptu musical parties that broke out on 19th century sailing ships. The name is also an apposite tie-in to the city's maritime history.
"We're excited to present another year of stellar and diverse experiences during this year's festival that will attract regional and national visitors alike," Goldberg continued.
Foo Foo events have either received grant funding through ACE or have applied to join the festival's promotional calendar as "Friends of Foo Foo."
Perhaps its main anchor is the Great Gulfcoast Arts Festival, Nov. 1-3, in Seville Square. Now in its 47th year, GGAF is a travel-worthy convention of over 200 juried artists and local performers. This year the festival will extend to Museum Plaza on Tarragona Street.
Nearby is "Fire and Rain," a colorful canopy that will drape overhead through several downtown blocks throughout the month of November. Billed as "Pensacola's biggest art installation to date," it winds from Southtowne to Artel Gallery.
Art and Science will converge for "3D Printsacola" on Nov. 1 at First City Art Center, 1060 N. Guillemard St. For this ambitious project, FCAC teamed up with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition.
"We believe there are many connections between art and science, art and technology, and how machine-generative art is changing the way some artists are making work these days," explained Caitlin Rhea, FCAC's executive director.
The evening features Rodney Mullen, the "godfather of modern street skating," who will put 3D-printed concrete "skulptures" to the test.
For traditional print artists a workshop by New York Times Best-Selling author (and former Pensacolian) Joshilyn Jackson is offered from 1:30-5 p.m., Nov. 8, at the Studer Community Center, 220 W. Garden St. It follows from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Nov. 9, with the Pensacola Writing and Book Festival. Aspiring scribes are invited to pick the brains of published authors including romance novelist Lenora Worth.
Eleanor Randolph, another former Pensacolian, is having a sort of homecoming at 5:30 p.m., Nov. 9, at the Pensacola Museum of Art. She will sign her new book, "The Many Lives of Michael Bloomberg."
"This masterful work not only paints a riveting portrait of a fascinating man; it is an absolutely first-rate study of leadership in business, politics and philanthropy," lauded a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.
Randolph was on the New York Times editorial staff for 20 years after writing for other daily heavyweights like the St. Petersburg Times, Chicago Tribune, and the Washington Post. She got her start reporting for the Pensacola News Journal.
Out on Perdido Key, the 35th annual Frank Brown International Songwriters' Festival gathers over 200 Grammy Award-winning songwriters from Nov. 7-17. The oldest of its kind in the U.S., the festival is spread out to over two dozen venues including Flora-Bama Lounge.
If you'd rather hear yourself croon, then join "Choir!Choir!Choir!" at 7:30 p.m., Nov. 6, at the Rex Theatre, 18 N. Palafox St. The mass sing-a-along will be led by Toronto-based musicians Daveed Goldman and Nobu Adilman.
For classical fans the Pensacola Symphony Orchestra welcomes Garrick Ohlsson, an acclaimed pianist, to perform Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1. The performance is 7:30 p.m., Nov. 2, at the Saenger Theatre.
For the younger set there's Stompfest, an invitational step show hosted by comedian Haha Davis, at 7:30 p.m., Nov. 2 at the Pensacola Bay Center. Stepping is a laminate of dance movements influenced by African foot dances and vintage R&B. The fest features jazz and pop recording star Marsha Ambrosius.
Speaking of jazz, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy swings into town at 6 p.m., Nov. 4, at Vinyl Music Hall. This tireless 25 year-old outfit ignited their reputation in the 1996 film "Swingers."
For hometown horns head to "Jazz for Justice," an annual fundraiser for Legal Services of North Florida.
"Our program works hard to meet the legal needs of children, elderly, victims of abuse, and those with disabilities," said Charlotte Waters, Communications Specialist for LSNF.
Local cats like The Quashers and Whiskey & Waters will join other regional acts from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., Nov. 10 at Seville Quarter. Admission is free but VIP tickets are available.
On another type of stage is "The Savannah Sipping Society," Nov 1-3 at the Pensacola Little Theatre. The play is a Georgia spin on "The Golden Girls" as four women of a certain age confront the next phase of their lives through the lens of happy hour. Tickets start at $18.
Oenophiles can unite for a good cause at "Science Uncorked," a fundraiser for the Pensacola MESS Hall, 116 N. Tarragona St.
"Basically, it's a fundraiser and a chance for our supporters to mix and explore," said Megan Pratt, Executive Director.
The corks will be popped from 6 to 8 p.m., Nov. 10 for those 21 and over. Tickets are $50. Founded in 2012 as an interactive laboratory for "Math, Engineering, Science, and Stuff," the MESS Hall is also staging an all-ages "Curiosity Day" from 1-4 p.m., Nov. 11.
"The planets are aligning for our event," said Pratt. "But it's not just about the kids. It's for anyone who wants to explore."
The afternoon revolves around Mercury's transit of the sun, a unique astronomical event linked to hands-on exhibits about exoplanet exploration.
Another venue for ingenuity is the Pensacola Children's Business Fair at 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Nov. 9, at the Palafox Market. This chaptered community event started in 2007 as a fun search for the next Bill Gates or Elon Musk.
"Our 'kidpreneurs,' affectionately known as 'Pensapreneurs,' are encouraged to develop their own brand, build a marketing strategy, and utilize their communication skills to entice potential customers," said Jennifer Fernandez, the fair's event and sponsorship coordinator.
Kids will express themselves on stage for "The Trail to Oregon!" at 7 p.m., Nov. 2, at N.B. Cook Elementary School. Based on a computer game, the play is an interactive musical by the Loudmouth Theatre Company, a local teen troupe. Tickets are $10.
Improbable Cause Mystery Theatre is collaborating with Stamped Film Festival for "The Mattachine: A Hedwig Experience" at 8 p.m., Nov. 9 at The Cabaret, 101 S. Jefferson St. The night features John Cameron Mitchell, the creator of the genderqueer musical "Hedwig and the Angry Itch." It also supports local LGBTQ charity and promotes trans awareness. Tickets are on sale through Eventbrite.
PenArts, a relatively new theater company, will perform "Into the Breeches," a George Brant play about social injustice during World War II.
"PenArts is thrilled with the local talent that it has been able to hire in Pensacola and audiences will see many familiar faces," said Christine Kellogg, artistic director.
"Into the Breeches" runs Nov 7-10 at The Gordon, their new home at 306 N. Devilliers St.
Celebrating our military heritage, the U.S. Navy Blue Angels Homecoming Airshow is Nov. 8-9 at N.A.S. Pensacola. A local rite of passage, the show closes out their 2019 season. Gates open at 8 a.m.
For an intimate dose of patriotism, head to the Pensacola Museum of Art for "100 Faces of War," a traveling exhibit that portrays individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice.
"With '100 Faces of War' I aimed to look at Americans who served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in a way that did not simplify their complex experience," said painter Matt Mitchell.
Mitchell's project, taking nearly 10 years to complete, are life-sized likenesses include 10 that are posthumous. The exhibit opens with a free reception at 6 to 8 p.m., Nov. 8. In conjunction is "The Telling Project," a forum for military veterans to share their personal stories through two dramatic performances: 2 p.m., Nov. 10, at the West Florida Public Library, 239 N. Spring St.; and 11 a.m., Nov. 11, at the PMA.
And as a kind of finish line to it all is the Pensacola Women's Half Marathon Weekend. It starts with a one-mile dash at 5 p.m., Nov. 2, while the main race and a 5K contingent, starts at 7 a.m., Nov. 3. The race is open to men but they are ineligible for prizes.

Texto completo: The Portland Conservatory of Music has only a few hundred students, but several of Portland's best musicians have an association with the school, and for concertgoers, it is a fount of varied, polished and inexpensive performances (including the free weekly Noonday Concerts). But its most crucial offerings have been a pair of brief but important annual festivals that explore different ends of music's historical spectrum - the Portland Early Music Festival, in October, and the Back Cove Contemporary Music Festival, in May.
This year, the school changed its plan, opting to present these weekend-long festivals on alternate years, rather than annually. As someone who was hoping to see both festivals expand - a week each would be a good start - I find this disappointing news. But then, it's miraculous for a school of this size to present as many concerts as it does.
On Friday evening, the eighth installment of the weekend-long Portland Early Music Festival got underway at Woodfords Congregational Church, with a program devoted mostly to vocal works by Claudio Monteverdi, with a pair of illuminating lute pieces by his contemporaries, Pietro Paolo Melii and Johannes Kapsberger.
The singers, who all live and work in Maine, though a few have national or international careers, were sopranos Jennifer Bates and Christine Letcher, mezzo-soprano Andrea Graichen, tenor Bruce Fithian, and basses John David Adams and Patrick Volker. Timothy Burris, who directs the festival (and also runs the Portland Early Music series at the Cathedral of St. Luke's), provided the spare lute accompaniments to the Monteverdi works, and gave fluid accounts of the solo lute pieces.
Though the program was short - it ran just over an hour, without intermission - it offered an appealing overview of Monteverdi's career as a madrigalist, the earliest works, "Lamento d'Ariana" and "Zefiro torna e'bel tempo" dating to the "Sixth Book of Madrigals" (1614), and the latest (the duet "Pur ti meo") from Monteverdi's last surviving opera, "L'incoronazione di Poppea" (1643).
Only the pair of works from the "Sixth Book of Madrigals" demanded the full ensemble, and in both, the voices were well-balanced, though not quite the homogenous readings recordings have made listeners accustomed to.
That's not to say that the performances were unpolished. The singers wove their vocal lines together beautifully, and they were clearly mindful of the passions expressed in the texts of these bittersweet love songs.
But the performance also raised an interesting historical question about what the sound of the 17th century really was. In the homogenous approach cultivated today, individual vocal distinctiveness is smoothed over, in favor of a velvety, inextricably unified ensemble sound. Generally, that style of sound is the province of permanent ensembles with the rehearsal time necessary to produce that level of tightly compressed ensemble singing.
As choral sound goes, it can be thoroughly seductive, particularly in richly harmonized works like Monteverdi's. But this music was composed for both court ensembles and cultivated amateurs to sing at home, in those days before recordings. So it seems likely that what most 17th century listeners heard was a more casual sound, closer in both texture and spirit to what the festival's singers produced on Friday. The ensemble's sound was solid, but not so suave that you could not easily focus on the singers' individual qualities.
Those qualities were estimable. Fithian, whom I've heard more frequently as a conductor (he directs the St. Mary Schola), harpsichordist and organist than as a singer, brought a pleasant timbre to his thoughtfully shaped tenor lines, and the basses, who are heard regularly as soloists from within Portland's choirs, gave the ensembles a firm foundation.
Several singers enjoyed a brighter spotlight, in pieces for smaller groups. In "Si doce Ã¨'l tormento," another lovesick soliloquy, Bates produced a flexible, richly expressive sound, inflected with only a hint of vibrato. She offered a different side of her artistry in the flightier, more assertive "Quel sguardo sdegnosetto."
Bates and Letcher were well-matched in "Zefiro torna e disoavi accenti," which opened the program, and she and Graichen gave a magnificent account of "Pur ti miro," the third act duet between Nero and Poppea, from "Incoronazione." That was a clear highlight of the program, although the account of "Lamento della Ninfa," by Bates, Fithian, Adams and Volker, was a strong contender.

Pyongyang's Retro Sci-Fi Architecture

Texto completo: In July 2015, the two of us stepped off a plane at the newly opened airport in Pyongyang, North Korea. It was our first time in the country. As architects based in Beijing, we were well acquainted with the world's cities and skyscrapers, but North Korea was a dark spot in our mental map -- filled in, as it was for most people, by preconceptions and stereotypes that rendered the so-called Hermit Kingdom in black and white. We had tried to leave those ideas behind, but we didn't expect that this first visit would leave us with such a sense of confusion, one where the difference between what was real and genuine was muddled by what was ostensibly staged or faked.
As soon as we left, we knew we had to return. Over the next four years we made three more visits, facilitated by a Beijing-based travel company called Koryo Tours. Over time we decided to try to represent the complicated reality of Pyongyang through photography, which ended up in the form of a book, "Model City: Pyongyang."
Pyongyang, a city of 3.2 million people, has a long history, but it was largely rebuilt after the Korean War (called the "American War" in North Korea) by the newly founded Communist government, which intended it to be a model city for a new society. North Korean society is built around "juche ideology," a homegrown form of socialism based on self-reliance, and it infuses everything in the city, especially the architecture. "On Architecture," an essay by Kim Jong Il, who ruled from 1994 to 2011, sets out juche-informed rules regarding axis, control of heights, framing of space and so on, and they are recognizable everywhere in the city.
Still, different architectural phases are noticeable in the city, from an early radical, brutalist period to the modernist and postmodern, up to the new developments created under the current leader, Kim Jong Un, where pastel colors and futuristic shapes are applied to super high-rise buildings, in a retro science-fiction style.
Architects have long dreamed of such "total planning," so it was not difficult for us to fall in love with this city. We wanted to reveal to the world its beauty, a beauty of a different kind, to be preserved when a necessary and inevitable change will eventually occur. In the last four years, the initial fascination we had as architects slowly transformed into empathy for a city with such a strong and peculiar cultural identity, and especially for its people, for whom we hope the future will unfold for the better.
Our photography portrays the puzzling feeling of "fictional reality" that we experienced in North Korea. We took inspiration from a ubiquitous feature in North Korean art: In painting, sculpture and propaganda posters, the sky is represented as a simple gradient of colors, like a hyper-saturated sunset or sunrise, transforming the real into the ideal, a metaphor for the "utopia" of Pyongyang itself. The buildings and cityscapes in the book are framed using a classical architectural approach, with no significant editing, while the sky is completely replaced by a soft gradient of pastel colors, taken from the color palette used by Korean artists for the posters or by the architects for the facades. The contrast between the two parts of the photographs creates a visual juxtaposition where the real part (the building or the city) looks unreal and the unreal part (the sky) could actually be real.
Sticking to the rules is part of the game when you decide to go to North Korea. We won the trust of our guides, the only Koreans we had the opportunity to interact with. This trust not only gave us a certain level of freedom in photographing and getting information but also allowed us to achieve a closer human relationship with them, so we could talk about our lives and their lives, our reality and their reality.
We were amazed by some of our interactions. For example, one of them asked us if Michael Jackson had really died. We were in North Korea on Nov. 9, 2016, with no access to the news, and our guides -- surprisingly -- informed us about the election of Donald Trump. We met the architect who designed the new Pyongyang airport (which was a surprise, as some media reports said he had been killed because Kim Jong Un didn't like the design), and we discovered that he spoke perfect Italian, having studied in Rome for five years. We ate a kimchi pizza together in a new futuristic residential neighborhood, and we ended up in a karaoke bar singing "Bella Ciao," an old Italian song of the resistance against fascism, with our guides. They all knew the lyrics by heart.
The human side of Pyongyang is barely visible in the book; people are small presences in the grand urban space or in front of gigantic statues. But it's there if you look carefully. For all the sober, clean, monumental urban structures, there are hidden spaces for leisure and entertainment, like the many parks -- the city is one of the greenest in Asia -- where people enjoy picnicking, singing and rollerblading. The political space of Kim Il Sung Square, where military parades and mass dances take place, faces the quiet riverfront stroll on the Taedong River, where people walk with children and enjoy the afternoon light.
Cristiano Bianchi, an Italian architect and photographer, and Kristina Drapic, a Serbian architect and graphic designer, are the authors of "Model City: Pyongyang."

Texto completo: The joy in planning a vacation in Europe comes from booking Mediterranean boat trips or researching restaurants in Paris, not the boring details of how you pay for those experiences. But there I was, stuck in a parking lot in Lerici, Italy, because I had forgotten to set up a personal identification number on my credit card (many unmanned kiosks in Europe, like parking ticket machines, require one). That I write about such things for a living only makes the story more embarrassing, so the following checklist has been a crucial part of my European travel prep ever since.
Bring at least two credit cards from different networks
A well-chosen travel credit card should be your main form of payment in Europe. From the London Tube to a neighborhood patisserie, the fraud protection a card offers is unbeatable: You would rather have a thief using your card for their Mitte district shopping spree in Berlin than depleting your actual bank account with your A.T.M. card. Also, the larger spending limit won't crimp your style if a hotel or a rental-car company places a 200 euros hold on the card.
Pick a credit card that does not charge a foreign transaction fee and you'll save yourself up to 3 percent of each purchase. And if you have an American Express or Discover card, carry a Visa or Mastercard too, since these cards are more widely accepted abroad.
Before you leave, alert your bank that you'll be traveling, either with a phone call or through its app. This should let you use your card without incident, although overly cautious financial institutions sometimes mess up and ping you with a fraud alert anyway. While in touch with your bank, see if it allows you to set a P.I.N. on the card (some cards, like the Bank of America Travel Rewards credit card, give you the option). If you don't have a P.I.N., you should still be able to use your credit card in person, and some unmanned kiosks sometimes allow you to skip this step. Chase, which issues Wirecutter's favorite travel rewards card, recommends you push the Enter, Continue, or Cancel button when asked for your P.I.N. If these don't work, you'll have to pay in cash.
Bring one debit card that you can use at European A.T.M.s
Smaller shops may not accept cards or might "pass on the extra processing fees associated with credit cards to customers," said Aaron Klein, a Brookings Institution fellow.
So if you want to pay for that pieróg in cash, consider opening a checking account that doesn't nickel-and-dime you abroad. The ideal option doesn't charge A.T.M. fees, reimburses A.T.M.-operator expenses worldwide, and forgoes foreign transaction fees. Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, recommends the Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account, which gives you those benefits. (You need a Charles Schwab brokerage account to get that checking account, but neither one requires a minimum balance.)
If you don't want to set up a bunch of accounts just to avoid fees, check your bank's international A.T.M. partners. Bank of America customers can avoid fees in a host of countries by using designated partner machines (Deutsche Bank in Germany, for example). You likely get better exchange rates at an A.T.M. than you do at a currency-exchange window, or from your bank before you depart.
Bring your mobile wallet
Apple Pay and other digital wallets are picking up steam abroad, and these mobile contactless payment systems (where you wave your phone in front of a payment terminal) could save you a lot of hassle -- especially if you lack cash or don't want to fumble with your wallet.
Make sure you've loaded your cards with no foreign transaction fees on your phone before you take off. Apple Pay should work even if you're in airplane mode, so you don't need a local SIM card to use it.

Texto completo: He makes us believe we already knew about every new exposé,
says media strategist
First, an excerpt from "All the President's Women," a new book by Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy, ran in Esquire. It detailed 43 new allegations of sexual misconduct and assault by Donald Trump, including an incident in the early 2000s when he was said to have hidden behind a Mar-a-Lago tapestry to grab a woman. Within a week, ProPublica published an investigation into new tax documents indicating that Trump's businesses lied either to lenders or tax authorities (or both) about their value to make more money.
Either story, in any other administration, would be devastating for the president, but these reports barely registered. News organizations moved right along, focusing on Ukraine, Syria and other political matters, while Trump's approval rating barely budged. That's because the president has a way of making any story seem like it's something we already knew about him. Nothing feels revelatory, or like a shock to the public consciousness.
But this is not Trump's genius at work - it's a function of our own cognitive biases. We measure people against what we perceive to be their baseline behavior. If, as evidenced by his history, we believe that Trump is a bad-faith actor with no moral compass (a belief that even some Republicans have expressed), malfeasance is to be expected. We react little to behaviors that in absolute terms are horrifying but that conform to the norm. We're moved only by deviations from our expectations.
So it would be less surprising if a notorious criminal were guilty of a number of crimes than if an upstanding citizen were guilty of a misdemeanor: Each has set a standard of behavior against which their subsequent actions are measured. In Trump's case, he stiffed contractors and drove his own business into bankruptcy six times; lenders stopped loaning him money. He has treated women horribly, with some of that behavior documented by women he's been horrible to, including his ex-wife Ivana, who claimed in a deposition that he raped her. (Trump denies this, and she later said that she did not want her words to be taken in "a literal or criminal" sense.) Before he ever ran for president, Trump had a long history of lying on the record about his business success, his personal life, his intelligence and the time of day (according to an acquaintance). Even his persona on "The Apprentice" was cutthroat, selfish and oblivious to the needs of others. The consistent through-line: Trump views ethics as dispensable features of the middle and lower classes, who have to consider the lives of other people because they lack the power or money that enables contemptuous disregard.
In 2016, it seemed that it might behoove Trump to clean up that image as he went on the campaign trail. Yet when asked about his taxes, he admitted he didn't pay them, which supposedly made him "smart." And when an "Access Hollywood" video featuring him bragging about sexual assault became public, he displayed no embarrassment or remorse beyond a pro forma statement: "I apologize if anyone was offended," he said, while in the same breath dismissing his comments as "locker room banter." Polling showed that the tape's revelations did not change people's opinions of Trump: Both before and after its release, 59 percent of the public said they thought that Trump did not respect women, according to HuffPost. Today, after scandals such as the payoffs to Stormy Daniels, and after E. Jean Carroll's essay alleging that Trump raped her, that figure has somehow fallen to 51 percent. In 2016, 44 percent of Americans said that if the allegations of sexual assault were true, they should disqualify Trump from the presidency; today, only 40 percent would consider them disqualifying.
Years into his presidency, why would anyone be jolted by additional women coming forward, or by the growing paper trail pointing to financial malfeasance? He has long since admitted to both, in public. Trump has made being openly terrible an asset, at least in terms of weathering blowback from additional misdeeds. When Politico/Morning Consult asked voters in May their opinions of Trump as a businessman, after a New York Times report that he had lost more than $1 billion in the 1980s and 1990s, they were evenly split: Forty-three percent said he'd succeeded in business, and 41 percent said he'd been unsuccessful.
The baseline effect is so strong that when Trump does minor things that you'd expect any decent human being to do, like expressing sympathy for hurricane victims and not immediately smearing an alleged sexual assault victim as a liar, the public applauds him. People see a deviation from his normal behavior and take it as a vast improvement, declaring that he seems more "presidential." This defines "presidential" downward to about the altitude of Dante's eighth circle of hell (which is where fraudsters go).
It also explains why scandals from people who produce fewer of them are blown out of proportion. When Hillary Clinton uses a private server for government business, she has to weather endless investigations, but when senior White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner do it, Democrats shrug because they're unsurprised, and Republicans attribute it to all manner of good-faith negligence (they're naive; they mean well; how can they be expected to know these things?). Conservatives accuse Joe Biden of allowing his son to grift his way through Ukraine as a beneficiary of nepotism, while Trump installs his daughter in the White House in an official capacity and his sons gleefully utilize the presidency to enhance the Trump Organization, all while pocketing millions of dollars from his golf courses.
In my day job, we create messaging for political candidates and conduct polls. Over and over, messages about Trump's corruption land with a thud. The reality is that voters have a hard time buying the idea that such misconduct affects them in any way at all. They might think it's unfair, but they also overwhelmingly think everything that happens in Washington is corrupt, and that all elites in politics and business are corrupted on some level. They view Trump as a data point on a continuum of corruption, not as an outlier. (Here the baseline is defined by perceptions of elites as a class: selfish cheaters who deceive nonelites all the time to get what they want.)
That appears to be changing incrementally with the impeachment inquiry. So many of Trump's recent misdeeds are wholly unprecedented - including soliciting help from foreign adversaries in damaging his political enemies, openly, publicly and live on television. It's hard not to notice them. A civic education process has begun: If most Americans didn't know that it's illegal to solicit foreign interference in an election, because the issue hadn't come up in their lifetimes, they're learning that now. We're primed as humans to register danger in terms of severity, magnitude and immediacy of threat, and Trump's impeachable offenses affect the whole country. The potential removal of a president has profound implications for all Americans.
In this case, it's important - for ourselves as individuals and for the sake of our democracy - to rethink our baseline expectations. Do we want a Trump presidency that is, to invoke a metaphor from the president's favorite and most expensive hobby, par for the course? Or do we want occupants of the Oval Office to respect its gravity, and to understand that they are public servants who exist to serve the office and not the other way around? Our expectations for Trump may be reasonable in the context of his historical behavior, but we cannot conflate our baseline for Trump with our baseline for the American presidency. They are not the same.

Women across the country get an unwanted surprise in the mail from Utah company: You’re pregnant! (They’re not.)

Texto completo: Chelcie Gette’s mother called her early Tuesday to tell her she had gotten something in the mail. The two went on FaceTime and opened it together. “It was a cute little card congratulating me for my soon-to-be baby,” Gette, 27, said.
There was one hiccup. “I knew I was not pregnant, so it was very confusing,” Gette said. “My mom thought this was my way of telling her I was pregnant!”
It’s likely that thousands of women across the country in their mid-20s to early 30s received such a package this week: correspondence from a stranger congratulating them on their pregnancy, along with several gift cards for baby products. Many of the women who received it, though, weren’t pregnant.
The card was purple and had a cartoon avocado with a heart over its pit. It read: “Holy guacamole! You’re going to avo baby!” Inside was what looked like a handwritten note, signed with a heart from “Jenny B.” It said: “Congratulations!!! I’m so excited for you! I hope you like these.” Included were a handful of coupons, five gift cards that amounted to $245 and a receipt proving their value.
Lena Ghamrawi, a 27-year-old lawyer who lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, said she opened her own card when she got home from work Wednesday. She is a policy counsel at Future of Privacy Forum, a think tank in Washington focused on issues of data privacy, and also is not pregnant. Thinking it may have been a gift from a friend who mistakenly thought she was pregnant, Ghamrawi began searching her phone contacts for a Jenny B.
“Once I ruled that out, I thought, ‘OK, maybe it’s a group that’s against Planned Parenthood that’s trolling people’ — because I did make a donation recently to them,” she said.
When she fell short, she searched on Google and quickly came across a Reddit thread in which dozens of women said they had received the same package. Many warned against using the gift cards — it was all an elaborate scheme, they said.
But the gift cards are real. So is Jenny B.
The letters were a flawed direct mail marketing campaign for Mothers Lounge, a wholesale mother and baby product distributor with several brands, based in Pleasant Grove, Utah. Its products range from baby slings to car seat covers, breast pads and baby leggings. Jenny Bosco and her husband, Kaleb Pierce, started the company in 2005, according to public records.
In a statement, Scott Anderson, director of marketing at Mothers Lounge, called the outreach “heartfelt.”
Why had these women received the mailings? “The qualified recipients for this mailer have, at one point, subscribed to an opt-in list for maternity deals and coupons through a third party marketing company,” Anderson said. “All information from third party companies is only used internally for Mothers Lounge and is not sold or used for anything else other than the direct marketing of Mothers Lounge.”
The initiative did not go over so well with some of the “qualified recipients.” Some women — the exact number who received the mailings is unknown — grew suspicious when they couldn’t find a return address. Additionally, many reported that when they tried calling the toll-free number on the cards, the line went unanswered.
And then there were the gifts themselves. “The gift card does ‘work,’ but you still owe a small amount for shipping,” Gette, a musician in Nashville, Tennessee, said. “You would have to enter your credit card number for that.”
This isn’t the first time the company has sent out these cards. In February, they set off enough alarm bells for the Surry County sheriff’s office in Virginia that it posted a “scam alert” on Facebook. But the next day, Capt. Jayson Crawley received a call from someone who said he was Ben Pierce from Mothers Lounge. Pierce told him the mailers were not fake but a “promotional advertisement.”
Gette said the marketing attempt was flawed in that it came off as “predatory.”
Although the advances in targeting of digital advertising allow marketers to better identify their audiences, such efforts are not always totally successful. Identifying nonpregnant women as pregnant seems about as unsuccessful as possible.
Eric Anderson, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said that for decades companies have shared and sold consumer data for these purposes.
“Any time you buy something, you are allowing your name to be shared,” Anderson said. “It’s a quid pro quo — they share your information out to the pool, and by doing that, they get to request names themselves.”
Based on purchases, a company can make an assumption of attributes and interests of the customer in order to better target their product. The Mothers Lounge’s technique was unusual and in bad judgment, Anderson said.
“Of all the things you can target things on, this is on the list of things you should probably avoid,” he said.
The Better Business Bureau has given the company an F rating, according to a spokeswoman, and has published a warning about the company’s promotional mailings.
Halen Hall-Chisler’s letter was sent to her parents’ house in Marietta, Ohio. Last year Hall-Chisler, who is 26, had an abortion. That caused a rift in her relationship with her mother.
Receiving the congratulatory package made her feel uncomfortable. “It was a little scary,” said Hall-Chisler, who works in a doughnut shop in Portland, Maine. “Especially in my circumstance, it was addressed to me with a name I don’t normally go by, and not a lot of people know that is my first name.”
Claire Jiang, 24, said she had received a frantic text from her father asking if she was pregnant. Embarrassed, Jiang, who is an architect in New York, emphatically denied the accusation.
But she was nonetheless confused as to why she would have been on the mailing list. The only explanation, she thought, was that she had purchased a baby gift for a friend last year. But even then, she was not living at her parents’ address at the time.
Not nearly ready to start a family, Jiang was perplexed that she was the target demographic. Her first reaction was to say to her father: “Can you just throw them away? I don’t want to think about this.”
“What this is is a deceptive marketing practice,” said Ghamrawi, who planned to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. “What this company is doing is assuming highly sensitive, personal information about me in a really intrusive way.”
The company risked sending the letters to women who were dealing with infertility or who had recently had a miscarriage. There was the possibility, Ghamrawi said, for all manner of unintended consequences, including family violence.
“If you think about the implications, it’s really irresponsible,” Ghamrawi said.

Texto completo: Carl Safina, 64, an ecologist at Stony Brook University on Long Island and a MacArthur “genius” grant winner, has written nine books about the human connection to the animal world. Coming next spring is “Becoming Wild,” on the culture of animals, and a young adult version of “Beyond Words,” on the capabilities of dogs and wolves.
We spoke over lunch in his Long Island garden, surrounded by his three dogs, some wild squirrels and a group of extremely tame hens. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.
Q: When a writer for the Sierra Club’s magazine recently put the words “animal” and “cognition” into Google Scholar, he was directed to almost 200,000 citations published in the past five years. Why the explosion of interest in this scientific area?
A: I think it’s happened because in recent years we’ve come to know much more about the inner activity of nonhuman minds.
We have tools today that didn’t exist 50 or even 10 years ago. There are researchers putting dogs into MRIs, and so it’s become possible to watch their brains do things. What we’re learning is that animals do have felt experiences and thus, I think, consciousness.
Q: What’s your definition of consciousness?
A: To me, consciousness is the thing that feels like something. It’s the sensation of experiencing the input from your sense organs. We’re learning that a lot of animals - dogs, elephants, other primates - have it.
Q: How else has research on animal behavior improved?
A: Well, until the 1950s and the 1960s, the study of animal behavior wasn’t seen as real science. Until Jane Goodall, Iain Douglas-Hamilton and George Schaller began publishing, there were few studies. They were among the first to watch wild animals for the purpose of describing their behavior. Before, if you wanted to study elephants, you shot them and pulled their molars out to see how old they were.
Thanks to these pioneers, we’ve learned that wild animals do complicated things. Many recognize the individuals around them - even solitary animals, like mountain lions. There usually is a male mountain lion with a large territory who visits a few females inhabiting the territory. The females all know each other. The adjacent males know who their neighbors are.
Who knew that dolphins could recognize each other after a long separation? Yet, scientists report that there was a dolphin in an aquarium who hadn’t seen another captive dolphin in 20 years. When they were reunited, there was immediate recognition.
Frans de Waal’s latest book, “Mama’s Last Hug,” chronicles the emotional deathbed reunion of an aged zoo chimpanzee and primatologist Jan van Hooff, who had worked with her for many years. Though Mama is listless, when van Hooff approaches her after a long separation, she recognizes him and reaches out to touch him.
Chimpanzees, dolphins, elephants - they’ve all demonstrated signs of recognizing individuals. Videos show that their recognition is not mechanical, not a chemical match with a stored memory bank. It is often accompanied by shows of emotion, which proves to me that the experience is felt.
Q: Has the internet widened our understanding of the animal world?
A: I’d say so. Almost everyone nowadays has a video camera on them all the time, and animal behaviors get recorded that we haven’t seen before. The other day, someone sent me a video where someone was backing up their car and a puppy went behind it. Another dog came streaking out at high speed, snatching the puppy away.
Thanks to the ubiquity of these videos, we’re seeing evidence that the envelope of what animals can do is much bigger than we thought. That leads me to wonder: Why, despite increasing evidence, do some people deny that animals have emotions or feel pain?
Q: What’s your guess?
A: I think it’s because it’s easier to hurt them if you think of them as dumb brutes. Not long ago, I was on a boat with some nice people who spear swordfish for a living. They sneak up to swordfish sleeping near the surface of the water and harpoon them, and then the fish just go crazy and kind of explode. When I asked, “Do the fish feel pain?” the answer was, “They don’t feel anything.”
Now, it’s been proven experimentally that fish feel pain. I think they feel, at least, panic. They clearly are not having a good time when they are hooked. But if you think of yourself as a good person, you don’t want to believe you’re causing suffering. It’s easier to believe that there’s no pain.
Q: As a child, did you have pets?
A: I did. I spent my first 10 years in Brooklyn, where I had the kind of pets you’d buy in a store - a parakeet, little turtles.
From the time I was 7, I had homing pigeons. I learned about life, with a capital “L,” from them. The pigeons figured out who they were going to mate with. They’d be out flying around during the day and they’d come home, feed their babies and go to sleep. Watching them go about their lives, you saw them do a lot of the things that humans do. It was there right in front of your eyes.
Then, I went to college, and I learned that my childhood observations were not allowed. They were “anthropomorphic.” But the more I see of the new neuroscience and neurochemistry, I see a lot of overlap. All of life is literally kin. I first learned that from my Brooklyn pigeons.
Q: You live with three dogs. What have you learned from them?
A: Among things, that they are capable of anticipation. For instance, they show much excitement when I simply touch my car keys, which might well signal that they are going to some place interesting, like the beach. That proves that they have imagination and even memory.
Another thing - and this shouldn’t surprise - they can be quite emotional. Some years ago, I lived with someone with a dog. Before we broke up, we argued a lot. Once, we took her dog to the beach, and we started bickering there. That dog just basically collapsed into a pile of leaves and would not get up. She did not want to be with us. And we weren’t even yelling at her. She just did not want to be a part of an unhappy scene.
That showed me that they can have a real-time valuation of their experiences. They know what they prefer to avoid.
Q: The psychologist who puts dogs into MRIs, Dr. Gregory Berns, wrote a book in 2013 titled “How Dogs Love Us.” Do you think your dogs do?
A: That’s easy. Yes. And I don’t need to scan their brain activity to know this. They show it in their actions and the choices they make. Our dogs sleep on the floor in our bedroom just to be near us.
We’ve never given them any treats in that room. The only thing they get for the effort of climbing the stairs is proximity to us. At dawn, two of the three jump on the bed. Jude, the third, has a knee problem, and he can’t. When we wake up, it’s always all tongues and tails and “Oh happy day!”
During the day, they roam free in the house and the yard. If I’m writing or working outside, they’re never more than a hundred feet from me. That’s their choice.
My point is that they seek us out just to be near us. And what is love’s fundamental emotion? It’s the desire to be near loved ones. So yes, dogs can love their humans.

Soon other relatives wanted his long-distance help. Khan began making short, lively videos to walk them through whatever concept was stumping them. He put them on YouTube, and before long, people who weren’t family members started tuning in to the minilessons.
Today, Khan Academy, a free educational website, attracts 19 million learners a month from Maine to Mongolia, including Hawaii. Based in Mountain View, Calif., the nonprofit has users in nearly every country in the world, accessing videos and curriculum in 40 languages. It was built with the help of 14,000 volunteers and is philanthropically funded, fueled by donations.
“It’s all not for profit, no one owns Khan Academy and it’s all for free,” the founder and CEO told local educators in a keynote speech at the recent Schools of the Future Conference at the Hawai‘i Convention Center. “It’s completely noncommercial. … Our mission is to cover all the core subjects, from pre-K all the way to college.”
The lessons at Khan Academy allow learners to work at their own pace with no stigma, he said. In classrooms, students might not master every skill on time, but teachers usually have to move instruction forward on a set schedule, leaving some kids with gaps in understanding.
“Those gaps accumulate,” Khan said, particularly in math. “A lot of kids hit a wall in algebra class. It’s not because they are not bright; it’s because of those little gaps.”
His cousin, for example, had convinced herself she was no good at math, but after a bit of targeted long-distance help, she moved from a remedial class to an advanced one in her New Orleans school.
In the early days, messages from grateful strangers who stumbled upon his videos gave Khan motivation to keep going with the project.
“I had a mother say both her sons had a learning disability, and because of this content they were able to keep up with their class,” he said. “She told me she and her family were praying for me every night.”
He decided to quit his day job to found Khan Academy in 2008, relying on his wife’s income. “Remember,” he said by way of explanation, “I was an analyst in a hedge fund — I was not used to people praying for me.”
More than 2,100 educators from across the state attended the Schools of the Future Conference, Oct. 3-4, which featured numerous speakers and about 150 breakout sessions. It was sponsored by the Hawaii Association of Independent Schools, Department of Education, Pillars of Peace Hawaii and Hawaii Society for Technology in Education.
Some attendees had heard of Khan Academy and used it with their students, while others were discovering it for the first time.
“There were points during his talk that I cried,” said Tracy Jones, a sixth grade teacher at August Ahrens School in Waipahu.“The kids were so excited about their learning. I had heard of Khan but never really explored it. At the first break I just jumped on there and signed up.”
Her colleague Janelle Bailey, who teaches first grade, agreed: “I was definitely inspired by his speech, and to see the different types of children that’s he’s reaching across the world is amazing.”
Children such as a girl from halfway across the world who posted a cheery video message that Khan showed conferees. “I am Zaya from Mongolia,” she said. “Your videos are so interesting and funny. Make more lessons.”
Khan said he assumed she was upper middle class since her English was quite good and she had internet access. But he found out otherwise.
“It turns out there was a group of volunteers from Cisco Systems who were using their vacation time to go to Mongolia and set up computer labs with internet in orphanages,” Khan said. “Zaya was one of those orphans.”
“What’s been even more incredible since then is that Zaya has graduated from high school and she’s become the top contributor to Khan Academy in the Mongolian language,” he said.
Khan Academy’s ultimate goal is to offer a “free, world-class education to anyone anywhere,” but rather than replacing teachers, it offers tools for students as well as educators, according to its founder.
“If students can get micro-tutorials in their own time and pace, it frees up the classroom to go deeper, for Socratic dialogue, to do peer-to-peer instruction,” he said.
Vice Principal William Olk of Central Middle School in downtown Honolulu said his school uses Khan Academy in algebra classes and for small-group instruction. Central’s principal, Anne Marie Murphy, asked Khan to consider adding some content in Chuukese.
“The majority of our children at our school are Micronesian and speak Chuukese,” Olk said. “He had not even heard of it, so he’s going to look into it, which is exciting.”
Today, major donors to Khan Academy include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, Bank of America, College Board and the Omidyar Fund. When Bill Gates’ representative first reached out to him, Khan recalls, “they were surprised that I was one guy operating out of my house.”
Today the Khan Academy team spans the globe.
“I get disproportionate credit for it,” Khan said. “We have over 200 full-time folks in our offices, a lot of current and ex-teachers, engineers, designers helping make this happen. We’ve had tens of thousands of teachers … helping us implement this, learning what works, what doesn’t work. There’s hundreds of thousands of people who’ve donated.”
One of his favorite success stories is a girl from Afghanistan named Sultana. When the Taliban took over her village, she was forbidden from going to school. Her brother gave her a computer with internet access, and she began learning English, then moved on to math and physics with help from Khan Academy.
She decided she wanted to become a physics researcher in the United States, and an online friend in Iowa advised her to take the SAT and try for a scholarship. But the exam isn’t offered in Afghanistan.
“She lies to her parents and smuggles herself across the border from Afghanistan to Pakistan, one of the most dangerous borders in the world, a 30-hour journey, just to take the SAT,” Khan recounted. “She does shockingly well for someone who frankly never had any formal schooling.”
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof spotlighted her case in a 2016 column that helped Sultana gain political asylum in the United States. She is now studying quantum computing but keeps a low profile because she fears for the safety of her family back home, Khan said.
“So if any of you have 16-year-olds who are complaining about having to get up on a Saturday morning,” he told teachers at the conference, “tell them this story.”

Texto completo: Mr. Maurer's wonky fascination with technology led to lamps he made out of scribbled memos, tea strainers and incandescent bulbs with feathered wings.
Ingo Maurer, a German lighting designer who was Promethean in his delivery of illumination -- fashioning lamps out of shattered crockery, scribbled memos, holograms, tea strainers and incandescent bulbs with feathered wings -- died on Monday in Munich. He was 87.
His death, at a hospital, was announced by his company, Ingo Maurer GmbH, which said the cause was complications of a surgical procedure.
Mr. Maurer had a wonky fascination with technology that took nothing away from his reputation as a poet of light, as he was often described.
His first lamp, designed in 1966, was a large crystal bulb enclosing a smaller one. Called simply "Bulb" (his product names would become more fanciful), it won praise from the designer Charles Eames and in 1968 became part of the Museum of Modern Art's collection in New York.
For "YaYaHo," which he made in 1984, he fashioned a lamp in the form of parallel low-voltage wires draped with shaded halogen bulbs that dangled like jewelry. In 2001 he made an early desk lamp using LEDs ("EL.E.DEE") then later attached LEDs to wallpaper in a pattern that resembled twinkling rosettes ("Rose, Rose on the Wall"). In 2005 he embedded wafer-like organic LEDs in glass tabletops, creating starry clusters with no visible connections. In 2012, he collaborated with Moritz Waldemeyer, another German designer, to produce a narrow table lamp with 256 LEDs simulating flickering candlelight ("My New Flame").
"He loved the technology that was coming out, but to him it was like Houdini," said his longtime friend Kim Hastreiter, the co-founder of Paper magazine. "He used the technology in his lamps like a magic trick."
Even so, Mr. Maurer never renounced the old-fashioned incandescent light bulb, with its golden hue and emotional power.
With "Lucellino," he attached goose-feather wings and suspended the bulb like a hovering Cupid, and with "Wo bist du, Edison ... ?" ("Where are you, Edison?") he reinvented it as a hologram projected on a shade.
But while the materials he used for his lamps made them artful and cheeky, Mr. Maurer professed to be more interested in the medium of light itself.
"I'm very lucky to work with the material which does not exist," he said in 2017 on a podcast produced by the design retailer Arkitektura. He couldn't take light in his hand and bend it and look at it from different sides, he explained; light is not a thing, he said, but "the spirit which catches you inside."
Ingo Raphael Maurer was born on May 12, 1932, to Theodor and Henny (Boeckmann) Maurer on Reichenau, an island in Lake Constance, in southern Germany near the Swiss border. His father, a fisherman and inventor, died when Ingo was 15, and his brother, the eldest of his four siblings, ordered him to leave school and find work. He could apprentice, he was told, either as a butcher or as a typographer at a local newspaper.
He chose the newspaper. Though it wasn't an obvious career path for a lighting designer, he would later point out the lessons taught by the airy gaps between letter forms. The sparkling water of Lake Constance had also been a mesmerizing influence on him, he said.
Mr. Maurer traveled to the United States in 1960, settling in San Francisco with his German girlfriend, Dorothee Becker, and working as a graphic designer. He was there for three years, soaking up Pop Art inspirations that resurfaced throughout his career.
Returning to Munich as a newlywed, he founded a company called Design M to produce his Bulb lamp, as well as a wall storage unit called Wall-All invented by Ms. Becker. (It is currently sold by Vitra under the name Uten.Silo.) The couple divorced in the mid-1970s.
His company, now known as Ingo Maurer GmbH, eventually expanded to include 70 employees and took on all of its own manufacturing locally. It also executed ambitious civic and private commissions.
Mr. Maurer is survived by his daughters, Sarah Utermoehlen and Claude Maurer, the company's managing director; and four grandchildren. Mr. Maurer's second wife, Jenny Lau, died of cancer in 2014.
A handsome man with a square jaw and flowing hair that turned paper white in his last decades, Mr. Maurer had a great deal of charisma, which helped propel him through hard economic times.
"The Italians even thought he was Italian," said Mariangela Viterbo, the head of a public relations firm in Milan, who met him in the late 1960s when he presented Bulb at a trade show in Turin. "In that period the big vision of modern design was Danish or Finnish. Ingo came with something more similar to our temperament -- more ironic, more joyful. It made a difference."
A crowning moment of disruption occurred at the 1994 Euroluce lighting fair in Milan, where Mr. Maurer introduced a chandelier made of suspended porcelain dish shards. The fixture was initially called "Zabriskie Point," after the Michelangelo Antonioni film, which has a scene of a house exploding in slow-motion. At least one startled Italian visitor to the fair exclaimed, "Porca miseria!," a phrase that translates roughly as "Dammit!" Mr. Maurer decided that he preferred that name for the chandelier.
Several Porca miserias! are still made, by hand, each year, but Mr. Maurer was never comfortable with the high price tag, upward of 30,000 pounds (about $ 38,000), as quoted by at least one website. He donated some of the profits to a family he once met in Aswan, Egypt.
Not everyone was charmed by his antic designs. Reviewing a 2007 retrospective of Mr. Maurer's work at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in Manhattan, Ken Johnson wrote in The New York Times, "While some of his pieces are lovely to look at, his work in general is so precious and so busily eager to please that it will make you pine for the reproving austerity of the fluorescent-light Minimalist Dan Flavin."
Paola Antonelli, the senior design curator at the Museum of Modern Art, disagreed.
"I've never seen anyone experiment with such abandon," she said, "and experimentation is the opposite of wanting to please."
Ms. Antonelli provided Mr. Maurer with a showcase in 1998, when she included his lamps in a design exhibition, and hung "Porca Miseria!" in the current MoMA exhibition called "Energy."
She said that at one of his design events, Mr. Maurer handed out paper 3-D glasses that created a vision of little hearts when the viewer looked toward the light.
"That was so him," she said of his whimsy. "In a pair of throwaway glasses."
Ingo Maurer, top right in 1998, created artful lamps out of cheeky materials, including, clockwise from Mr. Maurer, aluminum domes in a Munich train station; goose-feather wings in "Lucellino" (1992); porcelain dish shards in "Porca miseria!" (1994); and halogen bulbs dangling like jewelry in "YaYaHo" (1984). (PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRED R.

Chris Cuomo spreads myth that Ukraine whistleblower's identity is protected by law

Texto completo: Add CNN’s Chris Cuomo to the list of Democrats and media liberals perpetuating the myth that there’s a law somewhere granting anonymity to government whistleblowers.
No such law exists. Yet Cuomo, who claims to have completed law school, looked so uncomfortable on his show Thursday night as he tried to invent one.
“The reason you protect the whistleblower is because there is a law that protects whistleblowers from whatever it is that they reasonably have a fear of,” he said, making up a policy on the spot. “That’s why we protect their name.”
He admitted that he had personally “heard names, one specifically, about who this is supposed to be,” referring to the career government employee who has set off an impeachment inquiry over President Trump’s phone call with the president of Ukraine. But, Cuomo said, he wouldn’t divulge the name “because I respect the law.”
Cuomo may respect the law, but what about the intelligence of his viewers? It must have been obvious to them that he was trying to pull one over.
If there’s a law that forbids Cuomo from naming a “whistleblower,” shouldn’t CNN tell us which one it is? Perhaps he could even put up one of those sassy “fact check” graphics that explains it.
But no, they didn’t do that, because the statement is false. There is no such law.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York promulgated the same fiction earlier this week, writing to the intelligence community to say, in part, that “the whistleblower anonymity is protected by law.”
No, it’s not. The Whistleblower Protection Act and the follow-up law that enhanced it do nothing more than shield a federal employee from demotion, termination, or disciplinary action by superiors if he discloses information about waste and abuse or a violation of law within the government. There is no guarantee of anonymity.
The law does mandate that the inspector general of any agency where a complaint is filed not disclose the person’s identity, but that does not apply to anyone else, let alone journalists in the business of uncovering and reporting government secrets.
If the anonymity of the “whistleblower” is “protected by law,” there are a few people at the New York Times who should be in jail right now. Four of the paper’s journalists authored the first story to break details about who the career government employee is. The editor, Dean Baquet, subsequently defended the decision to report the information about him, which means he knows who it is too.
Why haven’t any of them been prosecuted for knowing the identity of this guy? Why aren't their sources for the information being investigated and prosecuted? Easy! It is because there’s no law that says the public doesn't get to know his name!
Literally, the only reason we don’t know his name is because it’s being hidden, in large part by the national media. (The Washington Examiner’s editorial position is that the public has a right to know this person’s identity.)
It looks like Chris Cuomo, just like many journalists in Washington, knows who the “whistleblower” is. If he doesn’t want to tell us the identity, that’s fine. But there’s no law preventing him from doing so.

Texto completo: The New Jersey attorney general sent a letter to President Trump's club in Colts Neck giving it 30 days to contest being stripped of its liquor license.
New Jersey officials are moving to revoke the liquor license at one of President Trump's golf clubs, which they say continued to serve a man who was already intoxicated and got into a fatal car crash shortly after leaving the club in 2015.
If successful, the move, first reported by The Washington Post, would be a financially damaging blow to the club, in Colts Neck, depriving it of the ability to meet the needs of thirsty golfers coming off the course and wedding parties eager to celebrate into the night.
The potential punishment is described in an Oct. 21 letter sent to the golf club by the office of the New Jersey attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, who was appointed to the position last year by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat.
The letter gives the golf club 30 days to contest the move. If the license is ultimately revoked by the state, the decision could be challenged in court or the club could seek to have it reinstated in two years.
A representative of the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.
The club in Colts Neck, near the Jersey Shore, is one of three in New Jersey that Mr. Trump owns. The ability of the others, in Bedminster and Pine Hill, to sell alcohol could also be threatened by the state's action. Under New Jersey law, the holder of a liquor license that is revoked must relinquish any others it controls for two years.
Liquor sales are a crucial revenue source for many golf clubs, said Jay Karen, the chief executive of the National Golf Course Owners Association.
"Golf is a combination of sport and leisure," Mr. Karen said. "And alcohol finds itself at the crossroads of that."
"Just the golf itself is not a high-profit-margin business," he added. That, he said, means alcohol sales become "pretty important to the whole operation from a profit standpoint."
Though he did not refer specifically to the Colts Neck club, which bills itself as a premier destination for weddings and other events, Mr. Karen said that clubs like it could be hit especially hard by the loss of a liquor license.
A notice of charges attached to Mr. Grewal's letter says the action was prompted by two infractions committed by the club on Aug. 30, 2015: serving liquor other than beer from carts out on the course -- in violation of the club's license -- and by serving liquor to the man, Andrew Halder, who already appeared to be intoxicated.
The two infractions together might typically result in a 25-day suspension of the club's license, says the notice, from the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control.
"However, due to the aggravating circumstances in this case, the division will seek revocation of the license based upon the total circumstances," the notice says. It does not elaborate on those circumstances, and a spokeswoman for Mr. Grewal declined further comment.
Shortly after leaving "a local golf club" on that date, Mr. Halder, of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., flipped his car on a highway ramp several miles from the Trump club, according to local news reports.
The car rolled over, and Mr. Halder's father, Gary, a passenger, was tossed out. The elder Mr. Halder later died at a hospital, news reports said.
Law enforcement authorities said at the time that Mr. Halder's blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit when the accident happened, according to news reports. He was charged with vehicular homicide and driving while intoxicated.
Mr. Halder pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide in January 2018, according to a court document. He was sentenced to three years' probation in April 2018. Mitchell Ansell, the lawyer who represented him at the sentencing, did not return a call seeking comment.
Mr. Trump bought the Colts Neck club, previously known as Shadow Isles, in 2008 for a reported $ 28 million. According to his most recent financial disclosure, he took out a mortgage from Amboy Bank, which is based in Old Bridge, N.J., that he is still paying off.
Mr. Trump's latest financial disclosure shows that the club had about $ 6.76 million in revenue last year, about 5 percent less than it took in the previous year.

Texto completo: The No. 2 Pentagon official told Ms. Cooper, the military's Russia-Ukraine expert, not to talk to Congress. She did anyway.
WASHINGTON -- The White House has declared that the executive branch will not cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry, but some officials have nevertheless provided testimony to Congress about what they know about whether President Trump's attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating his political rivals were a quid pro quo in return for aid.
One such witness, Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official, received a warning letter that shows how the administration has attempted to persuade officials to keep silent. Ms. Cooper appeared before impeachment investigators on Wednesday during a closed-door session that was delayed by Republican lawmakers who burst into the House Intelligence Committee's secure suite to protest the inquiry.
Below is a copy of the letter Ms. Cooper received, obtained and annotated with context and analysis by The New York Times.

DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
1010 DEFENSE PENTAGON
WASHINGTON, DC 20301-1010
OCT 22 2019
The date stamp shows that the deputy secretary of defense, David L. Norquist, sent this warning letter on Tuesday, the day before Ms. Cooper was scheduled to give voluntary, private testimony. That same day, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, signed a subpoena stating that Ms. Cooper was legally required to appear.
Daniel Levin
White & Case LLP
701 Thirteenth Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005-3807
Daniel Levin, Ms. Cooper's lawyer, is a former federal prosecutor who held senior positions in both Bush administrations. He served as chief of staff to William P. Barr in his first stint as attorney general in the George Bush administration, and in several roles in the George W. Bush administration, including as chief of staff to Robert S. Mueller III, then the director of the F.B.I., and as the acting head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
Dear Mr. Levin:
I understand that you have been retained by Ms. Laura Cooper, the Department's Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, as her private counsel for a deposition to be conducted jointly by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform, "[p]ursuant to the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry." The Department's October 15, 2019 letter to the Chairs of the three House Committees [Tab A] expressed its belief that the customary process of oversight and accommodation has historically served the interests of congressional oversight committees and the Department well. The Committees' purported "impeachment inquiry," however, presents at least two issues of great importance.
Ms. Cooper is a senior specialist in Russia-related issues for the Pentagon. A career official, she was one of many who tried to get the Trump administration to release a large package of American military aid to Ukraine, which Congress had appropriated to help the country resist Russian aggression. That aid package is at the heart of the Ukraine affair.
The first issue is the Committees' continued, blanket refusal to allow Department Counsel to be present at depositions of Department employees. Department Counsel's participation protects against the improper release of privileged or classified information, particularly material covered by the executive privilege which is the President's alone to assert and to waive. Excluding Department Counsel places the witness in the untenable position of having to decide whether to answer the Committees' questions or to assert Executive Branch confidentiality interests without an attorney from the Executive Branch present to advise on those interests.
This is part of a recurring separation of powers dispute. The House has said that because the Constitution permits it to set its own rules and gives it broad oversight and impeachment powers, it can lawfully exclude an executive branch lawyer who might otherwise instruct witnesses not to answer questions about matters that might be subject to executive privilege.
It violates settled practice and may jeopardize future accommodation. Furthermore, the Department of Justice has concluded that "congressional subpoenas that purport to require agency employees to appear without agency counsel are legally invalid and are not subject to civil or criminal enforcement." See Attempted Exclusion of Agency Counsel from Congressional Depositions of Agency Employees, 43 Op. O.L.C. (May 23, 2019) [Tab B].
Steven A. Engel, a Trump political appointee who heads the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, produced a memo in May asserting that congressional subpoenas to government officials for testimony without an administration lawyer present are invalid. That theory provides a legal shield for officials who have been subpoenaed but do not want to testify because it means that the Justice Department will not prosecute them for criminal contempt of Congress. Congressional lawyers contest this interpretation of the law. But even if it is accurate, it would not, by itself, stop an official from voluntarily choosing to comply.
The second issue is the absence of authority for the Committees to conduct an impeachment inquiry. In its October 15, 2019 letter, the Department conveyed concerns about the Committees' lack of authority to initiate an impeachment inquiry given the absence of a delegation of such authority by House Rule or Resolution. This correspondence echoed an October 8, 2019 letter from the White House Counsel [Tab C] expressing the President's view that the inquiry was "contrary to the Constitution of the United States and all past bipartisan precedent" and "violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process."
The full House chamber has not voted for a resolution authorizing an impeachment inquiry, as it did at the start of the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts in 1974 and 1998. Mr. Trump's legal team point to the lack of a vote as a sign that the process is a sham. House Democrats say nothing in the Constitution or House Rules requires such a resolution, and note that impeachments of other federal officials, like judges, have not started with a resolution.
This letter informs you and Ms. Cooper of the Administration-wide direction that Executive Branch personnel "cannot participate in [the impeachment] inquiry under these circumstances" [Tab C]. In the event that the Committees issue a subpoena to compel Ms. Cooper's appearance, you should be aware that the Supreme Court has held, in United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41 (1953), that a person cannot be sanctioned for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena unauthorized by House Rule or Resolution.
This is the key question. The White House has ordered executive branch officials not to give documents or testimony to Congress "under these circumstances," and Ms. Cooper was pointedly reminded of that fact before she received a subpoena. After receiving one, she went on to testify to the committee anyway -- as have several State Department employees. The letter leaves ambiguous whether such actions would be insubordinate, or whether a subpoena changes the relevant circumstances.
As yet, none of the witnesses who are current federal employees have been fired. Notably, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, forbids interfering with or denying federal employees a right to furnish information to lawmakers.
To reiterate, the Department respects the oversight role of Congress and stands ready to work with the Committees should there be an appropriate resolution of outstanding legal issues. Any such resolution would have to consider the constitutional prerogatives and confidentiality interests of the co-equal Executive Branch, see Tab D, and ensure fundamental fairness to any Executive Branch employees involved in this process, including Ms. Cooper.
Sincerely,
[signed]
David L. Norquist

Texto completo: Writers, directors and other creators share recommendations for how to spend the scariest night of the year.
You'd think that Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, would have plenty of advice on how to spend Halloween. After all, she's made a career out of highlighting the spooky and macabre.
But think again. "I haven't done anything but work on Halloween for the last 38 years, except when I had a baby in 1994," she said recently while preparing for appearances this weekend at the Chiller Theater convention in Parsippany, N.J. "When people ask me what I'd like to do, I'm like: anything but work!"
Fortunately, I found some others with horror in their bones to share recommendations on how to spend the scariest night of the year. The responses have been condensed and edited.
Paul Tremblay
Author, 'Growing Things and Other Stories'
Halloween is a time when I dip into short stories. I'd pair two of my favorite modern collections with classic collections.
"Things We Lost in the Fire" by Mariana Enriquez, an Argentine writer, reminds me of Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery and Other Stories." Enriquez's stories are haunting and disturbing and play with ambiguity. But they also mine sociopolitical and gender anxieties like Jackson did. Enriquez's "The Dirty Kid" is one of the most disturbing stories I've read in a while.
Nathan Ballingrud's "Wounds: Six Stories From the Border of Hell" is a perfect match with Clive Barker's "Books of Blood." Both collections really stretch the boundaries of the genre by employing these grand, horrific worlds. Nathan's story "The Butcher's Table" reminds me of the first time I read Barker's "In the Hills, the Cities." It's horrifying, but there's beauty.
Chelsea Stardust
Director, 'Satanic Panic'
Starting Oct. 1, I watch a horror movie every day. On Oct. 31, I close out the season with a small group of friends who are die-hard fans of Halloween. We watch classic Halloween-themed cartoons like "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." Then we put on John Carpenter's masterpiece, "Halloween," followed by the underrated gem "Halloween III: Season of the Witch."
Travis Stevens
Director, 'Girl on the Third Floor'
I'd check out the Dakota building where parts of "Rosemary's Baby" were filmed. It was a rare horror film that represented New York at its most sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing rather than grimy. Seeing some of those creepy details up close would be a lot of fun.
Caryn Coleman
Director of Programming and Special Projects, Nitehawk Cinema
Even though I'm a die-hard horror film fan, dressing up for Halloween has never been my thing. I've always preferred to spend this sacred holiday in a dark room watching scary movies -- until I had a kid. Now, the best thing to do for Halloween is take my 5-year-old trick-or-treating on the best street in Greenpoint: Milton Street. The houses go all out with their decorations, and it has that old-school feel of actually walking up to get the candy. It's packed, fun and amazing each year.
Frank Sabatella
Director, 'The Shed'
I recommend a trip to the village of Sleepy Hollow in Tarrytown, N.Y. Not only is the village itself beautiful this time of year, but it embraces the spirit of Halloween and Washington Irving's legend.
I like to start my day at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery and the Old Dutch Church. It's a beautiful and historic cemetery with gorgeous tombs, headstones and mausoleums. With twisted trees and spooky statues everywhere, it looks like something out of a classic horror movie. During the day you can grab a cup of hot apple cider or a cold seasonal beer right inside the cemetery and wander the winding paths and hills. In the evening there's a haunted lantern tour through the cemetery, which I highly recommend.
As the sun sets, it's imperative that you visit the Horseman's Hollow at Philipsburg Manor. It's a walking tour through a 300-year-old Dutch village that's now haunted by the headless horseman. It's the most frightening and artfully done haunted house experience around.
Boulet Brothers
Producers and hosts, 'Dragula'
We're huge fans of hosting classic homemade Halloween house parties. You can make anything look scary with the right string of lights and lit-up jack-o'-lanterns scattered about. Paper decorations and string are easy to make, and they will give your house a vintage 1950s aesthetic. Just hand draw skulls or witch hats out with crayons on brown packing paper, cut them out and glue them to coarse string and hang them around. Orange string lights make great additions to any décor too, not to mention as many candles as you can scare up.
As far as food, a favorite in our house is a beef stew that is slow baked inside a basketball-size pumpkin. Getting some apple cider and heating it up on the stove will make the place smell great, and you can serve it with rum, butter and apple slices.
Alice Waddington
Director, 'Paradise Hills'
For a fun night for us introverts who do not want to go trick-or-treating, I highly recommend bingeing Barbara Steele's Gothic horror filmography. Queen of Italian giallo terrors, she starred in classics such as the witchcraft film "Black Sunday" and the Edgar Allan Poe anthology "Castle of Blood." She mothered iconic unhinged villains, like the green-horned succubus in "Curse of the Crimson Altar."
Adam Egypt Mortimer
Director, 'Daniel Isn't Real'
If you've ever wanted to try your hand at conjuring, Halloween is the night to jump in. When I lived in New York, my friend Pat and I painted a magic circle on our roof on 131st Street, put on black robes and built an altar. Here's what you do: walk around the circle, pausing every few steps to chant the name of an entity (Satan or Cthulhu would work). After about 10-20 minutes of this, make a loud, clear and simple request from the spirit world.
Patrick Lussier
Director, 'Trick'
Halloween is one of the few times I get my wife to watch scary movies. We'll sit and watch three of them while waiting for the doorbell to ring. This year we're going to watch "The Hitcher," the 1986 movie with Rutger Hauer. It was one of his greatest movies. It's this twisted story of a father-son relationship, and about the importance of being able to destroy the older version of yourself in order to become the man you were meant to be. It's also something rare: a scary movie that's shot mostly in sunshine.
Grady Hendrix
Author, 'We Sold Our Souls'
Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn is doing this thing called Nightfall on Oct. 25 and 26, in which all these performers and groups -- Morbid Anatomy, Death of Classical -- are doing performances throughout the cemetery. You walk around and see all these amazing visuals too. I love that Green-Wood is working hard to make cemeteries fun again, a place to hang out. This city forgets its history quickly, so it will be nice to host a performance art séance for the dead and the living.
Jason DeVan
Director, 'Along Came the Devil 2'
In our family we have three boys that are 12, 17 and 19. When I was a kid, we loved watching those half-hour Halloween specials with Garfield and Fat Albert. You can watch a few of them now on YouTube and Amazon Prime. We even love the Halloween episode of "Happy Days," where Richie Cunningham goes to a haunted house.
Paul Smithyman
Production designer, 'I Can't See' (an immersive theatrical experience)
There's a Halloween street every year on 69th Street between Broadway and Central Park West. The 69th Street Block Association does it, and it's pretty amazing. I have a 4-year-old named Georgie, who wants to be a bush for Halloween. That's my new Halloween experience that will take my time in the next few weeks: Turn my daughter into a bush.

'Broad City' Creator Talks About Ending Show

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
ABBI AND ILANA are two young Jewish women.
They're best friends, living in New York City and going on wacky adventures. One day, they might take up a sketchy Craigslist ad to make quick cash. Another, they may run into trouble on a free "Birthmark" trip to Israel.
That's the premise of "Broad City," a Comedy Central series that finished its last season earlier this year. And the two women at the heart of it are Abbi Jacobson and liana Glazer, its stars and creators.
Jacobson, who grew up in Wayne (one episode has the two women visit the Philadelphia suburb), was in town for the B. Phi Innovation Fest, which aims to bolster Philadelphia's reputation as an innovative city. Speaking to a sold-out audience on Oct. 15, Jacobson talked about what she's working on now and the show that launched her career.
"The character that she plays in the show has these high lofty goals, well made out plans, and she can never complete them," said Andrea Helfrich, Philadelphia Flyers in-arena host and digital content producer, who interviewed Jacobson. "But if you think that art imitates reality, think again."
No one could describe Jacobson as not accomplishing her goals. Besides her work on "Broad City," she is the author of The New York Times bestseller "I Might Regret This: Essays, Drawings, Vulnerabilities, and Other Stuif," as well as the creator of two coloring books., "Color This Book: New York City" and "Color This Book: San Francisco." She is also the illustrator of "Carry This Book." Jacobson is now working to produce an Amazon series, "A League of Their Own," a modern take on the 1992 film.
After taking a moment to reminisce about Wawa, Jacobson and Helfrich talked about how "Broad City" got its start.
Jacobson met Glazer at an Upright Citizens Brigade improv class. Both were struggling to get the jobs they wanted, so they decided to start a web series, Jacobson said.
Agrande esta imagen.

They called it "Broad City."
Though each episode is much shorter, the web series had a similar style of humor as the television show, with a focus on the two women's back-and-forth conversation and their dayto-day dealings with life in the Big Apple. (Many of the web episodes are no longer online, Jacobson said, because they used copyrighted music and would have been sued.)
They thought the web series might lead them to jobs as writers, but Comedy Central wound up buying the show. Jacobson and Glazer were now writing, starring in and editing their own television series.
"Both of us, when we started, the intention was funny first," Jacobson said. "The things we find about ourselves and our friendship, what we find hilarious, let's heighten it, always. Let's amplify how you feel about interactions with the city, with yourself and push it further for the comedy. That has always been there, but the further we went along, the more we wanted the characters to grow and reflect things that we were going through and comment on stuff we thought was important or bulls- or frustrating."
Between the web series and the Comedy Central series, the women spent about a decade working on "Broad City." So they were glad they were able to end it on their own terms with an episode airing in March.
After years of the characters having fun in New York City, they grow up and move on to the next stages of their lives. Jacobson's character moves to Boulder, Colorado, to pursue an artist's residency program. Glazer's character goes to graduate school to become a therapist. The finale has the two friends saying goodbye to each other, but it was also a meta experience, Jacobson said. It served as a send-off for the show and the cast and crews' time together.
"Would you ever bring it back?" Helfrich asked. "We, like, just ended, so," Jacobson said, trailing off, to audience laughter.
"Is it too soon?" Helfrich said.
"We have a joke about us being old, doing it, which would be so fun," Jacobson said. "The team and acting with liana, that's the thing I'm going to miss the most. I still have liana. We still hang out all the time. We work together, but acting with her, it's so easy, and those characters are so fun, but we need to step away from it. That's the reason we ended it." *

Congress braces for protracted impeachment fight

Texto completo: Democrats and Republicans are preparing for an impeachment battle that could dominate Congress for months and drag on into the new year.
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been struggling to determine the timing for the impeachment process and how it will affect critical legislative deadlines, including must-pass federal spending bills.
House Democrats launched proceedings on Sept. 24 with orders from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to move "expeditiously."
But more than a month later, Democrats have yet to produce a timeline for when they plan to conclude the investigation and have not even scheduled public hearings, which are expected to precede a House floor vote on impeachment articles.
An earlier prediction by some Democrats that the inquiry could wrap up by October has now been abandoned. Democratic leaders won't even commit to wrapping up by Thanksgiving, or anytime in 2019.
"There is a desire to do it expeditiously," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters in the Capitol last week. "Whether that's the end of the year or not, we don't know."
The uncertainty has left both parties nervous about the practical and political implications of a drawn-out impeachment fight.
The most pressing legislative problem is impeachment's potential clash with the November spending deadline.
A temporary spending bill keeping the government funded will expire on Nov. 21, and the two parties are nowhere near reaching a long-term deal on fiscal 2020 spending, in part because of the impeachment battle, which has further aggravated the partisan divide.
Democrats and Republicans now conclude it's more likely Congress will be forced to send President Trump another stopgap measure, which is both wasteful to the taxpayer and harmful to government agencies, particularly the military.
"I think we are going to end up with one," Sen. John Kennedy told the Washington Examiner when asked about the prospect of Congress having to approve another stopgap bill. "Because, given the partisan atmosphere, I don't see how anything is going to pass."
So far, the impeachment proceedings have taken place mostly in closed session in a secure hearing room in the basement of the Capitol.
House Intelligence Committee Democrats who are running the inquiry have over the past month summoned a string of former and current Trump administration officials into a secure hearing room and, along with Republicans, questioned each for nine hours or more.
Lawmakers in both parties from three committees are participating in the questioning.
Democrats are attempting to build a case that shows Trump tried to win Ukraine's help investigating Democrats by withholding critical security aid.
Trump denies any quid pro quo was involved in his request, while Republicans have declared the Democratic impeachment proceedings to be "illegitimate" and unfair to the president.
Democrats told the Washington Examiner they are moving cautiously through the inquiry to ensure they build a solid case the public can trust.
"I hated the impeachment of Bill Clinton," Rep. Donna Shalala, who served as Clinton's secretary of health and human services, said. "I thought it was totally political. But we learned from that. And that is why we are being so careful now."
But public support for impeachment, which had climbed slightly in recent weeks, is showing signs of waning, particularly among those critical to maintaining the Democratic majority in the 2020 election.
A New York Times/Sienna College voter survey conducted Oct. 13 to Oct. 20 found 53% of battleground state voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Arizona opposed impeachment and removal of Trump, compared to the 43% who supported it.
Democrats may be caught grinding through an investigation the public opposes just as the critical campaign season heats up.
That may ultimately be good news for the GOP and will motivate them not to rush through the process when impeachment articles reach the Senate, which will hold a trial.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hinted last week he won't take any steps to try to speed up a trial and that the process would be under the control of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
The Senate conducted a two-month trial before acquitting Clinton of obstruction of justice and perjury on Feb. 12, 1999.
"I have no idea how long this will go on," McConnell said. "What I can tell you for sure is if the House impeaches, we will be on it. It will displace everything else and will be on it until we finish."

Texto completo: Time to vote for the Worst Trump Cabinet Member.
Not Rudy Giuliani! He’s personal lawyer. And best friend. And, yeah, raving maniac. But we’re going to stick to people who are running the federal government.
At least in theory.
One top contender has to be Attorney General William Barr. When Americans make a list of things they’d like the nation’s foremost law enforcement authority to do, how many do you think would start with, “Travel around the world seeking to discredit the Mueller investigation.”
But wait! What about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo? He’s the one who fired a much-respected ambassador to Ukraine. And was listening in on the fabled Trump-Ukraine phone call. Career State Department officials are reportedly miserable working under him. But then that’s true of so very, very many parts of our current government — “drain the swamp” is Trump code for “torture the people who actually have to do the work.”
Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is on a mission to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
He’s also the one who blurted out “We do that all the time” when asked if there was a quid pro quo between aid to Ukraine and getting dirt on Democrats. Then he tried to retreat. (“That’s what people are saying that I said but I didn’t say that.”)
Ineptitude is an important consideration here. There are lots of Cabinet members who would cause immeasurable harm if they weren’t so incompetent. (This is the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos contingent.) Consider Ben Carson, our secretary of housing and urban development, who was asked at a congressional hearing about REOs — a well-known HUD acronym for foreclosed properties — and appeared to think the questioner was talking about cookies.
Trump Cabinet-watching is much more exciting than it would be in a normal administration, where, say, the secretary of labor did not have to be tossed out of office for a role in the Jeffrey Epstein sex scandal. (Alex Acosta, we hardly knew ye.)
You’d probably be able to name the whole Cabinet now if it wasn’t for the rapid-fire turnover. We’ve been through four different heads of the Department of Homeland Security. And three in charge of the Department of Defense. Beginning, of course, with retired general Jim Mattis, who said recently that while he earned his spurs on the battlefield, “Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.”
It’s been pretty much downhill since. The current secretary of defense is Mark Esper, a former lobbyist for a defense contractor. Who the president referred to in a recent tweet as “Mark Esperanto.”
I’m sure the president isn’t the only one who doesn’t remember all their names. When the Cabinet meets, there are probably a lot of comments like, “I agree with … that guy over there with the green tie.”
But back to our contenders: Anybody having anything whatsoever to do with the environment is a good worst candidate in this White House. Former winner Environmental Protection Agency Chief Scott Pruitt has slunk away; remember the time he tried to use his influence to get his wife a Chick-fil-A franchise? His deputy, Andrew Wheeler, is now the top guy.
Wheeler used to be a lobbyist for energy companies, and he seems determined to weaken car emissions limits even when the car manufacturers want to keep them. His critics say that if he can’t get rid of environmental protection laws he doesn’t like, he simply stops enforcing them.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt has replaced the dreaded Ryan Zinke, another former worst contender. Previously Bernhardt was — yes! — Zinke’s top deputy and before that — yes! yes! — a lobbyist for energy companies. One who had so many potential conflicts of interest, he had to carry around a card listing all of them.
So, tough luck, endangered species. Bernhardt hates it when you get in the way of fuel extraction. But you have to admit he’s making history. Bernhardt is the first interior secretary to be under investigation by the department’s inspector general since his first day on the job.
And Wilbur’s back! Last season’s winner, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr., is most definitely looking for a repeat. We are thinking here of his threats to fire officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for reassuring Alabamians that a hurricane was not headed their way no matter what crazy maps a certain chief executive drew with his Sharpie.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao doesn’t seem to be doing much on national infrastructure. But she’s been very energetic when it comes to boosting her family’s shipping company and squeezing extra grants for Kentucky, which happens to be the state represented by her husband, Sen. Mitch McConnell.
And what about Energy Secretary Rick Perry? He was one of three Trump officials who seem to have been running the Ukraine policy, which would be bad enough even if the trio had not been calling themselves “the three amigos.” On the other hand, he’s resigning, and Trump does seem to be trying to blame him for everything.
What’s Perry’s bottom line? “Let’s face it — he’s not the brightest light,” said Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution.
Well, he seems to be a better dancer than Sean Spicer …

Texto completo: El Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) ha cambiado la revisión que realiza de la pesquisa sobre posible interferencia rusa en las elecciones de Estados Unidos a una investigación formal penal.
La revisión que el Fiscal General William Barr ordenó sobre los orígenes de la investigación sobre posibles vínculos entre la campaña de Trump de 2016 y Rusia ahora se ha convertido en una investigación criminal, dijo a POLITICO una fuente familiarizada con el asunto.
La investigación, realizada por el fiscal estadounidense de Connecticut, John Durham , se inició como un esfuerzo de Barr por responder preguntas no especificadas que tenía sobre por qué el FBI comenzó la investigación de contrainteligencia que finalmente llevó al nombramiento del asesor especial Robert Mueller.
Sin embargo, la escalada de la investigación de Barr de una revisión administrativa a un asunto penal significa que los actuales y antiguos funcionarios del FBI y del Departamento de Justicia enfrentan la posibilidad de cargos criminales, derivados de algún aspecto de su trabajo en la investigación de Rusia.
La designación de la investigación de Durham como una investigación criminal también aumenta enormemente su poder para recopilar información , abriendo la posibilidad de citaciones del gran jurado para registros y testimonios.
La medida seguramente complacerá al presidente Donald Trump, quien se ha quejado durante mucho tiempo de que fue espiado durante la campaña de 2016, a pesar de la falta de evidencia para respaldar esa afirmación. Trump también acusó a la administración Obama y a los funcionarios del FBI de traición, por sus acciones en la investigación de Rusia.
Los ex funcionarios habían expresado su reiterada preocupación por la investigación de Durham en las últimas semanas, diciendo que había indicios de que se estaba expandiendo más allá de una típica retrospectiva sobre cómo se manejaban los asuntos de alto perfil. La conversión de la investigación a una investigación criminal fue reportada por primera vez el jueves por el New York Times.
Las revisiones administrativas generalmente son realizadas por la Oficina del Inspector General (OIG) del Departamento de Justicia, que ha pasado más de un año investigando el contenido de las solicitudes de la Ley de Vigilancia de Inteligencia Extranjera que el FBI y el Departamento de Justicia presentaron para Carter Page , un especialista de la industria energética que había servido como asesor de campaña de Trump.
La investigación de Durham parece ser más amplia que la investigación de la OIG, aunque el alcance completo de su investigación sigue sin estar claro.

Hunter Biden Worldwide; Have you heard about his work in Romania?

Texto completo: Should Washington have done more to encourage foreign governments to examine the business activities of Hunter Biden? Hanging out the Biden shingle in jurisdictions where Barack Obama's vice president was leading U.S. policy appears to have been a more lucrative enterprise than previously believed.
Laura Strickler and Rich Schapiro report for NBC News:
In the final year of the Obama administration, an American lawyer traveled to Romania to meet with a businessman accused of orchestrating a corrupt land deal.
The businessman was Gabriel "Puiu" Popoviciu, a wealthy Romanian real estate tycoon. The lawyer brought in to advise him was Hunter Biden, the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Hunter Biden's work for Popoviciu in 2016 went unreported at the time, but Joe Biden's involvement in Romania was very much public. The vice president was among the leading voices pushing the government to crack down on corruption.
Will we now be treated to an explanation of Hunter Biden's vast expertise in the area of Romanian real estate law and corruption statutes? This column will go out on a limb and suggest that his knowledge of Bucharest property markets was not all that much greater than his familiarity with Ukrainian gas deposits. NBC elaborates:
There's no evidence that Hunter or his father acted improperly or violated any laws. But the arrangement, government ethics experts say, raises concerns that Hunter Biden was used as a prop in Popoviciu's effort to dodge criminal prosecution.
"We don't know what [Hunter Biden] was paid or what he was paid for but it does raise questions of whether this Romanian individual facing criminal charges was actually paying for a connection to the American vice president," said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor who specializes in government ethics.
For a Romanian businessman with legal troubles, renting a Biden might have seemed like a good deal even if it was not expected to result in a U.S. vice presidential favor or a golfing photo suitable for framing. The mere presence of a Biden on the team—while another Biden is forcefully representing the world's superpower in demanding Romanian reforms—could be a strong signal that one intends to mount an aggressive defense.
In this case it seems that local authorities either didn't receive such a message or they ignored it. Earlier this year, in a story largely dedicated to Hunter Biden's other foreign "business" ventures, the New York Times noted :
In addition to his work in Ukraine for the energy company Burisma, Hunter Biden advised a Romanian businessman with ties to the United States, Gabriel Popoviciu, whose real estate dealings had come under investigation, according to people familiar with the arrangement, which has not been previously reported. The investigation, which came as the United States and its allies were pushing Romania to clamp down on corruption, led to Mr. Popoviciu's conviction and a prison sentence.
What kind of message did Hunter Biden's work send to Romanians about the United States?
This column may ultimately owe Hunter Biden an apology for assuming that he was not as adept as the Clinton family in monetizing his brand name.
For now there's a question of whether the Biden family drew the line at China, Romania and Ukraine. If Joe Biden wants to continue to run for President, it seems reasonable for voters to ask for a full accounting of his family's business operations worldwide.

Meanwhile back in America, Democrats in the House are searching for evidence that President Donald Trump unduly pressured the Ukrainian government to examine Biden actions which the Bidens have promised they will never do again .

Trump to Tell Federal Agencies to Cut New York Times, Washington Post Subscriptions; White House plans to direct government staffers to not renew orders with the newspapers, whose coverage he has disparaged as 'fake'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The White House is planning to instruct federal agencies to not renew their subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post, administration officials said, escalating President Trump's attacks on the media outlets.
"Not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving—hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in an email Thursday.
Ms. Grisham declined to provide further details, and it wasn't immediately clear how the White House intended to compel agencies to cancel the subscriptions or how soon the order would take effect. The White House was still working on implementing the directive as of Thursday morning, an administration official said.
Spokeswomen for the Times and the Post declined to comment.
The decision comes days after Mr. Trump told his staff to cancel the White House's print subscriptions to the Post and the Times after expressing frustration with their coverage.
"We don't even want it in the White House anymore," Mr. Trump said of the Times during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired Monday night. "We're going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They're fake."
Print editions of the Times and the Post weren't among the newspapers delivered to the White House on Thursday, a White House official said.
The president has repeatedly railed against and sought to discredit the newspapers' coverage of his administration, including its dealings with Ukraine and the resulting impeachment inquiry in the House. On Twitter and during campaign rallies, Mr. Trump has attacked the news media, calling it the "enemy of the people" and dismissing some of the country's most venerable journalism outlets as "fake news."
In June, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that a Times story represented a "virtual act of Treason." The publisher of the New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, responded with an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal , saying the "new attack crosses a dangerous line in the president's campaign against a free and independent press."
Mr. Trump is an avid consumer of the news, and he regularly reads the Times and the Post, according to aides who privately acknowledged that they expect him to continue doing so despite the directive.
"I have no doubt the hard-working reporters of the New York Times and Washington Post will continue to do quality journalism regardless of whether the president acknowledges he reads them," said Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association and chief White House correspondent for ABC News.
"Pretending to ignore the work of a free press won't make the news go away or stop reporters from informing the public and holding those in power accountable," Mr. Karl added.
It wasn't immediately known how many subscriptions to the Times and the Post the federal government has. Federal employees are eligible for free digital subscriptions to the Post using their government email addresses.
Officials at the General Services Administration and the White House Office of Management and Budget didn't immediately provide data about the total number of subscriptions.
Canceling the subscriptions could limit officials' access to vital information that could assist them in doing their jobs.

Texto completo: 'Catch and Kill'
By Ronan Farrow, Little, Brown, 464 pages, $30
At first, I wasn't sure I wanted to read Ronan Farrow's book.
I didn't want to spend hours with a revolving cast of powerful men accused of doing unspeakable things to women, with impunity or the next best thing. I know the world can be like this, but I didn't want to know the world can be like this.
Now I know, in painful detail, thanks to Farrow and "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators." And you should too.
Farrow is the New Yorker magazine contributor who shared the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The New York Times. Their reporting is why disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is headed to trial on rape charges in New York City and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
Their work fueled the #MeToo movement and gave voice to scores of women who allege Weinstein harassed, groped, raped or otherwise forced himself on them and then brutalized them into silence. Their meticulous reporting allowed these women not just to be heard but to be listened to for the first time. And it brought to account men accused of sexual miscount and the industry that protected them.
But this is where the stories diverge.
Kantor and Twohey's new book, "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement," details what it's like to be investigative journalists for a newspaper that gave them the time, resources and support to make a difference. Told in the third person, it has the cool, authoritative voice of The New York Times. It focuses on the women who broke their silence and the work that helped them do it; it's a primer on how to do deep-dive journalism.
"Catch and Kill," which was released Tuesday, is a far different work. It's equal parts memoir, spy story and portrait of perseverance -- the women's and the author's -- under terrible circumstances.
Farrow began exploring rumors of Weinstein's sexual misconduct as a reporter for NBC News. In "Catch and Kill," he describes what it's like to work for a media outlet that tried to quash the story. The New Yorker later published Farrow's series of articles on which this book is based.
The NBC that Farrow portrays in "Catch and Kill" is the definition of a hostile workplace. Farrow's more sensational allegations about the company have already made their way into the headlines.
He described MSNBC President Phil Griffin waving around an enlarged image of a television personality's genitalia during a work meeting. And Farrow leveled the bombshell allegation that former "Today" show co-anchor Matt Lauer anally raped a young colleague while they were covering the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
That colleague is Brooke Nevils, and her complaint led to Lauer's firing in 2017, but NBC News did not disclose the accusation at the time. Lauer denies the allegation; he says he and Nevils had a consensual affair. Nevils' allegations are lengthy, graphic and on the record in "Catch and Kill." Her account underscores the pain, damage and, in Farrow's telling, the complexity of sexual assault. After Sochi, Nevils and Lauer had several sexual encounters, at his home and in his office.
"Nevils told friends at the time that she felt trapped," Farrow wrote. "Lauer's position of authority -- over both her and her boyfriend, whose brother worked for Lauer -- made her feel unable to say no."
Lauer is the specter that hangs over much of Farrow's deeply reported book, with its largely on-the-record accusations.
A foundation of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's contention that Weinstein had collected dirt on Lauer and that NBC killed Farrow's story on the producer's misdeeds to protect the star at the center of one of the network's most important franchises. NBC counters that Farrow's work was neither substantiated nor ready to run.
As the Los Angeles Times has reported, NBC has launched a counterassault against the book at the same time it is trying to quell the uproar Farrow's allegations have caused among its employees.
At the heart of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's quest to get the story -- and then get it published. All the while, Farrow alleges, NBC worked to shut down his efforts.
Throughout "Catch and Kill," the author maintains that Weinstein tried to bully them into silence, and to threaten, harass and buy off the women Weinstein had harmed. Farrow writes that Weinstein went so far as to have him followed by spies with ties to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.
Actress Daryl Hannah, whose sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein are detailed in the book, said she previously had told anyone who would listen, but it didn't matter.
"I think it doesn't matter if you're a well-known actress," she told Farrow. "It doesn't matter if you're twenty or if you're forty. It doesn't matter if you report or if you don't because we are not believed.
"We are more than not believed -- we are berated and criticized and blamed."
Someday, maybe, that will no longer be the case.

Who Wrote Lizzo's 'DNA Test' Hook? Now It's 100% in Court

Texto completo: The musician also added the author of a tweet that inspired the song's signature "DNA test" line to the track's credits.
Who wrote Lizzo's hit "Truth Hurts"? That question may now be settled in a court of law.
Last week, two songwriting brothers accused Lizzo of denying them credit for the song, one of the biggest hits of the year. The brothers, Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, said they had contributed to an early songwriting session that yielded the track's signature line.
A lawyer for Lizzo denied their claim at the time, but now the singer has sued the Raisens, as well as another writer, Yves Rothman, who made his own claim about "Truth Hurts."
Lizzo's suit, filed in United States District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday, seeks a declaratory judgment that Rothman and the Raisens had no part in creating "Truth Hurts," and asks for other unspecified damages.
In an interview with The New York Times, and in statements on social media, the Raisens said that the origins of "Truth Hurts" and the signature line that begins "I just took a DNA test" came in a songwriting session in April 2017, in which the brothers worked with Lizzo, Rothman and another writer, Jesse Saint John. As part of that session, the brothers said, they were all inspired by an online meme that was rooted in a recent tweet by a British singer named Mina Lioness.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The "DNA test" lyric has become so central to Lizzo's fame that she has applied for a trademark on the line's final phrase -- "100% that bitch" -- and sells T-shirts using it.
The Raisens argued that their session was collaborative, and so they deserved a share of the credits when Lizzo and her producer, Ricky Reed, took that line and later used it in "Truth Hurts." (The credited songwriters for "Truth Hurts" include Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Jefferson, along with Reed, Saint John and Tele, another producer.)
Lizzo's lawsuit denies that, saying that neither the Raisen brothers nor Rothman -- who, according to the suit, made his own claim to "Truth Hurts" last week -- had anything to do with creating her hit song. The suit further accuses the Raisens of "engaging in a pattern of harassment" against Lizzo and "threatening to 'go public"' with their claims unless they received a share of the song.
In a tweet on Wednesday, Lizzo said: "There was no one in the room when I wrote Truth Hurts, except me, Ricky Reed, and my tears."
Her suit notes that before the Raisens made their current claim against "Truth Hurts," in September, they first lodged and then withdrew a similar complaint. Lizzo's representatives believe this should have disqualified the Raisens from pursuing their claim a second time.
Lioness, the writer of the tweet, had complained that she also deserved credit, and that Lizzo and her representatives "have been ignoring my whole presence."
But on Wednesday, Lizzo said she would give Lioness credit as a writer of "Truth Hurts" and a share of the song's royalties.
"The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with," Lizzo wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. "Not these men. Period."
Minutes later, Lioness thanked Lizzo -- and her managers -- and wrote on Twitter: "I just took a DNA Test, turns out I'm a credited writer for the number one song on Billboard."
When asked about the suit, Justin Raisen said, "This makes me not want to make music professionally anymore. This is sad." He praised Lizzo for sharing royalties with Lioness but called that decision "obviously a political tactic."
"Truth Hurts" has been No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart for seven weeks, and may be on the next Grammy ballot for both record and song of the year; Lizzo is also considered a top contender for best new artist.

Pelosi's Impeachment Blunder

Texto completo: Nancy Pelosi had the Democrats' impeachment strategy right the first time: Don't do it. But apparently even a lifetime in the mud-filled trenches of politics wasn't enough to toughen the House speaker against the Democratic left's compulsion to impeach Donald Trump.
Anyone of any political stripe knows that the most psychologically distressed Democrats have wanted to impeach this guy, somehow just get rid of him, from day one.
Before Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, the Trump takedown was supposed to result from the Russian-collusion narrative, which got up to speed in January 2017 and then steamrolled across the country for two years of media leaks and the Mueller investigation, ultimately and fantastically going nowhere.
Within a day of the Mueller report's release, dismissing the Russian-collusion story lines, the opposition pivoted to the obstruction-of-justice narrative. Somehow, the pivoters must have assumed that the American people, after enduring the Mueller odyssey, would not notice that this extraordinarily disruptive investigation had come to nothing. And that people would saddle up to join the next get-Trump posse. That didn't work.
We'll pause in our own narrative to posit a de minimis level of legitimacy to what they've done. If the opposition party and, in our unique times, the opposition press want to spend what capital and credibility they have in a round-the-clock effort to take down a sitting president, that's their prerogative. Nothing in the Constitution says elected officials are obliged to do anything productive.
But translating the public's votes into a permanent presidential takedown had better work, because if they don't pull off impeachment and drive Donald Trump out of public life next year, the losses for the Democrats and the media will be devastating. It's the familiar do-or-die stakes of trying to take out the king.
Because Donald Trump loves living dangerously, he and the increasingly mysterious Rudy Giuliani handed his opponents the unexpected excitement of the Ukraine-Biden narrative -- and at last an opening for impeachment. The New York Times, delirious at the prospect, has even created an ominous little logo for its coverage, typically several pages a day -- "The 45th President: Impeachment."
Maybe it really will be the third time's the charm for the Trump-elimination forces, but the impeachment project looks like it's starting to go wobbly.
For starters, it's still just sort-of an impeachment. There's been no vote in the House and no sign the Judiciary Committee is drawing up articles of impeachment, as in the past. Instead, Adam Schiff's intelligence committee is interviewing Ukraine-related State Department officials -- in secret hearings. It resembles a show trial, with the "public" parts emerging as selective leaks to the impeachment press.
But the most telling impeachment development this week wasn't any paraphrased testimony from Mr. Schiff's private hearings. It was the news that Speaker Pelosi's impeachment timetable has been delayed "to sharpen their case" for doing it.
It is now evident that a vote to impeach President Trump isn't likely to occur before Thanksgiving, as many assumed, but will slip to December. Then, of course, the trial phase will pass to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Mr. McConnell reportedly wanted it all over by the end of the year, but what's the rush? The Trump trial could run through January -- 31 priceless campaign days before the Democratic Party's intensely competitive primaries. The Iowa caucus vote is Feb. 3, then comes New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11; Nevada's caucuses are Feb. 22; and the crucially important South Carolina primary arrives Feb. 29.
Instead of competing for their party's nomination, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet will spend invaluable campaign time planted on Capitol Hill during the days that the Pelosi-Schiff Trump trial drones on. Sens. Sanders and Harris can't call Mr. Trump the "most corrupt president" in the history of the country and then skip out on the trial of public enemy No. 1 to campaign in a downstate Iowa diner.
Joe Biden, Mayor Pete, and Hillary's new friend Rep. Tulsi Gabbard get to romp daily through the primary states, but who's going to notice with the Trump impeachment trial siphoning away the nation's media's attention?
Surely Nancy Pelosi knew when she stood firm against opening the impeachment dam that the interests of her party's anti-Trump compulsives -- nearly all from safe seats -- and her party's broader election interests were not aligned.
The left has always believed that some deus ex machina, such as Robert Mueller or a nonstop storm of negative press stories, would magically make the Trump presidency just go away -- rather than the more plausible likelihood that the relentlessly combustible Mr. Trump would eventually discredit himself in the eyes of most voters.
The American left throughout its existence has had a deep mistrust of the U.S. system, so rather than wait until November 2020 for voters to sort all this out, we get this crypto-impeachment. Like the sure-thing election of 2016, it too could backfire.

Texto completo: Actress Rose McGowan on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and his team of high-powered lawyers and covert investigators, accusing them of carrying out a plot to discredit and silence her.
The 72-page complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, adds to the already extensive legal troubles for the disgraced former film producer, who faces charges of rape and other sex crimes in New York stemming from years of abuse he allegedly carried out as one of Hollywood's most powerful figures.
Along with Weinstein, the lawsuit names attorneys David Boies and Lisa Bloom, who worked for Weinstein, and Black Cube, a private investigation firm allegedly hired to dig up dirt on McGowan.

"Harvey Weinstein was able to perpetrate and cover up decades of violence and control over women because he had a sophisticated team working on his behalf to systematically silence and discredit his victims," McGowan said in a statement. "My life was upended by their actions."
The lawsuit focuses largely on a series of events over several months in 2017 as McGowan prepared to publish a memoir, in which she says Weinstein raped her in 1997. Weinstein has denied the allegation.
Determined to learn what McGowan planned to write and to stop her from publishing the book, Weinstein leaned on Boies and, later, Bloom for help, the lawsuit alleges. Boies' law firm, in turn, hired Black Cube, a secretive firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents, the lawsuit alleges.
Lawyers for Weinstein and Bloom disputed the allegations. Others named in the lawsuit did not respond to requests for comment or could not be reached.
"Once and for all, Rose McGowan will be shown to be what she is: a publicity seeker looking for money," Phyllis Kupferstein, Weinstein's civil attorney, said in a statement. "From the moment she sought a multimillion-dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time to begin this. We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit."
Along with firsthand encounters McGowan had with alleged Black Cube operatives who posed as allies to earn her trust, much of the lawsuit is based on information reported by New Yorker reporter Ronan Farrow and New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey. In a series of articles and books, the journalists detailed the abuse many women say they suffered at the hands of Weinstein and other men, as well as the increasingly desperate efforts by Weinstein to keep his accusers quiet.
The lawsuit alleges McGowan's career as an actress and author, as well as her mental health, "suffered tremendously" because of Weinstein's efforts. It seeks unspecified damages for an array of offenses, including allegations of fraud and conspiracy.

Texto completo: On Oct. 23, a measure authored by Congressman DeSaulnier (CA-11) to better inform states about foreign efforts to interfere in an election was included in the final version of the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for A Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act (H.R. 4617), which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 227-to-181. The SHIELD Act would strengthen the country's ability to better identify and fight foreign interference in elections. Congressman DeSaulnier's amendment would require the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) to inform states within 30 days of receiving information that a targeted disinformation campaign has occurred in their jurisdiction.
"In 2016, bad actors weaponized social media platforms to spread false information, push misleading ads, and ultimately undermine Americans' faith in democracy," said Congressman DeSaulnier. "We know this disinformation campaign was successful, and that foreign agents, as Special Counsel Robert Mueller warned, are 'doing it as we sit here, and expect to do it again in the next campaign.' It is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that we have a government that is for and by the American people, and not by foreign adversaries."
The Senate Intelligence Committee has reported that all 50 states were targeted by Russia in the months leading up to the 2016 election, and earlier this month the New York Times reported that the Iranians are already following in Russia's footsteps and have begun cyberattacks aimed at disrupting our 2020 election. While these threats faced by foreign agents were substantial in 2016, state officials responsible for managing and securing election systems were unaware.
Congressman DeSaulnier has also authored the Bots Research Act (H.R. 2860), which would establish a task force at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to determine the impact of social media "bots" on public discourse and elections. He has also called for hearings in the House Oversight and Reform Committee on the impact of social media bots on our elections.

Texto completo: As WeWork, the beleaguered office-sharing startup, prepares to fire 4,000 rank-and-file staff members to cut costs, its board has agreed on severance packages for its co-CEOs if they leave, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
In the past week, WeWork’s board signed off on exit deals for Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham in the multimillion-dollar range, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the agreements are private. The severance arrangements were negotiated as SoftBank Group bailed out the company and on Tuesday named one of its executives, Marcelo Claure, as WeWork’s executive chairman.
For now, Minson and Gunningham are committed to WeWork, according to one of the people. They were appointed last month when co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann stepped down following the company’s withdrawal of a planned initial public offering.
“As your co-CEOs, we are committed to working with Marcelo and SoftBank to position our company for long-term success,” Minson and Gunningham wrote in a memo to staff obtained by Bloomberg.
Late Tuesday, WeWork secured a $9.5 billion lifeline, and Neumann gave up his board seat. He is set to walk away with as much as $1.2 billion in WeWork stock, a $500 million credit line from SoftBank and a roughly $185 million consulting fee, people familiar with the matter have said.
WeWork delayed layoffs earlier this month because it couldn’t afford the severance costs, a person familiar with the matter said. The Financial Times reported Wednesday the company would shed 4,000 jobs as a part of the turnaround plan.
Representatives for WeWork and SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. SoftBank is set to launch a CEO search, the New York Times and Axios have reported.

Pelosi's Impeachment Blunder; The Speaker knows the interests of her anti-Trump compulsives and the Democratic Party are not aligned.

Texto completo: Nancy Pelosi had the Democrats' impeachment strategy right the first time: Don't do it. But apparently even a lifetime in the mud-filled trenches of politics wasn't enough to toughen the House speaker against the Democratic left's compulsion to impeach Donald Trump.
Anyone of any political stripe knows that the most psychologically distressed Democrats have wanted to impeach this guy, somehow just get rid of him, from day one.
Before Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, the Trump takedown was supposed to result from the Russian-collusion narrative, which got up to speed in January 2017 and then steamrolled across the country for two years of media leaks and the Mueller investigation, ultimately and fantastically going nowhere.
Within a day of the Mueller report's release, dismissing the Russian-collusion story lines, the opposition pivoted to the obstruction-of-justice narrative. Somehow, the pivoters must have assumed that the American people, after enduring the Mueller odyssey, would not notice that this extraordinarily disruptive investigation had come to nothing. And that people would saddle up to join the next get-Trump posse. That didn't work.
We'll pause in our own narrative to posit a de minimis level of legitimacy to what they've done. If the opposition party and, in our unique times, the opposition press want to spend what capital and credibility they have in a round-the-clock effort to take down a sitting president, that's their prerogative. Nothing in the Constitution says elected officials are obliged to do anything productive.
But translating the public's votes into a permanent presidential takedown had better work, because if they don't pull off impeachment and drive Donald Trump out of public life next year, the losses for the Democrats and the media will be devastating. It's the familiar do-or-die stakes of trying to take out the king.
Because Donald Trump loves living dangerously, he and the increasingly mysterious Rudy Giuliani handed his opponents the unexpected excitement of the Ukraine-Biden narrative—and at last an opening for impeachment. The New York Times, delirious at the prospect, has even created an ominous little logo for its coverage, typically several pages a day—"The 45th President: Impeachment."
Maybe it really will be the third time's the charm for the Trump-elimination forces, but the impeachment project looks like it's starting to go wobbly.
For starters, it's still just sort-of an impeachment. There's been no vote in the House and no sign the Judiciary Committee is drawing up articles of impeachment, as in the past. Instead, Adam Schiff's intelligence committee is interviewing Ukraine-related State Department officials—in secret hearings. It resembles a show trial, with the "public" parts emerging as selective leaks to the impeachment press.
But the most telling impeachment development this week wasn't any paraphrased testimony from Mr. Schiff's private hearings. It was the news that Speaker Pelosi's impeachment timetable has been delayed "to sharpen their case" for doing it.
It is now evident that a vote to impeach President Trump isn't likely to occur before Thanksgiving, as many assumed, but will slip to December. Then, of course, the trial phase will pass to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Mr. McConnell reportedly wanted it all over by the end of the year, but what's the rush? The Trump trial could run through January—31 priceless campaign days before the Democratic Party's intensely competitive primaries. The Iowa caucus vote is Feb. 3, then comes New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11; Nevada's caucuses are Feb. 22; and the crucially important South Carolina primary arrives Feb. 29.
Instead of competing for their party's nomination, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet will spend invaluable campaign time planted on Capitol Hill during the days that the Pelosi-Schiff Trump trial drones on. Sens. Sanders and Harris can't call Mr. Trump the "most corrupt president" in the history of the country and then skip out on the trial of public enemy No. 1 to campaign in a downstate Iowa diner.
Joe Biden, Mayor Pete, and Hillary's new friend Rep. Tulsi Gabbard get to romp daily through the primary states, but who's going to notice with the Trump impeachment trial siphoning away the nation's media's attention?
Surely Nancy Pelosi knew when she stood firm against opening the impeachment dam that the interests of her party's anti-Trump compulsives—nearly all from safe seats—and her party's broader election interests were not aligned.
The left has always believed that some deus ex machina, such as Robert Mueller or a nonstop storm of negative press stories, would magically make the Trump presidency just go away—rather than the more plausible likelihood that the relentlessly combustible Mr. Trump would eventually discredit himself in the eyes of most voters.
The American left throughout its existence has had a deep mistrust of the U.S. system, so rather than wait until November 2020 for voters to sort all this out, we get this crypto-impeachment. Like the sure-thing election of 2016, it too could backfire.

Xi Cannot Stop Shaq; The dictator can only try to use state-run media to contain him.

Texto completo: Retired National Basketball Association star Shaquille O'Neal has been doing business in China for years. But he's not going to remain silent to please the world's largest police state. On Tuesday night the hoops legend supported not just free speech in general but specifically speech defending the people of Hong Kong.
China's dictatorship has been limiting Chinese broadcasts of NBA games ever since Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted—and then deleted—his support for Hong Kong freedom earlier this month. Hong Kongers have been demanding that the Chinese government allow basic liberties. They were disappointed when current NBA star LeBron James opined that Mr. Morey "wasn't educated" on the subject.
But now a former NBA star is standing taller than ever. On the U.S. cable network TNT on Tuesday, Mr. O'Neal helped kick off the NBA season with a message that is bound to cost him some overseas revenue—and win him even more fans among those who cherish liberty. The Hall of Famer noted that China cannot force Americans to stop expressing our beliefs as a condition of commerce:
... as American people we do a lot of business in China and they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values here in America is free speech. We're allowed to say what we want to say and we are allowed to speak up about injustices and that's just how it goes. And if people don't understand that, that's something that they have to deal with.
... Daryl Morey was right. Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say, 'That's not right.' And that's what he did... When it comes to business, sometimes you have to tiptoe around things, but again, they understand our values. … We have the right to speak, especially with social media. We're going to say whatever we want to say, when we want to say it.
The Allahpundit column at HotAir.com observes:
His point is simple. We understand China's values and look the other way at them, why can't they do the same for us? If LeBron and [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver can shrug off mass internment of religious minorities in concentration camps, the ChiCom government might reasonably be expected to shrug off one g-ddamned tweet by a team executive in support of Hong Kong. The reason this NBA/China standoff resonates is precisely because Americans on both sides of the aisle worry that Chinese economic power is pressuring American corporations like the NBA into following Chinese standards of free speech. .. the reason this has become a minor international incident isn't because Morey made it one but because China did. They could have ignored his pro-Hong-Kong tweet. Instead they chose to seize on it and bludgeon the league with it to send the message that further dissent won't be tolerated.
... Shaq wants a live-and-let-live approach where China does what it wants and Americans say what they want and both sides live with it. China says no. Either Americans tacitly approve of their totalitarianism by maintaining total silence about it or they don't do business with China.
In the Washington Post, Cindy Boren notes the commercial punishment in China imposed this week by the government:
State television chose not to air the first night's games and Tencent, the streaming partner of the league and ESPN, showed only the Lakers-Clippers game, according to the sports network.
As for Mr. O'Neal's appearance on American television, Matt Wilstein's report in the Daily Beast suggests that Mr. O'Neal's colleagues don't all share his commitment to free speech:
Shortly after the segment aired, the official NBA on TNT Twitter account posted a tweet that read, "Inside the NBA discusses recent surrounding the NBA and China" and included a video clip of the moment. But moments later, it appears to have been quickly deleted.
Morey also quickly deleted his original tweet, which read simply, "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong." But that did not stop China from suspending all ties with the Houston Rockets franchise and threatening the league's ability to broadcast games in that massive international market.
KNBC's Michael Duarte reports on the NBA's opening night game in Los Angeles between the Clippers and Mr. James's Lakers:
As fans walked past the statues of past legends Jerry West, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O'Neal, a reminder of the league's current controversy was just steps away... Outside Staples Center, pro Hong Kong protesters passed out T-shirts to fans reading: "Fight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong."
As a retired player it's unlikely Mr. O'Neal can command the endorsement sums of a current star. But he's putting at risk a commercial relationship that has been significant. In 2006, a Chinese sportswear company erected a 50-foot statue of him in a Beijing park. Two years later Pete Thamel wrote in the New York Times about the NBA's huge fan base in China:
Heidi Ueberroth, the N.B.A.'s president for global marketing partnerships and international business operations, recalled visiting the city of Guilin in the mid-1990s on a weekend trip while in China on business. Nobody knew she was affiliated with the N.B.A., but she remembered a young and energetic tour guide's introduction of the city as, ''The sister city of Orlando, Fla., the home of Shaquille O'Neal.''

Perhaps One Could Fashion a Giant and Delicious Statue "America is sitting on a mountain of uneaten bacon... Hog producers started building up their herds in anticipation of more demand for meat imports from China... The U.S. herd swelled to 77.7 million head. as of Sept. 1, a record for the month and the highest since 1943... So far, that's mostly led to an excess for U.S. supplies. But the glut could be short-lived if recent Chinese buying is any indication.

You can vandalize black history, but you can never erase it The site where Emmett Till's body was recovered should need no bulletproof marker.

Texto completo: When, at Mamie Till's insistence, the coffin was opened, she saw her son's right eyeball sitting on his cheek, dangling by the optic nerve. Let that single grisly detail stand in for all the rest. Let it speak to the savagery two white men unleashed upon the body of a 14-year-old black boy named Emmett Till.
On Saturday, a new marker was dedicated at the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi, from which his body was fished in August 1955. This is the fourth such memorial to Till, a Chicago boy who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered for supposedly getting fresh with a white woman at a local store.
The first marker wasn't installed until 2008. It disappeared. The next two were shot full of holes. The new one is said to be bulletproof, with protective glass and reinforced steel. It weighs 500 pounds and will reportedly be monitored by video cameras transmitting to the internet.
Even so, one wonders how long it will last. Where race is concerned, after all, white resistance to memory is often mulish. Black resistance too, sometimes. As Jessie Jaynes-Diming, a member of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, recently told NPR, "Whites and blacks came to our meetings and (said), 'Why are you all bringing this up? Why don't y'all let that die?' "
John Whitten would agree. A former county prosecutor, he was 7 years old when his namesake father defended the killers in court. Till, he told NPR, "came down here and got in trouble - overstepped his bounds to a degree some folks thought. And they cured him of his problems. I think all these folks are stirring crap up. Every day, somebody's dragging up the race card. Somebody saying we have racial disparity here. If nobody would stir that damn pile of stuff up, it wouldn't stink."
It is, yes, a crude and atavistic assessment. But, though others would likely use more oblique language, Whitten speaks the hearts of many white people when he says these are things we shouldn't "stir." For example, he speaks for Newt Gingrich who, in August, denounced a New York Times project on the history of slavery as "a lie."
And for the Alabama nurse who complained last year to Britain's Guardian newspaper that a new lynching memorial is "just stirring up something."
If some African Americans resist these stories because of the pain, many whites resist them because of the stain - the smudge on self-image, the blot on conscience, the blemish on the mythology of white virtue and innocence. They feel indicted by memory, so they try to kill it. "It's hard not to be embarrassed," a then-20-year-old white guy named Ryan Price told me in 2011. We had just sat through a documentary, "The Murder of Emmett Till."
In watching the movie, he said, "You get to the point where you almost want to change your skin color so you can show how much you care about issues of race, how much you care about the overt hatred and vitriolic discrimination of the past and today. Of course, you can't change your skin color, but you can be an ally to those who are marginalized in society, and that's something it really spurs me to do."
That young man's words inspired me - not only his willingness to grapple honestly with his feelings, but his determination to use those feelings for good. If more of us had courage like his, a simple commemorative sign would not have to be bulletproof or weigh 500 pounds. And history would not be a threat but, as he puts it, a spur. Unfortunately, too many of us have not courage, but cowardice.
They seek to murder memory. But you see, memory fights back.
So maybe they should make peace with it instead.

Texto completo: El alto funcionario anónimo del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump –que publicó un artículo en The New York Times— tiene una nueva sorpresa para el mandatario. Mejor dicho, le tiene Una advertencia, como se titula el libro que publicará en noviembre.
El misterioso personaje se volvió famoso tras publicar aquella editorial donde habla sobre el movimiento dentro de la Casa Blanca que busca asegurar el éxito del Gobierno estadounidense.
“Para ser claros, la nuestra no es la ‘resistencia’ popular de la izquierda” , dice aquella pieza publicada en septiembre de 2018 . “Queremos que la administración tenga éxito y creemos que muchas de sus políticas ya han hecho que Estados Unidos sea más seguro y más próspero” .
CNN obtuvo la portada del libro, el cual había sido un secreto, pero será lanzado el 19 de noviembre.
“Se han tomado fuertes precauciones para proteger la identidad del autor” , dijeron fuentes a la televisora.
Un borrador de un comunicado de prensa de la editorial Twelve describe el libro como como impactante.
“Retomando de donde se quedaron esas primeras palabras de advertencia, este libro explosivo ofrece una impactante historia de primera mano del presidente Trump” , indica.
Los editores afirman que el autor no publica el libro por dinero y que incluso analiza la intención de donar gran parte de las ganancia a la Asociación de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca y otras organizaciones que luchan por la libertad de prensa.
También se desconoce si el autor continúa en la Administración Trump, además de que la Casa Blanca declinó hacer comentarios.

Texto completo: For many people, "history" is a topic of middle and high school classes, a thing of the past with no application to daily life.
But 32-year-old Allison Horrocks and 33-year-old Mary Mahoney see history as a way of connecting with others. And they're using American Girl dolls to illustrate that point.
Horrocks and Mahoney - who both earned undergraduate degrees from Hartford's Trinity College and Ph.D.s in history from UConn - launched a podcast called "American Girls," in February.
In the twice-monthly episodes, the two historians unearth the American Girl books that many of us read as children and tweens. The books follow each American Girl as they live in their respective time period - the classic series of characters are set anywhere from the 1760s to the 1970s.
American Girl offers an easy point of access into the study of history, something that many listeners don't usually think about in their adult lives, Horrocks said.
"They haven't really been connected to these kinds of topics since they were kids," Horrocks said. "They're listening, in some ways, more eagerly because they haven't thought about this kind of stuff in 25 years."
After inviting listeners to step into a historical world on each episode, Horrocks and Mahoney launch into debates about the problematic aspects of American Girl, draw links to pop culture and talk about the lessons that the characters learn.
And for many, the podcast hits home.
The two women's easy on-air banter - they're best friends in real life, too - combined with the sometimes-heavy topics that the American Girl books bring up has spurred many listeners to reach out to the show with their own personal stories.
For example, after airing an episode about the character Josefina Montoya who deals with the grief of losing her mother, listeners sent in stories about their own loss, some of them about the loss of a parent when they were a child.
Horrocks said she answers at least 15 messages a day, including emails and direct messages on social media. At least half of those, she said, are lengthy paragraphs of appreciation and personal connection. Mahoney described many of the messages as "intimate."
"We're getting people's stories," Horrocks said. "I feel like the luckiest woman in the world sometimes."
When Horrocks and Mahoney first launched the podcast, they talked about it at the National Council on Public History's annual meeting - which was held in Hartford in March. That gave them an early base of listeners, many of whom were already listening to other history podcasts.
But in August, New York Times television critic Margaret Lyons wrote a column about the podcast, touching on her own childhood memories of American Girl and the experiences that shaped her into the person she is today.
The column is, in short, a wholehearted endorsement of the podcast. Shortly after the column published, the podcast's fan base began to grow. On Instagram, the "American Girls" podcast went from 2,000 to 7,000 followers, Horrocks said.
After Lyons' column, Horrocks and Mahoney saw an influx of listeners they hadn't yet truly tapped into: those who don't have a predefined passion for history.
The podcast is made to be friendly to those listeners, Mahoney said.
"I think sometimes people think history is very inaccessible ... that there's no way it could be of interest to you," Mahoney said. "In reality, it's just a form of storytelling and meaning-making."
As much as the podcast is a story of telling stories, it's also a story of friendship.
Although Horrocks and Mahoney met briefly when they were both undergrads at Trinity, they became actual friends while Ph.D. students at UConn.
And since meeting, they've each labeled the other as their best friend.
Both women said that the idea of a best friend, or even close friendship in general, seems to come more naturally to millennials than to older age groups.
Horrocks said that she once gave a talk, which Mahoney attended. When a man in his 50s asked Mahoney why she was there, she candidly told him it was because Horrocks is her best friend.
The man responded that the idea of a best friend is childish, Horrocks said.
"Maybe in other generations, that's a thing for children," Horrocks said. "I think especially women our age are really open about the importance of friends."
The genuine closeness between Horrocks and Mahoney bleeds into the podcast, smoothing the discussion and keeping listeners engaged.
And when listeners do reach out - whether with a short comment or an involved saga - they enter that intimate space, Mahoney said.
"When we started this show, we thought maybe a couple of friends would listen," Mahoney said. "That's how it started, but the life of the show has really been a surprise for us."

No More 'Marshall Plans'

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposes a "Green Marshall Plan," which would lend $100 billion to foreign governments to purchase "clean" energy products made in the U.S. Julian Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, wants "a 21st century 'Marshall Plan' for Central America." Columbia economist Glenn Hubbard likens President Trump's $50 billion Mideast peace plan to the Marshall Plan.
It's time to stop with these latter-day Marshall Plans. As the only nation-rebuilding effort perceived to have been successful, the 71-year-old plan has become the go-to association for policy entrepreneurs everywhere. Without substantive detail -- almost invariably absent -- these neo-Marshall Plans are sure to fail.
Appeals to the Marshall Plan cloak designs for massive government spending. No matter the cause's worth, no matter the plan's feasibility, this analogy provides an easy off-the-shelf sales pitch.
The real Marshall Plan of 1948 provided grants and loans to speed Europe's economic recovery after World War II. Although named for Secretary of State George Marshall, the plan's real author was Will Clayton, an international financier and former cotton trader. Debate persists about whether the Marshall Plan was motivated by humanitarian concerns, self-interest or anti-communism. To varying degrees, it was all of the above. Although scholars quibble about the plan's effectiveness and context, the American public remembers it as a triumph. But many forget why it succeeded -- not merely due to its ambition or price tag but, critically, because of good political and economic institutions in recipient countries.
The Marshall Plan often resurfaces in periods of crisis. In 1958 Bruno Kreisky, a socialist who went on to become chancellor of Austria, proposed a "Marshall Plan for the Third World." In 1999 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appealed for a "Marshall Plan for the Balkans."
After 9/11, proponents of aid to Arab countries turned to the analogy. "The security of the United States now depends upon achieving throughout the Arab and Islamic World what the Marshall Plan achieved in Europe," wrote Richard Sokolsky and Joseph McMillan in the New York Times. President George W. Bush invoked the Marshall Plan while spending $20 billion to reconstruct Iraq after the 2003 invasion, and liberal critics like Susan Rice argued it wasn't generous enough.
More recently, the musician Bono proposed a Marshall Plan for refugees in 2016. Commentators writing everywhere from Bloomberg to the Jakarta Post have implausibly christened the $575 billion Belt and Road Initiative "China's Marshall Plan." Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has trumpeted a $30 billion "Marshall Plan" for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
The original Marshall Plan's success now confers instant legitimacy on knockoffs of dubious merit. Without regard for accountability, administrative concerns, loan default, corruption, oversight, appropriate measures of success, or recipient-country history, all of these counterfeit Marshall Plans risk building up only one thing: the federal deficit.

THE ACCIDENTAL HONESTY OF MICK MULVANEY

Texto completo: A year ago, The New York Times opinion section published an anonymous op-ed headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration."
The headline was followed by this subhead: "I work for the president but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations."
In the piece, the anonymous writer calls out Mr. Trump's amorality with this devastating observation: "Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principle that guides his decision making."
The writer also described Mr. Trump's leadership style as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective" - descriptions that seem relatively tame by the standard of chaotic, bumbling and disastrous leadership on display during the abandonment of the Kurds in Syria last week.
The opinion piece was an immediate sensation and set off a search for the most likely scribe in that writhing den of opportunistic snakes that is the Trump administration. Official Washington has always loved parlor games, so for a week or two, hope shifted from the ongoing, leak-proof Mueller investigation to a cabal within the White House to save American democracy.
The mysterious writer, whose identity is known to only a small circle of editors at The New York Times, is described at the end of the piece only as "a senior official in the Trump administration."
Trump loyalists pointed to the piece as evidence of the existence of a "deep state" dedicated to undermining Mr. Trump's presidency. The generals who still worked in the White House at the time were considered prime suspects because their allegiance to a "higher authority" than politics always made them look shady in comparison to the administration's apparatchiks.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence showed up on the list of suspects, but both denied responsibility for it faster than Peter's denial of Christ after his arrest at the Garden of Gethsemane.
Intrigue about the identity of the op-ed writer soon took a back seat to the chaotic mundanity of living daily in Donald Trump's America. The piece was originally published on Sept. 5, 2018. Much has happened since then.
What we once considered normative in American politics has been shattered too many times to ever be taken for granted again. The chaos at the Trump White House has only gotten wilder.
So what happened to the op-ed writer who assured us that a patriotic remnant was in place at the White House to provide a reliable backstop to Mr. Trump's craziest notions. Is that anonymous writer still with us, or was he/she swept away during the resignations and firings of the past year? Is the so-called Resistance within the White House still intact?
We are now in the early stages of an impeachment inquiry. It is likely that the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives will, indeed, send the result of its investigations to the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate with a recommendation that Mr. Trump be removed from office because of a preponderance of evidence.
The conventional wisdom until last week was that Republicans in the Senate would not seriously entertain removing Mr. Trump from office because he is still popular with their base. The shameful betrayal of the Kurds and the mounting fury of Republicans over the blatant self-dealing of the Doral G-7 debacle has exposed cracks in his once impregnable Maginot Line of conservative Senate support.
On Sunday, Fox News' Chris Wallace told White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney that a well-placed source told him that 20% of Republican senators might consider voting with their Democratic colleagues to remove Mr. Trump from office, a scenario that the embattled Mulvaney dismissed as absurd and unworthy of a response.
Earlier in the week, Mr. Mulvaney conceded in the wildest press briefing ever conducted by a White House official that the Trump administration did try to strong arm Ukraine into investigating a political rival's son in exchange for the delivery of weapons already approved by Congress and that it "happened all the time."
It felt to many as if Mr. Mulvaney was attempting to "normalize" behavior that former State Department employees were pointing out to various House committees last week as gross deviations from the norm.
As bipartisan outrage over the "confession" grew, Mr. Mulvaney backpedalled and claimed that he never said what everyone with a set of properly working ears and eyes saw and heard him say, including Mr. Trump.
When Mr. Mulvaney said that Mr. Trump wasn't interested in fattening his own bottom line by offering the services of his Florida resort as the site of the G-7 next year, he added the odd observation that the president still considered himself in the "hospitality business."
Again, there was another wave of outrage and calls for Mr. Trump to replace Mr. Mulvaney, who doesn't appear capable of opening his mouth without saying the most incriminating things possible about his boss.
Mr. Mulvaney, a man who was a tea party conservative until he joined the even more fiscally-irresponsible Trump administration, bore evidence of the president's unfitness for office every time he opened his mouth. What kind of a moron would have Mick Mulvaney as his chief of staff?
It made me wonder if Mr. Mulvaney is the one playing 3D chess. Is he openly sabotaging the Trump administration by being so breathtakingly incompetent? Is the source for The New York Times anonymous op-ed hiding in plain sight as Mr. Trump's most fierce defender at the White House?
Nah, that's ridiculous! Though Mr. Mulvaney is bright enough to have written The Times' essay, he's never displayed enough moral courage to make a decent traitor. It's hard to grow a conscience overnight.

Bowing To Cartels Isn't Peace

Texto completo: The decision to release El Chapo's son is a reminder that Mexico needs a coherent strategy to fight violence.
MEXICO CITY -- Parents hugged their children behind locked doors of nurseries while gunshots rang out on the streets. Men with Kalashnikovs and burning trucks blocked key roads and access to the airport. Fifty-one inmates including murderers and kidnappers broke out of jail. To avoid more bloodshed, the Mexican government ordered the release of Ovidio Guzmán López -- son of the convicted drug kingpin Joaquin Guzmán, known as El Chapo -- who had been indicted in the United States for drug trafficking and captured by Mexican government forces. Cartel gunmen had taken to the streets in response to Mr. Guzmán's arrest.
As these events unfolded in the city of Culiacán in the state of Sinaloa on Thursday, they were broadcast live on TV and social media, raising fears about a failure in the security strategy of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Some people were relieved the official death toll that night was only eight, although several more corpses were found on Friday. But the Sinaloa cartel won, the government capitulated to its terror, and gangsters continue to have a level of control in swaths of the country.
On Friday, President López Obrador defended the decision to give in to the cartel's demand to release Mr. Guzmán, saying it avoided a massacre. "You can't fight fire with fire ... We don't want deaths. We don't want war," he said. "With justice, we will guarantee peace and tranquillity in the country." The problem is that his government is absolutely not guaranteeing peace and tranquillity, and violence rages daily.
The call to set Mr. Guzmán free in the midst of the fighting was a tough decision. Cartel thugs even attacked a military family unit, putting the lives of officers' children at stake. Other soldiers were reportedly held at gunpoint. There is a valid debate about the proper response to a hostage situation.
But the decision sends a message that cartels will be allowed to use violence to get their way. The Mexican security forces fumbled the operation from the start, arresting a top Sinaloa cartel suspect without enough backup to secure the area. And President López Obrador needs to forge a coherent strategy that provides a basic protection for citizens while tackling the deeper problems behind the violence.
Mr. López Obrador won his election last year thanks in part to his calls to end decades of corruption and uplift the poor. He rightly railed against the bloodshed and poverty that make people flee their homes, saying Mexico yearned for peace. Yet almost a year into office, homicide rates continue at record levels of more than 3,000 a month, while there are horrific incidents like gunmen ambushing and killing 13 police officers in the state of Michoacan last week.
I have been one of many voices criticizing the war on drugs and its catastrophic effects on Mexico. But the answer is not to give in to drug cartels, who can hold a major city and its residents under siege. The idea of drug policy reform, legalizing some drugs and providing better treatment for addicts, is to reduce the resources going to cartels and stop their rule of terror.
The problem in Mexico over the past decade is not only that the government has cracked down on traffickers by burning opium and marijuana fields. It is also that the cartels have used their billions to build paramilitary forces that lay waste to chunks of the country. It is not just a war on drugs but also a war financed by drugs. And that war does not stop even if the government is not attacking them.
Mr. López Obrador rightly points out that he inherited this problem. Reporting here since 2001, I have covered many dark days of this conflict: the massacre of 72 migrants; the disappearance of 43 students; cartel gunmen shooting down a military helicopter; a mass grave with more than 250 skulls. Yet that does not excuse him from the need to confront this humanitarian crisis.
The president appears to be struggling to win support from all his security forces. He created a new National Guard to bolster troops, but many of its members are occupied stopping Central American refugees and migrants from reaching the United States. Federal police officers blockaded streets in protest against being forced to join the National Guard, saying they would lose pay and benefits. And Mexican media outlets reported that elements in the army were unhappy with the outcome of Thursday's debacle in Culiacán.
President López Obrador needs to rally support from his forces and send out a clear message that criminal groups cannot ambush and murder them. He needs these forces to reduce the homicide rate and stop armed criminals from openly taking control of city centers. At the same time, his government could lead a more coherent plan for drug policy reform; there is already a smattering of bills in Mexico's Congress on the issue. And the government can press on with worthy social programs to steer young people from crime.
The United States also bears responsibility for this bloodshed. Between 2007 and 2018, more than 150,000 firearms seized in Mexico were traced to U.S. gun shops and factories. If serious American gun reform happens in the coming years, lawmakers should also listen to the gunshots over the Rio Grande.
Reducing Mexico's body count is a herculean task. But if politics is for anything, it should be to save lives. Just talking about justice does not stop bullets; cartel control is not peace.

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren has threatened that as president she would consider cutting off U.S. aid to Israel if the country moves against a two-state solution, but last year, she condemned President Trump for cutting off aid to intransigent Palestinians.
On Saturday, the Democratic front-runner said regarding aid to Israel, "Right now, [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu says that he is going to take Israel in a direction of increasing settlements. That does not move us toward a two-state solution."
She added, "It is the official policy of the United States of America to support a two-state solution, and if Israel is moving in the opposite direction, then everything is on the table."
The phrase "all options are on the table" was frequently used by politicians as a way of saying they would consider military action to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon if other options failed. Now, here's Warren taking that tone against a long-standing U.S. ally.
Warren's harsh words toward Israel stand in stark contrast to her previous condemnation of Trump's cutoff of aid to Palestinians.
Trump has come under fire from the Left after making several moves to unwind aid to the Palestinians, who have consistently rejected opportunities for a two-state solution and created obstacles to a negotiated settlement while continuing their campaign of terrorism. The terrorist group Hamas controls Gaza, where missiles are fired into Israel, and the supposedly moderate Palestinian Authority has a program that pays salaries to imprisoned Palestinian terrorists and to the families of terrorists who get killed.
As one part of Trump's campaign, his administration last year cut off more than $500 million in aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The agency has operated under an unprecedented definition that grants automatic refugee status to descendants of refugees rather than those who directly fled their homes as a result of a conflict, thus greatly inflating the number of Palestinians who are granted such status.
In September 2019, Warren joined dozens of Senate Democrats in condemning the move in a letter, stating, "We are deeply concerned that your strategy of attempting to force the Palestinian Authority to the negotiating table by withholding humanitarian assistance from women and children is misguided and destined to backfire."
Though the senators portrayed the UNRWA as nothing more than an honest provider of humanitarian aid, the reality is not so benign. The organization has long-funded textbooks in Palestinian classrooms that are littered with anti-Israel bias, a problem that has persisted despite claims the problem had been dealt with. More recently, an internal ethics report detailed a series of disturbing allegations against senior UNRWA management, including "sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority, for personal gain, to suppress legitimate dissent, and to otherwise achieve their personal objectives."
It would be one thing if Warren were talking in a broader fashion about cutting foreign aid (an argument, that, say, Sen. Rand Paul might make). But instead, she is singling out Israel, even though the aid to Israel has to be spent on U.S. equipment, facilitates military cooperation, and does not involve any sort of commitment of U.S. troops.
That Warren would find it so objectionable to push the U.N. and Palestinians to change but would be so forthright about threatening aid to a close ally is an indication of how prevalent anti-Israel sentiment is within the Democratic Party. It's clear that Warren feels that to satisfy her base, she needs to signal a willingness to bring down the hammer on Israel.

THE PULL OF EXTREMISM WHITE NATIONALISM IS GROWING AND DIVIDING

Texto completo: "Screw your optics."
Those were among the last words posted online by Robert Bowers before he attacked the Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, according to the federal indictment against him.
Those words were also a reflection of a debate that has split the white nationalist movement for years but has rarely reached the general public's eye. The reactions to Mr. Bowers' final post reveal much about that movement's direction since then.
The "optics debate" pits those who say they want to achieve a white-only or white-dominated nation through persuasion and politics against others - some calling themselves accelerationists - who want to start a race war as soon as possible.
To some of the former, the Tree of Life massacre was "strategically stupid," as one put it in an audio blog.
For others, though, that last post became a meme. A search for Twitter posts including "screw your optics" reveals 42 of them in August alone - a full nine months after the phrase was coined - including tweets dealing with white nationalism and mass killings, but also some broadly referencing U.S. or European politics, or topics as mundane as gardening and the decision to get contact lenses. A Google search, meanwhile, revealed at least 40 images captioned with some version of "screw your optics."
The Tree of Life massacre didn't end the "optics debate." But it may have shifted the balance as it reverberated through the increasingly networked white nationalist and supremacist movements in the U.S., Europe and the Australian subcontinent.
Some who study the white identity movement say that it continues to gain momentum and stridency, even as the media and many politicians decry violence perpetrated in its name at Tree of Life, Christchurch in New Zealand, El Paso, Texas, and elsewhere.
In the past year, "things have just gotten so much worse," said John Horgan, a psychology professor at Georgia State University who researches terrorism and violent extremism. Ethnic, racial and religious incitement "is insidious. It's pervasive. And it seems to be becoming an attractive counterculture to an increasing number of young people."
From 'amnats' to Atomwaffen
White supremacy today is "on the resurgence," said Kathleen Blee, distinguished professor of sociology and dean of the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. She traces the growth in the movement to the ease of participation through web forums and social media and in part to the election of President Barack Obama. "What propels white supremacy historically is threat," she said. "The idea that the white race is imperiled by a black presidency. That threat started mobilizing people."
White supremacy today is also distinguished by the prevalence of the "great replacement theory" - the idea that there is a plot, masterminded by Jews, to replace whites with other races. The theory has caught fire among white supremacists in the last decade or so, said Ms. Blee, and was referenced by name by the shooters in Christchurch, El Paso, and at a synagogue in Poway, Calif., near San Diego.
"There's a clear structure to how this works, and what this ideology does is that it focuses attention on certain groups as the enemy and makes the issue seem very, very urgent," she said. "That's the fear part. The race war is going to start right now. The threat is immediate, urgent and that action can be taken. Bowers and many other people buy into that."
What the FBI calls "racially motivated violent extremism" - including anti-Semitism and crime driven by bias related to gender identity - is on the rise nationally and locally, said John Pulcastro, a supervisory intelligence analyst with the bureau's Pittsburgh office. He can't quantify the prevalence of extremism but said that the numbers of acts, tips and preventive interventions have risen, especially since 2017's Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Va.
"It's a major focus of our intelligence unit right now and it's a national threat priority for the FBI nationally as a whole," said Mr. Pulcastro, who has spent 20 of his 30 years with the bureau working on extremism cases.
Optics - the way things look - may not have mattered to white nationalists a century ago, when the movement was epitomized by hooded Ku Klux Klan members and burning crosses. In 2017, though, initial images from Charlottesville conveyed a much different impression - clean-cut young men in polos and khakis, holding tiki torches. Advocates for "optics" won that day.
Only the next morning did the Nazi and Confederate flags appear, followed at the end by some very bad optics - video of a car driven by neo-Nazi James Fields plowing through counterprotesters and killing Heather D. Heyer, 32.
"After Charlottesville there was a huge debate about optics," wrote one self-described American Nationalist, who communicated with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in September and October and is profiled in a companion piece on this page. He characterized a divide between "pretenders who want to look tough wearing swastikas, and yell about killing people" and "actual White American Nationalists who disavow violence, promote change through policy, care about America, and refuse to dress up like some costumed freak to gain attention."
His side, he wrote, has "rules such as: If anyone tries to get you to do something illegal or tells you that they're gonna do something illegal, that person gets cut off immediately and forever."
Requests for comment from the other side of the optics debate resulted in long streams of mocking, often vulgar and sometimes threatening social media posts including references to shooting and raping journalists, pictures in which guns are pointed at the viewer and name-calling like "filthy dumb journo scum."
In the days after the Tree of Life massacre, the New York-based Network Contagion Research Institute turned its computer analysis tools to the use of the word "optics" on Gab.com, on which Mr. Bowers posted. "Optics" was closely associated with "infight" and with these extremist terms:
* wn, short for white nationalism, or the desire for a "white homeland."
* amnat, short for American nationalism, an avowedly nonracist reaction to globalism.
* civnat, a far-right term for moderate-to-conservative whites.
* Atomwaffen, a violent neo-Nazi clique.
* blackpill, a term for the act of pushing another person deep into nihilism.
Also associated closely with "optics" was the acronym gtkrwn - extremist code for "gas the kikes, race war now," said Joel Finkelstein, the director of the NCRI, which uses technology to study racism and anti-Semitism.
"When [Mr. Bowers] is talking about optics and passing it off as bravado to the public," said Mr. Finkelstein, "he's telling his own community that, 'we're ready to have a coming out party, and this is it.'"
The FBI, said Mr. Pulcastro, urges the public to be alert to the provocative word "invasion" in reference to immigration, the term "blood and soil," and the 14-word creed of white extremists: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
According to Mr. Finkelstein, "screw your optics" put Mr. Bowers solidly into the pantheon of far-right accelerationists.
"Bowers is kind of a meme now," he said. "He's not just a guy. He's a thing to do."
'Then we'll have our way'
From the outside, it may seem ridiculous that slaughtering aging Jews at worship in Pittsburgh or Hispanic shoppers in El Paso could advance any cause. Some fringe figures, though, saw it as a win for the far side of the optics debate.
One Gab poster early this year called Mr. Bowers "a good person who snapped, because of all the Anti-White [stuff] going on," according to the Tampa Bay Times. That post is reportedly attributed to Daniel McMahon, a Tampa-area man who frequently went by the name Jack Corbin online. Mr. Bowers repeatedly shared Jack Corbin posts before the Tree of Life massacre, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute.
In September, federal prosecutors in Charlottesville indicted Mr. McMahon, 31, for electronically intimidating an African American man into dropping a bid for a seat on that city's council.
Screwing the optics makes perfect sense to some self-described accelerationists, who believe that provoking society and speeding its decline is the surest path to a white nation, said Peter Simi, an associate professor of sociology at Chapman University in Irvine, Calif., and author of "American Swastika: Inside the White Power Movement's Hidden Spaces of Hate."
The term "accelerationist" originally referred to people who believe that ever-speeding technological and social change can prompt painful - but ultimately desirable - change. In recent years, some on the right fringe have adopted the term.
The rightist accelerationist logic, Mr. Simi said, is that by repeatedly damaging the prevailing system, they "can get to this total collapse, 'and then we'll have our way.'"
Those accelerationists have gained urgency from anti-immigrant rhetoric in politics and the media, experts agreed.
"Their view is, we don't need to just act, we need to act now, rather than later, because if we don't act, our very way of life is at risk," said Mr. Horgan, the Georgia State psychology professor. "We can't wait because we are being invaded."
Since Tree of Life, Poway and the Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand - before which the accused echoed "screw your optics" in his online posts - Mr. Simi has seen the emergence of a discussion thread more chilling than the optics conversation.
"I saw discussion that was very, kind of, strategic about how the person got radicalized, how they could have been more effective in terms of killing more people - this kind of after-incident assessment," he said.
International nationalism
The Anti-Defamation League counted 18 known attacks or plots by white supremacists in the U.S. between Oct. 27 and mid-September. Several were anti-Semitic, including Poway, in which a 19-year-old, following a script chillingly reminiscent of Tree of Life, killed one and injured three before his gun jammed.
Bari Weiss, New York Times columnist and author of the recently released book "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," still calls modern American Jews "the luckiest diaspora in Jewish history." Compared with anti-Semitism in Europe, "the cancer here is at stage 1 rather than at stage 4," she said. Ms. Weiss grew up in Squirrel Hill and celebrated her bat mitzvah at Tree of Life.
"In no way did I think that what happened in Pittsburgh would happen in America," she said. "I thought that violent anti-Semitism was something that happened in other places."
But white nationalism has become more overtly international.
"We had European white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, and American white supremacists marching in Poland," said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the ADL. "White supremacy is a global terror threat."
Organizations on both sides of the Atlantic are increasingly networked, according to an ADL report released in September.
Americans have attended far-right events and conferences in Poland and Scandinavia, the ADL and partner organizations reported. A few prominent figures from the movement even took up temporary residence in Hungary, where anti-immigrant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has emerged as a hero to xenophobes. And U.S.-based groups like Women for Aryan Unity have established chapters in Europe.
On Oct. 9, the suspected gunman in the Yom Kippur synagogue attack in Halle, Germany, livestreamed the attack on the Amazon-owned Twitch platform, narrating his actions in English in an apparent attempt at maximizing exposure. The Halle gunman failed to enter the synagogue, and then killed two and injured two others nearby.
The video was removed quickly by Twitch but had already been downloaded and copied to Telegram, an encrypted messaging app favored by extremists.

Trump Weighs Leaving Small Number of Troops in Syria; The plan is designed to protect oil fields and keep a foothold against Islamic State

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump is considering whether to keep a few hundred U.S. troops in northeast Syria after the bulk of the American force leaves, a move that would be another twist in years of policy gyrations over the country, according to U.S. officials.
A principal mission of the residual force would be to prevent President Bashar al-Assad's troops or Russian forces from taking control of Syria's oil fields, which are mainly in Kurdish-held territory in the northeast part of the country.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking Monday at a news briefing at U.S. military headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan, said administration officials have discussed keeping a residual force in northeast Syria to "deny access to the oil fields" to groups like the Islamic State.
The defense chief said the Pentagon hadn't presented a specific plan to the president and wouldn't say how many troops would stay or for how long.
"We presently have troops in a couple of cities that are located right near that area," Mr. Esper said. "The purpose is to deny access, specifically revenue, to ISIS and any other groups that may want to seek that revenue to enable their own malign activities."
The idea was presented to Mr. Trump last week by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who has vigorously opposed the president's initial decision to remove all of the 1,000 troops the U.S. has in northeast Syria.
Military officials said the Pentagon supports a plan to leave as many as 300 special operations forces to carry out that mission. The idea also has support in the State Department, according to people familiar with the issue.
In addition to keeping Syria's oil fields out of Russian hands, the troops could help the U.S. maintain a relationship with the Syrian Kurds and exert a modicum of influence in the region as Washington tried to encourage the Turks and the Kurds to maintain their shaky cease-fire.
Any U.S. troop presence would be protected by American air power.
The White House declined to comment. Mr. Trump appeared to allude to the idea on Friday and Sunday when he wrote in Twitter messages that the U.S. had "secured the Oil."
The plan, analysts say, might also give Mr. Trump a way to blunt criticism from members of both parties in Congress that he is abandoning the Kurds and handing the country over the Assad regime and the Russians.
Mr. Trump's interest in the plan was first reported by the New York Times.
A decision to maintain a small military presence would be the latest turn in a long saga in which Mr. Trump has pressed for more than a year for all American forces to leave Syria, only to be persuaded by top aides and Republican allies in Congress to slow the pace of that withdrawal or to leave some portion of the force in place.
Following a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 6, Mr. Trump directed a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria with the exception of a small complement of American troops at the al Tanf garrison in southeast Syria near the Jordanian and Iraqi borders. There are about 150 U.S. troops at al Tanf now, and U.S. military officials think the garrison could be used to host additional troops after the bulk of American forces leave northeast Syria.
If Mr. Trump approves the new plan, it would mean that the U.S. would have two geographically dispersed small complements of forces in northern and southern Syria.
Mr. Graham said Sunday that his latest discussions with Mr. Trump had eased his earlier concerns over the White House Syria policy. He said in an appearance on Fox News that he is "increasingly optimistic that we can have some historic solutions" in the country.
According to Mr. Graham, the administration is considering a broad plan under which there would be demilitarized zone occupied by international forces, but not Americans, to provide stability and that would be protected by air power.
It isn't known which nations, if any, would be willing to contribute forces for such a mission, and U.S. officials offered no details.
Mr. Graham also said he thought the U.S. and Kurds could work together to improve Syria's oil fields in the eastern part of the country so that the Kurds could derive revenue from them. "President Trump is thinking outside the box," he said.
The idea of working with the Kurds to develop their oil-exporting potential has been considered by U.S. officials before but hasn't been pursued, partly because Mr. Trump appeared to be intent on removing U.S. troops from Syria.
There are a number of impediments to carrying out the idea. A big one is maintaining security in a broad area with a small number of troops, though proponents say U.S. air power could make up for the small number of personnel on the ground.
Another challenge is how to export the oil that is produced in northeast Syria. Exporting the oil through Turkey is a political nonstarter. Nor would the U.S. appear to have any interest in giving the Assad regime or Russia a role in exporting the oil.
That means the oil would need to be exported through northern Iraq. Iraq's willingness to participate in such a venture isn't known, though northern Iraq is administered by Iraqi Kurds.

Texto completo: For many people, “history” is a topic of middle and high school classes, a thing of the past with no application to daily life.
But 32-year-old Allison Horrocks and 33-year-old Mary Mahoney see history as a way of connecting with others. And they’re using American Girl dolls to illustrate that point.
Horrocks and Mahoney – who both earned undergraduate degrees from Hartford’s Trinity College and Ph.D.s in history from UConn – launched a podcast called “American Girls,” in February.
In the twice-monthly episodes, the two historians unearth the American Girl books that many of us read as kids. The books follow each character as they live in their respective time period – the classic series of characters are set anywhere from the 1760s to the 1970s.
American Girl offers an easy point of access into the study of history, something that many listeners don’t usually think about in their adult lives, Horrocks said.
“They haven’t really been connected to these kinds of topics since they were kids,” Horrocks said. “They’re listening, in some ways, more eagerly because they hav-en’t thought about this kind of stuff in 25 years.”
After inviting listeners to step into a historical world on each episode, Horrocks and Mahoney launch into debates about the problematic aspects of American Girl, draw links to pop culture and talk about the lessons that the characters learn.
And for many, the podcast hits home.
The two women’s easy on-air banter – they’re best friends in real life, too – paired with the some- times-heavy topics that the American Girl books bring up has spurred many listeners to reach out to the show with their own personal stories.
For example, after airing an episode about the character Josefina Montoya who deals with the grief of losing her mother, listeners sent in stories about their own loss, some of them about the loss of a parent when they were a child.
When Horrocks and Mahoney first launched the podcast, they talked about it at the National Council on Public History’s annual meeting – which was held in Hart- ford in March. That gave them an early base of listeners, many of whom were already listening to other history podcasts.
But in August, New York Times television critic Margaret Lyons wrote a column about the podcast, touching on her own childhood memories of American Girl and the experiences that shaped her into who she is today.
After Lyons’ column, Horrocks and Mahoney saw an influx of listeners they hadn’t yet truly tapped into: Those who don’t have a predefined passion for history.
The podcast is made to be friendly to those listeners, Mahoney said.
“I think sometimes people think history is very inaccessible … that there’s no way it could be of interest to you,” Mahoney said.
As much as the pod- cast is a story of telling stories, it’s also a story of friendship.
The closeness between Horrocks and Mahoney bleeds into the podcast, smoothing the discussion and keeping listeners engaged.
And when listeners do reach out – whether with a short comment or an involved saga – they enter that intimate space, Mahoney said.
“When we started this show, we thought maybe a couple of friends would listen,” Mahoney said. “That’s how it started, but the life of the show has really been a surprise for us.”

Texto completo: I've been covering technology since the early '80s, and for the first 20 years or so of my career, I recall seeing very few negative media stories and even fewer complaints from politicians. For much of that time, tech pretty much got a free ride. Journalists and elected officials were in awe of what Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo and other tech companies had accomplished and were optimistic about what the future might be.
There were some anti-trust hearings and an eventual trial over Microsoft's domination of personal computing and the fear that that would carry over to the internet. But for the most part, politicians were either ignorant or positive when it came to tech. The word "big tech" was not a major part of our vocabulary.
Fast forward to 2019 when politicians from both sides of the aisle seem almost obsessed with potential problems arising from tech companies. The president and his allies claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook are biased against conservatives while Democrats complain about how these platforms were illegitimately used by Russia to tilt the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump. Both sides complain about privacy, and there are people across the political spectrum who agree that tech needs to be regulated, even if they can't agree on hardly anything else.
Tech was very much on the agenda at Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate as candidates responded to questions from New York Times national editor Marc Lacey as well as each other.
Lacey began by asking Andrew Yang if he agreed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren's call to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Yang agreed that "Sen. Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem," but diverged on solutions, pointing out that "We also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth-best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today."
He went on to say "It's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country" and "Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier," after claiming that "Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use."
Warren retorted that competition isn't working. "About 8%, 9% of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49% of all sales online happen in one place: That's Amazon," she said. I fact-checked her numbers, and she's not far off. Warren added, "It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses."
Tom Steyer agreed that tech companies "either have to be broken up or regulated," but then turned his attention to why he could beat President Trump a useful pitch for Democratic voters, but not very helpful when it came to the key question.
Corey Booker said, "We have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy," adding "We need regulation and reform."
I agree with Beto O'Rourke's first comment, "We need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road," but not with his assertion that tech companies like Facebook are "more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see."
While it is true that algorithms used by Facebook and other social media companies help surface what people see, the content itself is generated from users, not from journalists or other professionals who work for and report to the companies.
The problem with O'Rourke's claim is that classifying social media companies as publishers means they are responsible for everything on their platform, which could have a chilling effect on the free speech of their users.
The only way Facebook could vet and verify everything anyone posted would be to hire thousands of editors to read every post and decide whether it was a valid opinion or a fact, just as newspapers do for everything from reporter generated stories to op-eds. Even letters to the editors go through an editing process before they're printed in most newspapers, which holds them to different standards than what people can post on online forums or social media. That's not to say they shouldn't remove posts that violate their terms of service, but making that a requirement could have unintended consequences.
Sen. Kamala Harris used the tech question to take a shot at Warren, asking her to back her demand that "Twitter suspend Donald Trump's account."
Warren, who is taking a lot more incoming now that she's one of the top contenders, wouldn't take the bait, and I don't blame her. While it's very true that Trump has used Twitter to make mean comments and spread false information, it's also true that, whether you like him or not, he's president of the United States and what he says is, for that reason alone, newsworthy. There are lines that even public officials shouldn't cross, but it's right for Twitter to give him and other politicians a platform and to continue to give any other Twitter users the right to comment, respond and express their reaction to what the president posts.
In June, Twitter announced a policy to "place a notice a screen you have to click or tap through before you see the tweet to provide additional context and clarity," whenever a public official posts a tweet that "would otherwise be in violation of our rules."
Although I've expressed my thoughts on what was said Tuesday night, I'm not taking sides in the primary or the election, but, along with many in Silicon Valley and across the country, I will be watching to see how the candidates grapple with the very real issues of how tech is affecting our lives, our economy and our democracy.

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
For two decades, Gail Collins has brought her tart observations and puncturing wit to the New York Times op-ed page, in which time she has also written three books on the history of American women. The latest installment, "No Stopping Us Now: A History of Older Women in America," concerns the status and condition of a sector of the population which, at different times, has been the most powerful age group among women and, at others, the most disregarded or scorned among the population at large.
Collins traces attitudes toward older women from the colonial period to the present, showing that the age at which a woman was considered too old to be useful or attractive was influenced by economic conditions and increasingly shaped by popular entertainment and mass marketing. In early colonial days, older women, who often held property, were considered a catch. With the increase in female population, the status of women and, perforce, older women declined dramatically until late in the 19th century when certain older, well-heeled ladies began to form cultural clubs and later, a portion of them led the campaign for female suffrage.
Wars and the extraction of men from the workforce offered women, young and old, economic opportunity. But, after World War I came the era of Prohibition and with it the speakeasy and the aggressively young, boyishly contoured flapper, leaving no place for the older woman in the era's self-image. An ad in Ladies' Home Journal in 1922 put it this way: "You've got to make up in cleverness what you've lost in youth. Your corsets are all that stands between you and that vague, shapeless bourn from whence no traveler returns -- age." After World War II, the housing boom and the decline of multigenerational domestic arrangements brought another blow to the older woman. Her widowed presence was no longer desirable in the single-family, all-American home.
Collins, a connoisseur of humbug, leavens her history with examples of highhanded pontifications from every era. In "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex ... ," Dr. David Reuben wrote that old women "having outlived their ovaries … may have outlived their usefulness as human beings." This grim news came in 1969, right at the end of the decade that installed youth as the highest human achievement and instigated the widespread use of hormone replacement.
Collins covers familiar developments and events in women's history which, important though they are, are not specific to older women and might have been treated more succinctly. Further, she devotes by far the greatest attention to white, middle- and upper-middle-class women. And, once she gets to the 1980s and beyond, she drifts into a form of celebrity news, increasingly drawing upon the doings of TV and movie stars, media figures and politicians to make her points. Still, "No Stopping Us Now" -- a catchphrase that does sum up the more favorable position of older women in our own time -- is an engaging book, featuring throughout Collins' infectious relish for delusion and hucksterism.

The 1619 Project challenges us to change A look at the moment when a group of European men decided they could treat African people as property

Texto completo: Changing your mind is hard. Changing your worldview is almost impossible.
The 1619 Project, created by the Pulitzer Center and The New York Times, aims to change our worldview about the United States by identifying our founding date as 1619, the year the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia.
We are used to thinking of our founding as necessarily involving documents signed by wealthy white men, asserting our right to independence and then framing our government. The 1619 Project challenges us to look at the organic birth of our nation as the moment when a group of European men decided that they could treat a group of African people as property, not human beings.
And thus was the United States of America birthed as a nation that permanently consigned people from Africa to immutable slave status, based on their skin pigmentation and geographic origin. Historically, slaves had always had a way out of slavery through serving a designated number of years, purchasing their freedom or being freed by their owners for any number of reasons. Enslaved people from Africa in the United States had no way out. They still do not, and they are still reaping the whirlwind that those European men started in 1619.
So where does this previously unacknowledged information about the birth of the American idea leave white Americans and their view of our country's beginnings? As we struggle with our country's racial history, we are trapped in a state of cognitive dissonance. What began in 1776 and what began in 1619?
The official declaration of independence from England occurred in 1776, and all of the iconic celebrations of July 4 emerged from that declaration. The foundation of social and economic relations between two groups of people, the owners/founders and the owned/enslaved, began in 1619. The United States would not have happened without the labor of people who were kidnapped from Africa and transported under brutal conditions to the Western hemisphere.
"Out of slavery - and the anti-Black racism it required - grew nearly everything that has truly made America exceptional: its economic might, its industrial power, its electoral system, diet and popular music, the inequities of its public health and education, its astonishing penchant for violence, the example it sets for the world as a land of freedom and equality, its slang, its legal system and the endemic racial fears and hatred that continue to plague it to this day," according to The Times.
Racism was constructed by the original slaveholders to justify enslavement. By 1776, slavery was well established. When the authors of the Declaration wrote that all men were created equal, they did not include men from Africa. When the Constitution was ratified, persons of African origin were consigned to property status. An entire population of Africans and their descendants have been fighting ever since to regain their legal status as human beings, citizens and equal persons under the law.
Reframing the world view of many white Americans in the light of this information requires enormous courage. If we retain the perspective that this reframing is a zero-sum game, our habitual violence and interracial hostility will continue unabated.
We cannot allow ourselves to think about the information presented in The 1619 Project as anything other than a serious effort to correct historical inaccuracies, confusions and deliberate attempts to mislead all of us. If we do that, and this document receives the widest possible consideration, we may be able to transform the worldview of Americans to a broader, more just and inclusive notion of who we are.

Texto completo: This July, I spent a few weeks in Japan. Knowing that the new Portland outpost of Luke's Lobster was on my list of upcoming reviews, I decided to stop in to one of the five Tokyo-area branches. Yes, you read that correctly. There are nearly half-a-dozen Luke's in metropolitan Tokyo-Yokohama alone (plus another three farther south in Japan).
When I arrived during one of the muggiest days of the year, I encountered a line outside: two dozen stoic-yet-miserable-looking people looking down at their phones as they absentmindedly shuffled toward the carryout window.
I wasn't there to eat, so I bypassed the queue and stepped inside to have a look around. When I told the host where I was from, she brightened and said, "Oh, I understand. You're homesick. Does this remind you of home?" I nodded my head in agreement just to be polite, but the truth is: It didn't really.
More than anything in Maine, the space reminded me of the Luke's Lobster in Times Square or the one upstairs in the outdoor Brickell Center shopping center in Miami. And that's no accident. Thanks to a business model that includes vertical integration of a private steel works and furniture shop in Saco, Luke's is able to reproduce a Starbucksian degree of similarity across its restaurants; no two are exactly alike, but they bear an eerie family resemblance to one another.
In part, that's because all 40-ish Luke's Lobsters around the world share the same conceptual DNA as the original East Village, Manhattan, restaurant that opened almost exactly 10 years ago. No matter how far away, each modernized shack is precision-engineered to present a culinary picture postcard vision of New England lobstering. It's Maine viewed through an Epcot filter.
"The philosophy is the same across the board, but it's never a cookie cutter process," co-founder and chief marketing officer Ben Conniff said. "We build with reclaimed wood, materials from fisheries. You need these elements to make people feel like they're visiting Maine."
The effect is not unpleasant, and by New York or Tokyo standards, a delicately dressed, butter-toasted $20 lobster roll certainly represents an affordable way to get a taste of our state's most famous export. Yet each of the Luke's I've visited outside the state feels like it was designed by someone who had barely skimmed the Wikipedia entry for Maine.
When sited at the end of the expensively renovated Portland Pier, the gigantic 175-seat Luke's Lobster that opened this June doesn't seem out-of-place as much as it feels like a well-designed, Maine-themed placeholder - a weighted average of waterfront seafood restaurants across the state.
It's especially true of the terse menu, a greatest-hits collection of seafood shack classics, some of which (like the lobster roll) are decent. The best of the bunch is probably the crab roll ($16/$20), filled to overflowing with Maine-caught Jonah crab that is steamed, then air-jet "picked" in the company's bespoke seafood processing facility in Saco. Before it is mounded into a mayo-painted Country Kitchen roll, it gets drizzled with lemon butter and dusted with the restaurant's perky, celery-seed-forward "secret seasoning" mixture.
Pre-cooking the crab just to the point of doneness is a smart move - one that produces a roll that is tender and never fishy. A similar method works beautifully for sweet, bantam GaspÃ© Bay shrimp from QuÃ©bec - the same species that, until recently, was fished along the Maine coast. Here though, the shrimp are peeled and cooked in Canada, then shipped out to wherever Luke's shrimp rolls ($12/$15) are in demand.
Fried dishes are a bit more hit-or-miss. McCain-sourced, Maine-potato French fries ($3) come amply portioned and are cooked crisp-tender. My party ordered an extra serving for the 7-year-old dining with us, but the four adults at the table ate the entire basket of chunky-cut fries.
Whole belly clams from Community Shellfish in Bremen ($19/$22) are one of the best versions of this deep-fried dish I have eaten this year. Daintily coated in a crunchy, rice-flour (and therefore gluten-free) batter, the clams are flinty and sweet, with finespun layers of essential flavors that call to mind cucumber and iodine.
On the other hand, Icelandic (not Gulf of Maine-fished) haddock - available in a basket of beer-battered, deep-fried cubes ($11) or on a sandwich as a hefty fillet that extends far beyond the borders of a distributor-sourced brioche bun ($14) - is served overcooked and glistening with grease.
One of my dinner guests took a single bite of the sandwich, shook his head and swapped the plate for a Lighthouse Salad upgraded with picked lobster (in the same portion used for the lobster roll) and drizzled with a runny dressing of buttermilk and Atlantic Sea Farms kelp ($22). It's not an especially memorable salad, but it is a lighter way to sample some of the state's natural nosh.
Perhaps the inclusion of kelp in the dressing also represents the first evidence of a reversal of the tides of Luke's Lobster's influence - a hint of the Japanese affinity for seaweed making its way onto the menu in the U.S. I wonder what might happen if the restaurant began to incorporate foodways from far-flung locations in Chicago, Las Vegas and Taipei. For now, though, Luke's remains resolute in its uncanny-valley depiction of the Maine experience, even when it takes place in Maine itself.
In Tokyo, on my walk back to my hotel from the Shibuya Luke's Lobster store, my niece listened patiently as I described the weird approximations that make Luke's feel like it almost (but not quite) deserves a 207 area code. She challenged me, asking if a sanitized, carefully curated depiction of the state isn't what diners "from away" want. Of course, she's right.
Here in Maine, it's a different story - at least for locals. Portlanders will see your vintage lobster buoys and gooey, flakey Two Fat Cats blueberry pie ($9) and raise you a snowmobile, a shot of Allen's Coffee Flavored Brandy, a bottle of maple syrup and a cuffed pant leg teeming with deer ticks.
A competently produced lobster roll is fine and good, but in this town, is that really enough?

Texto completo: A second complaint came as the mixed martial arts star waited to see whether prosecutors would charge him in another case.
Conor McGregor, one of the biggest stars of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is being investigated over a sexual assault allegation, the second such case in less than 12 months, according to people familiar with the matter.
The most recent allegation relates to a complaint that a woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted in a vehicle parked outside a Dublin pub last week, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of Irish laws surrounding investigations. McGregor, a 31-year-old mixed martial arts fighter who is one of the world's highest-paid athletes, has not been charged, and the police have yet to interview him about the allegation. He was already waiting to hear whether he would be charged following a complaint that he assaulted a woman in Dublin last December.
The police passed the findings of the investigation in the first case to Ireland's prosecutor's office earlier this year. McGregor was arrested in January, questioned by law enforcement authorities and released pending further investigation, per the usual protocol in criminal investigations in Ireland and much of the rest of Europe, where a formal charge does not necessarily follow an arrest.
The allegations have not been proved, and the existence of the investigations does not imply that McGregor is guilty of any crime.
"Conor McGregor is frequently the subject of rumors," a publicist for the fighter said in an emailed statement. "He emphatically denies any report accusing him of sexual assault."
A lawyer for McGregor in Dublin did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Born in a tough, working-class section of Dublin, McGregor has helped propel U.F.C.'s popularity worldwide, though he has been involved in a flurry of police cases throughout his career.
Flanked by two bodyguards, McGregor appeared in court last week to answer charges of assaulting an elderly man at a pub in April. That case is still pending, with another hearing scheduled for next month. Security footage purporting to show the incident was leaked to the celebrity news website TMZ.
McGregor has participated in only one U.F.C. fight since 2016, a defeat last October to Khabib Nurmagomedov that ended in disgrace when a brawl broke out between their rival camps at the end of the fight. McGregor announced his retirement from the sport in March, only to hint several times that he would get back into the ring. The UF.C., which did not respond to a request for comment from The New York Times, has not announced any upcoming bouts featuring McGregor.
The Irish news media have reported on both sexual assault cases but without naming McGregor. Laws in Ireland restrict the news media from identifying individuals charged with rape unless they are convicted, which has not happened in either instance. News outlets reporting the identity of a suspect before a charge often face costly libel and breach of privacy lawsuits in Ireland. Publication after a charge is filed could lead to a more serious contempt of court indictment.
Newspapers and broadcasters have instead linked the two cases and typically described the suspect as a famous or well-known Irish sports star. Ireland's police service, known as the Garda, declined to comment on the profession of the person accused of the second assault.
"Investigations ongoing and no arrests at this time," a Garda statement said. "Owing to the nature of the investigation we will not be commenting further at this time."
McGregor's rapid rise from a destitute mixed martial arts fighter living with his mother to the U.F.C.'s most-prized asset has become one of the biggest stories in Ireland in the past decade. McGregor has largely enjoyed the attention, regularly taking to social media to brag and to show the fruits of his newfound wealth, which peaked in August 2017 when he participated in one of the most lucrative boxing matches -- a loss to the undefeated boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr.
McGregor, nicknamed The Notorious, has cultivated a bad boy reputation through over-the-top behavior that has on some occasions led to brushes with the law.
Last July, he pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct after he threw a hand truck at a bus carrying Nurmagomedov and other fighters returning to their hotel from Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Two fighters were injured by shattered glass.
Although he has not fought for a year, McGregor continues to be one of the U.F.C.'s most talked-about stars. He has a close relationship with the organization's president, Dana White, who this week ruled out a December fight -- hinted at by McGregor -- between the Irishman and the featherweight Frankie Edgar. White has been more tight-lipped when it comes to commenting on the allegations facing McGregor.
In August, five months after The New York Times first named McGregor in connection with the first sexual assault allegation, White said he knew "zero" about it, before adding: "To be honest with you, the back-and-forth that I've had with him about that is that it's not him -- it's somebody else. So I don't know."

Texto completo: Readers discuss an article about how darker-skinned southern Italians faced racism a century ago and had to struggle for acceptance.
To the Editor:
Re "How Italians Became 'White,"' by Brent Staples (Sunday Review, Oct. 13):
My very white Italian-American children find it hard to believe when I tell them that their four great-grandparents who immigrated to the United States from Sicily in the early 1900s were the brown people of their era. My paternal grandmother, Jennie, would say, "They called us bad names."
In the 1960s, when I was in high school on Long Island, we had a system of somewhat impenetrable cliques arranged by ethnicity, and I hung out with the Italian kids. I learned from the kids whose families had come from northern Italy that as a Sicilian I was less than O.K. A couple of the boys occasionally lobbed the "N" word at me. My white American children, born in a post-assimilation era, can't imagine that world.
In my family the immigrant experience, with all of its troubles and glory, shaped a family narrative embracing social equality that lives on in ensuing generations. My grandmother's staunch belief that "we are all God's children" rings just as true today.
Janice Sabin
Vashon Island, Wash.
To the Editor:
I think that Brent Staples exaggerates the extent to which Americans viewed Italians through the lens of "racism." There was plenty of skepticism and fear as millions of impoverished people -- Italian and otherwise -- poured into American cities. With them came crowding, crime, filth, disease, nondemocratic political ideas and social chaos. Urban places had not developed the physical and institutional infrastructure to accommodate this influx of needy people.
Yes, there were unfortunate events like the lynching in New Orleans and plenty of condescension toward swarthy "dagos." However, over all, American communities absorbed Italians, educated their children, provided jobs and supported their entrepreneurial efforts as small-business owners. The vast majority of Italian-Americans viewed these opportunities with gratitude, worked extremely hard and took meticulous care of their homes and families.
The results of their resilience are obvious today. As a descendant of these extraordinary people, I don't buy your victim narrative. Italian-Americans were beneficiaries of America's democratic capitalist system and pluralistic culture, not victims of it.
Laura Compagni-Sabella
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
To the Editor:
What a short memory Americans have of their own immigrant experience. With very few exceptions, every family came here from somewhere else and went through, to one degree or another, some challenges, bumps and bruises on their way to becoming American. But it's a bit like Snapchat, where their collective memories dissolve.
Without a trace of self-awareness, they just point at newcomers and shout: "We must raise the drawbridge! Keep them out! They are too different!" More than likely, someone (or many someones) was saying the same thing about them or their forebears when they came here.
America is -- and always has been -- a powerful, even irresistible idea that draws people to it. Understanding the meaning of America fully -- and adjusting to it -- takes some time. Freedoms are easier to grasp than responsibilities. Opportunities are more exciting and grab attention faster than do barriers and challenges. But, with some time and work, almost everyone "becomes" American and feels rewarded for the investment.
Gene Boccialetti
New York
To the Editor:
Both of my paternal grandparents were born in Ireland and emigrated to the United States around 1900. I remember their describing "Irish Need Not Apply" signs and being discriminated against in many ways. Their story is quite similar to what you have described for Italians.
As a country we have a very checkered history of our treatment of anyone not of British ancestry. Asians, Africans, South Americans, Southern Europeans, Eastern Europeans, Irish, Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Hindi -- all were treated as inferiors at one time (most still are).
Only when the accents disappeared and it became impossible to tell that someone was Italian or Irish were we "accepted" as white. Unfortunately, many still fall under the label of "them" -- inferior and to be feared.
President Trump has done a very effective job of bringing out into the open how deep and alive racism still is in America. For a "Christian" nation we fall quite short of the values that Christianity stands for; we have a lot of repair and repentance to do, a lot of forgiveness to be earned.

To the Editor:
Even as a third-generation half-Italian-American, I still feel a surge of nausea whenever faced with choosing an "ethnicity" on official forms or job applications. The only choice allowed for my mixed European heritage is "white," but checking it feels like a betrayal of my ancestors and a forced whitewashing of this country's true microdiversity.
I resent, every time, that my identity will be assumed into a featureless, monolithic bloc of whiteness and ascribed to an established majority I neither identify with nor aspire to. And leaving the box unchecked in protest feels even worse, like choosing voluntary self-erasure over involuntary state erasure.

To the Editor:
My father, whose parentage was Irish and Italian (two immigrant groups that were each reviled at some time), instilled a pride in us about our southern Italian ancestry. He didn't talk about the discrimination, perhaps because he was of the generation that produced Italian-American entertainers like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Tony Bennett. Much had improved by the mid-20th century.
With this in mind, I was mortified when Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, made his recent remarks about who should be emigrating to the United States and what the Statue of Liberty should say today ("Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet"). Is he unaware of (or in denial about) the history of his own ancestors in this country? We Italian-Americans were once as poor, wretched and hated as many of the asylum seekers trying to come to the United States today.

To the Editor:
Your article cites Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, but he was not alone in the prejudice against Italians from the south of Italy in the late 19th and early 20th century. His hated rival, Woodrow Wilson, wrote in his 1902 "History of the American People": "Throughout the [19th] century men of the sturdy stock of the north of Europe had made up the main strain of foreign blood ... but now there came the multitudes of men of the lowest classes from the south of Italy and men of the meaner sort out of Hungary and Poland, men out of the ranks where there was neither skill nor energy nor any initiative of quick intelligence ... as if the countries of the south of Europe were disburdening themselves of the more sordid and hapless elements of their population."

To the Editor:
Bravo, excellent piece! Its point is that Italians were the scary foreigners to be feared not so long ago. As an Italian-American, I am greatly troubled by how far too many of those who share my heritage support the current president's anti-immigration policies.
Had he been elected in 1916 instead of 2016, I assure you that he would have been denouncing Italians as the dangerous immigrants to be kept out.

Texto completo: A New Hampshire church will resume services Sunday morning, a week after a shooting during a wedding last Saturday that left a bishop seriously wounded.
New England Pentecostal Ministries in Pelham, N.H., will reopen for services at 11 a.m. Sunday, though Sunday school classes are cancelled, the church announced on its website.
“During this time we understand there are a number of questions and concerns, and our goal is to remain on one accord. This is the time to band together in unity through praise and worship in the Lord, along with fasting and prayer," the statement from the church said.
Dale Holloway, 37, was arrested last Saturday after police said he barged into the church during a wedding and shot Bishop Stanley Choate in the chest and the bride, Claire McMullen, in the arm, before Holloway was tackled to the ground by wedding guests.
Holloway had been released from a Massachusetts prison less than a year ago for beating his estranged girlfriend.
The statement warned that police will be in the parking lot Sunday morning for security, but said churchgoers should not be alarmed.

Radio Golf at Everyman Theatre

Texto completo: It's never the wrong time to do the right thing.
Everyman Theatre is showing Radio Golf, the final play in renowned playwright August Wilson's 10-play opus, 'The American Century Cycle.' Radio Golf brings the "crackle of a comedy with old-fashioned melodrama," according to the New York Times, and highlights the challenges faced by modern-day African Americans straddling the line between monetary success and cultural assimilation.
The play opened Oct. 15 and runs through Nov. 17 at Everyman Theatre, located in the up-and-coming Market Center District of Downtown Baltimore. This is the fourth August Wilson production from Everyman, after Fences (2002 and 2015) and Gem of the Ocean (2008). The Harlem Classical Theatre's Associate Artistic Director Carl Cofield makes his Everyman directorial debut with this play.
Radio Golf tells the story of Harmond Wilks, played by Jamil Mangan, a young African-American real estate developer running for Mayor of Pittsburgh in 1997. He opens a campaign office in the heart of Pittsburgh's Hill District, his childhood neighborhood that's fallen into disrepair.
Together with his business partner Roosevelt, played by Jason B. Mcintosh, and wife Mame, a resident company member Dawn Ursula, Harmond's grand plan to develop a neglected block in order to erect a high-rise apartment complex - complete with a Whole Foods and Starbucks - is challenged by two members of the Hill community, Sterling, played by Anton Floyd, and Elder Joseph Barlow, played by Charles Dumas. Harmond must face his uncovered past and weigh the impact and true costs of his personal progress if he chooses to ignore his heritage and legacy.
"Although Radio Golf is set in 1997, August Wilson saw into the future and started this conversation around life in America for upper-class Black folk," Director Carl Cofield said. "How important is success if you're denying and destroying your family's history and culture in order to get it? It's a modern examination of what the American
Dream means today, and has huge resonance in Baltimore and other urban centers."
Because the themes of neighborhood revitalization and cultural crossover directly affect both the Market Center, Bomo area, and Baltimore at large, Everyman is hosting multiple events that will engage community partners and begin to breach these topics in order to start a dialogue between neighbors and engaged Baltimore supporters. These include a neighborhood cleanup day and community panel discussions.
"We specifically chose to bring Radio Golf to Baltimore because of the mirror it holds up to our neighborhood and how it reflects some of the greatest challenges that Baltimore faces today," says Everyman Founding Artistic Director Vincent M. Lancisi. "August Wilson is one of the most revered playwrights of our age. His legacy of chronicling the American century decade by decade has left us with a treasure trove of great stories. Radio Golf is one that is immediate, relevant, and funny all at the same time."
Radio Golf runs from Oct. 15 - Nov. 17 and you can purchase your tickets online at everymantheatre. org, by phone at (410) 752 -2208, or at the Everyman Theatre Box Office at 315 W. Fayette St., Baltimore, Md.

Texto completo: The New York Times aseguró que Iván Archivaldo Guzmán alias ‘El Chapito’, hermanastro de Ovidio Guzmán López , alias ‘ El Ratón ‘ o ‘ El Nuevo Ratón ‘ fue quien encabezó el rescate del también hijo del narcotraficante Joaquín ‘ El Chapo ‘ Guzmán , exlíder del Cártel de Sinaloa (CDS).
A decir de la publicación, ‘El Chapito’ habría sido detenido inicialmente pero pudo escapar según fuentes pues un grupo de sicarios superó a las fuerzas militares mexicanas.

Leer más: Liberan a Ovidio Guzmán, hijo de El Chapo, poco después de anunciar su captura
‘Una vez libre, el hermano mayor orquestó una asombrosa muestra de fuerza para conseguir la liberación de su hermano, Ovidio’, se lee en la nota en del New York Times en inglés.
‘La acción no sólo consistió en tomar como rehenes a los soldados, sino en secuestrar a sus familias, de acuerdo con las dos personas informadas sobre el asunto, quienes no estaban autorizadas a hablar públicamente’, señaló el periódico.
Según versiones que circularon el día de lo ocurrido pero que no han sido desmentidas ni confirmadas por autoridades, sicarios del Cártel de Sinaloa tenían la orden de asesinar a familiares de elementos castrenses, de los cuales habían obtenido direcciones en caso de que no se llegara a ningún acuerdo para la liberación del hijo de ‘ El Chapo ‘ Guzmán .
Y aunque dichas versiones no han sido confirmadas, basta con recordar las declaraciones del propio presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador ( AMLO ) quien aseguró que respalda a quienes tomaron la decisión de liberar a Ovidio Guzmán López pues estaban en riesgo las vidas de muchos seres humanos, ‘porque no se trata de masacres pues eso ya se terminó’.
Recordemos que el pasado 17 de junio, Ovidio Guzmán , alias ‘ El Ratón ‘, fue detenido por autoridades federales en la capital de Sinaloa, Culiacán, lo que provocó una serie de balaceras y hechos violentos donde se reportó un saldo de 8 muertos, 16 heridos y 51 reos prófugos.

Mattis jabs Trump in comedic address; critics say former secretary should go further

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - For the last year, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has taken heat for his reluctance to criticize President Donald Trump, especially after he resigned in protest last December.
For one night at least, on Thursday, the retired Marine Corps general dropped that tendency as he saturated a comedic keynote address with direct jabs at Trump, who earlier this week called his former Cabinet official "the world's most overrated general."
"I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress," Mattis said in his keynote speech at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York. "So, I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals."
When Mattis stepped down, the former defense secretary, who sparred with Trump over military actions between 2016-18, said the president deserved to have someone "whose views are better aligned." On Sunday, Mattis offered words of caution regarding Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria on "Meet the Press," warning the Islamic State would "resurge" without military pressure.
The president did not appreciate the general airing those concerns.
"You know why?" Trump told lawmakers Wednesday. "He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month."
On Thursday, Mattis also teased Trump for dodging the draft for the Vietnam War because of the "bone spurs" that the president has said he had in both of his heels.
"I earned my spurs on the battlefield," Mattis said. "Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor."
Several high-profile politicians at the dinner, a charity event known for comedic roasts, saluted Mattis's flippant speech. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted a photo of himself chatting with the general after the event.
But for other observers, Mattis' zingers drew attention to the military officer's reticence to substantively criticize the president.
Thomas Nichols, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said he did not think the speech was an occasion for laughter.
"I don't think anyone should be chuckling at Mattis' brush-off of Trump's insult," he wrote on Twitter. "It's his facile way of dodging the reality that he knows a lot about what happened in this White House, including what are now obviously impeachable acts directly related to his time as SECDEF."
Critics contrasted Mattis' jokes with a Thursday op-ed penned by retired Navy Adm. William McRaven in the New York Times that rebuked the president. Titled "Our Republic Is Under Attack From the President," the Navy officer's piece slammed Trump for abandoning the Kurdish soldiers who fought in Syria as America's allies. "He is wrong," McRaven wrote.
Mattis has defended his decision to keep his personal beliefs about the Trump administration private.
"If you leave an administration, you owe some silence," he told the Atlantic in August. "When you leave an administration over clear policy differences, you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country. They still have the responsibility of protecting this great big experiment of ours."

Texto completo: A woman plunged several feet into an open construction zone pit on a Midtown sidewalk Friday afternoon, authorities said.
Emergency responders swarmed to the scene at Eighth Ave. and W. 35th St. about 2:45 p.m. to pull the woman out of the concrete crater, two blocks from Penn Station.
Medics took her to Bellevue Hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening.
Witnesses said the hole was covered, but the woman fell through the lid.
"[The cover] flipped and she dropped like a bag of sand. Like it was trapdoor," wrote New York Times Editor Christopher Mele on Twitter. "She was like two paces ahead of me."
Mele said that the woman "dropped like five feet."
"(It) looked like she hit the back of her head but never lost consciousness but still scary," he wrote.
On Tuesday, Verizon utility workers discovered the decomposed body of a homeless man inside a manhole near Columbus Circle.
The man was later identified by police as Cesar Gabriel Cortez, 41, of Georgia. The city medical examiner will determine the cause of his death.

Texto completo: 'Tis the season for fake spiders, light-up ghosts, tiny candy bars, and tacky costumes. All that Halloween stuff can make your bank account balance look downright scary! So, let's talk about three simple tips for saving money on Halloween.
1. Don't buy name-brand candy
There was a time in my life when I was overly concerned with being the "cool" house on the block. You know, the one with the really legit, exciting candy at Halloween — maybe even some full-size candy bars.
But when I saw the price tag at the store, that need to impress the neighbors left quick. I thought, Nope! Sorry, cute neighbor kids. You're getting the generic brand. I can buy a huge bag of it for half the price!
If you're on a tight budget, don't feel pressured to splurge and get the expensive candy. The kids will get plenty, and they'll all be on sugar highs anyway, so they'll never know the difference.
2. Scale back on Halloween parties
Halloween parties are pretty elaborate these days with huge spreads of food, amazing costumes, and even signature cocktails. If you're hosting or attending one, just be wise with what you spend. After all, Halloween is just one day!
If you're hosting, ask your guests to bring a dish to share. Set a budget for yourself on party supplies and decorations, and stick to it!
If you're attending someone else's party, don't feel pressured to bring the fanciest bottle of wine or go overboard with buying the most impressive costume. You don't want to go into November stressed out about overspending on this one day.
3. You can decide not to celebrate Halloween
Okay, I honestly don't love Halloween. Not for any spiritual or moral reason, it's simply because I'm not creative. And I'm terrible at coming up with costumes! Thankfully, my girls usually want to be princesses. That's something Amazon can fix. But I dread the day when they want something more imaginative. I'm not the mom who just whips up a costume out of odds and ends in my craft closet.
But guess what? No one says we must celebrate Halloween. There's no shame or guilt in a graceful no if Halloween doesn't fit your budget this year. If you sit this holiday out, you'll save so much money on candy, costumes, and ugly plastic partywear. Plus, you'll save time and energy. You can always jump back in next year, when you have room in your budget.

MLB proposal ends Lowell's ties to Sox

Texto completo: The nearly 25-year affiliation between the Lowell Spinners and the Red Sox would end under a radical reorganization proposal from Major League Baseball that leaked Friday, one that would decrease the number of affiliated minor league teams by 25 percent.
Short-season leagues, including the New York-Penn League in which Lowell plays, would be disbanded under the plan, which would eliminate 42 affiliated teams in total. Because MLB views Lowell and the Spinners' home, Edward A. LeLacheur Park, as “good," the franchise would continue to exist in the “Dream League," an MLB concept in line with independent or college leagues.
Also dropping to the Dream League would be the two other New England teams in the NYPL: The Vermont Lake Monsters, affiliated with the Oakland Athletics since 2011 and playing at 113-year-old Centennial Field in Burlington since the franchise formed in 1994, and the (Norwich) Connecticut Tigers.
The overhaul, first reported by Baseball America and the New York Times, has emerged from ongoing and now contentious negotiations between MLB and Minor League Baseball over their Professional Baseball Agreement, which will expire on Sept. 30, 2020.
MLB says the primary motivations for the changes, which emerged from the MLB owners' meetings in June and were presented to MiLB in August, are to ensure its young players play in quality facilities — rather than some of the current dilapidated stadiums, mostly found in the lower leagues — and to create a saner geographic layout for both leagues and MLB franchises.
The cuts would serve to motivate MLB to increase the currently meager salaries it pays minor leaguers, an increasingly plaguing issue.
Minor League Baseball does not accept the premise and the impetus for the proposals.
“We are engaged in negotiations, and while both sides have differing views over what's going on, we hope that there's a resolution available, but we are concerned about saving baseball in as many cities in America as we can, and the proposal that's on the table at this point doesn't give us any comfort that that's even possible," said Pat O'Conner, president and CEO of Minor League Baseball, which oversees the current 16-league, 160-team system. “It's the economics. These ownership groups in these communities are just not going to be able to withstand the additional costs the MLB proposal puts on them."
Through other channels, MiLB castigated MLB for seeking cuts after boasting recently about increased minor-league attendance in the face of decreases in the major leagues. In addition, MiLB intimated that the plan could create a feeling of betrayal among members of the US Congress who, besides holding antitrust authority over MLB, are also invested in maintaining baseball's prosperity at all levels.
Dave Heller, owner of the Lowell Spinners and three other affiliated teams, was not immediately available for comment. The Red Sox referred the matter to MLB for elaboration; MLB declined to comment.
The “120 plan" wants to reduce the total number of teams from 160 to 120 and eliminate short-season leagues. It also addresses geographical gerrymandering in places like the Triple A Pacific Coast League, whose 16 teams are spread out from Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee to Tacoma, Wash., and Sacramento.
Each big-league franchise would be limited to four US based full-season franchises, plus one complex-based Rookie-league team.
No other teams in the Red Sox system — Pawtucket/Worcester (Triple A), Portland, Maine (Double A); Salem, Va. (High A); Greenville, S.C. (Single A); and its Gulf Coast squad (Rookie) in Fort Myers, Fla. — would be eliminated or moved out of their league, although there is a high probability that the Single A Carolina and South Atlantic Leagues will be rejiggered and/or drastically reduced.
The “120 plan" calls for a cap on total players under minor-league contract, between 150–200 per franchise, according to an industry source. (Dominican Summer League teams and roster sizes would not be affected.) Including Lowell, the Red Sox have space for 190 minor-league contracts in their system.
Roster sizes of teams would also be altered. With an emphasis on health and wellness for its players closest to being called up, MLB wants to increase the roster size in Double A and Triple A up from 25, which would allow for more player off days, the ability to carry an additional catcher, reduce workloads on pitchers, and effectively create a more serviceable taxi squad.
Also, the “120 plan" seeks to push back the date of the amateur draft from early June to later in the month, after the conclusion of the College World Series.

Texto completo: An incredible story of amnesia and family trauma hits Netflix, and the tale of Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn's friendship airs on Lifetime.
What's Streaming
TELL ME WHO I AM Stream on Netflix. At age 18, Alex Lewis woke up from a weeklong coma to discover that he had survived a devastating motorcycle accident, but lost most of his memory. At the hospital, he realizes he can't remember who he is, how to walk or anything about his past -- but he recognizes his identical twin brother, Marcus. This documentary follows the story of Alex's recovery with Marcus as his guide, filling him in on the details of his childhood. But roughly a decade later, after the twins' mother dies, Alex starts to question whether the childhood Marcus reconstructed for him was truthful, going on to uncover childhood trauma that he and his brother experienced before the accident. In his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny wrote that although the brothers recounted their story in a 2013 memoir, the film "functions as a continuation of the book, and ends in a staggering sequence in which Marcus is finally able to relay the whole truth to his brother."
THE BLOB Stream on Criterion Channel. Sometimes, there's nothing scarier than something that can't be explained, and that's at the heart of what's terrorizing a rural Pennsylvania town in this 1958 horror film. "Well it's kind of like ... it's kind of like a mass; it keeps getting bigger and bigger," the protagonist, Steve (Steve McQueen), says as he struggles to describe it to the local police. As Steve tries to warn the town, the gelatinous villain goes on to gobble up the local mechanic and invade the movie theater. Then people discover its weakness. While the film was not particularly well received by critics at the time, it has become a cult classic that has inspired a festival in Phoenixville, Pa., one of the filming locations.
LOOKING FOR ALASKA Stream on Hulu. Charlie Plummer stars in this television adaptation of John Green's book that's based on the author's experiences at boarding school in Alabama. Miles (Plummer), a transfer student at Culver Creek Preparatory High School, ingratiates himself with a gang of new friends, and becomes captivated by Alaska (Kristine Froseth), a fellow classmate who's coping with her mother's death. The eight-part limited series follows their relationship, and the unexpected tragedy that affects Miles and his new friends.
What's on TV
PATSY & LORETTA 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Two Broadway stars portray country music stars in this Lifetime movie about Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn's friendship. Already well established in her career, Cline (Megan Hilty) takes a young Lynn (Jessie Mueller) under her wing, helping her navigate the male-dominated Nashville music industry. They soon become close friends, touring together and working to balance their family lives with life on the road. Callie Khouri, who wrote "Thelma & Louise" and created the TV series "Nashville," directs.

Can the Left Save Liberalism?

Texto completo: America's dual faith in individual liberty and democracy is under attack by the president's populism.
As the author of a recent book titled "What Was Liberalism?," I have been chided by critics for joining a chorus of doomsayers. The stock of liberalism certainly looked low in 2016, when I began my research: Donald Trump was elected president and the British decided to leave the European Union. But Mr. Trump's approval ratings have never climbed above the mid-40s, while the British seem to be regretting their rash decision. The popularity of nativist and reactionary parties in Europe has receded from its high-water mark of two or three years ago. So many liberal Democrats have decided to run against Mr. Trump that they can't fit in one room.
If a liberal is simply someone who agrees with the traditional Democratic platform, then it's safe to say that the rumors of liberalism's demise are, at the very least, premature. Nor, despite Mr. Trump's relentless insistence that the party has surrendered its agenda to the left-wing "Squad," have most liberals abandoned their core faith in free markets or their instinctive patriotism. The ranks of the slightly-left-of-center have, if anything, grown under Trump.
But there is an older understanding of liberalism that is deeply endangered, that will not revive on its own, that will be rescued only through conscious choices by liberals themselves.
What I have in mind is a liberalism more of means than of ends, a belief that individual and minority-group rights can be protected only in a society governed by the rule of law, neutral institutions and secular, rational debate. This broader doctrine, which encompasses both the modern left and the modern right, has a disputed genealogy. Some begin their story with John Locke, with the idea of government created by individuals for their own benefit. Others begin with Adam Smith, the first exponent of the doctrine of the free market.
I start with James Madison, who was as committed as either Locke or Smith to the supremacy of individual liberty but was acutely aware of the inherent tension between liberty and democracy. Madison recognized that "the people" can be as tyrannical as a monarch. It is not enough, he wrote in Federalist 51, "to guard the society against the oppression of the rulers"; it is equally necessary "to guard one part of the society against the oppression of the other part." What we now call a "liberal democracy" is a state where majoritarianism is tempered by a respect for individual rights as well as the rights of political or ethnic minorities.
The opposite of liberalism is not conservatism, as we understand the term in modern America, but populism. The illiberal populism of Donald Trump, Hungary's Viktor Orban or Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, each of whom was more or less fairly elected, entails the cynical and reckless use of the mechanisms of democracy to disenfranchise political minorities, politicize the state, stigmatize immigrants and other "outsiders," and diminish civil liberties. Populists address an exclusionary "us." As Mr. Trump himself once put it with rare clarity, "The only important thing is the unification of the people -- because the other people don't mean anything." Populism is democracy without liberalism.
We suffer from a confusion of terms, and not only in regard to liberalism. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are routinely referred to as "populists," including in this newspaper, presumably because they assail the rich. But so did Theodore Roosevelt. In his day, as in ours, the rich vacuumed up almost all the value produced by the economy. Does pointing that out make you a populist? Does denying that claim, or endorsing the virtues of gross inequality, mean that you are not a populist? The thought is absurd. None of the Democratic candidates would talk about, or treat, "the people" as Mr. Trump has done. They are not populists. Are they liberals? Bernie Sanders -- who calls himself a socialist, opposes free trade and shows very little regard for the working of the free market -- is not. I have my doubts about Elizabeth Warren. But they're not populists either.
Today, paradoxically, it is not liberals but conservatives who endanger liberalism. The secular, free-market conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan accepted the basic apparatus of a liberal society. But Mr. Reagan also welcomed into the party extremists and conservative evangelicals who thought about politics in far more absolute terms. Over time, those groups took over the host body of the Republicans, leaving us with an illiberal party that represents half the country. Today's Republican leaders, with the vehement support of their base, have threatened the autonomy of the federal and state judiciary, treated intelligence and law-enforcement agencies as instruments of the "deep state," attacked the press and pulled down the empire of science, reason and fact into the mire of "fake news."
It may be that a combination of the impending impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and a Democratic victory in 2020 will break the illiberal fever. Certainly any imaginable Democratic victor would put an end to attacks on the government and the press. But it is not, in the end, the formal rules and institutions that sustain liberal democracy. It is the widespread faith in them, what we call "norms." Forty years of swelling illiberalism on the right -- and some reciprocal illiberalism on the left -- have deeply corroded that faith.
So what can a Democratic president do to restore liberal norms? The resentment that Mr. Trump has exploited is plainly rooted in decades of middle-class stagnation and rising inequality. A left-of-center candidate like Elizabeth Warren would drain the toxins with bold moves to lower the cost of public goods like education and health care and yank the billionaires down from their stratosphere.
Liberals would like to consign the whole problem to economics, the language of which is second nature to them. Reaching into the national culture runs against the grain of their policy-oriented ethos. And didn't Barack Obama spend eight years trying to bridge the divide between red and blue America, only to find it deeper at the end than it had been at the beginning? As intellectually conscientious a president as we are ever likely to have, Mr. Obama rarely strayed from the language of reason -- but he left behind a nation consumed by unreason.
Yet to abandon that effort is to accept a new version of "us" and "them," but with the Trumpian terms reversed. Modern liberalism came into being with Franklin Roosevelt, who forged a collective language of "we" without abandoning the "I" of individual liberty to which Madison and Jefferson had devoted themselves. Polarization has persuaded growing numbers of people on the left that the national "we" is a fiction propagated by straight white men. They would challenge Mr. Trump's white-identity politics with an "other identity" politics that emphasizes the intrinsic difference of historically marginalized groups, whether African-Americans or L.G.B.T.Q. persons, rather than their right to full membership in the national community. This is a recipe for endless cultural warfare, and it will not be easy, especially for an ideologically driven figure like Senator Warren, to resist that tidal pull.
In a rare slip that exposed his true feelings, Mr. Obama once said that "bitter" people "cling to guns or religion," or racism, xenophobia or protectionism, "as a way to explain their frustrations." The clear implication is that while liberal values like diversity, unlimited personal autonomy and secularism are universal, conservative values are a kind of pathology. Most liberals, at least under truth serum, would probably say the same.
A Democratic president, whatever his or her actual feelings, will have to take conservative values more seriously, as long as they share the same liberal root system. Democrats on the left hardly believe that only bitter people want to restrict free trade. They should accept that the same is true of people who want to see limits on immigration or balk at the modern politics of gender.
The poisons that now corrupt our national bloodstream will not be washed clean by a Democratic victory in 2020. That would only mark the beginning of liberal renewal.

Texto completo: Amazon wants you to just love a little bit again.
The streaming service's new anthology series, "Modern Love," is based on The New York Times column about the different ways we love in the contemporary world. This can be love in a marriage, sure, but also between a paternal doorman and a tenant, a couple on a second date or any other way we express or acquire the emotion, or lose it. Or almost lose it.
The fourth and best episode of the series, "Rallying to Keep the Game Alive," is about a marriage on the verge of collapse, a husband (John Slattery) and wife (Tina Fey) who aren't sure what they will have in common after their growing children leave the house. They eventually find their way back to each other, through admitting their failures, putting the past in the past and playing a lot of tennis.
The episode is instantly relatable for those who have been in long-term relationships that require care and maintenance, and who go through rough patches that seem to have no end. Its universality makes it even more surprising that the episode is based on a column written by "Rescue Me" actor Denis Leary's wife, Ann.
Slattery's "Dennis" is an actor of at least some fame and wealth (his fabulous New York apartment and a fan encounter make that clear), and his wife, Sarah, is often aggrieved by the lifestyle of partying and affirmation that being an actor has afforded him.
But their problems are deeper than fans coming up to him in restaurants or her being kept at arms' length from the fabulous parties he attends. They're about the resentment built up between them when they didn't notice, a frustration that they can't even discuss openly at marriage counseling sessions. It isn't until they give up on therapy and share a resigned meal that the real problems they confront come to the surface, so they can start addressing them. Eventually, the rhythms of tennis help their relationship rally, quite literally.
Over its eight episodes, "Love" uncynically embraces sentiment, a tone that's welcome in some episodes and distinctly mawkish in others (the final episode's attempt to tie them all together in a saccharine montage is fully on the side of cloying and annoying). "Rallying" finds a space for a small amount of skepticism about the sheer power of love without losing a hopeful mood. It also has a sardonic humor that's distinctly missing in other episodes.
The notion that no amount of money or fame can solve love's limits is reassuring. We all struggle, but some of us overcome and "stay in the game. "

Texto completo: With three polls showing her in the lead, Sen. Elizabeth Warren may soon eclipse former Vice President Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.
A Marist poll asked voters whether "the economy is working well for you personally." Nearly two-thirds of Americans said "yes." This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group. Sixty- seven percent of college graduates and 64 percent of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68 percent of whites, and 61 percent of nonwhite people. So do Americans of every generation. So do supermajorities in every region in the country.
The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59 percent), Democratic women (55 percent) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55 percent). So, when Warren declares that President Trump is "part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else," it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.
There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And The New York Times reported in May that "over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases." Americans don't just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday's debate.
This progress is bad news for Warren. Why on earth would Americans rally to her call for "big structural change" to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and - whether she admits it or not - would require them to pay more in taxes?
Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren's proposals: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for "Medicare for All"; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion for free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. "Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion," Riedl says. There's no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren's wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.
No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren at Tuesday's debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination. To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump. They can't do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.
If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And since Warren said Tuesday that if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will "repeal the filibuster," she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump's message - "whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me" - will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

In a relationship with 'Modern Love'

Texto completo: Television review
MODERN LOVE
Starring: Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, Tina Fey, Dev Patel, Julia Garner, John Slattery, Andrew Scott, Andy Garcia, Shea Whigham, Laurentiu Possa, Catherine Keener
On: Amazon, first season available Friday
In the first episode of the likable new anthology series “Modern Love," Cristin Milioti plays Maggie, a single New Yorker whose apartment doorman acts like a guard. When she arrives home with dates, the stiffly uniformed Guzmin — played with a masterfully cryptic deadpan by Laurentiu Possa — stands like a sentry at the building entrance, his disapproval clear. His protectiveness appears threatening, like he's a mobster. We never see Maggie's parents, as the half-hour called “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man" unfolds amid the city grid; just Guzmin, his severe cap, and his portentous face.
I love it that the Amazon series, available Friday, starts off with a tale that's not about conventional romance. While the eight half-hours of “Modern Love" have the sparkling feel of urban romantic comedy, they're about the very many faces of love out there in the world — between lovers, yes, but also between friends, between people tossed together by circumstance, between a birth mother and the gay couple adopting her baby. “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man" shows, with wry warmth, how you can find fierce devotion and shelter in unexpected corners of a cold, bustling city of strangers. You can't always predict who is going to fill a familial role in your life, and in your heart.
The adaptation of the New York Times column of the same name was created by Irish writer-director John Carney of “Once" and “Sing Street," and he brings just the right touch to almost every episode (he wrote and directed most; the other writers and directors include Sharon Horgan, Emmy Rossum, and Dan Savage). OK, so there's a bit of corniness here and there; the charm of the whole project makes its excesses tolerable, as does the swiftness of the storytelling. Carney & Co. consistently keep the focus on the protagonist's point of view, without elaborate side detours or embellishment, just like in the newspaper columns. Each half-hour knows exactly what it's about and goes there elegantly. You could say that the show is the “Twilight Zone" of love, without all the science fiction, oppressive doom, and broken watches, of course. It's a collection of small stories that share a broad theme, as well as a city that only seems to hinder love.
There were two episodes that didn't take off for me, for one reason or another. Much as I enjoyed watching Tina Fey and John Slattery as a couple on the verge of splitting, the static episode, called “Rallying to Keep the Game Alive," relies too heavily on the tennis metaphor that, in the original newspaper piece by Ann Leary, wife of Denis Leary, works well. And an episode in which a young woman (Julia Garner) seeks approval — but not romance — from a much-older man, fails, to a cringing effect, to make its meaning clear. That's the nature of anthology shows; they are usually uneven, and you get to start afresh with each new chapter. And unlike Amazon's “The Romanoffs," Matthew Weiner's extremely uneven anthology of hour-long-plus episodes, the misses pass by briskly.
The only truly edgy episode is called “Take Me as I Am, Whoever I Am," and it stars Anne Hathaway as a bipolar woman named Lexi who has kept her diagnosis to herself. We see her dancing and singing glamorously in choreographed scenes set in the supermarket, as she rides a manic phase. And then we see her unable to get out of bed, lying her way through absences at work, profoundly depressed. Can Lexi ever find love? Will she explain to the man she just met the reason for her erratic behavior? I found the episode absorbing and moving, as a woman braving her illness alone reaches her breaking point. I also liked a far lower-stakes episode starring Dev Patel as a tech wiz and Catherine Keener as the magazine interviewer who schools him on lost love and regret.
By now it's probably clear that “Modern Love" is not for viewers who can't suspend their cynicism for a few hours. There is plenty of earnestness afoot, even when it's lurking just under the surface, and there are a few happy endings, too. For me, it felt like a holiday from all the more demanding narratives on TV right now, a pleasing distraction from brooding superheroes, toxic media moguls, and an endless number of crimes that always need solving.

Texto completo: Steven Soderbergh's latest film hits Netflix. And a new series based on a column in The New York Times debuts on Amazon.
What's Streaming
THE LAUNDROMAT (2019) Stream on Netflix. Private jets. White suits. Backyard pools sloshing around the bellies of manicured lawns. These are some of the many accouterments of wealth seen in this latest feature from Steven Soderbergh. Adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Jake Bernstein, the film tells a collection of stories related to the Panama Papers. At its center are Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman, who play seedy partners in a Panama City-based law firm that helps the very rich stay wealthy through many flavors of trickery. The pair's most prominent victim here is Ellen Martin, a Midwestern widow played by Meryl Streep who catches on to the firm's dishonesty when she tries to settle an insurance claim after her husband's death. Also in the cast: Sharon Stone, Jeffrey Wright and Matthias Schoenaerts. "The film's subject matter could hardly be more urgent," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. But, Scott wrote, the movie "conducts its business with brisk, breezy irreverence. It's a didactic comedy, an earnest lesson in political economy dressed up as a farce."
MODERN LOVE Stream on Amazon. A piece of insight from Anne Hathaway (or a character of hers, at least): "If you can find love in a supermarket early in the morning, you know you can trust it." That line is spoken by Hathaway's character in this new series, which is based on stories from the long-running column in The Times that collects personal essays about relationships. Hathaway stars opposite Gary Carr in an episode where a meet cute happens in the produce section of a Fairway Market. Cast members in other episodes include Tina Fey, Dev Patel, John Slattery, Andy Garcia, Catherine Keener and Andrew Scott.
TEEN SPIRIT (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Max Minghella, the English actor known for playing the two-faced Nick Blaine on "The Handmaid's Tale," made his directing debut with this music-infused drama. The film stars Elle Fanning as Violet, a British teenager who quickly goes from singing in a dingy bar to participating in an international competition that could make her a pop star. "Conflicts, naturally, arise (with Rebecca Hall briefly slapping the movie out of its fairy-tale daze as a music-industry vulture with a dubious contract offer)," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times, "yet Minghella refuses to be distracted from his waiflike star or her internal ache." Catsoulis called the movie "both proudly clichéd and refreshingly different."
What's on TV
SID & JUDY (2019) 8:05 p.m. on Showtime. It has been five decades since the death of Judy Garland, who has been getting renewed attention this fall as the subject of the biopic "Judy." In that movie, Renée Zellweger plays Garland during the final period of her life. For a different kind of look at the singer's career, consider this documentary, which is peppered with voice-overs from Jennifer Jason Leigh (as Garland) and Jon Hamm (as Garland's third husband, Sid Luft), in addition to archival footage.

1,713 Huge Boilers In Public Housing, And Winter Looms

Texto completo: The seven steel boilers should have been replaced years ago.
Instead, they continue to sputter inside a cavernous brick building, producing steam that travels through a maze of old pipes providing heat and hot water to the Breukelen Houses in Canarsie, Brooklyn, a public housing complex where 3,500 people live.
On a recent morning, a masked welder squeezed into the dark chamber of boiler No. 7. One of its metal plates had corroded, and the boiler, built in 1985, needed to be patched up with a new one. Nearby stood a new 15-foot-long steel tank that collects water for the boilers to heat back to steam; it was free of punctures or leaks.
"The old one was completely rotting," said Anthony Picciano, a superintendent who oversees heating plants in Brooklyn developments run by the New York City Housing Authority, or NYCHA.
As winter approaches, the city is racing to ready boilers in the nation's largest public housing system, where widespread heat outages have repeatedly left many of its 400,000 low-income residents shivering in their homes. Many of the boilers are old; some were built in the 1950s. With temperatures dropping, the fragile, antiquated heating network imperils a large portion of public housing residents: children, older residents and people with health conditions.
Providing consistent heat is only one challenge in a long list of woes for the agency, which oversees 176,000 subsidized apartments. NYCHA is under the supervision of a federal monitor after federal prosecutors accused it of years of mismanagement. In addition to heating inadequacies, the agency has a history of failing to rid its apartments of mold and lead paint.
More than half of the housing authority's 1,713 boilers -- some made by companies that no longer exist -- are more than 20 years old, the typical life span of a boiler.
Following years of underfunding and poor maintenance, nearly half are in critical condition and need major repairs or replacement.
Pipes that circulate steam to apartments are crumbling, aging buildings are poorly insulated and radiators need to be overhauled.
Replicating changes implemented last winter, the agency has set up a centralized command center to respond to outages more quickly and has staffed technicians around the clock. NYCHA recently submitted a 10-year plan to the federal monitor outlining how it plans to replace its worst boilers.
The agency plans to recruit an additional 70 heating plant technicians, significantly more than last winter, but still 100 workers shy of the number it ideally needs, said Joey Koch, a senior vice president at the authority. The new technicians are not new hires but caretakers who are being promoted.
"We're reading data in a different kind of a way," Ms. Koch said. "We've started really tracing the causes of the problem so that we can accurately fix them, thinking strategically about where to invest whatever money we get, whether it's capital or expense dollars."
Two winters ago, a spell of bone-chilling temperatures exposed the vulnerabilities of NYCHA's decrepit boilers: More than 80 percent of residents experienced at least one outage and were left to fend off the cold by boiling water or opening gas ovens. The agency's then-chairwoman, Shola Olatoye, resigned several months later, following punishing headlines and a scathing City Council hearing at which she refused to apologize.
Housing officials said they made strides last winter, even though more than 131,000 apartments lost heat or hot water at least once. There were fewer heat outages reported last winter than during the previous one, and the average time to restore heat went down from 30 hours to eight hours, officials said.
But as it started to get cold again, those improvements meant little to residents of the Breukelen Houses. It was among the developments with the most outages last winter.
Residents there had no heat or hot water 25 times from Oct. 1, 2018, to May 1, 2019 -- the city's heat season.
During the heat season, landlords are legally required to maintain inside temperatures at a minimum of 68 degrees if the temperature outside falls below 55 degrees. Regardless of outside temperature, apartments must be at least 62 degrees inside at night.
Even with electronic sensors that record temperatures at a handful of developments, federal prosecutors found that NYCHA's own records show temperatures routinely drop below the legal minimum at thousands of apartments.
"NYCHA is crippling the same people, the same tenants, who have been paying their rent and coming home to a frozen apartment, which is not so much illegal as it is unsafe," said Calvin Dumgo, 59, a lifetime resident and former tenant association president of the 31-building development.
As a result, Breukelen residents threatened to withhold rent last winter.
Earlier this year, NYCHA told the office of Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn, that new boilers wouldn't be installed until at least 2023, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times. However, Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that there was not a concrete date for the new boilers.
Last Friday, as outside temperatures hovered in the low 60s and dropped to the mid 50s at night, residents said they were beginning to feel cold inside their homes.
"Even my dogs have sweaters on today," said Alexandra del Castillo, 48, a school bus driver and mother of two who has lived at the Breukelen Houses for 22 years. "We withstand too much cold here," she said, adding that her family typically relies on two electric space heaters, not the apartment's radiators.
It probably doesn't help that more than half of NYCHA's buildings, like those at the Breukelen Houses, were built in the 1950s or earlier. Their insulation and piping systems are below today's standard for new construction, causing heat leaks and inefficiencies. It's also why residents at some developments often speak of a different problem: apartments so overheated that people end up opening windows in the middle of winter.
Identifying the source of an outage can be complex. It could come from a breakdown in a boiler room, a leak in the pipes that send steam to buildings or a failure in the vertical risers that carry heat up to homes -- all of which can set off a domino effect and make the entire system collapse.
"One of the things I think folks don't understand is the chance of a component failure anywhere along that chain," said Gregory Russ, the agency's recently appointed chairman. "Any of those component failures, depending on what it is, can lead to a heat outage in a building. It's not simply that the boiler isn't firing."
Moving forward, Mr. Russ said he was looking to holistically assess buildings to address not only old boilers but other factors that could make buildings greener and more efficient. Some experts and environmental groups have suggested that the most sustainable and cost-effective solution is moving away from steam heating, an energy-inefficient and fossil-fuel-heavy method that is the century-old norm in most of the city.
Many of those investments, however, would require significant funding which NYCHA doesn't have: Its buildings need more than $ 32 billion to overhaul elevators, roofs and apartment interiors.
In looking forward, the housing authority could learn from its past.
Some of NYCHA's most reliable boilers are also its oldest: Three hulking boilers beneath the Berry Houses, an eight-building development on Staten Island that only experienced one outage last winter, have roared to life every day since 1954.
How have the 20-foot boilers, which were manufactured by Fitzgibbons, a now-defunct boiler company from upstate New York, endured? Possibly because "some old things were built better than your newer stuff," said Gary Dubner, a heat plant technician at the development.
Then there's the fact that Mr. Dubner and his colleague, Brian Dwyer, have cared for the boilers every day for the past 25 years, consistently treating the water with the right chemicals so the machinery doesn't rot.
Mr. Dubner has forged a deep connection with the boilers: Even before he opens the door to the boiler room each morning, he can tell if there's a problem just by the sound they're making. High turnover of technicians at other locations, he said, was something NYCHA could address to retain workers who know the equipment intimately.
On a recent visit, the two men had already spent three days prepping each boiler for winter, taking them apart and cleaning out the soot and built-up scale.
"How do they still work?" Mr. Dubner said. "By loving care."

Texto completo: There’s no excuse not to see some dance this weekend. You might not be able to avoid it. Dance will be everywhere.
Tonight (Thursday, Oct. 16) and tomorrow at the Cedar , the dance duo Hijack (Arwen Wilder and Kristin Van Loon), with other local dancers, will premiere a new work by Mexico City-based Galia Eibenschutz , the 2019 McKnight International Choreographer. Eibenschutz integrates drawing into her performances, so the walls and floor of the Cedar will be covered with paper for drawing by dancers.
Bringing Eibenschutz here for a monthlong residency took “a visa application that weighed five pounds and a classically nail-biting wait from immigration offices,” according to the Cedar. Her piece will be performed to original live music on drums by New York-based Katelyn Farstad, who will open the show as her alter-ego Itch Princess. This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Thursday’s show will be followed by a public reception, Friday’s by a conversation with the artists. Doors at 7 p.m., show at 7:30. FMI and tickets ($15).
TU Dance continues to tour “Come Through” with Bon Iver. Commissioned by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra’s Liquid Music series, the smash hit collaboration that premiered here in 2018 has upcoming dates in Brooklyn, Houston and New Orleans, among other cities. Friday-Sunday at the O’Shaughnessy , the esteemed dance company founded by former Alvin Ailey dancers Uri Sands and Toni Pierce-Sands will perform their 16th season fall concert. The program will feature two works Uri choreographed for other companies, including “Tracks,” set to the music of the O’Jays; the repertory favorite solo piece “Clear as Tear Water”; and a reprise of “Salve,” a dance about healing. FMI and tickets ($24-34).
The Cowles Center will host the 5th annual Twin Cities Tap Festival , a weekend of explosive rhythms and infectious joy that will start Thursday with a student showcase and continue Friday with a concert. The showcase will feature top local tap talent (try saying that five times fast) and youth ensembles including Keane Sense of Rhythm and Elite Tap Feet. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($15-20). The concert will shine a light on local and national tap artists Sarah Reich, Bril Barrett, Jeannie Hill and members of Dorrance Dance. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($28-34). Tip: Use promo code 5TAPS19 when ordering showcase and concert tickets, save 20%.
On Saturday , the festival will tap its way to Northrop for the return of Dorrance Dance , the award-winning New York City-based company that made its memorable Northrop debut in 2015. Performing to music by Jelly Roll Morton, Radiohead’s Thom Yorke and a live ensemble, the company will dance “Jungle Blues,” “Three to One” and “Myelination,” named for the change in nerve cells that allows impulses to move more quickly. All were choreographed by Michelle Dorrance, a 2015 MacArthur Fellow. “Myelination” will include improvisation by the dancers. Here’s a preview. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($21-50).
Are you free tomorrow morning (Friday, Oct. 17) ? Three women of Ragamala Dance – founder and co-artistic director Ranee Ramaswamy, co-artistic director Aparna Ramaswamy and choreographic associate Ashwini Ramaswamy – won’t be dancing, but they will be talking about their artistic process, their intergenerational creative partnership, and more at Paikka in St. Paul. Tickets are free. Coffee and breakfast will be available. 8:30-10 a.m. FMI. P.S. Ashwini will dance in November at the Lab.
The picks
Now at Open Book: Ten Thousand Things: “The Winter’s Tale.” TTT has a long history of presenting Shakespeare as human-scale stories, not sacred literature, and making Shakespearean language sound normal. In her second year as artistic director, Marcela Lorca carries on the tradition with “The Winter’s Tale,” featuring a stellar cast and music by Peter Vitale and J.D. Steele. After touring to prisons and community sites, the show has moved into Open Book (through Oct. 27), after which it will travel to North Garden Theater in St. Paul and the Sheldon Theater in Red Wing. FMI and tickets (prices vary). Closes in Red Wing on Nov. 17. P.S. Earlier this month, Lorca became the first Twin Cities-based director/choreographer to win the prestigious Fichandler Award from the Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation. Joseph Haj, the Guthrie’s artistic director, also has a Fichandler; he won his in 2014, before coming to the Twin Cities.
Tonight (Thursday, Oct. 17) at the Minnesota Museum of American Art: Curator Tour of “History Is Not Here: Art and the Arab Imaginary.” This exhibit at the M features work by 17 Arab artists – paintings, photographs, video, installations, book art – that challenges stereotypes and opens eyes and minds. Walk in off the street and you might find it daunting. Walk through with Laura Werthem Joseph, the museum’s new curator of exhibitions, and you’ll get an inside perspective on the themes and artists. 6 p.m. Free, but RSVP requested. Also 2 p.m. on Nov. 17.
Tonight through Saturday: 9th Annual 10,000 Laughs Comedy Festival. If it’s comedy you want, you’re in the right place. For this year’s 10,000 Laughs, Mystic Lake has partnered with Acme Comedy Club to bring stand-up into venues across Minneapolis, from the 70-seat Comedy Corner Underground to the 400-seat Parkway. National headliners – people who have appeared on “The Daily Show,” “The Tonight Show,” “Conan,” “Colbert,” Comedy Central, Netfllix and more – will convene to make you laugh, along with unknowns who will try their darnedest. Headliners will include Aparna Nancherla, Josh Johnson, Doug Benson, Brian Posehn, Dan Cummins and Ryan O’Flanagan. Here’s the complete schedule. We love the idea of the “Funny 20,” which will take place at the Uptown VFW on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. Twenty comics will each deliver one joke, maximum length one minute. And “Don’t Tell,” a midnight Friday show of secret comedians at a secret Northeast Minneapolis location, with free drinks. FMI and tickets.
Friday morning through Sunday: Richard Egarr Plays Bach. One of the SPCO’s two new artistic partners, Egarr will debut in that role with an all-Baroque program of music by Bach and Telemann. Egarr, a harpsichordist, also serves as music director of the Academy of Ancient Music and has, ahem, made several recordings with them. Plus he has a large solo discography. He first performed with the SPCO in March 2017. 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. Friday at the Ordway Concert Hall, 8 p.m. Saturday at St. Paul’s United Church of Christ, and 3 p.m. Sunday at St. Andrew’s Lutheran Church in Mahtomedi. FMI and tickets ($11-50; children and students free).
Friday and Saturday: Minnesota Orchestra. Two nights, two concerts, both led by Osmo Vänskä, each featuring northside artists and performers (including North Community High School’s high-voltage dance troupe) and Aaron Dworkin’s “The American Rhapsody” as its centerpiece. Friday’s concert is at North Community High School , Saturday’s at Orchestra Hall. Dworkin’s new work combines spoken word with composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s “Symphonic Variations on an African Air.” Both concerts are at 7 p.m. FMI and tickets f0r Friday and Saturday (both choose-your-price starting at $5).
Sunday at LynLake Brewery: “Atlas Obscura” Trivia with Dylan Thuras and Magers & Quinn. Among our favorite nonpolitical e-newsletters (besides New York Times Cooking) comes from Atlas Obscura, with a daily dose of “the world’s hidden wonders.” Just the other day, we learned something about China’s chopstick industry. It can’t hurt, right? Originally founded as a media company, Atlas Obscura has evolved into a travel and experiences company that recently partnered with Airbnb. But it still publishes a best-selling book by the same name (the second edition just came out), and co-author Dylan Thuras will be here to lead us through a night of travel and location-themed trivia. Event starts at 6 p.m., trivia at 7. Buy a copy of the book and get $1 off a beer.

Texto completo: * Correction appended.
Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, will resign as secretary of energy later this year, President Donald Trump said during a visit to Texas on Thursday.
Perry drew scrutiny after being entangled in the president's efforts to push Ukraine officials to investigate the son of a political rival.
Perry's resignation was anticipated for several weeks, prior to news coming out about his involvement in the Ukraine scandal, in which Trump made efforts to convince the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate a company that formerly worked with Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to The New York Times.
At Louis Vuitton's Rochambeau Ranch in Johnson County on Thursday afternoon, Trump told reporters Perry will leave at the end of the year and that he had been aware for months that Perry planned to resign. Trump added that he already has a replacement for Perry and will be announcing that name "very shortly."
"Rick has done a fantastic job. But it was time," Trump said, according to White House pool reports. "He told me at the end of the year he’d like to go, and he’s got some ideas about doing something else. He’s a terrific guy."
Later Thursday, the president called Perry "very successful" during a campaign rally in Dallas.
"He spent three years with us and I want to thank you, Rick," Trump said.
Trump denied that the replacement would be Gov. Greg Abbott or Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
Calling Perry a good friend, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said in a statement Thursday that he wished his fellow Republican well "as he returns to private life" after a long public career.
“He went from being Texas’ longest-serving governor to heading the Department of Energy, where he was a leading advocate for U.S. energy, including liquefied natural gas," Cruz said. "Under his leadership, U.S. oil and gas production has soared — with much of that new production coming from Texas — and the United States has become a net exporter of natural gas, creating good-paying jobs, providing cleaner and more affordable energy, and boosting America’s energy independence."
Emma Platoff contributed reporting.
Correction: A previous version of this misattributed a quote said by Sen. Ted Cruz. It also gave the incorrect name for the location where Trump told reporters that Perry will leave at the end of the year. Trump said that in Johnson County.

Celibacy benefits: 6 ways it improves your emotional and mental health

Texto completo: In September 2019, actress Linda Hamilton — best known for her portrayal of Sarah Connor in the Terminator films — revealed to The New York Times that she’d been practicing celibacy for 15 years. Not surprisingly, this piqued the public’s interest.
Here was this celebrity, openly embracing the choice not to have sex. Not for religious reasons, but simply because it is her choice. So, this got us thinking: Everyone always talks about the health benefits of having sex, but are there benefits of abstaining from it as well?
To find out, we reached out to a few sex and health experts, whose answers might surprise you. Whether you’ve intentionally sworn off sex or you’re just in a dry spell, prepare to have your feelings about celibacy bolstered by the ways being celibate can boost your health.
1. IT GIVES YOU MORE MENTAL FOCUS AND CLARITY
There are actually a few purely practical health benefits to being celibate. Adina Mahalli, a certified relationship consultant and sexual health expert for Maple Holistics, discussed with us how not having sex frees up your focus.
“Sex is great, but thinking about it all the time can easily cloud your judgment and inhibit logical and clear thinking. The common saying ‘thinking with your little head instead of your big head’ demonstrates this issue. Sex is an incredibly complicated and deep act that affects people’s emotional state, brain chemistry and hormones,” explained Mahalli, adding, “Abstaining from sex can help people who are looking to make more logical judgements in their lives or to think more clearly. ”
Per Mahalli, it only takes a few months of being celibate (including masturbation) for your sex drive to drop enough to increase your ability to look at situations more logically. “Abstinence is also a way to help realign your emotions, brain chemistry and hormone levels if you feel that something may be wrong in any of those areas. This physiological alignment, mental clarity and logical thinking can benefit you in multiple areas in your life — work, social life and even help you find a suitable partner,” said Mahalli.
2. IT ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD A MORE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP FOUNDATION
And speaking of relationships, Mahalli points out that being celibate while in a relationship can strengthen it. “When getting into a new relationship, sex can easily cloud your perception of your new partner because of oxytocin release (the love chemical) in the brain,” she said. “This chemical is released but is slowed after about six months, which is why the vast majority of relationships either end or begin to develop issues at this time. ”

3. BEING CELIBATE EXEMPLIFIES A TYPE OF CONSENSUAL SEX LIFE
What’s also interesting to note is that not being celibate and being sex-positive are not mutually exclusive. Dr. Carol Queen — author of The Sex & Pleasure Book: Good Vibrations Guide to Sex for Everyone, as well as a staff sexologist and curator of the Antique Vibrator Museum — elaborated on this point.
“The important element here is that the celibate person has chosen to be celibate. Sex-positive doesn’t mean that everyone is having a ton of sex — it means that each person should be able to create the [consensual] sex life that’s right for them unimpeded by outside restrictions, which includes the option of celibacy,” said Dr. Queen.
4. CELIBACY CAN PROMOTE POSITIVE SELF-ESTEEM AND SELF-CARE
Real talk: Sex can complicate everything — having one (or more) sexual partners can have myriad effects on a person’s well-being, some more desirable than others. As Dr. Queen explained, “Partners can affect one’s finances, mental health, ability to make one’s own choices. For some people, a journey toward optimal well-being will include taking at least some time away from these kinds of connections. There may be positive self-esteem implications of taking oneself off the market, too, in the sense that some people measure their self-worth partly according to how successfully they can attract partners or sexual interest. ”
5. SOLO EXPERIENCES HAVE MANY OF THE PERKS OF PARTNERED SEX
Dr. Queen also clarified that there is a difference between having no sexual experiences of any kind (including masturbation) and having no partnered sex. While some of the perceived health benefits mentioned here are only related to partnered sex, if your celibacy includes solo sexual experience, you’re also getting many of the health benefits ascribed to sex.

6. BEING CELIBATE (FOR A TIME) CAN INCREASE YOUR ENJOYMENT
So, let’s say your celibacy is just temporary — whether self-imposed or you sort of stumbled into it. Should you decide at some point you would like to move toward an active sex life, your time being celibate could have a rather positive effect. “Taking a break from sex helps restore your enjoyment of the act, as well as your appreciation of all your non-sexual and pre-sexual interactions,” Ken Blackman, the principal engineer behind OM (orgasmic meditation), told us.
Blackman has an easy-to-understand analogy to help explain, saying, “Having sex whenever your desire rises above, say, a three out of 10, is like eating an entire meal whenever your hunger rises above a three out of 10. Not only do you get bloated, but you lose your capacity to savor the meal. It becomes harder and harder to really enjoy each bite as a sensual experience. ”
Basically, absence makes the heart (or, ahem, whatever) grow fonder. “Giving yourself some time to remember what it feels like to want sex, and really savoring that feeling of desire, will heighten your senses, make you more present, and boost your enjoyment of the entire experience, from flirting to touching,” said Blackman, offering one final piece of advice for those transitioning toward a more sexual life: The longer you don’t have sex, the more intense your enjoyment will be when — or if — you do.

Resumen: Google and other Big Tech companies are rushing to establish a new protocol, called DNS over HTTPS ("DoH"), that could open the internet floodgates to child pornography, drugs, malware and other illegal activity and enable perpetrators to hide behind new privacy shields.

Texto completo: Google and other Big Tech companies are rushing to establish a new protocol, called DNS over HTTPS ("DoH"), that could open the internet floodgates to child pornography, drugs, malware and other illegal activity and enable perpetrators to hide behind new privacy shields.
As a retired child safety and cybercrimes police detective, I have dedicated my career to helping children by pursuing, apprehending and prosecuting child predators. I am urging Google and the other proponents of this plan to slow down, think this through and respond to questions from law enforcement and federal authorities about the dangers of this plan.
Parents do not need dangerous new gateways through which their children can be exposed to predators, pornography, cyberbullies, school violence and drug dealers.
Already, as a recent New York Times investigation found, tech companies have reported 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused this year — more than double what they found the previous year. And the number keeps growing. Now is not the time to make it even easier to spread this filth and hide behind Google’s shield.
Child-safety experts at the internet Watch Foundation (IWF) are warning the so-called privacy changes could have a "catastrophic impact" by exposing child victims to some of the worst practices on the internet.
As the IWF notes, Google’s plan would mean that criminals could soon have countless new ways to bypass safeguards that child safety groups, cybersecurity experts, internet service providers and government agencies have developed. These changes could allow child predators to directly interact with children and then disappear, leaving law enforcement no means to find the offenders.
Antitrust investigators with the House Judiciary Committee have also sent a letter to Google asking the company to address serious concerns about the plan.
Specifically, the plan causing so much concern involves the internet Domain Name System (DNS), which makes the web work by connecting websites to unique addresses on the internet. Thanks to the DNS, which is often called "the phone book of the internet," a user can type in a website name and end up exactly where they want to go.
But the change could hide user requests, strengthen encryption, enable criminals to bypass essential filters like parental controls and make abusive material freely accessible. This would come at the same time that online child-abuse groups are sharing images of ever younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. We cannot afford to give them new tools for hiding out.
Three specific questions need to be addressed: How will law enforcement be able to track online predators who collaborate through private email services and meet at a website to sexually exploit our children?
Will law enforcement still be able to track domestic terrorists such as school shooters who collaborate on certain websites they visit to obtain their information?
With millions of schools using Google Chromebooks, will this new protocol enable bypassing school filters such as Go Guardian and Securely that help keep our children safe?
In the pursuit of greater privacy, we must not jeopardize safety. We must fully evaluate the dangerous impact these changes could introduce. We must ensure that tech companies are implementing well-informed, responsible updates that strengthen, not diminish our children’s interaction with the online world.
Detective Richard Wistocki (Ret.) was a law enforcement officer for 30 years, including over two decades as an internet crimes investigator with the Naperville Police Department. As a cybercrimes detective and child safety proponent, he educates law enforcement, parents and students on responsible digital activity.

Texto completo: Watching the Democratic presidential candidate debate -- with Elizabeth Warren promising government health care for all without saying she'll tax the middle class to pay for it -- was like staring from a distance at the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
You don't know the Big Rock Candy Mountain? That's the gorgeous Democratic Socialist paradise where everything is free.
"Where the handouts grow on bushes ... And the sun shines every day/ On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees/ The lemonade springs where the bluebird sings/ In the Big Rock Candy Mountains."
It sounds so nice, like Democratic economic policy written for modern Americans who've been trained to despise the freedom offered by capitalism, while yearning for free stuff promised by the federal masters.
It's an old hobo (can I still use that word?) song about a dreamy place where the cops have wooden legs, guard dogs have rubber teeth and the hens lay soft-boiled eggs all day.
But I concentrated on what the candidates were saying, and it completely harshed my mellow.
It wasn't that they rained hate on President Donald Trump. The debate sponsors, CNN and The New York Times, are cheerleaders in the anti-Trump resistance. And all performed as expected. The one thing they stand for, clearly, is they hate Trump.
But I had hoped we'd hear a bit more about what distinguishes one candidate from another on policy. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a military veteran, tried to go there, mocking CNN and the Times and fellow Democrats for pushing the conflict in Syria, which she described as another "regime change war."
Gabbard's attempt was admirable, but doomed. The last thing Democrats and the Beltway media want to be reminded of is that on Syria, they're now in bed with those "Never Trump" pro-war Republican neocons.
And so, a dense anti-Trumpian fog descended upon the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Warren, the Massachusetts senator, refused to say if the middle class would end up paying for her monster federal government Medicare plan for all. And that's not the only problem with the plan -- it would kick some 150 million Americans off their private health care insurance.
Asked whether she'd tax the middle class to pay for her plan, Warren dodged, pivoted, danced, but didn't answer. She wasn't pressed enough.
It's as if the entire Democratic Beltway Media Hive has come to realize -- perhaps through the release of hive-friendly pheromones -- that former front-runner Joe Biden is done and Warren must be protected, even from herself.
At least Sen. Bernie Sanders didn't dodge. He climbed the Big Rock Candy Mountain years ago, planted his flag and waited for the entire Democratic Party to move hard left and join him. He's 78 and just had a heart attack, but he stood strong. Sanders is the one authentic candidate in the bunch. He admits what he is: He's a socialist.
"At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. "And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice."
Voters already know the middle class always gets the bill.
In a question written as if to please CNN boss Jeff Zucker, Anderson Cooper asked Biden about his son Hunter.
"Mr. Vice President," said Cooper, "President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you."
That's not completely true. It was categorically wrong for then-Vice President Biden -- as the Obama administration point man to Ukraine and China -- to have his son Hunter cashing in on business deals in both countries, including $50,000 a month from Ukrainian gas company Burisma.
I don't know if it was a crime, but it was a clear conflict of interest. The legendary Chicago boss Richard J. Daley leveraged his clout to help his sons. When asked about it, Daley told reporters to kiss his mistletoe. But Daley didn't say mistletoe.
"Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses," Cooper continued. "My question is, if it's not OK for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden?"
Biden looked to his left and his right as if afraid. He's no Dick Daley.
"Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong," Biden said, going on to babble about George Washington worrying about foreign influence in elections and then, of course, Trump.
Cooper pressed on.
"Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine," Biden said.
Joe, you did talk to your son. Hunter admitted as much years ago. Even now, with the other candidates avoiding the Hunter issue lest they be accused of pro-Trumpian leanings, Joe must realize that he won't be the Democratic nominee. It's being given to Warren.
Yet before he walks off the stage for the last time, wouldn't it be nice if Joe Biden sings to the nation he loves, in the song the Democrats now sing, in a fine clear voice?
"There's a lake of stew/ And of whiskey, too/ You can paddle all around 'em/ In a big canoe/ In the Big Rock Candy Mountains."

'Street' smarts about a foster care crisis

Texto completo: When "Sesame Street" adds a character and a story line to its fabled neighborhood, people notice. In May, the show's creators introduced Karli, a Muppet in foster care, and this month they revealed the reason for her situation: Her mom struggles with substance abuse.
In supplemental "Sesame Street in the Community" videos available online, Elmo's dad explains to him that "Karli's mother has a disease called addiction. Addiction makes people feel like they need a grown-up drink called alcohol or another kind of drug to feel OK. That can make a person act strange in ways they can't control." Elmo and Karli, a green plush 6 1/2-year-old with yellow ostrich feather pigtails, talk about "grown-up problems" and how sharing can help if you're sad or scared.
Karli's separation from her mom might seem too harsh for the "Sesame Street" audience, but because the videos are available online only, parents and caregivers can decide if kids should see them.

In fact, the programming does us all a favor with its honest depiction of what fractures families. Substance abuse is the primary reason for the foster care crisis in this country. And "Sesame Street's" spotlight on it could help redirect our cities and states toward a better approach to confronting it.
Last year, a record 440,000 children were in foster care in the U.S. "Neglect" is the most common reason for removing kids from their families, but it is a very vague category. And too many people assume that neglect means poverty.
As a columnist for the Arizona Republic wrote: "[The Department of Child Safety] removes the most kids from high poverty ZIP codes. That's no coincidence." A caseworker who was featured in the HBO documentary "Foster," about child welfare in Los Angeles County, told Rise Magazine, "This is not a child safety crisis. It's a poverty crisis, a racism crisis." The New York Times ran an article called "Live in a Poor Neighborhood? Better Be a Perfect Parent."
And yet the data don't line up. Child poverty has reached historic lows in recent years in the U.S., while the number of children removed from their families is growing. On the other hand, government figures clearly show that counties with high rates of drug overdose deaths and hospitalizations also have high rates of severe child welfare cases. At a recent conference sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, federal and state officials estimated that more than 80% of the nation's foster care cases involved substance abuse.
Unfortunately, specific data linking child welfare cause and effect are inconsistent and somewhat contradictory. Why is it, for instance, that California reports to the federal government its removals due to substance abuse at slightly more than 10% for kids over the age of 1 while in Colorado that number is close to 70%? Or why is Louisiana listing substance abuse as a factor in 8% of cases for kids under the age of 1 when Kentucky lists it in half of its cases?
Even within single states the numbers look fishy. In 2010, Arizona listed parental substance abuse in 34% of its child welfare cases, but in 2013 it was only 6%. It seems unlikely that the shift would be that abrupt. And what the heck is going on in New Hampshire, which has a drug overdose death rate that's 70% higher than the national average but reports drugs as a contributing factor in only about 2% of its foster care cases?
In fact, the "threshold" for reporting drug use as a factor in foster care varies significantly state by state. Some require a formal diagnosis, some rely on investigator suspicion. Some states allow investigators to pick multiple factors; others ask workers to limit it to one.
Without a consistent standard -- and therefore better data -- it's hard to move public policy toward a real fix for the surge in foster care cases. A general improvement in "safety net" services won't keep children from neglect and abuse if the true cause is parental drug use. If kids are in homes where the heat isn't on during the winter, or where the refrigerator is empty, or if they are sent to school inappropriately dressed (all triggers for child welfare agencies to intervene), is it because their family is poor or because drug problems stop parents from doing basic things to care for their children?
In the "Sesame Street" videos, we find out that Karli's mother is getting treatment, and foster care is demystified. Elmo and the rest of the neighborhood's adults, kids and Muppets help Karli cope with what she calls her "big feelings." The story line is designed to help build resilience in kids and families, but it can also point child welfare agencies toward a more accurate and specific analysis of their mounting crisis.
If we want to see a decline in the numbers of kids removed from their families and placed in foster care, it pays to follow time-honored "Sesame Street" lessons: Be honest and learn to count.

'Mrs. Doubtfire' Musical Heading to Broadway

Texto completo: Coming soon to Broadway: a new musical, adapted from an Oscar-winning film, about a struggling actor who masquerades as a woman to get what he wants.
No, not that one.
This season, it's "Mrs. Doubtfire," based on the 1993 comedy starring Robin Williams, about an estranged husband posing as a Scottish nanny to spend time with his kids. The show will begin previews at the Stephen Sondheim Theater in March 2020 for an April 5 opening, after an out-of-town run in Seattle later this year.
The producer, Kevin McCollum, is no stranger to bringing films to the stage. He signed a deal in 2013 with 20th Century Fox, the studio behind "Mrs. Doubtfire," to develop nine to a dozen new musicals based on the company's films. "The Devil Wears Prada" and several others are on his docket. (While Disney purchased 20th Century Fox earlier this year and holds the rights to the film, the company's theatrical branch is not a producer, a spokesperson for the musical said.) McCollum is also working on "The Notebook," from Warner Bros.
But film-inspired musicals are still tricky on Broadway, where the appeal of recognizable stories is at odds with audience members' lofty expectations for adaptations that live up to the originals. "Moulin Rouge! The Musical," "Beetlejuice" and "Mean Girls" -- not to mention Disney's catalog -- are still playing to packed houses this season, but other recent adaptations, like "Pretty Woman" and "Groundhog Day," have found less success.
And then, of course, there's "Tootsie," which opened to good reviews but has seen only average ticket sales.
"Mrs. Doubtfire" will walk the same tightrope. The family-focused plot is ideal for a Broadway stint, McCollum told The New York Times in 2013, but there is a risk to playing such a memorable title role in the shadow of someone like Williams.
Stepping into Euphegenia Doubtfire's pumps this time around is Rob McClure, whose previous Broadway appearances include "Beetlejuice" and "Something Rotten!" The creative team behind "Something Rotten!" is at work here as well: Karey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell wrote the book, and Wayne Kirkpatrick and Karey Kirkpatrick wrote the score. The director will be Jerry Zaks, whose most recent project was the "Hello, Dolly!" revival.
Alan Menken said in a 2015 interview that he, David Zippel and Harvey Fierstein -- all Disney musical veterans -- were working on writing "Mrs. Doubtfire." Menken later said that the show was on "creative hiatus," citing other projects. A spokesperson for the musical said there had been an earlier but unannounced "exploration of other creatives," but that the Kirkpatricks and O'Farrell had been working on the show since 2016.
"Mrs. Doubtfire" will follow the clown-filled holiday offering "Slava's Snowshow" at the Sondheim after "Beautiful," the Carole King musical, closes at the end of this month.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In the early 1970s, a police officer named Frank Serpico became New York City's best-known whistle-blower by speaking up against widespread corruption in the Police Department.
A best-selling book and his portrayal by Al Pacino in the 1973 film "Serpico" helped make his name synonymous with facing down wrongdoing.
For decades, Mr. Serpico, 83, has lived in a secluded cabin in the woods north of the city. But when whistle-blowers make the news, he inevitably gets requests for interviews.
So Mr. Serpico chuckled over the phone recently when asked about the whistle-blower who has created a political firestorm by coming forward on White House activity regarding a call to the president of Ukraine.
The scenario in Washington is "so parallel to my situation," he said, adding that it did not surprise him to see disparagement of the whistle-blower by President Trump and some other Republicans.
"This is what happens," he said. "They want to discredit what you are saying, so they try to bring you down and turn you into a criminal. They tried to undermine my credibility, and now the president is doing the same thing."
Mr. Serpico, who was profiled in a 2017 documentary and in another film this year, is a Brooklyn native who joined the Police Department in 1959 and grew increasingly disillusioned by the number of officers "on the pad," or accepting bribes and payoffs from criminals, bookies and the like.
"It wasn't about just taking a freebie," he said. "It was cops doing the same thing that they were locking people up for."
He steadfastly refused to take such money, he said, and in 1967 began complaining to high-ranking officials at Police Headquarters and City Hall.
They took little action, and he became a pariah in the department, he said. He considered quitting and simply walking away from the issue, a familiar decision for many whistle-blowers he has spoken to.
"At some point, you have to decide, 'If I go up against the system, I better be ready to put my life on the line,"' said Mr. Serpico, who wound up taking his story to a reporter at The New York Times, David Burnham.
Mr. Burnham wrote a front-page article that helped prompt the Knapp Commission hearings in 1971 on police corruption, which, with Mr. Serpico's testimony, helped expose pervasive wrongdoing and sparked the biggest shake-up in the department's history.
Speaking up had its price. Mr. Serpico's police career ended in 1971 after he was shot in the face during a drug raid. He has long maintained that he got no backup from his colleagues because of his pariah status.
The shooting left him with permanent injuries, and he is still despised by some of his old colleagues as a snitch.
"To them, I'm no whistle-blower," he said. "They still consider me a traitor."
The whistle-blower label is not easily shaken, he said. Most people he meets still refer to his actions or thank him for his decision to speak out against police corruption.
"Every time there's another whistle-blower in the news, people want to ask me about it," he said.
If asked about politics, Mr. Serpico levels the criticism he once reserved for police corruption at the political division roiling the country.
"Why can't the two parties come together for the good of the country?" he said. "All they care about is the good of themselves. If we can't trust our authorities and we can't stand up for justice, where are we as a country, as a people?"

Texto completo: "Catch and Kill" was pulled from two of Australia's biggest online book retailers amid legal threats from the former National Enquirer editor who features prominently in the book.
SYDNEY, Australia -- Two of Australia's biggest online booksellers have suspended sales of Ronan Farrow's new book after one of the men who is prominent in it threatened legal action.
The book, "Catch and Kill," which details Farrow's investigation of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, was unavailable on Booktopia, a major Australian online book retailer, and through Amazon in Australia as of Wednesday, a day after the book's publication.
Lawyers for Dylan Howard, an executive with American Media, Inc., sent letters to Australian booksellers last month warning of "false and defamatory allegations" potentially contained within the book.
"We note that if the book is distributed by you in Australia and our client is correct as to the defamatory imputations contained within the book, we are instructed to initiate immediate defamation proceedings against the Publisher, and our client will have no alternative but to join you as a party to those proceedings as a distributor," the letter warned. The lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.
Howard, who is Australian and the former editor of The National Enquirer, features prominently in "Catch and Kill." The book outlines his assistance to Weinstein, including an instance where he forwarded the producer "dirt" on the actor Rose McGowan after she tweeted about "my rapist."
The Daily Beast, which earlier reported Howard's threat, also wrote that Howard was taking similar legal action in Britain, Ireland and the United States, though the book was available for sale in those countries.
In a tweet on Tuesday, Farrow expressed his disappointment after an Australian reader noted her pre-ordered copy had "disappeared" from Amazon's Kindle store, saying the book retailers had "caved and banned it due to frivolous legal threats."
His publisher, Little, Brown, said in a statement that the book "has been meticulously reported, researched, and fact-checked, and we're proud to bring Ronan Farrow's important reporting to the public. That one tabloid editor may seek to suppress women's stories by threatening booksellers only amplifies the powerful message of Mr. Farrow's book."
Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, said there was no intention to restore the book to the website "unless there is clear direction that there will be no legal action."
Keeping the book on the site with the specter of a potential defamation suit would be an "unnecessary nuisance," he said, adding that this was not the first time Booktopia had complied with threats.
Amazon Australia declined to comment.
The dispute comes at a time when Australia is increasingly being called the defamation capital of the world because of its strict and complex laws that favor complainants.
"Australia is really a plaintiff playground," said Matthew Lewis, a Sydney-based lawyer specializing in media law. "All it takes is a general complaint to have a chilling effect on free speech on important matters."
"Ultimately, it's a question of risk," Lewis added. "If there's a potential risk of defamation, then it is a business decision ultimately of whether or not they want to promote that book, or alternatively err on the side of caution."
Mark Rubbo, the managing director of Readings, an independent book retailer in Melbourne, confirmed that he also received a letter of notice from Howard's lawyers but has continued to sell the book in his stores and online, saying he "acted on the advice on the publisher."
"It smacks a little of censorship, which I hate," he said.
Multinational attempts to suppress book sales are not unprecedented. In 2018, threatening letters were sent to booksellers around the world, including in Australia and the United Kingdom, in an attempt to quash sales of "Billion Dollar Whale," an exposé by two Wall Street Journal reporters about the Malaysian financier Jho Low, who prosecutors say helped steal billions of dollars from a government investment fund.

Last night's Democratic debate proved that it's going to be very difficult to defeat Trump

Texto completo: Maybe after Tuesday night’s debate it will have finally sunk in that Democrats are going to have a very, very, very hard time winning the presidency next year.
It was an embarrassment to watch Sen. Kamala Harris, who was once considered a serious contender for the nomination, drone on about how the president of the United States should be “taken down” from Twitter. She apparently thought it would be a standout moment to “urge” Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join her in that campaign-defining cause.
Warren, having branded herself as the ultimate liberal truth-teller, wouldn’t admit that her dreamy healthcare policy proposal would absolutely require a tax increase on middle-income households. “Costs will go down” was her answer every time she was asked about that inescapable fact, almost as if someone had pulled a string on her back to make the sound.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg sounded like he might have been onto something when he dismissed every single Democrat proposal on gun control. But then he offered his own unique one: “We have to just get something done.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders literally had a brush with death and is now acting like nothing’s wrong. Joe Biden pretended his son Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine, which just happened to coincide with his own political engagement there, is nothing, even though Hunter had just said earlier the same day that it was done with “poor judgement.”
Are any of these people listening to themselves?
If I were head of the DNC I would be absolutely soiling my pants. The party is rudderless, and the first contest of the primary is just four months away.
Democrats are no better off today than they were in the 2016 election, but they might take some comfort in knowing that the shoe was once on the other foot.
This same show played out in 2012, when Republicans were certain that beating President Obama would be a breeze. That was delusional thinking then and it’s delusional to think it about President Trump now.
Trump may have shaken the conventional wisdom on politics, but some things really will never change. Incumbency counts for a lot. That's bad news for Democrats, but hopefully they’re seeing things a little more clearly after last night.

La crisis militar desatada por Trump en Siria deja 50 bombas atómicas en manos de Turquía

Texto completo: El presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , se ha negado a frenar su ofensiva militar en el norte de Siria pese a la presión de Estados Unidos y otros miembros de la Alianza Atlántica (NATO, en inglés).
El vicepresidente, Mike Pence, viaja este miércoles a Turquía para reunirse con Erdogan, mientras el presidente, Donald Trump, aseguraba desde la Casa Blanca que la ofensiva militar “no es entre Turquía y Estados Unidos”. Sin embargo, el conflicto se inició a consecuencia de una decisión suya, y esta crisis tiene como rehenes a 50 bombas nucleares estadounidenses.
Un reporte periodístico había indicado que Erdogan no se reuniría en persona con la delegación diplomática encabezada por Pence: “No voy a hablar con ellos. Van a hablar con sus homólogos. Cuando Trump venga, hablaré”.
Sin embargo, fuentes oficiales citadas por la prensa local precisaron horas después que el presidente turco sí recibiría a Pence, que viaja junto al secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo, para convencerle de que frene su ofensiva militar.
El ataque turco es consecuencia directa de la decisión anunciada el 6 de octubre por Trump de retirar las tropas estadounidenses de Siria, un país en guerra civil desde 2011.
Hasta entonces, Estados Unidos había prestado apoyo aéreo a los kurdos en su batalla contra el dictador Bashar Al-Assad, a su vez ayudado por Rusia. La retirada estadounidense permitió a los turcos atacar a los kurdos, un pueblo sin estado que reclama territorios en Turquía y es considerado como terrorista por este país. Los kurdos se aliaron entonces con Al-Assad, Rusia ocupó el puesto estratégico que antes tenía Estados Unidos, y, en los combates, decenas de presos del Ejército Islámico (ISIS), enemigo de todos, quedaron en libertad.
Tras el rechazo internacional provocado por la decisión de Trump, y con la fuerte presión del Congreso en su contra incluso por parte de los republicanos, el presidente anunció un fuerte castigo económico contra Turquía por su ofensiva militar. Sin embargo, este miércoles ha vuelto a insistir en que la confrontación “no es entre Turquía y Estados Unidos”.
Turquía, miembro de la Alianza Atlántica, tiene en su territorio bases militares estadounidenses con armas atómicas, según ha informado el diario The New York Times.
En concreto, 50 bombas termonucleares, almacenadas en la instalación de las Fuerzas Aéreas en Incirlik, a 100 millas de la frontera con Siria.
Preguntado hoy al respecto, Trump ha expresado hoy su “confianza”, sin aclarar en qué, añadiendo que la base aérea es “poderosa”, y Turquía es miembro de la Alianza Atlántica: “Se supone que tenemos que llevarnos bien con ellos, qué quiere la gente, que les disparemos, sería la primera vez”.
Un oficial estadounidense de alto rango ha dicho al citado diario que Erdogan básicamente tiene las armas como “rehenes” . Sacarlas por vía aérea marcaría el final de la alianza de facto entre Turquía y Estados Unidos, pero dejarlas allí sería perpetuar una vulnerabilidad nuclear que debió desaparecer hace años.
La meta de Pence es convencer a Erdogan de un cese al fuego inmediato, pero también reiterará que las sanciones impuestas este lunes en contra de Turquía se mantendrán hasta que se llegue a un acuerdo para evitar el conflicto en la región, ha informado la cadena NBC News.
Erdogan ha afirmado que nadie podrá detener la ofensiva turca en Siria y que esta solo llegará a su fin una vez su Gobierno establezca una “zona segura” que vaya desde Manbij, en territorio sirio, hasta la frontera con Irak.
“Para la solución más rápida al problema en Siria, le proponemos a todos los terroristas que dejen sus armas y equipos , destruyan las trampas que prepararon y salgan de la zona segura esta noche”, le dijo a los periodistas.
Las declaraciones se dan luego de que el ejército de Al-Assad llegará a zonas del norte del país donde previamente operaba Estados Unidos.
Las tropas sirias habían sido expulsadas del norte del país con la ayuda de los milicianos kurdos, que además habían batallado contra el grupo terrorista ISIS, arrinconado en esa área tras ser derrotado por Estados Unidos en Irak.

Part attorney, part investigator. How Rudy Giuliani's many roles for Trump could play out in impeachment inquiry

Resumen: Rudy Giuliani is the latest in Donald Trump's orbit to come under intense scrutiny for work he did for the president.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rudy Giuliani, by his own admission, reached out to Ukraine to unearth damaging information about President Donald Trump's potential presidential rival – mixing roles of personal attorney and unofficial diplomat.
Depending on the time of day and who he's talking to, Giuliani is an attorney advising Trump on legal matters. An unofficial envoy corresponding with foreign leaders. A cable news attack dog. A freelance investigator.
Now Giuliani finds himself in a difficult position. Two associates, who tried to help him get Ukrainian officials to investigate one of Trump's political rivals, have been arrested on campaign finance charges. Prosecutors are examining Giuliani's business dealings in that country. And Democrats have accused him of violating lobbying laws by acting as an unregistered agent for a foreign government.
Giuliani has said he's an attorney for Trump as well as the two men now in federal custody. But experts say he can't rely on attorney-client privilege to completely shield himself from answering questions from Congress or prosecutors.
In short, Giuliani can't have it both ways, said Josh Rosenstein, a Washington, D. C. , lawyer who advises clients on foreign lobbying laws.
More: Federal investigators have been looking into Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine since early 2019
“Either he is admitting that he was somehow an unofficial emissary of the U. S. government operating outside legal channels and directed by the president to engage in the sort of activity at the root of the impeachment inquiry," Rosenstein said, "or he was acting as an unregistered agent of foreign principals and potentially assisting them in violating campaign finance laws. "
It’s too early to gauge what Giuliani’s legal exposure might be, experts say – if there is any at all. The opacity and fluidity of his relationship with the president has raised challenging questions about what Giuliani can and cannot reveal to congressional and criminal investigators.
But it's clear that Giuliani is the latest person in Trump's orbit to come under scrutiny by federal authorities. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, once said he would take a bullet for his boss. Now he is serving three years in prison.
Giuliani has cast any scrutiny as likely politically motivated and said he is not in any legal jeopardy. "Did nothing wrong," he said Tuesday, hours after he defied a congressional subpoena for documents related to his dealings in Ukraine.
The president has come to Giuliani's defense, tamping down speculations that his standing might be in peril.
Is Giuliani a 'foreign agent'?: Trump-Ukraine scandal puts spotlight on Rudy Giuliani's business ties.
Giuliani is central figure in inquiries by Congress, prosecutors
Giuliani seems to begin his days much like the president does: with a series of tweets in the wee hours of the morning, often in the same bombastic tone.
He castigates the media, attacks the impeachment inquiry, discredits the whistleblower whose allegations fueled it, pushes baseless claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and peddles the conspiracy theory that Ukraine – not Russia – interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Democrats.
Giuliani, however, has been distinctly mum about the arrests last week of two of his associates, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan of funneling foreign money to American political campaigns. Two other men were charged as well.
Arrest made: Fourth suspect surrenders in campaign-finance case tied to Rudolph Giuliani associates
Prosecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman gave $5,400 to a U. S. congressman and pledged to raise another $20,000 as they sought his help in removing Marie Yovanovitch as U. S. ambassador to Ukraine.
That congressman is former U. S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who wrote a letter to U. S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Yovanovitch's removal. After Parnas and Fruman were arrested, Sessions said he didn't know about the alleged scheme and would donate their contributions to charity.
That investigation appears to have extended to Giuliani.
Kenneth McCallion, a New York lawyer who has represented several Ukrainian clients, told USA TODAY that federal authorities questioned him in early 2019 about Giuliani's activities in Ukraine.
Giuliani said Tuesday he had "no such knowledge" of a federal inquiry involving him.
The New York Times has reported that prosecutors in the U. S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York – the office Giuliani led in the 1980s – are investigating whether he violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, in his dealings with Ukraine. The Times reported that the investigation into Giuliani is tied to the criminal case against Parnas and Fruman.
FARA requires Americans who work on behalf of foreign entities to register their activities with the Justice Department.
The focus of the investigation, according to the Times, is Giuliani’s efforts to “undermine” Yovanovitch, as part of a campaign to get Ukraine to help Trump politically.
A spokeswoman for the U. S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York said she cannot confirm whether Giuliani is under investigation, but the probe into Parnas and Fruman is ongoing.
Burisma and Biden: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust
Federal prosecutors have ramped up their enforcement of FARA, a law meant to identify foreign actors attempting to influence U. S. policy.
Giuliani and his consulting firm have had clients from Latin America to eastern Europe. In an interview with The New York Times, a wealthy developer from the city of Kharkiv in Ukraine described Giuliani as a "lobbyist" who would burnish his city's reputation in the U. S.
The Justice Department has shown a willingness to prosecute high-profile figures with ties to foreign countries. Among them are two men who once were in Trump’s inner circle: Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who is awaiting sentencing, and Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman who's serving seven and a half years in prison.
Giuliani has rejected accusations that he has violated FARA, saying he was working on behalf of Trump, not a foreign entity.
But that claim, legal experts say, could put Giuliani in a bind.
Either he acknowledges advancing Ukrainian interests in his effort to discredit Yovanovitch, or he says he was working at Trump's behest, which furthers the impeachment inquiry, said Matthew Sanderson, a Washington, D. C. , lawyer who advises clients on FARA.
The arrests of Fruman and Parnas also could pose legal risks for Giuliani.
“The risk is all your communications and activities with these people will be exposed, probably, and investigated,” said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor in New York. “There’s a significant chance that people who know a lot about things they did with Mr. Giuliani may at some point in the future decide to be debriefed by the government. ”
Any legal risk to Giuliani, though, remains hypothetical because so little is known about what evidence the investigators have found, Cotter said.
Giuliani has declined to discuss his dealings with Parnas and Fruman, saying the duo were his clients "on two separate things," and much of their communication is privileged. He said he has to talk to them to figure out what's confidential and what's not.

The shifting nature of the Trump-Giuliani relationship
The nature of Giuliani’s work for the president is murky, experts say, in part because Giuliani himself has described it in different ways. This raises questions about whether he could assert attorney-client privilege during the impeachment inquiry and what limits there could be to that privilege.
For example, Giuliani has identified himself as the president’s lawyer, as he did in an interview with Fox News on Sept. 26. But he has also asserted he is not acting as Trump’s lawyer, as he did in an interview with The Atlantic the same day.
Other times, he’s appeared to act as an unofficial envoy, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity that he spoke to the Ukrainians at the request of the State Department. "I wasn't operating on my own," he said.
In that case, conversations between him and Trump may not be protected, experts say. Communication between an attorney and his client is protected only if they pertain to the issue for which the attorney was hired.
Giuliani joined Trump's legal team in 2018 amid former special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. With the Mueller investigation over, experts say it's now unclear what legal work, if any, Giuliani is doing for Trump.
“The nature and exact extent of their relationship is in question,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former prosecutor under independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
Giuliani's defense: Trump backs Rudy Giuliani after report says president's lawyer is under investigation
Giuliani can't avoid testifying in impeachment inquiry, experts say
Still, Rosenzweig said there is no way Giuliani can use attorney-client privilege to shield himself entirely from testifying in impeachment proceedings. "The only thing it will accomplish – and it probably will succeed to some extent – is to delay his testimony,” he said.
Attorney-client privilege is limited to confidential communications between a client and that person’s attorney. Lawyers can’t claim privilege to protect themselves from what they said while representing their clients. Only clients can decide if they want their dealings to be confidential.
That means the privilege does not apply to conversations or correspondence Giuliani had with foreign leaders or State Department officials in the course of his dealings in Ukraine, experts say.
“The conduct at issue – pushing arguments about potential corruption to foreign officials – does not appear to involve providing confidential legal advice," John Bies, chief counsel at American Oversight, a nonprofit focused on government accountability, wrote on the Lawfare blog.
"It is not even clear that Giuliani’s conduct constitutes legal work performed in his capacity as Trump’s attorney, even if it were charitably viewed as something other than political campaign work,” he wrote.
Bies, a former Justice Department official in the Obama administration, agreed there is no indication that Trump sought legal advice from Giuliani. Instead, Trump directed him "to undertake other (nonlegal) activities" on his behalf, Bies wrote.
“Directives of this sort, of course, would not be privileged,” he wrote.
Giuliani pushed back against the notion that attorney-client privilege wouldn't apply, telling Fox News' Laura Ingraham that if the work he did was to "obtain evidence in order to exonerate your client, it damn well does apply. "
There's one other thing not protected by attorney-client privilege, Rosenzweig said: communication regarding future crimes, either by the client or the attorney.
If attorney-client protections fail, Giuliani cannot assert executive privilege. “Giuliani, so far as I know, holds no executive rank” in the Trump administration, Rosenzweig said.
Many of the recent headlines about Giuliani have drawn parallels with Cohen, who also held dual roles for Trump: attorney and, in his own words, fixer. Cohen pleaded guilty last year to several crimes, including arranging hush-money payments to women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump.
The roles the two men played show the president’s desire for someone who can both be a lawyer and a political henchman, Cotter said.
“Both attorneys … have engaged in actions that seem, to me, beyond the bounds and ethics of a lawyer,” Cotter said, “but they do them anyway. ”

Texto completo: In most of Ohio, most elections bring one party dominance driven primarily by geography. Holding battleground status in the presidential campaigns has been a reminder to us as citizens that we really do matter and hold the ultimate responsibility for leadership. That is normalcy in Ohio. If the new normal allows candidates to ignore us, we will ignore them as both our issues and our support becomes unimportant to the outcome.
The Democrats' presidential debate that CNN and the New York Times are holding in suburban Columbus has sparked a pre-debate debate: Does Ohio still matter? As always in Ohio politics, follow the money and you will find the answer. The political advertising professionals who direct dollars to targeted geography driven by the Electoral College say Ohio voters no longer hold the key to the White House.
Democrats have selected Westerville, a solid Republican suburb turned into a Democratic stronghold by the choice between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton, as the debate location and the key to their competitive fortunes in Ohio. It's quite a change from 2016 when Sandusky County was singled out as the best representation of Ohio and when Ottawa County was watched for the best track record of siding with the winner. But it doesn't really matter if Ohio is bypassed during the campaign as insignificant to the outcome.
What a comedown that would be from the 1920 presidential election. We Buckeyes were so important 99 years ago that both parties nominated an Ohio officeholder and Senator Warren G. Harding defeated Governor James M. Cox. Like present days, 1920 was a turbulent time, following the "war to end all wars," enactment of income taxes, industrial regulation, labor strife and foreign policy disputes over entry into the United Nations forerunner, the League of Nations. Cox supported the massive change engineered by the Wilson administration while Harding promised a "return to normalcy," and won in a landslide.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, soon to turn 77, wants a rocking chair rather than a boat rocking reform, channeling Harding with a return to normalcy message. The problem with that idea is the widespread understanding that corruption has been normalized in Washington.
Harding died in office, and was held in high regard by his country. Within months the Teapot Dome scandal revealed close associates leasing oil-rich government ground without bids to buddies made instantly rich. Harding's sexual scandals in the White House were also revealed and his reputation plummeted.
The Harding comparison goes beyond message, right to vulnerability for Biden. Donald Trump isn't waiting on Biden to win the nomination to go on the attack. Biden's son Hunter turned proximity to power into huge cash deals with a Ukrainian oil company and a state-owned Chinese bank. Casual corruption is normal in Washington because it's not illegal. If Biden is the nominee, Democrats will say the Trump business interests are also cashing in on political power. Biden is betting routine corruption cancels out any advantage, leaving chaos as the reason to deny Donald Trump four more years.
As always, the outcome in Ohio will come down to how voters feel about the economy. The Democrats dominate the cities in Ohio and the counties in which they reside. Republicans are just as strong in the small towns and rural counties, while a shift to the GOP presidential candidates in manufacturing centers can only be offset by the shift to Democrats in the service-industry-dominated suburbs. Because strong feelings drive high turnout, the economy normally tells us where fear or anger will bring out voters.
In most of Ohio, most elections bring one party dominance driven primarily by geography. Holding battleground status in the presidential campaigns has been a reminder to us as citizens that we really do matter and hold the ultimate responsibility for leadership. That is normalcy in Ohio.
If the new normal allows candidates to ignore us, we will ignore them as both our issues and our support becomes unimportant to the outcome. We're living with that in our state and local elections so we'll survive, but we can't thrive without competition between two good choices.
John Damschroder, a Fremont native who worked in Gov. George Voinovich's administration, writes about business and economic development in Ohio.

U.S. News: Bolton, Mulvaney Pursued Opposing Paths on Ukraine

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- During President Trump's tenure in office, both his chief of staff and his national security adviser have listened to most scheduled calls with foreign leaders, according to current and former White House officials. During the phone conversation this summer that sparked an impeachment inquiry, neither of the two key advisers was on the line.
The two aides who missed the call -- Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton -- represented two poles of a fierce internal White House debate over an issue now at the center of a House impeachment inquiry: Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
This account is based on interviews with current White House officials, former administration officials, and people familiar with testimony given during the House's investigation of the president.
Mr. Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, carried out the president's order to suspend nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Mr. Bolton, who has since resigned as national security adviser, protested the move and -- before the hold on the money was lifted -- promised Ukrainian officials during a visit to Kyiv in August that the U.S. wouldn't revoke it.
Mr. Bolton raised alarms after Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, brought up investigations the president wanted Ukraine to pursue in a July 10 meeting at the White House with senior Ukrainian officials, according to testimony from a witness in the House impeachment probe. Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's lawyer, had for months been pressing Ukraine on the president's behalf to mount investigations into Democrat Joe Biden and his son as well as into possible 2016 election interference. Those efforts have become a central focus of the House impeachment inquiry.
Two months earlier, Mr. Mulvaney organized a meeting at the White House between the president and the U.S. delegation that had traveled to Ukraine for Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration, according to Rep. Gerry Connolly's (D., Va.) account of the testimony of a State Department witness. In that meeting, the president asked Mr. Sondland and other U.S. officials to work with Mr. Giuliani to address Mr. Trump's reservations about meeting with the Ukrainian president. Mr. Mulvaney raised no flags about that request.
When it came time for the July 25 phone call, Mr. Mulvaney's office helped schedule it, as it would for any foreign-leader call.
The call was billed as a simple congratulatory call about Ukrainian parliamentary elections. Mr. Mulvaney viewed it as routine and instead attended a breakfast with Vice President Mike Pence and Robert Lighthizer, the president's top trade adviser. Mr. Mulvaney sent his own national security adviser, deputy chief of staff Rob Blair, to monitor the president's call, and Mr. Blair raised no alarms about the call afterward.
Mr. Bolton closely tracked planning for the call. He told administration officials who were pushing for it that there was no reason to have the call because there was nothing substantive to discuss. He then pushed to delay it from happening before Ukraine's elections on July 21, a move he told officials would be inappropriate.
In a call with Energy Secretary Rick Perry on July 11, a day after the meeting with senior Ukrainian officials, Mr. Perry urged Mr. Bolton to schedule a call between Messrs. Trump and Zelensky. Mr. Perry said he, Mr. Sondland and U.S. envoy for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker wanted a call before the parliamentary elections to counter Russian influence and help build the relationship with Mr. Zelensky.
Mr. Bolton ultimately cleared the path for the call when he submitted the official National Security Council scheduling memo. The NSC under Mr. Bolton had also submitted scheduling memos for Mr. Trump's first conversation with Mr. Zelensky in April, and another for an official invitation for Mr. Zelensky to visit the White House. That meeting hasn't been scheduled.
At the time of the July 25 call, there were strains on the relationship between the president and Mr. Bolton. The two men disagreed on the president's approach with North Korea and his interest in meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.
Mr. Bolton sent his deputy, Charles Kupperman, to listen in to the call rather than attending himself. White House officials who worked closely with Mr. Bolton interpreted his absence as a signal of his frustration over the suspended Ukraine aid.
The White House has begun a review into how the president's call was handled, people familiar with the process said. The inquiry includes the decision by John Eisenberg, a lawyer on the NSC, to place records of the call into a classified computer system typically reserved for the government's most precious secrets, the people said.
Mr. Mulvaney is supportive of the probe, which was first reported by the New York Times, the people said.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment, and an NSC spokesman declined to comment.

How U.S. Will Execute a Withdrawal

Texto completo: The Pentagon will have to disassemble combat bases that were built to stay for a mission that was supposed to last, and protect the troops as they withdraw amid a chaotic battlefield.
President Trump's decision -- made in the span of a week -- to withdraw about 1,000 American troops from northern Syria caught the Pentagon, and the forces on the ground, off guard.
To carry out the "endless wars" since Sept. 11, 2001, which Mr. Trump has vowed to wrap up, the American military has perfected the ability to build complex logistics pipelines that can funnel everything from armored vehicles to satellite internet access to gym equipment directly to combat outposts throughout the Middle East.
Now, American troops are making a hasty withdrawal from Syria -- under pressure from encroaching Turkish proxy forces, Russian aircraft and columns armored by the Syrian government. This means the Pentagon will have to disassemble combat bases and other infrastructure that were built to stay for a mission that was supposed to last, all while protecting the troops as they withdraw amid a chaotic battlefield.
Where did U.S. troops operate before the Turkish offensive?
Before the Turkish offensive, American troops, mostly Special Operations forces, operated in an archipelago of about a dozen bases and outposts across northeastern Syria, mostly living alongside their Syrian Kurdish partners. They were divided into two main headquarters, known by their cardinal directions, East and West.
The outposts are often a mixture of blast-resistant walls known as Hesco barriers, rudimentary structures and all-weather tents. The large air base in the city of Kobani is replete with a small tent city and some container housing units.
The western headquarters, known as Advanced Operational Base West, oversaw roughly half a dozen smaller outposts that covered cities like Manbij and Raqqa. About 500 troops are dedicated to the area partly overseen by A.O.B. West.
The eastern headquarters, known as A.O.B. East, is closer to the Iraqi border and helps monitor some of the roughly 500 troops in that area around the Euphrates River Valley, with several smaller outposts around Deir al-Zour and some near the Iraq-Syria border in towns like Bukamal and Hajin. The number of forces in the east, however, is fluid, as units frequently move between Syria and Iraq.
Where are those troops moving now?
As the troops withdraw, they first will collapse inward by abandoning the outposts closest to the line of advancing foreign troops, in this case the Turkish military and its ill-disciplined Syrian militia proxies, along with Russian and Syrian government forces. That strategy was made clear in a video posted online Tuesday, showing a Russian journalist standing in an abandoned American outpost west of Manbij and closest to Syrian government troops.
Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a spokesman for the American-led coalition based in Baghdad, confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday, "We are out of Manbij."
The troops are likely to be repositioned to Iraq or potentially to Jordan. Some may return to the United States, officials said.
What routes will the troops use in exiting Syria?
The western and eastern headquarters are likely to withdraw independently of each other. In the west, American forces will, according to American military officials, probably leave through the Kobani airfield, known as the Kobani Landing Zone. That base, with its long dirt runaway, can support C-17 transport aircraft and has a large Air Force contingent of maintenance staff. In the east, those forces will most likely exit overland and into Iraq in convoys, with some traveling via helicopter airlift.
Are there risks in the withdrawal?
The risk of confrontation with the medley of different ground forces -- both state-led and proxy -- is undoubtedly higher than it was several weeks ago.
Convoys moving through contested territory and aircraft making repeated landings all might contribute to an accidental confrontation or a staged attack, especially from any Islamic State leftovers that might want to take advantage of the sudden withdrawal.
One of the biggest risks to the remaining American troops as they pull back will most likely be attacks from a Turkish-backed Syrian militia called the Free Syrian Army, which has spearheaded the Turkish offensive in many places along the border. Those troops are supported by Turkish Army artillery and mortar fire, and Turkish Air Force strikes.
American officials say these Turkish-backed militia are less disciplined than regular Turkish soldiers, and deliberately or inadvertently have fired on retreating American troops. Another emerging threat comes from Islamic State fighters, who had gone underground after the defeat of the final shards of the terror group's caliphate, or religious state, in northern Syria this year.
The hasty, risky nature of the withdrawal might actually require that the number of American troops in Syria be increased, at least temporarily. The military's Central Command is preparing to send hundreds of additional American forces to help secure bases where American Special Forces have been operating with their Syrian Kurdish partners -- many of whom have now left to fight the Turks -- and safely evacuate those Americans in the coming weeks.
"We are repositioning additional forces in the region to assist with force protection as necessary," Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told reporters on Friday at the Pentagon.
In a sign of the concern over the safety of the remaining American troops in Syria, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke Monday with his Russian counterpart about the deteriorating security in the country's northeast.
And last Friday, the American military logged an attempt to attack a Marine KC-130 transport aircraft landing in Kobani with "surface-to-air fire," according to military documents obtained by The New York Times. The aircraft discharged flares as a defensive measure. The flight was unharmed and continued its approach, landing at the airfield.
Will any American troops stay in Syria?
Yes, there are roughly 150 troops at al-Tanf, a small base in southern Syria near the Jordanian border. While billed as a Special Operations mission to train local forces and go after the Islamic State, the base serves as a tollbooth of sorts for Iranian, Russian and Syrian forces in the region that have to navigate around its kilometers-wide defense bubble. The presence of American forces there gives the United States visibility on the movement and actions of those other military forces.
On the Jordanian side of the border, the American military keeps a quick reaction force staged there, including extra troops and artillery, in case anything were to go awry at the al-Tanf base.
The base also watches over a nearby refugee camp that is run by the United Nations.
What U.S. combat equipment will be left behind?
That is unclear. Some of the various bases' hard structures, tents, tables, gym equipment and larger construction machinery might be left behind. What won't be abandoned is anything sensitive, such as radios, weapons, armored vehicles and important documents.
American military officials say the hastier the withdrawal, the more equipment will be left behind or have to be destroyed. Much depends on the security conditions on the ground.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—During President Trump's tenure in office, both his chief of staff and his national security adviser have listened to most scheduled calls with foreign leaders, according to current and former White House officials. During the phone conversation this summer that sparked an impeachment inquiry , neither of the two key advisers was on the line.
The two aides who missed the call—Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton—represented two poles of a fierce internal White House debate over an issue now at the center of a House impeachment inquiry:
Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
This account is based on interviews with current White House officials, former administration officials, and people familiar with testimony given during the House's investigation of the president.
Mr. Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, carried out the president's order to suspend nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Mr. Bolton, who has since resigned as national security adviser, protested the move and—before the hold on the money was lifted—promised Ukrainian officials during a visit to Kyiv in August that the U.S. wouldn't revoke it.
Mr. Bolton raised alarms after the U.S. ambassador to the European Union brought up investigations the president wanted Ukraine to pursue in a July 10 meeting at the White House with senior Ukrainian officials, according to testimony from a witness in the House impeachment probe. Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's lawyer, had for months been pressing Ukraine on the president's behalf to mount investigations into Democrat Joe Biden and his son as well as into possible 2016 election interference. Those efforts have become a central focus of the House impeachment inquiry.
Two months earlier, Mr. Mulvaney organized a meeting at the White House between the president and the U.S. delegation that had traveled to Ukraine for Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration, according to Rep. Gerry Connolly's (D., Va.) account of the testimony of a State Department witness. In that meeting, the president asked the same ambassador, Gordon Sondland, and other U.S. officials to work with Mr. Giuliani to address Mr. Trump's reservations about meeting with the Ukrainian president. Mr. Mulvaney raised no flags about that request.
When it came time for the July 25 phone call, Mr. Mulvaney's office helped schedule it, as it would for any foreign-leader call.
The call was billed as a simple congratulatory call about the Ukrainian parliamentary elections. Mr. Mulvaney viewed it as routine and instead attended a breakfast with Vice President Mike Pence and Robert Lighthizer, the president's top trade adviser. Mr. Mulvaney sent his own national security adviser, deputy chief of staff Rob Blair, to monitor the president's call, and Mr. Blair raised no alarms about the call afterward.
Mr. Bolton closely tracked planning for the call. He told administration officials who were pushing for it that there was no reason to have the call because there was nothing substantive to discuss. He then pushed to delay it from happening before Ukraine's parliamentary elections on July 21. Holding it earlier, he told officials, would be inappropriate.
In a call with Energy Secretary Rick Perry on July 11, a day after the meeting with senior Ukrainian officials, Mr. Perry urged Mr. Bolton to schedule a call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Perry said he, Mr. Sondland and U.S. envoy for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker wanted a call before the parliamentary elections to counter Russian influence and help build the relationship with Mr. Zelensky. He told Mr. Bolton they were assured that Mr. Zelensky wouldn't prove an obstacle to any investigations into alleged corruption.
Inside the White House, Messrs. Perry and Sondland were viewed as the biggest proponents of a July call between the two presidents. They told White House officials that it was important to establish a close relationship with Mr. Zelensky to encourage Ukraine's energy independence and help push the country away from Russia and closer to the West.
Mr. Bolton ultimately cleared the path for the call when he submitted the official National Security Council scheduling memo. The NSC under Mr. Bolton had also submitted scheduling memos for Mr. Trump's first conversation with Mr. Zelensky in April, and another for an official invitation for Mr. Zelensky to visit the White House. That meeting hasn't been scheduled.
But Mr. Trump was lukewarm to the request to speak to Mr. Zelensky a second time. He told one official that he didn't think a call with Mr. Zelensky was worth interrupting the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. The phone call was delayed for another day because the White House had blocked off time for a potential phone conversation between Mr. Trump and the prime minister of Sweden about the rapper A$AP Rocky, whose arrest in Stockholm the president had made a priority to monitor.
At the time of the July 25 call, there were strains on the relationship between the president and Mr. Bolton. The two men disagreed on the president's approach with North Korea and his interest in meeting with Iran President Hassan Rouhani. Iran policy was the source of a heated argument in London in June between Mr. Bolton and Mr. Mulvaney, who accused Mr. Bolton of trying to start a war and veering from Mr. Trump's preferred path.
Mr. Bolton was ousted from the White House amid disputes over the president's pursuit of a meeting with the Taliban at Camp David and his willingness to ease sanctions on Tehran to secure a meeting with Mr. Rouhani. His departure was about six weeks after the president's call with Mr. Zelensky.
Mr. Bolton was traveling in Asia on July 23 and 24, but was back in Washington at the time of the Ukraine call. NSC staff asked to hold off on Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky until Mr. Bolton returned from the trip.
But ultimately, Mr. Bolton sent his deputy, Charles Kupperman, to listen in to the July 25 call rather than attending himself, as he consistently did on other scheduled calls with foreign leaders.
White House officials who worked closely with Mr. Bolton interpreted his absence as a signal of his frustration over the suspended Ukraine aid.
The list of those listening on that call—Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence's national security adviser Keith Kellogg, Mr. Kupperman, Mr. Blair, among others—helps to fill out an understanding of a conversation that is now under scrutiny. The presence of Messrs. Kupperman and Blair, and Mr. Mulvaney's absence, haven't previously been reported.
Before the July 25 call, Mr. Bolton argued with the president that any disruption in aid would leave Kyiv and the rest of Europe vulnerable to Russian aggression. One White House aide said that argument became heated on Mr. Bolton's side. After the call, advocates for the aid within the White House and on Capitol Hill pushed for the president to reconsider.
The White House lifted the hold on Sept. 12, two days after Mr. Bolton's departure.
The White House has begun a review into how the president's July 25 call to the Ukrainian leader was handled, people familiar with the process said. The inquiry, led by the White House Counsel's Office, is seeking to establish how administration officials handled the call, including the decision by John Eisenberg, a lawyer at the NSC, to place records of the call into a classified computer system typically reserved for the government's most precious secrets, the people said.
Mr. Mulvaney is supportive of the probe—which was first reported by the New York Times—the people said. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment and the NSC spokesman declined to comment.

Jailing opioid executives is a sickening idea

Texto completo: It is bad enough that the Democratic presidential candidates want to make pharmaceutical companies pay billions of dollars in punishment for the opioid epidemic. It is far worse, both tyrannical and against the spirit of the Constitution, to say the company executives should be criminally tried and imprisoned.
It is the Democratic candidates, not the executives, who are sick.
I’ve explained at length in a prior column why it is absurd to blame the drug manufacturers for the choices of doctors, pharmacists, patients, and black-market dealers and buyers. For all those arguments, please do read it. Pharma executives are not the ones misprescribing or misusing their legally produced drugs.
But to suggest not just that the companies pay damages, but that they should be jailed, is frightening.
Remember, as noted above, these drugs were and are being manufactured legally. They have been approved by the federal government. They have been approved by doctors. And, used correctly, they provide blessed relief to tens, maybe hundreds, of millions of Americans. Serious surgeries of all sorts are bearable because of opioids. Recovery from surgeries is quickened because of these drugs. Cancers and nonsurgically repaired injuries can be excruciating without these medicines.
And, again, these drugs are legally produced. How in tarnation is it right to penalize an executive for making a legal medicine that makes life better for tens of millions, just because others misuse those medicines? Furthermore, in spirit and at least arguably in law as well, how is it not a constitutional violation to criminalize something ex post facto? If it is not criminal to produce and advertise a legal product now, how can the government rightly imprison somebody for having done so?
This proposal, advocated most prominently in the debate by Kamala Harris, is deeply un-American and manifestly unjust. These candidates are addicted to corporation-bashing platitudes, and they need an intervention.

Elizabeth Warren's stubborn dishonesty on raising middle-class taxes

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren deservedly drew heat from several rivals over her stubborn refusal to acknowledge that implementing a $32 trillion plan to provide free health insurance to everybody would require increasing middle-class taxes. But since she keeps trying to make the same bad argument, it's worth reviewing what's so dishonest about it.
Warren, whenever she's asked about whether middle-class taxes would go up, argues that costs would only go up for corporations and the wealthy, but "costs would go down for the middle class."
Essentially, she's trying to make the case that because middle-class Americans would be getting free healthcare, their costs would go down overall. But Sen. Bernie Sanders, who actually wrote the bill she's endorsing, makes a similar argument about middle-class Americans being better off on net under his plan (without premiums, deductibles, or co-payments), but he acknowledges that the middle class would still pay more in taxes.
It's one thing to argue that people are getting a better deal by sending money to the government in exchange for services. It's another to refuse to acknowledge they are paying taxes. For instance, people may believe that paying property taxes and sending their kids to public school is a good deal on net. But they still think of property taxes as taxes and increases in property taxes as tax increases. They don't say that they aren't actually paying taxes, because otherwise they'd have to pay to educate their kids, or that property taxes didn't go up because the percentage increase in tuition at a local private school was even higher.
Even looking at things on a net tradeoff basis, however, Warren's numbers don't add up. An analysis of the 2016 Sanders campaign proposal from the liberal Urban Institute took into account that much of the $32 trillion price tag would result from the federal government absorbing many costs currently being paid by states and the private sector. But the analysis still found that the plan would increase overall health spending in the U.S by $6.6 trillion over a decade.
The largest revenue raiser Warren has proposed during her campaign is a $2.75 trillion wealth tax, or less than half this amount. Put aside the fact that European countries have abandoned wealth taxes because they haven't worked, and that there is significant reason for skepticism that it will raise as much as promised. Warren has already pledged to use the wealth tax to pay for universal child care, universal pre-K, raising child care worker pay, free college, and canceling student loan debt.
The clearest proof that middle-class taxes will have to go up is that other countries with socialized health insurance systems along the lines of what Warren is advocating have higher middle-class taxes than the U.S., and often national sales taxes, or VAT taxes (which are especially punishing for those with lower incomes who have to spend most of their income).
Warren wants us to envy the social welfare systems of other countries while ignoring their tax systems.

Texto completo: Whatever you think of Elizabeth Warren's technology regulation plan (and I think it is idiotic in moral and economic terms), at least she doesn't share Kamala Harris' absolute focus on purging President Trump from Twitter.
In a rather stunning couple of minutes at the Democratic presidential primary debate in Ohio on Tuesday, Harris upheld her plan to see Trump removed from Twitter as some kind of mantle of true leadership; as if the fate of the country will rise or fall on whether Trump can fire off his usually inane messages.
It's a simple point but one that obviously bears observing: Any candidate who thinks this is a serious issue with which to use their limited speaking time on a debate stage is not serious candidate. The country has too many issues of utmost importance facing it. More than that, however, Harris is obviously aware that the complex issues of content creation and online distribution reach many billions of times further than one Twitter account.
The next president, whether Trump or someone else, will have many challenges to face.
@realDonaldTrump isn't one of them.

What is it with the Cuomo brothers and the N-word?

Texto completo: CNN anchor Andrew Cuomo claimed in August that his unflattering nickname “Fredo,” which is derived from the Godfather series, is “like the N-word” for Italian Americans.
This is obviously not true. But do you know what is like the N-word? The N-word, which the CNN host’s brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, dropped Tuesday during a live radio interview.
The governor’s remarks came amid the broader context of him complaining about the New York Times, which he claims does not know what it is talking about when it reports that his administration “pulled off a fiscal sleight of hand, delaying $1.7 billion in scheduled Medicaid payments by three days — effectively pushing the cost to the following year’s budget.”
“To tell you the truth,” Cuomo said, “I don’t even, I don’t understand that fully.”
His host, WAMC's Alan Chartock, joked, “Well, if the Times said it so, it must be so, right?”
“Oh, well, yeah,” groused the governor. “Oh, Times also said in an article the other day, apropos of nothing, they were talking about — going back the Italian-Americans because you now have me. They used an expression that southern Italians were called. I believe they were saying southern Italians, Sicilians — I am half Sicilian — were called, quote-unquote, and pardon my language, but I am just quoting the Times, ‘[N-word] wops.’ N-word wops as a derogatory comment.”
The New York Times article to which Cuomo is referring is an Oct. 12 op-ed titled, “How Italians Became ‘White.'" It includes the following passage:
Racist dogma about Southern Italians found fertile soil in the United States. As the historian Jennifer Guglielmo writes, the newcomers encountered waves of books, magazines and newspapers that “bombarded Americans with images of Italians as racially suspect.” They were sometimes shut out of schools, movie houses and labor unions, or consigned to church pews set aside for black people. They were described in the press as “swarthy,” “kinky haired” members of a criminal race and derided in the streets with epithets like “dago,” “guinea” — a term of derision applied to enslaved Africans and their descendants — and more familiarly racist insults like “white [N-word]” and “[N-word] wop.”
Cuomo had at least three separate racist insults from which to choose and he quoted on live radio the one slur that combines two separate racial epithets. Solid work, my man.
The governor continued Tuesday, railing against the failing New York Times, saying, “When I said that ‘wop’ was a derogatory comment, that is when the Times Union told me, ‘No, you should look in Wikipedia. ‘Wop’ really meant a ‘dandy.’”
“I am sure that’s what they was saying to me back in Queens -- ‘You’re a dandy!’ – when they looked at me with scorn, and gave me a hand gesture and called me a ‘wop.’ So, that’s the New York Times,” he added.
A quick word of clarification: If you are confused by the governor’s reference to the Times Union during his tirade about the New York Times, you should be. They are two separate New York-based news entities. Cuomo conflated the New York Times’ Oct. 12 article with an Aug. 16 Times Union op-ed, which argued that “wop” is actually derived from the word “guappo,” which is Italian for “dude” or “dandy,” as opposed to “without papers,” as the governor claims.
To recap: You have the governor of New York using the N-word for no good reason on live radio. You have his little brother claiming “Fredo” is like the N-word for Italian Americans. This same little brother, by the way, also once said that the term “fake news” is “the equivalent of the N-word for journalists.”
All of this is to say: What is it with the Cuomos and that word?

7 things to watch in the October Democratic debate in Ohio

Texto completo: The impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump has dramatically changed the campaign landscape for the Democratic presidential candidates who will gather Tuesday in Ohio for their fourth debate.
The uproar over Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden has drawn attention away from every other Democrat in the race. And the candidates’ attempts to stay focused on healthcare, immigration, guns and other issues have been largely drowned out by the impeachment media storm and raging controversy over Trump’s foreign policy.
That could change, at least briefly, at the CNN/New York Times debate Tuesday in Westerville, Ohio.
Here are seven things to watch:
1. Will Biden face pressure on Ukraine?
Trump and his allies have been hurling unsubstantiated allegations that Biden, when he was vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor in an effort to protect his son Hunter Biden, who was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
In a July phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens — shortly after suspending nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine for its fight against Russia-backed separatists.
Numerous Ukrainian officials have said there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim. A probe of the gas company had nothing to do with Hunter Biden, they said, and had gone dormant when the Obama administration pushed for the prosecutor’s ouster because of his failure to go after corruption.
Still, Biden has refused to say why he saw no conflict in his son’s paid position on the gas company board when the vice president was the Obama administration’s point man for fighting corruption in Ukraine.
With Democrats nearly united in the drive to impeach Trump, it would be delicate for one of Biden’s rivals to raise the topic of whether his son’s Ukraine work posed at least the appearance of a conflict. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has suggested that kind of attack would serve as a gift to Trump.
But debate moderators might not let Biden easily deflect questions about his son the way he has so far — by going on the attack against Trump for inviting foreign interference in the 2020 election.
Hunter Biden agreed Sunday not to work for any foreign-owned companies if his father is elected president.
2. How will the candidates stack up on foreign affairs?
The chaos and violence that followed Trump’s abandonment of America’s Kurdish allies in Syria last week, apparently at the bidding of Turkey’s president, have pushed foreign affairs to the top of the campaign agenda.
Trump’s Ukraine scandal and the giant Hong Kong protests against the Chinese government could further test the candidates’ dexterity with complex challenges overseas, an area little explored in previous debates.
For Biden, it’s a chance to show the expertise he developed over eight years as vice president and 36 years as a U.S. senator, including two as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
The current and former members of Congress onstage have varying degrees of experience in foreign policy. But for those with little or none — South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer and New York businessman Andrew Yang — questions about troubles abroad will carry an especially high risk if they’re unprepared to respond.
3. How will those in the back of the pack try to vault ahead?
Most of the 12 candidates onstage are stuck below 3% in the polls, so they’re in danger of not qualifying for the party’s increasingly stringent criteria for inclusion in future debates. That gives them an incentive to go on the attack.
California Sen. Kamala Harris, Castro and Booker have all gone after Biden in previous debates, with varying success. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii assailed Harris with scathing criticism of her record as a prosecutor.
With time running out, will Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar target Biden in a bid for moderate voters?
Will Steyer, a first-time candidate for public office who will be onstage for the first time at a Democratic debate, try to advance himself by tearing down one of his opponents?
4. Are the leading contenders ready to rumble?
For months, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has honored a peace pact with Warren, his leading rival for the support of progressives.
But Sanders’ poll numbers have been sliding as Warren’s have been rising, and he’s signaled he’s ready to point out their differences.
“Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not,” he told ABC News on Sunday.
Biden too has started to point out contrasts with Warren. At a recent fundraiser, he described himself as someone with “a proven ability to get things done,” then took an apparent swipe at Warren’s penchant for releasing a wide array of lengthy plans for her presidency. “We’re not electing a planner,” he said.
5. What’s the impact of Sanders’ recent heart attack?
The 78-year-old had to suspend his public events after suffering a heart attack early this month in Las Vegas. Many debate viewers will be watching Sanders’ energy level on Tuesday to assess his fitness to be commander in chief.
The senator’s health-related detour from the campaign trail could also draw new scrutiny to the other septuagenarians in the race: Biden and Warren, as well as Trump.
In a September debate, Castro appeared to question the mental acuity of Biden, who will turn 77 in November, by falsely accusing him of forgetting a comment on healthcare that he’d made a few minutes before. The attack backfired, earning Castro a heap of criticism.
The next oldest Democratic candidate, Warren, who at 70 is three years younger than Trump, frequently puts her vigor on display by jogging into rallies.
Still, the presence on the debate stage of several younger candidates — Buttigieg is 37; Gabbard is 38; Castro, 45; and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, 47 — will inevitably highlight the age of their older rivals.
6. Can Harris and Buttigieg escape the mid-tier doldrums?
Harris has been one of the most uneven performers in the debates so far. She surged upward in the polls after confronting Biden in the first debate over his opposition to busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s.
But she had trouble explaining her healthcare plan in the next debate, and Warren has overtaken her as the top woman in the race. Harris tried to contrast herself with Trump in the September debate, but still failed to gain traction.
Buttigieg, one of the top fundraisers in the field, impressed many Democrats early on as a young, erudite, gay war veteran.
He is relatively popular in Iowa, which holds the party’s first presidential nominating contest on Feb. 3, but he has had trouble building support among African Americans, a crucial Democratic constituency. Like the lower-tier candidates, both Buttigieg and Harris face intense pressure to find a breakaway moment. Buttigieg has taken shots, albeit mild ones, at Warren and O’Rourke in recent days.
7. Will Warren be forced to say how she would pay for “Medicare for all”?
Warren was asked directly in the September debate whether middle-class taxes would rise if she’s able to fulfill her promise to offer Medicare to all Americans. America’s richest individuals and biggest corporations will pay more, she responded, and middle-class families will pay less.
Asked once again if middle-class taxes would rise, Warren sidestepped the question again, saying “total cost” would drop for “hard-working families.”
Republicans see a Democratic nominee who backs higher taxes for the middle class as a gift to Trump. So Warren’s response, if the question arises again, could matter a lot.

Repulsive video satire of rampaging Trump a sign of our sick political times Orlando Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: The sickening decline of politics in 2019 continued this weekend with the showing at a right-wing conference of a video that depicted President Donald Trump massacring a church full of people.
The scene was lifted from the film, "Kingsman: The Secret Service," during which Colin Firth - his mind altered by a SIM card signal - uses guns and stabbing objects to kill people in a Kentucky church.
In the edited version of that scene, Trump's face is on Firth's body, and the faces of his victims are replaced by various news outlets' logos or people the president has denounced (a sizable group, that).
Trump appears to have played no role in all of this, and a spokeswoman said Monday morning that he had not seen it but, "based on everything he had heard, he strongly condemns this video."
It seems odd the president hasn't yet seen it, considering the amount of time he spends on Twitter, but OK.
We would prefer to hear this in the president's own voice, considering he hasn't shied away from embracing violence in the past.
Examples? In 2017, he posted another video, this time an old clip of the real Donald Trump attacking someone during a WrestleMania event. The video he tweeted superimposed CNN's logo over his victim's face. Har, har.
In 2018, he praised a Montana congressman who pleaded guilty to attacking a reporter, saying, "Any guy that can do a body slam, he's my guy."
In 2016, he asked supporters at a rally to "knock the hell" out of protesters, promising to pay the attackers' legal bills.
Until this weekend, the "Kingsman" video resided in a corner of YouTube for more than a year, viewed more than 170,000 times by people who get their jollies from such things.
Then someone decided to show it at AMPfest19, a conservative gathering at the Trump National Doral resort in Miami. The conference featured a lengthy list of speakers, including Donald Trump Jr. and Florida's own U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz and Mike Haridopolos, the one-time president of the state Senate.
The conference had lined up a number of misfits, cranks and extremists to discuss such topics as "Unmasking the Russian Hoax," "Education Indoctrination: How the Left Has Poisoned Our Schools," and "The Left's LGBT Manipulation."
Speakers included Dinesh D'Souza, James O'Keefe, Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer and a person who calls himself Carpe Donktum, who confirmed to the Washington Post that the video's creator was someone who contributes to his MemeWorld site.
Carpe Donktum was Trump's guest in the Oval Office in July. That bears repeating: A guy called Carpe Donktum had a 20-minute meeting with the president of the United States.
We don't know several key details in this story, which was first reported by The New York Times, like who was responsible for showing this video, the time and the location the video was shown, or how many people saw it.
We do know that the organizer of AMPfest19, or American Priority, posted a statement saying he knew nothing about the video and did not sanction it. Was American Priority shocked? Absolutely, but not by the video.
Organizer Alex Phillips wrote that it was "shocking the New York Times would not report on any of the sanctioned events in the article."
If that - and not the graphic depiction of violence against the media and political enemies - is what shocks American Priority, the event should get some new priorities.
Trump didn't tell someone to make this video. He didn't have to. His unceasing attacks on anyone who crosses him have granted soft permission for Americans to act on their worst impulses.
When they do, the president makes a few perfunctory, half-hearted remarks, then returns to the attack mode that amuses and entertains so many of his supporters.
Trump could use his platform to promote American unity, but that's not part of his DNA.
Someday this nation will rediscover its basic decency. Someday can't come soon enough.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House says President Donald Trump has yet to watch a graphically violent parody video that depicts a likeness of him shooting and stabbing opponents and members of the news media, but based on what he's heard, he "strongly condemns" it.
The parody was shown at a meeting of Trump supporters at his Miami resort.
The video portrays Trump's critics and media members as parishioners in a church fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O'Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders' head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organization logos.
Trump's face is superimposed on a killer's body. Among the targets: former President Barack Obama, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry of Trump.
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham says in a tweet that Trump will see the video shortly and that, "based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video."
The video and its screening were first reported by The New York Times.
The "unauthorized video" was shown last week "in a side room" at an American Priority conference at Trump's Doral Miami resort, the event's organizer, Alex Phillips, said in a statement.
"This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned" by the event's organizers, Phillips said.

Russia's Putin visits
Saudi Arabia on Mideast trip
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Saudi Arabia on Monday, meeting with the oil-rich nation's king and crown prince as he seeks to cement Moscow's political and energy ties across the Mideast.
Putin received all the trappings of a state visit, with a mounted guard escorting his limousine to King Salman's Al-Yamamah palace in Riyadh on his first visit to the kingdom since 2007.
In the intervening years, the Arab Spring roiled the wider Mideast as Putin would partner with Iran in backing Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country's still-raging war. Saudi Arabia unsuccessfully backed those trying to oust Assad.
But more recently, Russia joined OPEC in lowering their production beginning in 2017, the first such cut for the cartel in a decade.

Officer who shot naked man found not guilty of murder
DECATUR, Ga. - A former police officer who fatally shot an unarmed, naked man was found not guilty of murder Monday but was convicted of aggravated assault and other charges that could send him to prison for more than 30 years.
Robert "Chip" Olsen's face turned red and he squeezed his eyes shut tightly as the verdict was read. His wife, Kathy Olsen, began sobbing and had to be led from the courtroom.
Olsen, now 57, was a DeKalb County police officer in March 2015 when he responded to a call of a naked man behaving erratically outside an Atlanta-area apartment complex. Shortly after arriving, he fatally shot 26-year-old Anthony Hill, an Air Force veteran who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Texas prison guard acquitted in death of inmate he threw down
ANGLETON, Texas - A jury has acquitted a former Texas prison guard who slammed a handcuffed inmate to the ground so hard that the man's liver ruptured and he died.
The Houston Chronicle reports that Lou Joffrion was acquitted last month on aggravated assault charges in the 2017 death of David Witt, who had mental health issues.
Authorities say Joffrion, who was a sergeant at the Darrington Unit in Brazoria County south of Houston, picked up the 128-pound Witt and slammed him to the ground after Witt refused orders to return to his cell.
Joffrion's lawyer defended the use of force, saying whether it was excessive is "subjective."
Jennifer Erschabek of the Texas Inmate Families Association called the verdict "legalized brutality."

Protests erupt as Spain
convicts separatists
BARCELONA, Spain - Riot police engaged in a running battle with protesters outside Barcelona's airport Monday after Spain's Supreme Court convicted 12 separatist leaders of illegally promoting the wealthy Catalonia region's independence and sentenced nine of them to prison.
Police fired foam bullets and used batons against the thousands of protesters who converged on Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport after a pro-independence grassroots group put out the call. Protesters fought back by throwing objects, spraying dark clouds with fire extinguishers, and breaking windows.
Regional emergency service SEM said 53 people were treated for injuries at the airport.
Police also clashed with angry crowds late Monday night in downtown Barcelona.

Hong Kong police say
bomb targeted its officers
HONG KONG - A homemade, remote-controlled bomb intended to "kill or to harm" riot control officers was detonated as they deployed against renewed violence in Hong Kong over the weekend, police said Monday, in a further escalation of destructive street battles gripping the business hub.
The "loud thud" Sunday night close to riot officers who had been clearing away a protester-built roadblock marked the first known use of an explosive during protests that started in June.
But despite spiraling violence, widespread vandalism and gasoline-bomb attacks by black-clad, hard-core protesters - and repeated government appeals for people not to take their side - the protest movement is still rousing determined support from more moderate demonstrators.

Dems focus on Trump, state issues

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – It's debate week in Ohio. And national Democrats want you to know they're not going to abandon the state when it's over.
On Tuesday, 12 Democratic presidential hopefuls will debate in the Columbus suburb Westerville. The location is said to represent Democrats' inroads in the suburbs and its commitment to campaign in the state that Donald Trump won in 2016 by 8 points.
Issues such as Medicare for all and the Green New Deal have dominated the national narrative around the Democratic primary. But they were near absent during the Ohio Democratic Party's state dinner Sunday.
Instead, party officials and a handful of 2020 presidential candidates addressing the crowd spent much of their time attacking Trump, pledging to address climate change and urging action on gun control and the opiate addiction crisis.
The five candidates – who have polled in single digits in recent weeks – delivered messages tailored to Ohio.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar stressed her ability to win Republican-leaning areas. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg likened the Trump presidency to a TV show, and in a few short months, "You get to pick up the remote and change the channel to something better."
Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan said Democrats shouldn't be afraid to voice support for labor unions. Businessman Tom Steyer noted a recent spate of overdose deaths in the county. Businessman Andrew Yang started his speech with a stat about manufacturing automation correlating with support for Trump.
"It's been an interesting campaign to be a candidate from Ohio because it seems like it's all happening here," said Ryan, the only candidate of the five who won't be on the debate stage Tuesday.
More than 25,000 people requested free tickets to the debate from the party; only a few hundred were available.
The state and national party organized events across the state before and after the debate. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez will meet General Motors workers on strike in West Chester, farmers in central Ohio and gun violence survivors in Dayton. Candidates extended their stay by a few days to campaign here.
Republicans have painted the Democratic field as too far left and out-of-touch with most voters, especially Ohioans who elected Trump in 2016.
"From supporting a bogus impeachment witch hunt, to advocating for failed socialist policies, the Democrats' radical agenda is taking center stage in Ohio," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said in a statement. "But no matter the candidate, not one 2020 wannabe will stack up to President Trump's record of success in the Buckeye State."
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper refuted that idea, saying Democrats are with the mainstream on big issues such as health care, guns and climate change. Republicans, Pepper said, are in the minority.
"They want to keep the Affordable Care Act, expand it, do better – others want to go further. It's a debate between how do we broaden access," Pepper told reporters before the dinner. "Donald Trump and the Republicans want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act entirely."
Perez said the party will invest in Ohio because he thinks Democrats can win here. The message, he said, is simple: "We have your back on the issues that matter most."
CNN, which hosted the July debate, will host the Oct. 15 debate with The New York Times.

Warren escalates Facebook fight with ad targeting Zuckerberg

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has escalated her tiff with Facebook by running an ad — on Facebook — taking aim at its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. It's the latest example of growing resentment of Big Tech by Republicans and Democrats alike.
The list of grievances is long: Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are too big and powerful. They're bad for privacy, public discourse, democracy, and small business. They're spying on us, contributing to economic inequality, and hooking us and our children on addictive, useless services. The companies, of course, object to these characterizations.
Warren, who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies, began running a text ad on Facebook last Thursday to take aim at Zuckerberg.
"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election," the ad reads. It then goes on to say that while this isn't true, Zuckerberg has "given Donald Trump free rein to lie" on Facebook.
Warren's ad is taking issue with Facebook's policy of not fact-checking politicians' speech or ads, the way it has outside parties fact-check news stories and other posts. Facebook has refused to remove a misleading video ad from President Trump's campaign targeting Democrat Joe Biden.
Facebook responded to Warren's move by tweeting Saturday that the Federal Communications Commission "doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech. We agree it's better to let voters — not companies — decide."

Census Bureau seeks state data, citizenship information
The US Census Bureau is asking states for drivers' license records that typically include citizenship data and has made a new request for information on recipients of government assistance, alarming some civil rights advocates.
The two approaches come amid President Trump's efforts to make citizenship a key aspect of federal information-gathering in the runup to the 2020 Census, despite this year's Supreme Court ruling that a specific citizenship question can't be included.
Civil rights advocates worry that the wider net being cast by the Trump administration for such information could chill Latino participation in the population count, which will determine how many congressional seats each state gets and guide the allocation of federal funding. The census results also will be used to redraw state and local electoral maps.
Specialists caution that inaccuracies in state motor vehicle records also make them a poor choice for tracking citizenship, if that is the bureau's goal.
After the Supreme Court ruling, Trump signed an executive order in July requiring the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to collect records on citizenship from federal agencies and increase efforts "to obtain State administrative records concerning citizenship."
The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators said most, if not all, states recently received requests for information including citizenship status, race, birthdates, and addresses. The association has advised members to consult their privacy officers, and "each state is making their own determination how to respond," spokeswoman Claire Jeffrey said in an e-mail.
Associated Press
Russia pounces on US missteps in Syria
These have been disastrous weeks for American foreign policy, a popular presenter on Russia's state television told viewers on Sunday night.
The United States essentially turned its back on Ukraine amid the impeachment inquiry, TV host Dmitry Kiselyov said in his weekly show. Then, Washington abandoned the Syrian Kurds. “The Kurds themselves again picked the wrong patron," Kiselyov said. “The United States, of course, is an unreliable partner."
As the Middle East reels from President Trump's erratic foreign policy, Russia is savoring a fresh chance to build its status as a resurgent world power and cast itself as a force for stability. The withdrawal of US troops from northeastern Syria, coupled with Turkey's incursion, is allowing Russia to play the part of responsible peacemaker.
It's too soon to tell whether Russia will be able to manage the new volatility in Syria, just as it's not clear if the impeachment furor over Ukraine will help the Kremlin's interests in Eastern Europe. But as Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in Saudi Arabia Monday for a state visit to one of America's most important allies, it appeared clear that Trump's moves in recent months were helping him make the case that Moscow, not Washington, was the more dependable actor on the world stage.
Putin appears to be betting that he can boost Russia's global standing by playing to other countries' individual interests in a world in which the Trump administration's moves have left many traditional US allies in dismay.
“Russia will never be friends with one country against another," Putin said in an interview with two Arab news networks and the Kremlin-controlled channel RT Arabic that aired Sunday. “We build bilateral relations that rely on positive trends generated by our contacts; we do not build alliances against anyone."

Trump says he'll look into case after Fox appearance
President Trump says he'll "be looking into" the case of a US financial adviser charged with killing a hotel worker while on a family vacation in Anguilla after the man's wife appeared on the "Fox & Friends" morning show and urged Trump to intervene.
Trump tweeted shortly after the segment that, "Something looks and sounds very wrong."
He says: "I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!"
Scott Hapgood and his family were on vacation when they say a hotel worker showed up at their room unannounced and demanded money before attacking them on April 13.
An autopsy report shows the victim, 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel of Dominica, died of positional asphyxia and received blunt force injuries to his torso and other areas.

Where’s the whistleblower? Key GOP questions about Schiff’s contact may never be answered

Texto completo: House Republicans are eager to ask the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry a variety of questions about the scope and frequency of his contact with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.
They also want to know about the California Democrat's role in orchestrating the complaint alleging President Trump sought Ukraine’s help investigating Joe Biden.
But it is appearing more likely Republicans will never have the chance to ask the whistleblower any questions at all about how closely he worked with Schiff’s team.
“At some point, both Schiff and the whistleblower came to the conclusion that his personal testimony stands to do more harm than good to both of them,” a Republican source who requested anonymity told the Washington Examiner.
Republicans planned to ask the whistleblower a long list of questions about his contact with Schiff. Among the questions is whether Schiff directed the whistleblower to file his complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, which gave Schiff’s committee official jurisdiction over the matter and provided a platform for them to launch an impeachment inquiry.
Schiff hasn’t made an announcement about the whistleblower’s appearance but it is looking increasingly likely he won’t be testifying at all, even though Democrats had once deemed his testimony crucial to their probe into Trump’s conduct during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Suddenly, the whistleblower has become irrelevant.
“Given that we already have the call record, we don't need the whistleblower who wasn't on the call to tell us what took place during the call,” Schiff told CBS News on Sunday. “We have the best evidence of that.”
Schiff has over the past two weeks gradually veered away from his effort to interview the whistleblower citing the need to protect the person’s safety and anonymity.
But just weeks earlier, House Intelligence Committee Democrats were adamant about interviewing the whistleblower, even though he did not have first hand knowledge of the July 25 call.
Democrats demanded acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire promise to allow the testimony before House lawmakers conducting the impeachment probe.
“I was very pleased that the Director gave his personal assurance that that whistleblower would not only be protected, but when that whistleblower comes before our committee, and all that is remaining is to get the security clearances for his or her counsel, that when that whistleblower comes before our committee, there won't be any Department of Justice minder, no White House minder — no one to sit next to that whistleblower and try to circumscribe, redact anything that whistleblower has to say as it pertains to misconduct by the president or anyone around him,” Schiff told CNN last month.
Schiff became less enthusiastic about hearing from the whistleblower following his admission on Oct. 2, provided by his press team directly to the New York Times, that his top staff on the intelligence panel had, in fact, been in contact with the whistleblower prior to the whistleblower filing a formal complaint about the call with the intelligence community inspector general.
Schiff’s admission contrasted his earlier claim that the panel had no communication at all with the whistleblower.
And it drew sharp criticism from Republicans who cited it as evidence Schiff has been dishonest about his role in orchestrating the whistleblower complaint and subsequent leaks to the media.
“So the whistleblower was communicating with team Adam Schiff behind the scenes?” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee member Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina, said. “Well. This explains a lot, indeed.”
Schiff has insisted he had no personal contact with the whistleblower and that only his staff handled the communication with the whistleblower, who approached the panel days before lodging the official complaint.
“As Chairman Schiff has made clear, he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, has had no communication with them or their attorney, and did not view the whistleblower’s complaint until the day prior to the hearing with the director of national intelligence, when the office of the director of national intelligence finally provided it to the committee,” Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland told the Washington Examiner.
Republicans believe the whistleblower’s contact with Schiff’s team was more significant than he has disclosed and say the GOP lawmakers on the panel would have compelled the whistleblower to testify about that contact.
“Republicans are convinced that the contacts between Schiff, his staff, and the whistleblower were much more extensive than reported,” the GOP source said.“If we get a second round of media stories about Schiff being deceptive again, that would be really damaging to Schiff,” the GOP source said. “He doesn’t want to have to answer those questions.”
Schiff has for weeks been building the case that the whistleblower believes his anonymity and safety would be threatened if he appears before the committee.
Democrats cite Trump’s comments calling the whistleblower’s account of the call “a fraud” and the whistleblower’s lawyers wrote to Congress and called Trump’s comments about the whistleblower “dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers.”
Schiff, speaking to CBS News Sunday, said his priority is making sure “the whistleblower is protected,” now that other whistleblowers are surfacing and that the original whistleblower’s testimony “may not be necessary.”
For Republicans, it will end any chance of finding out what guidance, if any, Schiff offered the whistleblower, when and how the whistleblower first contacted Schiff’s staff, whether the staff consulted with Schiff before advising the whistleblower, and what advice Schiff may have provided and whether they leaked any of the information to the media.
“Schiff has never given a full account of it, so about the only way we could get that information is to question the whistleblower directly,” the GOP source told the Washington Examiner. “Now, conveniently, Schiff is closing off that possibility.”

Texto completo: John McCain's widow and daughter condemned a fake video aired by President Trump's supporters, which depicts him killing media outlets and political adversaries including the late senator.
"Reports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage," Cindy McCain said Monday on Twitter.
Tweet
Meghan McCain retweeted her mother's statement and sent out a couple of her own comments on the video on Twitter.
"No it isn’t - the joker is a fictional character from a comic book. One of the people in this video is my Dad, sitting senators and congresspeople. Please don’t insult me or them by insinuating this is anything like heavy metal. This could inspire violence towards REAL people," McCain told journalist Stephen Miller, who compared the video to the Joker movie and called it a meme.
Tweet
The co-host of The View, 34, added that people defending the video would be outraged if Democrats had made their own version of it.
"Also you’d be screaming bloody murder if something like this was shown at an Adam Schiff or Obama event. So please for God’s sake just stop. This video is disgusting and disturbing and any human with any moral clarity sees that," she said.
Tweet
A fake video of Trump killing his political enemies surfaced Sunday night after the New York Times reported it was played at a pro-Trump conference at his Trump National Doral Miami resort last week. The Trump campaign condemned the video saying they "do not condone violence." His press secretary also said he "strongly condemns" it but has not seen it yet.
Tweet
Members of the media widely criticized the video as disturbing.

Purple &amp; Bold: China, the NBA and the limits of basketball diplomacy

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Monday, Oct. 14 edition of the Purple & Bold Lakers newsletter. To receive breaking Lakers news and the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
The NBA has a program called Basketball Without Borders, a community service initiative that has run camps in 27 different countries over the last two decades. The dream goes something like this: Through the game of basketball, diverse cultures can find some common ground.
But the world as we know it has borders — not just geopolitical lines on a map, but borders of ideology and values. And never have the limits of NBA diplomacy become more apparent than last week.
The Lakers and Nets unwittingly put themselves in the midst of an international incident this week because of a tweet. It’s a weird situation, especially given that the Chinese response has felt particularly outsized, but it’s highlighted what the limitations are for a game to be a unifying force in a world with endlessly complex divisions.
The NBA became so aware of the thorny nature of the politics of the situation that they shut down media availability for the entire trip. The Athletic reported that players, most prominently LeBron James, were wary of the onus for the NBA’s response to China’s actions being put on them, and asked to not be made available for questions. Rather than putting players in position to say something harmful either abroad or at home (like James Harden awkwardly apologizing to China for his general manager’s tweet), the NBA and the player’s association wanted avoid commentary “in real time,” at least until everyone was safely home.
It should be noted here that China is a country that tightly controls and restricts visas: Journalists, for example, require multiple references to just get in. Multiple times, the government kept the NBA in the dark as to whether they would even be allowed to participate in their events. A situation where the Chinese government harassed or detained a player for something they said while visiting abroad could have felt like a very real threat to the traveling contingent. If that’s the case, Adam Silver probably made a wise choice to keep them out of the line of fire.
But now that everyone is safely home, where does it go from here? The NBA would probably prefer this situation quietly goes away, and that they can continue their lucrative contracts in a country where basketball has been increasingly popular. The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese government was toning down rhetoric against the NBA — which make sense because the incident has drawn attention to their authoritarian handling of the Hong Kong protests. It’s bad diplomacy to cut off a league that’s well-liked in the country, disappointing fans locally and making observers abroad question whether they should do business there.
But it seems difficult to imagine this will go away soon. Next year, the NBA will be pressed to continue exhibition games in China: Which teams are going to want to go? Which teams are going to want their players subjected to questions about what it’s like to be the first teams to play since the international incident that briefly flared up tensions between the NBA and China? What do they think of how China handles Hong Kong (because in a year, a lack of knowledge on the situation will be a less convincing case)?
In absence of the voices of players and other NBA personnel who actually went to China, Steve Kerr’s voice stood out among people stateside who spoke on the issue. Well, “spoke” might be a strong word, but Kerr offered that it’s easier for NBA players and coaches to speak on social issues that are close to home. That’s understandable, and it does seem like an unfair burden to expect the NBA to set the example for all US-Chinese relations in all cases.
But it’s also true that the NBA’s reputation as a league that’s outspoken and unafraid to speak the truth on important issues is taking some hits.
As Kerr put it: “Using the game as a force for the greater good. I think those things are important, those values are important. Obviously, there are tremendous financial forces at play here — so how you reconcile all that, I don’t know.”
No one else in the NBA appears to know either.
In the interest of examining the issue, I’m dropping a lot of related reading down in the links.
BUT WHY TONIGHT?
If you’re surprised to see a Lakers-Warriors home game less than 72 hours after the Lakers last played in China, it’s hard to imagine that the Lakers are thrilled about it either.
It’s unclear if players will miss the game due to fatigue. It’s easy to imagine LeBron James, for example, sitting this one out, especially if Anthony Davis is unable to play following his MRI on his sprained thumb. Preseason games, it should be noted, are firmly under control of teams. But it’s also true that any team going to China is hard-pressed to squeeze six preseason games into its schedule.
Frank Vogel said earlier this month that he would be judicious when it came to divvying up time for the long preseason schedule: “I think they made a wise decision a couple years back to reduce it from 8 preseason games to six. Potentially could go even further down to four. I think each coach has an obligation to their team to make sure they’re being smart with their vets. Make sure they’re getting enough reps to learn their new teammates and the system. Get sharp, ready to play, but not overdo it.”

Charles M. Blow: Trumpism’s infinite vulgarities

Texto completo: The terrains of acceptability and respectability have shifted under the American conservative.
That which was once forbidden is now embraced. That which they once condemned, they cheer. Conservatism has been unveiled in all its craven glory. No longer is it shrouded behind morality, small government, traditional values and spending concerns.
President Donald Trump is the new doctrine, and Republicans bought it. There is no amount of cruelty or crudeness he can display that Republicans won’t cheer and defend. His corruption has become theirs.
And, it is possible that Trump is growing bolder in his coarseness, and it is revealed that there is precious little that will shake loose his base and its blind devotion to him.
Last week, Trump went on more profanity-laced tirades. At a campaign rally in Minnesota, Trump said of Joe Biden: “He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass.”
Let’s ignore for the moment that one could not find a more obsequious vice president than Mike Pence, a man who looks at Trump like he’s made of rainbows and cotton candy.
Let’s instead focus on the coding of the charge against Biden, whether Trump is conscious of it or not, whether it was intentional or not.
The insult invokes a fear and disdain that white racists have had throughout American history: The subjugation of the white man to the black one.
Indeed, Jim Crow was born out of a fear of “Negro domination” in which white Southerners were deadly afraid that they could be forced to live under black rule in the wake of the Civil War.
This was a real possibility. In the 1870 census, the first after the enslaved were emancipated, several Southern states were majority black and several others were within striking distance of that marker.
And many Southerners despised Northern liberals for seeming to encourage the ascendance of black people in the South.
So, Southern states, beginning with Mississippi, called constitutional conventions to write white supremacy into the DNA of those states.
The subjugation of Biden, the Northern white liberal, to the black man is not only a symbol but an omen. The white supremacists see this as a particular kind of racial betrayal and racial subjugation that can never be made normal.
To them, these white men and women who would happily play second fiddle to a black man — or white feminist, or someone who is Hispanic or Arab, or someone who is LGBTQ — is engaged in surrender of the white racist patriarchy. It is a sign of weakened, misplaced affections, and a lust of annihilation. These white liberals to them are N-word lovers.
That is why Obama stays on the tip of Trump’s tongue. The invocation of him is a hot-wire shorthand that gives an emotional charge to his statements that his audience receives intuitively. The racism is coded, received, without the burden of delivery.
The disdain for and distrust of Obama is still strong and abiding.
Conservatives scoured every facet of his life looking for a scandal and found none. They picked at every imaginary faux pas — wearing a tan suit, putting his feet on the desk, putting mustard on his burger — and yet they not only defend Trump’s truly vulgar behaviors, they cheer them.
Sarah Palin made a whole campaign out of saying that Obama “pals around with terrorists,” while Trump quite literally cozies up to murderous dictators and brags about the love letters he exchanges with one.
Republicans see nothing wrong here. Trump is a rich white man defending white supremacy and white nationalism. For him, the rules are different. For him, certain dispensations must be given.
According to Politico:
“One of Donald Trump’s most prominent Christian supporters will argue in a book due out before the 2020 general election that American evangelicals ‘have a moral obligation to enthusiastically back’ the president.”
How can that be?
Pat Robertson, upset last week over Trump’s unconscionable abandoning of the Kurds in northern Syria, said: “The president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen.”
As if he had a mandate from heaven.
The way that the Religious Right has bent and distorted biblical doctrine to support this vulgar man is absolutely obscene. It makes a mockery of their faith and their supposed philosophies.
The moment that Trump insisted on separating immigrant children from their families, locking those children in cages and arguing in court against having to provide soap and toothbrushes to those children, or against turning off the lights so that they could sleep, should have been the red line to any true Christian — or for any human being with a shred of compassion, regardless of faith. But it wasn’t. So, now I no longer know what to call these people.
Righteousness simply can’t be this transactional and situational. What is the point of your books of rules if you will gladly oblige a man who flaunts them? Either morality has meaning or it doesn’t.

Biden divides Black voters by generation

Texto completo: While polls suggest Joe Biden leads among Black voters, please read the fine print. Although Barack Obama's vice president touts his African-American support by saying "I think they know me," in reality that support is conditional, more specifically generational, and therefore flimsy and tenuous.
Biden enjoys widespread support among older Black adults, leaving some younger Black voters to try to persuade their parents and grandparents to change their ways and shift their vote for the 2020 election.
Black millennials and Gen Z-ers are proactively attempting to sway their elder family members away from Biden and toward progressive candidates, as the New York Times reported in September. While it's unclear if the attempt to specifically sway older Black voters is working, according to an October Quinnipiac poll, Biden's support among Black registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters has dropped 17 points since their July poll.
Biden has downplayed this Black generational gap, suggesting the votes of older and moderate Blacks are all he may need to get him over the top. However, it should come as no surprise that Biden has a young Black people problem.
While his age, 76, has been mentioned as an issue, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are also in his age group - and yet their age, until Sanders' recent heart attack, has not emerged as a factor.
But what has proven a roadblock for Biden's support among young people of color is the shelf life of his mindset, his decades-old sentiments on race, society and politics that seem to lock him into the 1960s and 1970s. Add to that Biden's perceived persona of white moderation that tells Black people we should move in baby steps rather than seek aggressive and immediate change.
During the third Democratic debate, when asked about slavery and reparations, Biden responded with references to Black parents unable to raise their children, and by telling them to "make sure you have the record player on at night." At that moment, Biden sounded out of touch - more like a white man blaming Black people for their oppression.
While Obama sometimes lectured young Black people, as he did during his 2013 commencement address to Morehouse College, he was able to get away with it because he was the Black president, familiar with the hardships that Black Americans face. And although Biden enjoys touting his proximity to Obama, it comes off as condescending when the former vice president addresses the Black community about inequalities that plague it.
When Biden recently spoke at an LGBTQ presidential forum, he appeared out of touch with present-day criminal justice realities by insisting yet again that his 1994 crime bill did not increase mass incarceration.
"That act was overwhelmingly supported by the African-American community, overwhelmingly supported by the community at large. Everyone from Ted Kennedy on voted for it. It did not have mandatory life sentences in it. That wasn't what it was about," Biden argued.
Yes, the bill was supported by many Black leaders at the time. And yes, studies have shown that incarceration rates were on a steady incline prior to the bill. But to repeatedly dismiss arguments that the bill had a role in increasing the mass incarceration rates, and how it continues to impact communities of color, is shortsighted.
For young Black voters the denial of the crime bill's effects may bring to mind how it had a part in creating a flawed criminal justice system that allowed for the killers of Tray von Martin, Eric Garner and Philando Castile to walk free while many people of color are serving lengthy prison sentences for doing far less.
A tone-deaf Biden once said that young people - not specifically Black - who think these days are as hard as the 1960s have no right to complain.
"The younger generation now tells me how tough things are - give me a break," he told the Los Angeles Times last year. "No, no, I have no empathy for it, give me a break."
Perhaps Biden would have more credibility had he not been one of the most ardent supporters of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which makes it exceedingly difficult for people to discharge their student loan debt when they file for bankruptcy unless they can prove undue hardship.
America is suffering from a $1.65 trillion student-debt crisis amid soaring tuition rates. Blacks are hit particularly hard, with 85% of Black college students holding debt compared with 69% of white students. Black people owe an average of $34,000, which is $4,000 more than their white counterparts.
And, according to the Brookings Institution, Black students have three times the default rate. The racial wealth gap means Black people have less accumulated wealth and borrow more than whites, and, as victims of institutional discrimination, are targeted by for-profit institutions.
A new generation of Black voters does not need lectures on parenting skills or how to win the contest for Black respectability. Young Black adults are spending their time supporting their families and raising their children.
They are struggling against the impact of climate change that will hit their own communities hardest, while also fighting racial injustice and mass incarceration exacerbated by the 1994 crime bill Biden championed with pride. Not to mention, Black voters are suffering from a historic loss of wealth since the Great Recession - a subprime mortgage crisis from which homeowners, unlike Wall Street, never received a bailout.
When Biden speaks virtuously, as he did in June, of his history of compromising with white segregationist lawmakers, he harkens back to a time when Black people were excluded and invisible. After some backlash, Biden first said that his comments on that were taken out of context, then he said he regretted the remarks.
But for young Black voters watching the recent rise of white nationalism, Biden's history of being "civil" with segregationists (his word) is alarming.
As the 2020 election heats up, Biden may be feeling confident about securing the Black vote, but it would be a mistake for him not to think about younger Black voters, an influential part of this crucial voting bloc. For them, "President Biden" is not a solution to the social, economic and environmental issues that they face. - (CNN)

Texto completo: Facebook wants to pivot to privacy, but there's a new obstacle in its path: Attorney General William Barr.
Barr and other law enforcement officials in the United States, Britain and Australia are asking the technology company to scrap its much-touted plan to make all of its messaging services end-to-end encrypted by default. The move is likely the first salvo in a broader fight against programs that put users' communications out of government's reach -- a trend that Barr this summer called "unacceptable" and "exceptionally dangerous."
But leaving consumers' information unprotected is dangerous, too. The officials say in their letter that they support a "means for lawful access," otherwise known as a "backdoor" for authorities to enter with a warrant. The problem is that a door for U.S. authorities could be a door for everyone else. And everyone else wants in.
Services such as WhatsApp operate with a universal code, which means the moment the United States is offered a security workaround, the leaders of countries far less free will start asking for similar treatment. Egypt, The New York Times recently reported, has been conducting sophisticated cyberattacks on its opposition politicians and civil society. Microsoft has revealed that the Iranian government attempted to breach email accounts belonging to a U.S. presidential campaign. Create a "golden key" for the good guys here, and hackers might find ways to unlock whatever they wish.
Barr's concerns are legitimate. Criminals take advantage of these systems to conduct their business in the dark, and some of that business, such as child exploitation imagery, is repugnant. There is a tradeoff between security and safety. But the tradeoff need not be absolute. Even with encryption, there are ways to gather evidence, and there could be areas for compromise beyond the debate over a backdoor.
Solutions might vary depending on the abuse being targeted, and each possibility comes with narrower tradeoffs of its own. Forwarding limits could stop disinformation from going viral; filtering tools could conceivably allow users to reject flagged material from being sent to them or prevent some material from being sent altogether. Some believe the way forward for criminal investigations is to permit court-compelled device unlocking for suspects in custody; others believe lawful hacking is the answer. But preventing end-to-end encryption entirely would be a mistake.

Salesianum star O'Neill faces Eagles

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA – When the Eagles played the Vikings last Oct. 7, Brian O'Neill was still a reserve, in his rookie season as a second-round draft pick.
That changed for O'Neill, the Salesianum and University of Pittsburgh star, later in the season when injuries proceeded to decimate the Vikings' offensive line.
Now, O'Neill is an anchor at right tackle on an offensive line with the third best rushing offense in the NFL, with a running back in Dalvin Cook who's second in the NFL in rushing with 542 yards.
Cook is also a threat as a receiver, with 200 yards, including 86 last week against the Giants.
To O'Neill, as he told the Vikings' website, it's all part of the process.
"If I went back now and looked at the first couple games I played in, I'd be like, 'Oh my gosh. Who's that?'" O'Neill said. "And honestly, I hope I feel the same way next year, looking back on the first couple games from this season and saying, 'Man, I can't believe I was doing some of that stuff.' Because I think I'm so far away from what I can be and who I want to be as a player."
O'Neill has yet to allow a sack this season. Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said he wanted to rebuild his offensive line with young athletic players like rookie center Garrett Bradbury and O'Neill, a former state basketball player of the year at Salesianum on a team with the Milwaukee Bucks' Donte DiVincenzo.
"He started coming on quite a bit towards the end of last year," Zimmer said. "When he first got here, he needed to gain some strength and bulk. I thought as the season wore on, he became more aggressive when he started understanding the program a little bit more. He's done a really, really nice job with our run game, and in our pass game. I feel like he's a guy that has a bright future for us."
'Singing like a canary' Eagles safety Andrew Sendejo spent the last eight seasons with the Vikings and knows their defense as well as anybody on the current Vikings team.
No wonder Zimmer said about Sendejo during a conference call this week: "I'm sure he's singing like a canary."
Sendejo wasn't going for that narrative. He played for the Vikings in their 38-7 loss to the Eagles in the 2017-18 NFC Championship game and was run over on a TD run by LeGarrette Blount.
"I have my own job," he said. "I'm not just here to help the offense. I have my own special teams and defense team stuff that I have to focus on and study."
Sendejo didn't have much luck against the Eagles last season, either. He suffered a season-ending groin injury in the fifth game last year at Philadelphia, a 23-21 Vikings win. The Vikings didn't pick up Sendejo's $5.5 million option for 2019. He signed a one-year, $1.3 million deal with the Eagles.
Prediction There are many reasons to pick against the Eagles in this one. Vikings QB Kirk Cousins typically picks apart their defense, as the Minneapolis Star-Tribune points out. Cousins has a career passer rating of 101.2 against the Eagles, with 17 TDs and only 5 INTs. He has averaged 303 yards passing per game against the Eagles.
He also got a call from the president after last week's win over the Giants, as Pro Football Talk details.
The Vikings have a stout defense, led by defensive ends Danielle Hunter and Everson Griffen, giving up just 14.6 points per game.
But I like the Eagles. They have the best run defense in the NFL, and Fletcher Cox seems to be playing better at defensive tackle, despite not getting any of the 10 sacks last week against the Jets. So if they can slow Cook, the Eagles will have a good chance.
Score: Eagles 26, Vikings 24
Around the NFC East Washington
Running back Adrian Peterson is one player who seems energized by Washington's coaching change when Bill Callahan was promoted to replace the fired Jay Gruden, as the Washington Post reports.
That's because Callahan said his team will run the ball more.
Washington has averaged 17.6 carries per game this season, down eight carries per game from last season.
Of course, the strategy for the 0-5 Redskins might work against the Miami Dolphins, who are 0-4 and could be one of the worst teams of all-time, as USA Today posits.
"I'm hyped about it," Peterson said. "You look at the first four weeks ... totally opposite from what we did last year when we were able to be more successful as a team."
Wilmington native Wendell Smallwood could also benefit.
He had six carries for 27 yards last week against New England, most coming long after the game was decided.
Giants
Giants quarterback Daniel Jones, who's 22 years old, got quite an education from Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who's 42 years old, in New England's 35-14 win Thursday, as the New York Times describes.
Jones threw three interceptions, and his six in the last three games after not throwing any in his first two.
Of course, not having Saquon Barkley, or three of their top receivers, didn't help.
"I don't think it was overwhelming, I think it was just bad plays, bad decisions," Jones said.
Cowboys
For some reason, the Dallas Morning News writes that Dak Prescott's six interceptions aren't necessarily a bad thing.
He's not leaning as much on Ezekiel Elliott, and Prescott is on pace to surpass 5,000 yards passing this season. He has also surpassed 400 yards passing twice this season (he had only done so once in three previous seasons).
Then again, Eagles QB Carson Wentz has only surpassed 300 yards once this season, but he has thrown just 2 INTs.

Texto completo: I should start by disclosing that Halloween is my favorite holiday on earth. I love the blatantly transactional nature of it, the fact that it jettisons religious tradition in favor of uncut sugar lust.
But to me, Halloween has always represented something even more profound: the chance to upend the prevailing moral order.
After all, kids are duly instructed in school, at home, and on television to never take candy from strangers. Yet, on this one blessed night, kids are basically exhorted to venture out, garishly dressed, to accept sweets from any rando who happens to open the door.
Back when I was a kid, in the latchkey '70s, there was a communal understanding that certain acts of low-level vandalism and bullying were going to transpire on Halloween. Eggs were going to be chucked. Pumpkins were going to be smashed. Doorbells were going to be rung then ditched. While I'm technically not advocating for any of these activities, I do remember the sheer thrill of Halloween as being drenched with this sense of anarchic peril.
You kind of never knew what was going to happen, what you might see (some neighborhood mom in her slip!), or who you might encounter (a roving band of marauding teens intent on snatching your hard-won treasure). Would you be the kid who dared to bite into the caramel apple booby-trapped by some maniac with a razor blade, and if so, what would it feel like to have your tongue sheared in half?
OK, that looks horrifying on paper. But Halloween used to represent the closest a kid could get to a world free from parental oversight.
Which is precisely why I find today's kid-safe version so lame.
Back in my day — a phrase I am mortified to be uttering — the idea that a parent would chaperone Halloween was unthinkable.
But in my neighborhood now, it's considered de rigueur for parents to trick or treat with their kids — sometimes whole families dress up together. The adults wind up chatting with one another. The themed costumes are praised. Photos are taken. It becomes a coffee klatch.
Some families festoon their homes with elaborate decorations and camp out in their front yards, as if the point of Halloween is for the parents to gather compliments like so many UNICEF pennies.
As any lawyer would tell you, this kind of fraternizing violates both the spirit and intent of Halloween, which is for children to gather as much candy as possible in the limited window allotted. You don't hang on Halloween. You hustle.
Thanks to shrewd planning and an obsessive awareness of my childhood neighborhood, I used to routinely rack up 10 pounds of candy every year. I would then haul the booty back home, where I dumped it on the rug and engaged in an interminable trading session with my brothers. A full-size Snickers bar for two Laffy Taffys and a fistful of candy corn? Nice try.
These sessions were made all the more intriguing by the sheer diversity of candies doled out back then: dozens of different candy bars, hard candies, cream chews, taffies, toffees, jelly beans. National brands, regional brands — like my beloved Big Hunk bar — even homemade concoctions, like the candied apples that Gary Lahr's mom saw fit to give out (and, hey, no razor blades).
Not today. Parents are so paranoid about kids being poisoned, that most stick with the same mass-market bars. When my kids return home, 90 percent of their take consists of the staid six: Snickers, Reese's, Milky Way, Kit Kat, Twix, and M&M's. And they're invariably “fun size," a term I put in quotation marks because I do not consider receiving a fraction of a candy bar to be fun.
But honestly, none of that would be so bad except for the most galling aspect of today's Halloween protocol: the fact that most parents don't allow their children to keep their haul. No, there's an elaborate system of candy buybacks — sometimes dentists get involved — in which kids are basically forced to trade their sweets for cash or toys or, I don't know, karma.
If my parents had suggested such a scheme to me and my brothers, we would have sought legal remedy, arguing (quite correctly) that the candy in question was work product, and, as such, not subject to illegal seizure.
Alas, now comes the ugly part, the part where I confess to having gone over to the dark side.
Because as the father of three young children — two of them registered candy addicts — I must reluctantly admit to having participated in these desecrations. I have chaperoned my children, have limited their trick-or-treating time, and, most shamefully, have requisitioned their Halloween loot — setting aside a few Kit Kat Darks for myself, obviously.
I can offer no excuses for these betrayals, aside from the fact that I had cavities in every single one of my back teeth by the time I was 12.
I'm not proud. I can only plead that nobody reading this will tell my children how I really feel.

12 Hours. 4 Syrian Hospitals Bombed.

Texto completo: The Russian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush the last pockets of resistance to President Bashar al-Assad, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
An analysis of previously unpublished Russian Air Force radio recordings, plane spotter logs and witness accounts allowed The Times to trace bombings of four hospitals in just 12 hours in May and tie Russian pilots to each one.
The 12-hour period beginning on May 5 represents a small slice of the air war in Syria, but it is a microcosm of Russia's four-year military intervention in Syria's civil war. A new front in the conflict opened this week, when Turkish forces crossed the border as part of a campaign against a Kurdish-led militia.
Russia has long been accused of carrying out systematic attacks against hospitals and clinics in rebel-held areas as part of a strategy to help Mr. Assad secure victory in the eight-year-old war.
Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that tracks attacks on medical workers in Syria, has documented at least 583 such attacks since 2011, 266 of them since Russia intervened in September 2015. At least 916 medical workers have been killed since 2011.
The Times assembled a large body of evidence to analyze the hospital bombings on May 5 and 6.
Social media posts from Syria, interviews with witnesses, and records from charities that supported the four hospitals provided the approximate time of each strike. The Times obtained logs kept by flight spotters on the ground who warn civilians about incoming airstrikes and crosschecked the time of each strike to confirm that Russian warplanes were overhead. We then listened to and deciphered thousands of Russian Air Force radio transmissions, which recorded months' worth of pilot activities in the skies above northwestern Syria. The recordings were provided to The Times by a network of observers who insisted on anonymity for their safety.
The spotter logs from May 5 and 6 put Russian pilots above each hospital at the time they were struck, and the Air Force audio recordings from that day feature Russian pilots confirming each bombing. Videos obtained from witnesses and verified by The Times confirmed three of the strikes.
Recklessly or intentionally bombing hospitals is a war crime, but proving culpability amid a complex civil war is extremely difficult, and until now, Syrian medical workers and human rights groups lacked proof.
Russia's position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has shielded it from scrutiny and made United Nations agencies reluctant to accuse the Russian Air Force of responsibility.
"The attacks on health in Syria, as well as the indiscriminate bombing of civilian facilities, are definitely war crimes, and they should be prosecuted at the level of the International Criminal Court in The Hague," said Susannah Sirkin, director of policy at Physicians for Human Rights. But Russia and China "shamefully" vetoed a Security Council resolution that would have referred those and other crimes in Syria to the court, she said.
The Russian government did not directly respond to questions about the four hospital bombings. Instead, a Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed to past statements saying that the Russian Air Force carries out precision strikes only on "accurately researched targets."
The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, opened an investigation into the hospital bombings in August. The investigation, still going on, is meant in part to determine why hospitals that voluntarily added their locations to a United Nations-sponsored deconfliction list, which was provided to Russia and other combatants to prevent them from being attacked, nevertheless came under attack.
Syrian health care workers said they believed that the United Nations list actually became a target menu for the Russian and Syrian air forces.
Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the secretary general, said in September that the investigation -- an internal board of inquiry -- would not produce a public report or identify "legal responsibility." Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian permanent representative to the United Nations, cast doubt on the process shortly after it was announced, saying he hoped the inquiry would not investigate perpetrators but rather what he said was the United Nations' use of false information in its deconfliction process.
From April 29 to mid-September, as Russian and Syrian government forces assaulted the last rebel pocket in the northwest, 54 hospitals and clinics in opposition territory were attacked, the United Nations human rights office said. At least seven had tried to protect themselves by adding their location to the deconfliction list, according to the World Health Organization.
On May 5 and 6, Russia attacked four. All were on the list.
The first was Nabad al Hayat Surgical Hospital, a major underground trauma center in southern Idlib Province serving about 200,000 people. The hospital performed on average around 500 operations and saw more than 5,000 patients a month, according to Syria Relief and Development, the United States-based charity that supported it.
Nabad al Hayat had been attacked three times since it opened in 2013 and had recently relocated to an underground complex on agricultural land, hoping to be protected from airstrikes.
At 2:32 p.m. on May 5, a Russian ground control officer can be heard in an Air Force transmission providing a pilot with a longitude and latitude that correspond to Nabad al Hayat's exact location.
At 2:38 p.m., the pilot reports that he can see the target and has the "correction," code for locking the target on a screen in his cockpit. Ground control responds with the green light for the strike, saying, "Three sevens."
At the same moment, a flight spotter on the ground logs a Russian jet circling in the area.
At 2:40 p.m., the same time the charity said that Nabad al Hayat was struck, the pilot confirms the release of his weapons, saying, "Worked it." Seconds later, local journalists filming the hospital in anticipation of an attack record three precision bombs penetrating the roof of the hospital and blowing it out from the inside in geysers of dirt and concrete.
The staff of Nabad al Hayat had evacuated three days earlier after receiving warnings and anticipating a bombing, but Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital, three miles northwest, was not as lucky.
A doctor who worked there said that the hospital was struck four times, beginning at 5:30 p.m. The strikes landed about five minutes apart, without warning, he said, killing a man who was standing outside and forcing patients and members of the medical staff to use oxygen tanks to breathe through the choking dust.
A spotter logged a Russian jet circling above at the time of the strike, and in another Russian Air Force transmission, a pilot reports that he has "worked" his target at 5:30 p.m., the time of the strike. He then reports three more strikes, each about five minutes apart, matching the doctor's chronology.
Russian pilots bombed two other hospitals in the same 12-hour span: Kafr Zita Cave Hospital and Al Amal Orthopedic Hospital. In both cases, spotters recorded Russian Air Force jets in the skies at the time of the strike, and Russian pilots can be heard in radio transmissions "working" their targets at the times the strikes were reported.
Since May 5, at least two dozen hospitals and clinics in the rebel-held northwest have been hit by airstrikes. Syrian medical workers said they expected hospital bombings to continue, given the inability of the United Nations and other countries to find a way to hold Russia to account.
"The argument by the Russians or the regime is always that hospitals are run by terrorists," said Nabad al Hayat's head nurse, who asked to remain anonymous because he feared being targeted. "Is it really possible that all the people are terrorists?"
"The truth is that after hospitals are hit, and in areas like this where there is just one hospital, our houses have become hospitals."

INTRO TEXT, PAGE 2.
These voters -- representative of all Americans who are registered to vote -- were invited to spend a weekend in late September at a resort outside Dallas to show that there might be a better way to disagree. And, as furor in Washington was just beginning to build over the possible impeachment of the president, Donald Trump's name barely came up. The New York Times took a portrait of nearly every participant. Collectively, their faces are a reflection of all American voters.
---
--ARTICLE--
GRAPEVINE, Texas -- The voters arrived from all over the country: nine of them named John, 10 who'd come from mobile homes, four who lived in South Dakota. Twenty-seven considered themselves extremely conservative; 30 said they were extremely liberal. Twenty-one were out of work and looking for it. Two came with service dogs. At least one did not tell her parents she was coming here, because talking politics is so hard at home that she didn't want to admit she was flying to Texas to talk politics with people she didn't know.
There were 526 of them, testing a theory by the Stanford political scientists James Fishkin and Larry Diamond. Put a diverse group of voters in a room, the researchers say, and they're like to mute their harshest views and wrestle more deeply with rebuttals. They become more informed, even more empathetic. And in this setting, pollsters can get a picture of what people believe when they're not just relying on sound bites and tribal cues.
Each voter here was selected from a nationwide survey of thousands of households to resemble the country's demographic diversity and political differences. "America in One Room," the event was called. In the conversations that followed, it was often hard to tell which ideological camp to place voters in.
A nonpartisan group named Helena raised about $ 3 million to bring everyone here to a hotel and convention center with cowboy-themed carpets and an indoor river walk. The research institution NORC at the University of Chicago conducted surveys of the group and worked to find the right representation of voters, calling some of them two, three, four times to coax them onto planes or away from home.
Many of the voters were sure at first that the invitation was a scam -- an all-expenses-paid trip to a Texas resort to ... give their opinions?
Over four days, mostly in small groups, they debated policy proposals in a 55-page briefing booklet that made little mention of whom the proposals came from. Partisan trigger words -- Democrats, Republicans, progressives, conservatives -- were, by design, largely missing from the text. The language voters themselves used was often personal rather than political.
"You have to learn to listen to them," Mr. Fishkin said. "They don't talk the way policy wonks talk about an issue. They bring their life experience, their observations. But they're making arguments when they tell a story."
In one room, the debate among a dozen voters about the Affordable Care Act moved from one personal testimonial to another: One man's deductible rose to $ 3,000 from $ 500 after the law took effect. Another man's family premium had gone up to $ 2,600 a month. Across the table, one woman said her father had been found to have colon cancer right after the law forced him to acquire insurance for the first time in his life. "I can tell you from personal experience, it saved one life," she said.
In a different room, a middle-aged man sure that steep tariffs on China were necessary encountered a young woman who believed the tariffs were hurting her family's South Carolina farm. In another room, voters argued about whether Americans would willingly take the jobs that many immigrants do, as a hotel worker whose employee badge identified him as from Mumbai came in to retrieve the coffee cart.
In another immigration discussion, a 53-year-old mother from Chicago wanted to share a story she'd seen on Facebook of immigrants transported to the United States inside of mattresses. She recalled seeing a mattress cut open -- the living bodies inside, the tufts of cotton covering them.
"There has to be a better way," she said. "I can see myself being transported in a mattress."
Asked if these conversations had moved them, many voters said their preferred policies had not shifted, but their views of each other had.
"I may not have changed my position," said Bonnie Sumner, 74, from Woodland Park, Colo. "But I've changed my understanding of the woman in the group who said, 'You know what, I had great health care, it worked for me, and the Affordable Care Act changed things, and I'm worse off now."'
In the final survey data, however, it appears that some minds were changed. NORC surveyed the group before the conference, and again on the same questions at the end. Voters on both the left and the right appeared to edge toward the center. Democratic support receded for a $ 15 federal minimum wage and for "Medicare for all"; Republican support grew for rejoining the Paris climate agreement and for protecting from deportation immigrants brought to the United States as children.
These answers, Mr. Fishkin said, better approximate public opinion in a society where voters are informed. And from inside this carefully constructed model of democracy in Texas, the share of participants who said they thought American democracy worked well doubled, to 60 percent.
In principle, there is something hopeful in these findings. But an essential part of what happened here will be harder to replicate than the structured discussions. During meals and at the bar at night, there were unlikely pairings of people everywhere, just talking, with no moderators.
James Mowrey, a 33-year-old microbiologist from Nebraska, walked away from dinner on the last night to say that the people around him had, in the end, changed his thinking about something. He considered himself a free-market guy. But he now believed a public option could foster more competition in the health care market.
"They explained it to me in the way I think," he said. And he seemed pleased to have changed his mind.

Heirs of omission: Who’s in, and not in, a will

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

The case for identifying the whistleblower

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 12 Oct 2019.

Texto completo: The identity of the person who filed the intelligence community whistleblower complaint that sparked the drive to impeach President Trump remains a secret. Democrats leading the impeachment campaign say his or her identity (for brevity, the whistleblower will hereafter be referred to as "he") must remain closely guarded. Advocates of whistleblower laws, such as Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, agree.
The New York Times came under heavy criticism when it reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer. "Any decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistleblower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm's way," Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower's lawyer, told the Times. "The whistleblower has a right to anonymity."
Does he? And does that right outweigh the rights of the public to know salient facts in a proceeding designed to lead to the impeachment and removal of the president?
The answer to the first question is yes, the whistleblower does have a right to anonymity. But the answer to the second question is no, that right does not outweigh other rights in an impeachment battle. Here are three reasons the whistleblower should be publicly identified:
1. The public has a right to know. There is no higher public concern than a debate that could lead to the president's removal. Simply put, everything should be public, because the public should be aware of everything that figures into the process. The whistle has not been blown on a mid-level bureaucrat using a government credit card for personal expenses. The whistleblower has accused the president of serious wrongdoing, and in doing so, has set off a proceeding of the highest public concern on Capitol Hill.
What were the circumstances of that accusation? Who gave the whistleblower the information he included in his complaint? Was that information cherry-picked? Did the whistleblower have contacts with others in the effort to bring the complaint against the president? Those are all valid questions for the public to ask and to which they deserve answers. The president is their president, not simply of a small number of privileged people at the Capitol.
Did the whistleblower act out of bias? If he did, does that matter? Explaining his reason for publishing the fact that the whistleblower is a CIA officer, the Times' executive editor Dean Baquet implied the paper wanted to defend the whistleblower against criticism. The Times reported that the whistleblower "works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House," Baquet said, "because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible." Baquet was right; it is important for journalists to give readers and viewers information about the president's accuser.
Finally, the president says he should have the right to confront his accuser. There is no such right written into the Constitution concerning impeachment. But in commonsense terms, Trump is correct. In a matter of such grave importance, a president should not have to face anonymously sourced charges.
2. The whistleblower set the terms of the debate. In his Aug. 12 complaint, he laid out the accusation that Democrats would later wholly adopt in the effort to remove the president. "I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election," the whistleblower wrote. "Namely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the President's 2020 reelection bid."
The whistleblower included other information in his complaint, much of it alleged Trump actions involving the 2016 election, but the fact is, the whistleblower defined the controversy that would ensue as House Democrats followed his lead. There has been no more important player in shaping the case against the president. And that person is supposed to remain anonymous as the battle rages? The argument more or less refutes itself.
3. He's not Deep Throat. The most famous anonymous source in all of journalism is Deep Throat, the man who gave Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein a number of leads in the paper's Watergate reporting. Woodward and Bernstein agreed not to reveal Deep Throat's identity, an arrangement that lasted for decades until 2005, when Mark Felt, who was a top FBI official during Watergate, revealed that he was the source.
The whistleblower is not a similar case. He has gone through official channels to accuse the president, working with a team of attorneys to produce a polished legal document outlining Trump's alleged wrongdoing. Journalists have not made any agreement to keep his identity a secret.
In addition, the whistleblower does not have absolute protection under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, which Democrats have cited to say the whistleblower's identity should remain secret. "The whistleblower has the right in the statute to remain anonymous," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment effort, said recently.
In fact, the law says: "The Inspector General shall not disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the Inspector General determines that such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation ..." First, that part of the statute applies only to the inspector general; he is the only official specifically prohibited from identifying the whistleblower. And second, even that prohibition has a condition attached to it, that the inspector general can identify the whistleblower if it is unavoidable in the course of the investigation. Even if "course of the investigation" refers only to the inspector general's inquiry, the fact is, that investigation has now morphed into a House impeachment proceeding in which the chances of the whistleblower remaining forever anonymous are thin.
The Times made the case, correctly, that personal details about the whistleblower were a key part of judging the credibility of his complaint. We already know, if the Times is correct, that he is a career CIA officer with deep expertise in Ukraine and Central European affairs. But the public is entitled to know all the facts about the whistleblower and not just the facts as characterized by journalists, or certain facts judged relevant by journalists while others are kept hidden. Credibility goes both ways. Party affiliation, past political activities, job performance, and any connections to investigators are all things that merit proper public scrutiny.
Some will argue that the whistleblower cannot be identified because exposure would bring threats to his safety. It is true that people of great notoriety sometimes face threats. But it is also true that the whistleblower's name is already out there; if threats are coming, they are coming whether or not a news organization reports his identity. If much of Washington already knows who he is, which it does, then anonymity ceases to be about protecting the whistleblower and becomes instead a shield that protects him from scrutiny in an effort to topple the president.
In the big picture, it is the public's right to know that should prevail. It's time for the whistleblower to be identified.

We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

Texto completo: When will I finally decide "enough" and cancel my newspaper subscriptions?
Will it be one more snarky headline about Devin Nunes?
Or perhaps another disgusting editorial drawing of President Trump backed up by law enforcement officers depicted as jackbooted thugs carrying clubs?
Or another New York Times accusation against Justice Kavanaugh?
Or will it be another hysterical fact-free column endorsing gun confiscation?
The attacks on President Trump and Congressman Nunes have now escalated to insulting the intelligence those of us who support them.
Hillary Clinton called us "deplorables."
President Barack Obama mocked us for "clinging to our guns and religion."
Former Fresno State adjunct history instructor Lars Maischak Tweeted: "Justice meant that two Republicans should be executed every time an immigrant is deported."
Hillary Clinton is still complaining that she won the 2016 popular election by 2.9 million votes.
But just five California counties — Los Angeles (Hollywood), Alameda (Oakland), Santa Clara (Silicon Valley), San Francisco and San Diego — produced a three million vote margin for her.
Excluding California, Mr. Trump beat Clinton by 1.4 million votes in the rest of America.
Some Central Valley newspapers seem to assume conservatives have already canceled their subscriptions so they are free to publish biased news and opinion pieces that only appeal to the political left.
A 2016 Gallup Poll already revealed only 20% of Americans have "a great deal or lot of confidence in newspapers."
Pew Research shows nearly half of all newspaper newsroom jobs have already been eliminated since 2008 — from 71,000 employees to just 38,000 in 2018.
How about some real facts about guns? The 2017 FBI Uniform Crime Report shows rifles of all types were determined to be responsible for 403 of the 11,000 firearms homicides nationwide. Handguns killed 7,000. Shotguns and unidentified firearms were used for another 3,500 murders and over 2,700 people were beaten or stabbed to death.
For risk comparison, CDC data shows 24,000 people tragically used a firearm to commit suicide while drunk drivers killed nearly 11,000 and distracted — texting — drivers killed 3,200. Over 70,000 people died from drug overdoses — including opioids.
I respect the good intentions of those who wish to reduce gun homicides — but they will save far more lives by focusing on controlling inner-city violence than they will by restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens.
Returning to the need for a neutral press, Thomas Jefferson — the author of our 1776 Declaration of Independence — made it clear that he expected newspapers to act as vigilant watchdogs over government if our new Republic was to survive.
The 63 million Trump voters and 117,000 Nunes voters deserve a semi-neutral press —or there will be no further need for a press at all — at least in our home.

JOE BIDEN IS A HYPOCRITE ON UKRAINE

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden has said that in holding up vital military assistance to Ukraine, President Donald Trump "used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation, a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia ... to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor."
That's rich. The aid in question is lethal military assistance that the Obama-Biden administration refused to give Ukraine.
In 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea and began arming separatists in eastern Ukraine with tanks, armored vehicles and rocket launchers, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko came to Washington to plead for weapons to defend his country. In an impassioned address to a joint session of Congress - with Mr. Biden sitting directly behind him - Mr. Poroshenko said his country appreciated the nonlethal assistance he was getting, but declared "one cannot win a war with blankets."
The Obama-Biden administration was unmoved. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that "President Barack Obama stuck to his refusal to provide weapons or other lethal military gear to Ukraine, despite a passionate appeal Thursday for help in fighting pro-Russian rebels by Ukraine's president." Why? The administration feared that lethal aid would provoke Moscow.
So what did the administration give him? Instead of RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades), we provided MREs (meals ready to eat) - food rations. As one frustrated former Pentagon official put it at the time, "What kind of message does that send anyway? We are sending MREs while they are being invaded by an aggressor."
Answer: a message of weakness.
When Mr. Trump took office, he delivered a message of strength. In December 2017, the new administration announced that the United States would send the lethal aid to Ukraine that Mr. Poroshenko requested and Messrs. Obama and Biden refused - the sale of $47 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles. In May 2018, after Ukraine tested its new Javelin missiles, Mr. Poroshenko exulted on Twitter, "Finally this day has come!" and personally thanked Mr. Trump "for supporting Ukraine and adopting a decision to provide Javelin anti-tank missile systems."
For Mr. Biden to now attack Mr. Trump for a temporary delay in a new round of lethal military aid reeks of hypocrisy. It was on Mr. Biden's watch that the United States refused to deliver military aid at all.
And because Mr. Biden raised the Russian threat, let's recall that the Obama-Biden administration bears much responsibility for the annexation of Crimea that necessitated the delivery of lethal aid to Ukraine in the first place. Russia's military intervention in Ukraine came in the aftermath of the Obama-Biden administration's failure to enforce its red line against Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons by Syria.
Assad used chemical weapons on innocent civilians not once, but 16 times. And yet Messrs. Obama and Biden did nothing, failing to carry out even "unbelievably small" military strikes - a decision Mr. Biden publicly defended. "We can easily say we should have bombed and gone in and taken out their air defense system," Mr. Biden said. "Well, you know, big nations can't bluff."
Bluff is what Messrs. Obama and Biden did - and Assad called their bluff. Not only that, they turned to Russia for a face-saving way out, letting Russian President Vladimir Putin broker a phony deal to have Syria disarm. So it should come as no surprise that, when Mr. Obama threatened to impose costs on Mr. Putin if he invaded Ukraine, the Kremlin called his bluff, too. Mr. Putin knew Messrs. Obama and Biden did not have the will to stand up to him in Ukraine. And he was proved right when they refused to give Ukraine lethal aid for fear of further provoking him.
None of this excuses Mr. Trump's delaying a new round of lethal military aid to Ukraine. But if this military assistance was as vital to countering the Russian threat as Mr. Biden says, then it's fair to ask: Why didn't the United States provide it when Mr. Biden was the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine?

Tech startups starting to get off the fast track

Texto completo: Headnote Silicon Valley shifts focus to profit, not growth
SAN FRANCISCO - Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, recently published a blog post titled "The Great Public Market Reckoning." In it, he argued that the narrative that had driven startup hype and valuations for the past decade was now falling apart.
His post quickly ricocheted across Silicon Valley. Other venture capitalists, including Bill Gurley of Benchmark and Brad Feld of Foundry Group, soon weighed in with their own warnings about fiscal responsibility.
At some startups, entrepreneurs began behaving more cautiously. Travis Vander-Zanden, chief executive of the scooter startup Bird, declared at a tech conference in San Francisco last week that his company was now focused on profit and not growth. "The challenge is to try to stay disciplined," he said.
The moves all point to a new gospel that is starting to spread in startup land.
For the last decade, young tech companies were fueled by a wave of venture capital-funded excess, which encouraged fast growth above all else. But now some investors and startups are beginning to rethink that mantra and instead invoke turning a profit and generating "positive unit economics" as their new priorities.
The change is being driven by the stumbles of some high-profile "unicorns" - startups that were valued at $1 billion and above in the private markets - just as they reached the stock market.
The most visible of those was the office rental startup WeWork, which dramatically ousted its chief executive and withdrew its initial public offering last month.
At the same time, shares of Peloton, a fitness startup, and SmileDirectClub, an online orthodontics company, immediately cratered after the companies went public. And Uber, Lyft and Slack - which also listed their stocks this year - have similarly dealt with falling stock prices for months.
The lackluster performances have raised questions about Silicon Valley's startup formula of spending lots of money to grow at the expense of profits. (All of those companies lose money.) Public market investors, it seemed, just weren't having it.
"A lot of these highly valued companies have run into the buzz saw of Wall Street, where they're questioning or reminding us that profitability matters," said Patricia Nakache, a partner at Trinity Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.
She added that she anticipated a "ripple effect" on private startup valuations that would start with the largest, most valuable companies and trickle down to the smaller, younger ones.
For startups and investors that were used to heady times and big spending, that means it may be time for a reset.
Aileen Lee, an investor at Cowboy Ventures, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, California, said she considered dusting off a four-year-old "winter is coming" email she had sent to startups in 2015, telling them to prepare for a downturn. She hasn't revived the warning yet, she said, because "I worry about becoming the boy who cried wolf."
Other venture capitalists are being more forward. At Eniac Ventures, a venture firm in New York and San Francisco, the partners recently combed through their companies and identified the "gross margins" - a measure of profitability - for each one, said Nihal Mehta, general partner of the firm. This was not something the firm regularly looked at, he said, but they were inspired by Wilson's cautionary blog post.
They ultimately decided that in future meetings with entrepreneurs, they would push for more detailed financial models, even though the companies are very young, Mehta said. - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Headnote AN ETHIOPIAN CULTURAL TREASURE
AMSTERDAM - In 1998, Sirak Asfaw, a Dutch civil servant who was born in Ethiopia, noticed something shiny in the suitcase of a guest who was staying at his house. Curious, he opened the case to find a glittering gilded crown inside.
"I couldn't believe my eyes," Sirak, who moved to the Netherlands a political refugee in the 1970s, said in a recent interview in Amsterdam. "I felt betrayed. Using my house to smuggle cultural heritage from Ethiopia? I knew it had something to do with Ethiopian history, the Ethiopian kingdom. I knew this is not good."
Sirak said that he felt he couldn't return the crown to the Ethiopian authorities, because he suspected that the government might have been complicit in the theft, and he feared that it would be stolen again.
He also didn't want to hand it over to the Dutch authorities, because he worried that a museum would keep the crown forever rather than returning it when a new Ethiopian government was in place.
So Sirak locked the visitor out of his house, he said, and removed the crown from the suitcase. He did not identify the smuggler to The New York Times for fear of his safety, and said he didn't know how his guest had acquired it.
For 21 years, he hid it in his home. "When I saw it, I always felt very emotional," he said. "I knew it shouldn't be here, not in my house, not in the Netherlands."
Last year, after Ethiopia installed a new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, Sirak decided that it was time to try to return the crown, confident that the new government would handle the return properly, he said.
He contacted an independent Dutch art crimes investigator, Arthur Brand, who placed the crown in a high-security art facility in the Netherlands and alerted the Dutch police.
Toon van Wijk, a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an email exchange with The Times that officials were investigating. "Authenticity must be determined in cooperation with the Ethiopian authorities," he said. "Once the investigation has been completed, we must look at the next steps."
The Ethiopian ambassador to the Netherlands, Abay Weldu Hagos, said in a telephone interview that discussions were underway with Ethiopia's Ministry of Tourism and Culture to return the work either to the church from which it was stolen or to a museum in Ethiopia.
"It's up to Ethiopian stakeholders to decide where it should go," he said.
Jacopo Gnisci, a research associate at Oxford University who specializes in Ethiopian artifacts, examined the crown in Amsterdam a few weeks ago and said he thought it was authentic.
He believes it was probably a liturgical crown used in Orthodox Christian ceremonies. Gnisci also tracked down a photograph in which a priest is wearing the crown in 1993, a few years before it disappeared.
The crown was probably stolen in the 1990s from a church in the village of Cheleqot, 75 miles from the border with Eritrea, Gnisci said.
The researcher said it was a rare object, one of only about 20 such liturgical crowns in existence.
"If I had to put a price tag on it, I'd say 40,000 to 50,000 euros" - about $44,000 to $55,000 - Gnisci said in a telephone interview. That figure, he said, "is at the highest possible end of the market for Ethiopian artifacts, just under the price you'd fetch for an illuminated manuscript."
The object has surfaced at a time of increased international debate about the return of African art and artifacts to their places of origin.
Sirak said he would like for the crown to be given to the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.
"That's the safest place for it, but I trust that the Ethiopian government will take care of it," he said. "Now it is in safe hands, and I'm a bit relieved."

O’Rourke to stage Trump counter rally

Texto completo: Beto O’Rourke is seeking to turn President Donald Trump’s rally next week at the American Airlines Center in Dallas into a duel for the heart of Texas between himself and the president he hopes to unseat.
The former three-term Democratic congressman from El Paso, who is seeking his party’s nomination for president, will hold a “Rally Against Fear” Thursday evening in Grand Prairie, 13 miles west of Dallas. The Trump rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. Doors open for the O’Rourke rally at 6 p.m.
“We will not be defined by this president’s fear, his hate, or the differences between us that he tries to exploit, but instead by a renewed sense of hope and a unified vision for the future of our country,” O’Rourke said in a statement released by his campaign Wednesday evening, announcing the rally. “In this moment of smallness, paranoia and division, Texas is going to lead the way with our strength, our courage, our diversity and the big, bold, ambitious things we want to achieve together.”
In February, when Trump held a rally in El Paso, O’Rourke was featured at a counter rally. Trump held the rally in the border city to stress the importance of completing a wall along the border with Mexico, an ambition O’Rourke opposes as unnecessary and counter-productive.
The Theatre at Grand Prairie, where the O’Rourke event will take place, has a seating capacity of 6,350 and the American Airlines Center can hold 20,000 people.
The dueling rallies will come on the heels of the fourth Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night outside of Columbus, Ohio. O’Rourke will be one of a dozen candidates sharing the stage for the debate, co-hosted by CNN and The New York Times.
But O’Rourke’s claim to a place in the fifth debate, in Georgia in November, is tenuous. He is at 1.6% in the RealClearPolitics polling average nationally and 1.7% in Iowa, his best performance in the four early nominating states.
Under Democratic National Committee rules, to participate in the November debate a candidate needs to reach 3% in four authorized national or early state polls, or 5% in two early state polls. O’Rourke is among four candidates who will be part of Tuesday’s debate who have not yet met that threshold. The other three are former San Antonio Mayor and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.

Texto completo: Android software creator Andy Rubin has left Playground Global, the venture-capital firm he co-founded, a person familiar with the matter said.
Playground bought back Mr. Rubin's stake in May when he departed, and Mr. Rubin no longer has an active role at the firm, the person said. The news of Mr. Rubin's departure from Playground was earlier reported by BuzzFeed.
Mr. Rubin couldn't be reached for comment about leaving Playground.
Playground is an early-stage investment firm that has raised $800 million across two funds.
Mr. Rubin came under public scrutiny for the $90 million exit package he got from Google parent Alphabet Inc. It followed sexual harassment claims from a former subordinate. Mr. Rubin denied the misconduct through his attorney . He departed Alphabet in 2014, but the settlement wasn't revealed until it was reported by the New York Times last year. The payment was publicly disclosed in a shareholder lawsuit earlier this year.
Mr. Rubin leads Essential Products Inc., a smartphone company he started. The company unveiled its new phone design this week. Playground remains an investor in Essential, the person said.
Mr. Rubin launched Playground in 2015 after his departure from Google. Playground raised its most recent $500 million venture fund in 2017. It raised a $300 million fund in 2015.
Playground's portfolio companies have included Wi-Fi business Eero , diabetes-treatment provider Virta Health Corp. and drone business Skydio Inc.

The Souls of Brown, White And Black Folk

Texto completo: It's not our brains and it's not our bodies.
Around New Year's 2017, a community organizer named Chris Lambert leased a soon-to-be-empty school building for $ 1 in one of Detroit's poorer African-American neighborhoods. The plan was to pour $ 5 million into remodeling the building, take on the $ 1-million-a-year operating expenses and turn the place into a vibrant hub for the surrounding community, with nonprofits, culinary training programs, after-school programs and artists.
Lambert did not communicate this well to the people who actually lived in the community.
When neighbors learned Lambert had acquired the building for a dollar, many wondered why a white outsider, not somebody from within the community, had gotten such a deal. They assumed that he was the cutting edge of gentrification, that he was going to pour money in and push the current folks out. This kind of outsider exploitation is the lived history for many Detroiters.
That month, Lambert hosted some community meetings to mollify fears. They did not go well. People called him a colonizer. They called his black colleagues Oreos. "This white guy is going to subject us to more slavery," somebody declared.
Lambert wanted to argue back. But his black partner, Dwan Dandridge, advised him to just listen. It's a hazing process, Dandridge told Lambert. You feel voiceless tonight. These people have felt voiceless their whole lives. Just listen.
This fullest account of the episode can be found in Bittersweet Monthly in an article written by Anne Snyder, my wife. I visited Lambert and Dandridge in Detroit a few weeks ago, a year and a half after the grand opening.
The building, now called the Durfee Innovation Society, has children teeming the halls, a pizzeria, training programs, yoga classes. Lambert is humbled by the mistakes he made, but his center is fantastic. Some of his angriest critics have now taken part in neighborhood festivities held in the building. There is still distrust, suspicion, rage at injustice coursing through the neighborhood. But there is also life together, happening every day.
I see these messy clash-ups across the country, wherever people are trying to do racial reconciliation. You realize that coming together across race is not a neat two-step process: truth and reconciliation. It's an emotionally complex, thousand-step process, with moments of miscommunication, resentment and embrace. This is the hard process of trying to see each other across centuries of wrong.
The somewhat comforting truth is that it's always been like this. When you read David Blight's brilliant biography of Frederick Douglass, for example, you see that Douglass passed through exactly these many moods in dealing with his countrymen of another race -- moments of fury and harmony, despair and hope.
Sometimes he was disgusted with America. "I have no love for America, as such," he once said. Other times he was enraptured: "I am an American citizen. In birth, in sentiment, in ideas, in hopes, in aspirations and responsibilities."
Douglass's genius was his ability to balance his indignation at oppression with his underlying faith in the American project. In his speeches he would praise his white audiences in one movement and thunder condemnation in the next. In an 1876 speech about Abraham Lincoln, he both condemned and complimented the man who inspired and infuriated him: "Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull and indifferent; but measuring him from the sentiment of his country ... he was swift, zealous, radical and determined."
Douglass could withstand all the ups and downs, all the ambivalences, because of an unchanging underlying belief: in the natural rights of all humankind.
He constantly returned to the core belief of America's founding in 1776, that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. Slavery and racism were not just wrong -- they betrayed the divine natural order of the universe. Douglass had an underlying faith in the providence. Justice would eventually triumph. The "laws which govern the moral universe," he said, would make it so.
And here we get to the nub of what sustained Douglass and what sustains people today as they do this work. It is the belief that all humans have souls. It is the belief that all people of all races have a piece of themselves that has no size, weight, color or shape, but which gives them infinite value and dignity.
It is the belief that our souls make us all radically equal. Our brains and bodies are not equal, but our souls are. It is the belief that the person who is infuriating you most right now still has a soul and so is still, deep down, beautiful and redeemable. It is the belief that when all is said and done all souls have a common home together, a final resting place as pieces of a larger unity.
When people hold fast to their awareness of souls, then they have a fixed center among the messiness of racial reconciliation and they give each other grace. If they lose the concept of the soul, they've lost everything.

Rhiannon Giddens' New Album Traces African, Arabic Roots

Texto completo: When MacArthur "Genius" Grant recipient and Nashville star Rhiannon Giddens picks up her banjo to play, she is not just preparing to make beautiful music. She is simultaneously teaching people about the African origins of the quintessentially American instrument, bringing back songs that have long been sidelined and defending minstrelsy.
Yes, this proudly African American woman from North Carolina, who was a co-founder of the Grammy-winning Carolina Chocolate Drops, avidly defends the music that fueled minstrel shows, which were usually performed by whites donning blackface.
Giddens sings and plays minstrel banjo, octave violin, and viola. Her latest album, "There Is No Other" with Italian multi-instrumentalist Francesco Turrisi, on which he plays piano, accordion, frame drum, tamburello, lute, cello banjo, daf and colascione, reflects the common origins of global music, whether American, Irish or Italian.
The recording, which they also released on vinyl, was produced by Joe Henry and recorded and tracked during "an intensely productive five-day period in Dublin, Ireland. It primarily features only Giddens and Turrisi playing one or two instruments together."
The resulting recording "is at once a condemnation of 'othering' and a celebration of the spread of ideas, connectivity, and shared experience. The array of instruments reveals the sonic ties that bind between African, Arabic, European and American cultures."
The album is an alluring and emotive mix of original songs penned by Giddens, such as the haunting introductory tune "Ten Thousand Voices" and her personal spiritual, "He Will See You Through," and a soulful set of diverse interpretations from Ola Belle Reed's "I'm Gonna Write Me a Letter" and Oscar Brown Jr.'s "Brown Baby" to the Italian traditional Tarantella tune "Pizzica di San Vito."
On the album, the musicians trace the "overlooked movement of sounds from Africa and the Arabic world and their influence on European and American music, and illuminates the universality of music and the commonality of the human experience."
Giddens recently told the Irish Times: "It's all about movement, for both of us ... movements of human beings and how we affect each other. If you just look at our range of instruments, where they've come from and how they've traveled across the world, it's pretty amazing. The way that both of us approach music is very similar because we're both educated about where the music is coming from. But when it comes to playing, we're both just playing what we feel."
Her latest venture, which included a stop at the Kennedy Center on her tour, falls within Giddens' mission as an artist known to excavate music from the past to "reveal bold and candid truths about our present."
She has performed for the Obamas at the White House and acted in two seasons of the hit television series Nashville, in addition to being profiled by "CBS Sunday Morning," the New York Times and NPR's "Fresh Air," among others.
Her acclaimed solo albums, "Tomorrow is My Turn" (along with the EP "Factory Girl," produced by T Bone Burnett) and "Freedom Highway," received three Grammy Award nominations. Her legendary work with the Carolina Chocolate Drops received a Grammy in 2010.
Giddens is also featured in Ken Burns' "Country Music" series on PBS this fall and will perform at concerts tied to the series in Nashville and New York City.
Another collaborative project, "Songs of Our Native Daughters," features Giddens and tells the stories of historic Black womanhood and survival.

Texto completo: Joe Biden's media tough talk is drawing parallels to another presidential candidate: the man he's running to replace, President Trump.
Biden reamed out Trump in New Hampshire this week for running an administration defined by an abuse of power. But Biden's campaign followed his appearance in the early-voting state by sending a letter to New York Times editor Dean Baquet.
In the note, Biden's team accused the New York Times of distorting reality through its coverage of claims the former vice president abused his own position as Barack Obama's No. 2 to protect his son Hunter Biden's business interests in Ukraine. Joe Biden's dealings with Ukraine are under scrutiny as part of Trump's impeachment inquiry into whether the sitting president encouraged foreign governments to dig up political dirt on the White House hopeful.
Biden's confrontational posture, while falling short of Trump's "enemy of the people" attacks on a free press, still echoes the antagonistic rhetoric Trump deployed toward members of the media during the 2016 cycle, and continues to do so in the White House.
It's also a fairly unusual tactic for a Democratic presidential politician, who Republicans have said for years receive more favorable treatment from a sympathetic press corp.
Republican strategist Brad Todd ripped that approach, advising Biden to develop thicker skin.
"Biden spent eight years in the warm media cocoon of the Obama administration, and he doesn't know how to handle the slightest bit of pressure from a millennial-dominated press entourage that is attitudinally on a far different wavelength from him and unwilling to hide it," Todd said.
In the Wednesday letter, Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield blasted a New York Times story from May as having "an outsized hand in the spread" of the "baseless conspiracy theory" that Biden acted inappropriately in Ukraine to shield his son from an investigation. Hunter Biden had a $50,000-a-month gig in Ukraine, sitting on the board of an oligarch-connected natural gas company.
Trump allies, such as Rudy Giuliani, assert Joe Biden may have created a potential conflict of interest by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees while he was part of the Obama administration unless Ukraine fired its top prosecutor, who had probed the younger Biden's company, Burisma Holdings. There's no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.
The letter additionally reacted to a New York Times opinion piece by author Peter Schweizer. He elevated debunked ties between Hillary Clinton and the Russia-Uranium One controversy and argued that although Hunter Biden's role with Burisma Holdings wasn't illegal, it should've been.
"Are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?" Bedingfield asked the New York Times.
The Biden camp also wrote to Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday urging the social media giants not to run a Trump reelection ad targeting the former vice president.
The reaction from Bidenworld follows a similar letter it sent last month to ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and Fox News imploring the TV networks to quit booking Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, for their shows because he “will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.” Trump enlisted Giuliani in his efforts to obtain damaging information on Biden.
Giuliani told the Washington Examiner in September that Biden attacked him since he and other Democrats couldn't cope with somebody "standing up" to them.
"All they're trying to do is kill the messenger and silence the messenger. But they're not answering the message," he said.
Dale Weiss, a senior vice president at the CommCore Consulting Group public relations firm, downplayed connections between Biden and Trump's media strategies because "this administration did not invent open hostility towards the press." He cited a letter President Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1807 dismissing a newspaper as "a polluted vehicle."
Yet Weiss added tensions between candidates and news outlets are "now amplified in the age of 24/7 information overload."
"It’s like driving with your car radio at full blast and not being able to turn it down. The tremendous volume of what is seen, heard, and written feeds on each other with fewer and fewer filters," he told the Washington Examiner.

'They really hurt the hearts of the Chinese people': China's basketball fans side with country over NBA

Texto completo: Chinese basketball fans said they might no longer support the NBA if the feud between the basketball league and their homeland continues.
"It’s O.K. to chase the star players," Yezi Zhang, a basketball fan at the Thursday exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai, told the New York Times. "But we shouldn’t do it at the cost of the dignity of the motherland." Zhang, 24, said she might stop going to NBA games if the league does not apologize.
The NBA came under the spotlight of the Chinese Communist Party after the Houston Rockets general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong freedom protests. China cut ties with the Rockets and have threatened their business with the NBA. State-run Chinese media said the differences between the two might be irreconcilable.
Despite suspending broadcast of NBA preseason games, the game between the Lakers and the Nets was allowed to continue.
Lin Wenwen, a 21-year-old Lakers fan in China, said the situation between the NBA and his homeland was "a shame." He said he blamed, "The young losers in Hong Kong." Chinese propaganda has caused many in the communist country to believe the Hong Kong freedom protests are an attack on China.
Mao Runkai, a fan of Lebron James, said supporting the freedom protesters was equal to racism. He also said he believed patriotism came above being a fan. "The issue of sovereignty is as serious as the issue of racism," he said.
"Everyone is feeling very patriotic," said Rong Qiang, a 40-year-old fan, adding he was willing to end his fandom of the NBA.
Both Daryl Morey and NBA commissioner Adam Silver apologized to China, but China is still furious about Silver saying he supports Morey's freedom of speech.
The NBA has also drawn heat from U.S. fans after a series of controversial moves including kicking two fans out of a Philadelphia 76ers game in Philadelphia for bringing "Free Hong Kong" posters and shutting down a CNN reporter from asking a question about China at a press conference.

Trump's Reckless Rush to Withdraw; The Syria pullout boosts the impression that he's all impulse, blithely operating out of his depth.

Texto completo: One thing I think I've correctly observed about the U.S. military in the 21st century is that its leaders tend to be the last to want to go to war and the last to want to leave it. Political figures operate under public pressures and shifting geopolitical needs and goals; they're surrounded by people who see the world a certain way; they get revved up, and say, "Go, invade." Top military staff have reservations. They've studied the area, know the realities, the history—they have doctorates in it—and don't want to get into anything America can't win cleanly, decisively, relatively quickly. They're skeptics.
In the end the commander in chief makes the decision and they do their constitutional duty. Troops are deployed and perform. They dig in and fight, they're professionals—they commit.
The political figures then decide after a few years—or decades—that it's time to come home. Military leaders are skeptical again. They've been in this thing a while, they're committed to the battle space, they've lost men, they know and care about their allies in the fight, they have a sharp sense of the repercussions of withdrawal. They want more time.
I suspect the current habit of skepticism springs in part from the military's generations-long reckoning with Vietnam. You can see it in Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster's influential 1997 book, "Dereliction of Duty." "The war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of the New York Times," Donald Trump's second national security adviser writes. "It was lost in Washington, D.C." Responsibility for the failure rested not only with President Lyndon B. Johnson and his civilian advisers but also his military advisers, particularly the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Between the lines Gen. McMaster was telling the current military: Don't claim to see lights at the ends of tunnels when you don't really see them, play it straight. Be forthcoming with political leaders—and the public—about "likely costs and consequences."
Anyway, history is human. Military leaders have their ways and biases. But public military opposition to the president's withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria, after a Sunday telephone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, seems to me completely correct. Gen. John Allen, a retired Marine, said, "If we were going to draw a circle around a group of American troops who are more important right now to the stabilization of any place on the planet, it's that thousand troops." He said of Turkey's incursion into Syria, "This is just chaos." Retired Adm. James Stavridis said it will lead to the comeback of ISIS and embolden other U.S. adversaries. He noted that it's some kind of policy that can unite, in opposition, Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bernie Sanders.
It is.
More compelling is what Jennifer Griffin, the respected national-security correspondent for Fox News, reported Wednesday night. She spoke to a "distraught" U.S. Special Forces soldier on the ground alongside the Kurdish forces that were about to be abandoned. "It was one of the hardest phone calls I have ever taken," she tweeted. The soldier told her "I am ashamed for the first time in my career." He said, "There was no threat to the Turks—none—from this side of the border." The Kurds, who are guarding thousands of ISIS prisoners, had just prevented a prison break and were pleading for U.S. support. Without it, the soldier said, those detainees would likely soon be free. Of the president: "He doesn't understand the problem. He doesn't understand the repercussions to this." "It's a shame," he added. "The Kurds are standing by us. No other partner I have ever dealt with would stand by us."
I believe every word of this.
Why this decision? Why now?
To redeem a campaign pledge with another campaign looming? On impulse? What was behind the impulse? The president doesn't seem to know much about the Kurds—that they've backed the U.S. since 2003 and fought ISIS since 2011. They have their reasons: They want their own state. But they are a gallant people, brave and sympathetic to the West.
The president, defending this decision, asked what we owe them. "They didn't help us in the Second World War, at Normandy for example."
Yes, I forgot. Reagan made that point in his Pointe du Hoc speech. He said, "Don't forget to stick it to the Kurds for not showing up." Oh wait, he didn't say that, because he was quite the reader of history.
Mr. Trump, in defending his position, says he is against the "endless wars" that have marked the first two decades of this century. Fair and good, the right approach, he ran for president opposing them and Americans left and right agreed.
But there is too much craziness to the decision, both its substance and how it was made. The area has been functioning, the number of U.S. troops small and limited. Adm. Stavridis called it "a small investment with a big spring to it."
The decision was done on the word of Mr. Erdogan, a particular kind of player—thuggish, duplicitous. He considers the Kurds on his border a security threat. He threatens to send Syrian refugees to Europe if European countries call his incursion an occupation. If they insult him like that, "We will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way."
Mr. Trump himself says if the ISIS terrorists the Kurds are holding in prison are freed or escape, no worry. "They're going to be escaping to Europe," he said. "They want to go back to their homes."
That's a viciously careless way to treat your allies. Who, by the way, were at Normandy.
Most unsettling was the president's mad tweet assuring critics that his decision was right: "If Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)." This isn't funny, it's self-inflated nut stuff.
The president is misreading his base, which will have qualms. Their sons and daughters fought in the wars; they know who the Kurds are.
Why would he do such a dramatic, piercing thing at what is for him a dramatic, piercing moment, with impeachment looming and support for it rising in the polls? Why offend Republicans senators, whom the president needs to survive impeachment? Why give them an excuse to start peeling off?
Why give those of his supporters who are cable-news hacks an excuse to show some pride? I'm not a lackey, this is about principle, the president has made a misjudgment! Watch it, they could get in the habit of self-respect.
The Syria decision contributes to the hardened impression that in foreign policy he's all impulse, blithely operating out of his depth. It adds to the hardening suspicion that in negotiations he's not actually tough; he'll say yes to a lot of things, and some very bad things, to get the deal, the photo-op, the triumphant handshake.
Foreign-policy decisions in this administration look like the ball in a pinball machine in some garish arcade with flashing lights and some frantic guy pushing the levers ping ping ping and thinking he's winning.

'Scan Artist' Review: Go Ahead, Take Your Time; Evelyn Wood's astonishing speed-reading claims appealed to politicians, corporate executives, college students—and comedians.

Texto completo: In its postwar heyday, Evelyn Wood's Reading Dynamics course was more than just the object of fun it would later become. (Woody Allen on what he gleaned from speed-reading "War and Peace": "It's about Russia.") It was an educational franchise that attracted politicians, corporate executives and generations of college students eager to get through their coursework in time for a kegger. In "Scan Artist," Marcia Biederman argues that the course was a fraud that bilked millions through false claims, pushy sales tactics and rigged assessments of post-instruction speeds. As if condensing her point for rapid reading, she declares: "Evelyn Wood was perhaps the greatest scammer of the twentieth century."
A Utah school teacher and a member of the Church of Latter-Day Saints, Evelyn Wood is an unlikely figure to have outdone such legendary swindlers as Charles Ponzi and George C. Parker (whose signature scam was selling the Brooklyn Bridge). But appearances can deceive: Maybe Wood was like the Brewster sisters in "Arsenic and Old Lace," those sweet little old ladies who outdid the most sinister of criminals.
Wood didn't set out to teach speed reading. Pursuing a master's degree at the University of Utah's speech department after World War II, she visited her adviser upon completing her work. "I turned in my thesis to Dr. Lowell Lees," Wood would recount, "and watched in amazement as he read my eighty-page paper as fast as he could turn the pages; he read, graded, and returned the thesis within a matter of minutes." She believed he actually read it all, and she was thrilled.

Inspired by this feat, Wood dived into the business of teaching people to read rapidly. The core instruction involved using one's finger as a "pacer" that would lead the eyes to view not lines of text but blocks or even whole pages. "The average person reads 150-200 words per minute," lamented an early Reading Dynamics advertisement. Wood promised "1,000 words per minute with greater comprehension." Teenagers on her payroll were presented with books they had supposedly never seen before. After a few minutes of finger zig-zagging, they could answer questions from the crowd about what they had "read." While Ms. Biederman, a New York-based journalist, isn't able to prove that the demonstrations were faked, she persuasively suggests that they were.
Corporations were the first to be enthusiastic about the speed-reading idea, keen to see their managers zip through piles of paperwork. By the 1960s and 1970s, the target market was colleges. A New York Times story from the early 1970s reported that there were Evelyn Wood institutes in "more than 150 cities" in 47 states and seven foreign countries.
From the beginning of the craze it was obvious to more than a few observers that what was gained in speed was lost in comprehension. William Perry Jr. and Charles Whitlock taught social and educational psychology at Harvard and were early critics of the idea of "lightning-like reading rates." A pupil taught speed reading hadn't become a better reader, they scoffed; he had merely been trained "how to get nothing out of such reading in one-tenth the time it previously took him to get nothing out of it."
Eventually Reading Dynamics became a punchline, and not only with Woody Allen. "Saturday Night Live" ran a spoof ad for the Evelyn Woodski Slow Reading Course: "I used to be a heavy speed reader," Jane Curtin says, "and I never laughed when I read Mark Twain. But now that I take my time, I find him very funny. Did you know that reading all the words in a story can help you understand the humor?"
If Evelyn Wood perpetrated a scam, she was not as adept at harvesting its rewards. She grew her business and her brand but sold out early, in the mid-1960s, to an investment group, staying on as a consultant (for $1,000 a month) and retaining the Utah-Idaho franchise. When she died, according to a grandson, the last of the Reading Dynamics money "was spent on the funeral brunch."
Ms. Biederman makes a good case that Wood's claims were preposterous, but she takes such a prosecutorial stance that one begins to feel some sympathy for her subject. She chides the company for an advertisement that showed a picture of the White House with the caption "Reading Dynamics Held Here Under Two Presidents." Not so, objects Ms. Biederman: "In fact, the class for Nixon staffers met at a site now named the Eisenhower Executive Office Building." What a silly gotcha. The mansard-roofed edifice known then as the Old Executive Office Building is on the White House grounds, next to the West Wing, and is where most White House staff work. It is hardly an alternate "site."
More seriously, Ms. Biederman argues that Evelyn Wood and her husband, Douglas, were Nazi sympathizers. Active in his church, Doug was named to run a Mormon mission in Frankfurt, Germany, in the late 1930s, where Evelyn joined him. Ms. Biederman accuses them not just of complicity in the church's policy of accommodating the Third Reich but of actively admiring Hitler. Doug wrote home to his parents that "the people practically worship Hitler"—Ms. Biederman plays down his furtive criticism of the regime, points to his making anti-Semitic remarks and concludes he "was practically a fellow worshiper." As for Evelyn, she "likely" rewrote church lessons to delete "words like 'Israel' and 'Zion.' "
When it comes to her more substantial indictment of Wood's reading boasts, Ms. Biederman might have cited the great scholarly work on the grift, "The Big Con" (1940), by David Maurer. In a classic con job, he explained, the mark is easily fleeced because he thinks he is in on the scam. Thus the maxim: "You can't cheat an honest man." Yes, Wood's enterprise played on the enduring American desire for self-improvement. But it succeeded because it promised learning on the cheap, and customers raced to be duped with unseemly speed.

Texto completo: Auto emissions have risen nationwide in the last three decades, and particularly so in Fairfield County and the greater New Haven.
Auto emissions have gone up 25 percent overall in Fairfield County since 1990. When adjusted for population, that increase drops to 9 percent, according to Boston University’s Database of Road Transportation Emissions.
In New Haven, the increase is more stark. Overall, emissions have risen 41 percent since 1990 — a 32 percent per-person increase.
That pattern holds true across the country, according to a New York Times analysis of the Boston University data. Suburban driving is the primary culprit, and though there are more cars in denser, urban areas, there also tends to be more public transportation.
Auto emissions are, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the largest producers of carbon-monoxide and other greenhouse gasses. Passenger cars and SUVs make up 60 percent of all emissions, with another 23 percent coming from freight trucks, as The New York Times reported.
Americans have been driving a lot more in recent years, according to federal officials, bolstered by a relatively solid economy and low gas prices.
In 2018, Americans drove 3.225 trillion miles, an increase of 12.2 billion miles over 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
“Record-setting vehicle-miles traveled reflects a robust economy, lower gas prices and is another reason to ensure that America’s roads and bridges are well-maintained and modernized to improve safety,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao said.

Texto completo: In response to news reports over the weekend that at least one additional administration whistleblower has come forward to say what he or she knows about President Donald Trump's Ukrainian schemes, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted, "I've seen this movie before - with Brett Kavanaugh. More and more doesn't mean better or reliable."
Mr. Graham's raw political spinning has a fatal flaw.
Mr. Graham wants to tar the whistleblowers as part of a partisan campaign. But their motivation is largely irrelevant now because the bulk of the allegations have already been corroborated by the rough phone call transcript released by the White House and by the statements of the president and his aides.
So while it's still possible that the whistleblowers are part of some elaborate Democratic or "deep state" plot to take down the president, the plotters are using truthful information to do the deed. Mr. Graham surely knows this but is opting to pretend that there's no there there.
The most charitable view of Mr. Graham's sycophancy is that the president has put him and GOP senators in general in a no-win predicament.
The political hell most Senate Republicans have found themselves in since 2016 can be described as the chasm between how Mr. Trump wants them to behave and how they believe they should govern. Virtually none of these senators can get re-elected without the third of Republicans who adore Mr. Trump, but the vulnerable ones need more than just the Trumpers to get across the finish line. This means they have to attract less single-minded voters who are often more Trump-skeptical - mostly suburban, college-educated Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.
But because the president and his most ardent fans will not brook any criticism of the president, the senators have been left trying to thread a very narrow needle: Differentiate yourself from Donald Trump while not actually criticizing Donald Trump.
The impeachment drama is shrinking the needle's eye even more, and from both sides.
On one side is the president. Virtually no GOP senator agrees with the president that his July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was, as Mr. Trump likes to say, "perfect." Beyond that, opinions differ, but it's a safe bet that most Senate Republicans think the conversation could have gone better and would dearly love for the president to say so.
Past presidents in the crosshairs of scandal have resorted to apologizing. Ronald Reagan admitted that "mistakes were made" after he stumbled on the facts during the Iran-Contra scandal. Bill Clinton initially denied everything, then told the nation, "I have sinned" and asked for forgiveness for the conduct that led to his impeachment.
Mr. Trump is determined to go another way and to punish those who disagree. That's why Mr. Graham, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio find it necessary to hide behind various parsing rationalizations. Mr. Rubio's response to Mr. Trump's calling on the Chinese to investigate Joe Biden is now the official safe harbor for Republicans: He didn't really mean it, he's just trolling the press. Ms. Ernst says, in effect, that criticizing the president won't change his behavior, so why bother?
Meanwhile, the Democrats have bungled the impeachment issue. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, in particular, has never missed an opportunity to burn any credibility he might have as a sober and honest investigator. Democratic partisans may like his red-meat rhetoric, but they lose sight of the fact that trolling Mr. Trump just makes the president's job easier. Mr. Schiff's entirely fictional account of Mr. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, read into the congressional record, may have infuriated the president, but it also gave Mr. Trump a talking point and an excuse for Republicans to hide behind the unfairness of the process.
If impeachment is going to be anything other than a partisan protest immediately swatted down by the GOP-controlled Senate, Democrats need to carefully and methodically make their case through serious fact-finding - an investigation that not only persuades at least 20 Republican senators but also a sufficient number of the voters those senators need to stay in office.
Short of that, the safer path will be for Republicans to continue to pretend everything is "perfect."

Lethal U.S. Airstrike on Afghan Drug Labs Is Disputed

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- At least 30 civilians were killed by American airstrikes that targeted drug labs in western Afghanistan this spring, according to a United Nations report released on Wednesday, a figure that the United States-led mission in the country quickly disputed.
The strikes, on May 5, targeted more than 60 sites in Farah Province and neighboring Nimruz Province, the United Nations report said. As of last month, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan had verified that 39 civilians were either wounded or killed in the strikes. Seventeen of those were working in the drug labs, which were primarily producing methamphetamine.
A statement from the American-led mission in Afghanistan disagreed with nearly all of the report, citing its "reliance on sources with conflicted motives" and the decision to call those killed in the bombings civilians instead of insurgents.
The dispute sheds light on America's current war methods -- relying heavily on overhead surveillance, air support and local forces to select and attack targets -- and the sometimes contentious definitions by which the United States military identifies combatants on an increasingly murky battlefield.
In the case of the May 5 strikes, the United States military said in its statement that its own "exhaustive and comprehensive review" had determined that the labs were producing revenue for the Taliban, and that the people working in them were Taliban fighters and "lawful military targets."
It said the timing of the strikes was chosen to avoid civilian casualties, but the United Nations report disputed this. Its report said that one of the targeted sets of facilities, in the Bakwa district of Farah Province, "were not controlled and operated exclusively by the Taliban, but rather they were owned and operated by criminal groups with connections to international drug trafficking networks."
These differing assessments are at the core of the dueling findings. While the American military sees economic engines that contribute to the Taliban's war effort as legally legitimate targets, the United Nations considered the sites hit on May 5 to be outside that categorization.
The people inside the labs were not "performing combat functions," the United Nations report said, and "while some of the sites may have been associated with illicit activity, they did not meet the definition of legitimate military objectives under international law."
A United States defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said revenue from the targeted drug labs was directly funding Taliban Red Units, a well-trained branch of the insurgent group that is responsible for some of its more deadly attacks.
After the strikes, the United States military, primarily using overhead surveillance, determined that no civilians were injured or killed. In June, the United Nations sent a fact-finding mission to several of the sites and conducted interviews with 21 local people, according to its report.
With decreasing numbers of American troops deployed in combat zones, a lack of people on the ground to assess the damage caused by airstrikes has become a staple of United States combat operations in recent years. In April, the military command in Africa determined that civilians had been killed in an airstrike in Somalia only after a rights group and pressure from lawmakers prompted a review.
And the fight against the Islamic State has been rife with civilian casualty allegations after extensive American bombing campaigns in cities such as Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria.
The United States military has not targeted any other methamphetamine labs after the May strikes, the defense official said. A United Nations report released in June said that 717 civilians were killed by American and Afghan government forces in the first six months of this year.
The United States has spent more than $ 8 billion on anti-narcotics operations in Afghanistan, according to the United States special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction. Officials have shifted antidrug strategies several times over the course of the long war. The latest iteration, which began in 2017 and primarily targeted opium-producing facilities, was called off late last year.
And while opium poppy growth has long been a financial foundation for the Taliban, methamphetamines have quietly appeared across Afghanistan in increasing quantities. In September last year, the Afghan counternarcotics police seized more than nine metric tons of chemicals that could be used to make the drug.

And Now We're in a Constitutional Crisis

Texto completo: With a full-on confrontation between the House and the president, no simple resolution is available.
For the first time since President Richard Nixon refused to turn over the White House tapes, the United States is facing a genuine constitutional crisis.
To be sure, Donald Trump had already created a crisis in the presidency by abusing the power of his office to pressure foreign governments to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But that act on its own didn't count as a constitutional crisis, because the Constitution prescribes an answer to presidential abuse of office: impeachment.
Now that President Trump has announced -- via a letter signed by Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel -- that he will not cooperate in any way with the impeachment inquiry begun in the House of Representatives, we no longer have just a crisis of the presidency. We also have a breakdown in the fundamental structure of government under the Constitution. That counts as a constitutional crisis.
A constitutional crisis exists when two conditions hold. First, we face a situation where the Constitution does not provide a clear, definitive answer to a basic problem of governance. Second, the political actors whose conflict is creating the problem appear ready to press their competing courses of action to the limit.
With Watergate, those two conditions were met. When President Nixon refused to comply with a valid subpoena issued by a federal court, there was no clear answer in the Constitution as to which branch of government would prevail. Mr. Nixon wouldn't budge, and neither the special prosecutor nor the court was willing to back down. The crisis was resolved only after the Supreme Court ordered the tapes to be turned over and Mr. Nixon resigned.
President Trump's stonewalling of the House impeachment inquiry also satisfies the two conditions for a constitutional crisis. First, the Constitution doesn't indicate what is supposed to happen if the House tries to exercise its constitutional power of oversight to investigate the president and the president flatly rejects the House's constitutional authority. Congress can demand that the president comply, but it can't very well send its sergeant-at-arms to the White House to enforce its subpoenas.
You might say that under the Constitution, the House could justifiably impeach the president for refusing to participate in the impeachment inquiry. Indeed, the third article of impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee against Mr. Nixon charged him with contempt of Congress for ignoring subpoenas issued by Congress.
Yet as Mr. Trump appears to be calculating, it's not so simple or satisfying for the House to proceed to impeachment without a factual inquiry. Impeaching a president for refusing to participate in an impeachment inquiry is a kind of meta-impeachment. It would allow Mr. Trump to argue that the meta-impeachment is illegitimate because it isn't based on an investigation.
That brings us to the second condition, namely that neither of the key actors seems prepared to back down. About the only thing the House could do now would be to pass a resolution formally authorizing the impeachment inquiry -- something it has not yet done and which the White House counsel cited in his letter as a reason to consider the current inquiry "unprecedented." Passing such a resolution might be a good idea for the House. But it would not qualify as backing down. To the contrary, passing a resolution to investigate impeachment would raise the stakes in the constitutional confrontation.
Mr. Trump, for his part, could in theory back down once the House passes such a resolution and start cooperating in the inquiry. That would avert the crisis. It's just barely conceivable that the motivation for the White House counsel's letter was to force House Democrats to go on the record individually as supporting an impeachment inquiry.
The White House counsel's letter, however, strongly signals that Mr. Trump won't start cooperating even if the House passes a resolution to authorize the inquiry. The letter makes a number of independent arguments for why the current impeachment inquiry is unconstitutional and illegitimate, and those would presumably still apply even if the House passed a resolution authorizing the inquiry.
Assuming that Mr. Trump isn't backing down, we're witnessing a full-on confrontation between the House and the president, with no simple resolution available.
When two branches of government are locked in a standoff, it's always possible that the third branch of government might come in to resolve it. In this instance, that's the judiciary, and the Supreme Court is the obvious candidate for the role. Faced with presidential refusal to comply with subpoenas, the House could seek judicial enforcement of its subpoenas.
As a matter of ordinary constitutional law, there's little doubt that the House's arguments before the courts would be much stronger than any offered in Mr. Cipollone's letter. It's well-settled constitutional doctrine that Congress may issue subpoenas for any valid legislative purpose. The Constitution gives the House the power to impeach. An impeachment inquiry is therefore a valid legislative purpose under the Constitution -- and impeachment-related subpoenas should be enforced by the courts.
The president could always assert executive privilege with respect to particular confidential documents. Such claims of privilege could be analyzed by the courts under existing constitutional precedents. There is no precedent in constitutional doctrine, however, supporting a president's blanket refusal to comply with any subpoenas regardless of privilege.
More to the point, Mr. Cipollone's letter presents the president as the judge of whether a congressional inquiry into impeachment is constitutional. That obviously can't be right. Not only would that violate the principle of separation of powers; it also would effectively put the president in ultimate control of the impeachment process.
Given the extreme weakness of Mr. Trump's arguments, it's probable that the lower federal courts would side with the House. Going to the Supreme Court, however, is always a bit of a gamble. The court's four more-liberal justices would undoubtedly side with the House. The court's four most conservative justices, two of them appointed by Mr. Trump, would find themselves in a quandary. Given the weakness of Mr. Trump's arguments, it's possible to imagine that they would take the position that the judicial branch should abstain from a conflict between the other two branches -- a way of dodging the issue that would effectively allow them to give Mr. Trump a victory.
That would leave the balance of power with Chief Justice John Roberts, who is a judicial conservative but above all wants to protect the court from appearing partisan. The trouble is, there would be almost no way for the Supreme Court to resolve the current crisis without seeming as though it was taking a side in a political fight.
What would happen? A good guess is that Chief Justice Roberts, with his back to the wall, would stand up for the clear constitutional precedent that says the courts will enforce valid congressional subpoenas. The Supreme Court chose the rule of law over President Nixon, a precedent that will not be lost on Justice Roberts.
But a guess is not constitutional reassurance. And in a constitutional crisis, that kind of reassurance is what the Republic needs.

Texto completo: Over three weeks, the man impersonated Nikolas Cruz, the confessed gunman, on social media to threaten and taunt.
A California man was convicted on Tuesday of cyberstalking and threatening to kidnap relatives of those killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., federal prosecutors said.
The man, Brandon Michael Fleury, was found guilty of three counts of cyberstalking and one count of transmitting a kidnapping threat, according to Ariana Fajardo Orshan, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Mr. Fleury, 22, will face a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on Dec. 2, prosecutors said.
Over the course of three weeks, from late December 2018 into early January 2019, Mr. Fleury used 13 different Instagram accounts to target survivors and victims' loved ones, prosecutors said. He operated under various aliases, including Nikolas Cruz, the man who has confessed to killing 17 people at Stoneman Douglas, and Ted Bundy, the notorious serial killer, according to prosecutors.
From his home in Santa Ana, Calif., Mr. Fleury sent dozens of messages using Instagram handles that included "the.douglas.shooter," "nikolas.killed.your.sister" and "nikolas.the.murderer," and images of Mr. Cruz as the accounts' profile pictures, according to court documents.
"I'm your abductor I'm kidnapping you fool," Mr. Fleury said in one message sent to multiple people, prosecutors said.
Other messages taunted the recipients about the deaths of loved ones and mentioned the assault weapon used in the attack.
"I killed your loved ones hahaha," "Did you like my Valentines gift? I killed your friends" and "With the power of my AR-15, I take your loved ones away from you PERMANENTLY," some of the messages read, according to prosecutors.
Several siblings, friends and parents of victims filed a harassment report with the Broward County Sheriff's Office in December 2018.
Law enforcement officers traced many of the Instagram accounts to Mr. Fleury's home address, according to a criminal complaint.
In searching Mr. Fleury's home, where he lives with his father and brother, investigators found thousands of images of Mr. Bundy, targeted victims and saved screenshots of his messages on Mr. Fleury's tablet, court records show.
Mr. Fleury admitted to targeting family members who were "activists" and had a large social media presence, according to the complaint. He told law enforcement officers that he was trying to gain popularity, and that he had found a "fascination" with mass shooters and serial killers.
Daryl Wilcox, Mr. Fleury's lawyer, argued during the six-day jury trial that Mr. Fleury's autism affected his capacity to understand the emotional impact of his statements, The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported.
During the trial, his father took the stand and described his son as an isolated and deeply autistic young man who played with stuffed animals all day, according to The Sun Sentinel.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The White House has signed off on special licenses for some U.S. companies to do some business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., according to a person familiar with the process.
The approval is likely to be interpreted as an act of goodwill as senior U.S. and Chinese officials gather for trade talks on Thursday . Business groups hope negotiators can agree on an interim or partial deal to prevent higher tariffs and additional duties on imports from China.
The partial reprieve for Huawei follows up on a plan President Trump outlined after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit of the Group of 20 leading economies in June. The administration had blacklisted Huawei earlier this year , contributing to an economic standoff between the U.S. and China dominated by tariffs and other sanctions.
Mr. Trump had said U.S. companies could do business with Huawei if the cooperation didn't harm U.S. national security, allowing the Commerce Department to grant licenses in those cases. No licenses have yet been granted , although the U.S. government has granted a temporary reprieve allowing companies to cooperate with Huawei.
Further details on which companies might be licensed and how national-security concerns would be addressed couldn't immediately be learned. The New York Times earlier reported the White House action.
The White House referred questions to the Commerce Department, which said the temporary reprieve remains in effect and that it had no additional announcements at this time.
Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to meet Thursday to discuss possible ways out of the trade war before an increase in U.S. tariff levels on Chinese products scheduled for Oct. 15 and the addition of major new consumer imports to the tariff list, set for Dec. 15.
The Huawei licenses or other concessions, including purchases of American agricultural goods by China, could be included as a part of such a deal, the person said.
Still, Mr. Trump this week said he doesn't favor a partial deal, and senior GOP lawmakers have expressed their preference for a broad deal to end the trade war and roll back tariffs. Democrats and China hawks are likely to attack any perceived shortcomings of an interim deal.

Texto completo: Kombucha changed Maddy Eagle's life, and now she's bringing her brew to Southwest Florida.
When Eagle, 30, was living in Germany a few years ago, she developed a sensitivity to gluten that resulted in occasional surges of inflammation. Sometimes her joints hurt with an almost arthritic pain.
"These flare-ups were out of the blue, and I didn't always react to gluten or bread," Eagle said, "so it was hard to cut back when I didn't always have an issue."
She started researching homeopathic remedies for her symptoms and stumbled on kombucha, a fermented beverage made from sweetened black or green tea that contains probiotics — gut-friendly bacteria believed to help with a variety of issues. Eagle found that as soon as she started to have joint pain, if she drank kombucha, the pain disappeared.
"To have something that you can drink for those issues, like kombucha, which is for most people a damned good drink — it's great," Eagle said.
When Eagle and her husband, Thomas Zeltner, 26, moved to Fort Myers, Eagle started brewing her own kombucha at home. And when Zeltner began selling his handcrafted wood products at the Alliance for the Art's Saturday GreenMarket, Eagle decided to sell a few growlers of her kombucha from his stand.
"I bottled up five bottles of kombucha, kept it on ice and waited to see if the yogis would buy it after yoga," she said.
The result? The yogis loved it.
"People were saying it had such a fresh taste, and it's a milder kombucha than others they'd tried," Eagle said.
"I was like, 'Wow, I really have something here.'"
After a few months of selling her craft kombucha in small batches, Eagle reached out to the Commercial Kitchen on Metro Parkway in Fort Myers to become a member. The kitchen helped her with the licensing requirements from the Department of Agriculture and gave her information on insurance procedures. She also connected with the Small Business Development Center at Florida Gulf Coast University for resources with her startup. Then she invested in a mini fridge with two small taps, and a few kegs. In September 2018, her kombucha business, Flying Eagle, was ready to take off.
Until recently, Eagle worked at Gartner as a senior marketing program manager. As her kombucha business grew, she made the decision to leave. "I really wanted to focus on my business and my brand," she said.
Eagle has four flavors in her standard lineup — strawberry-lemongrass, mixed berries with Cuban oregano (a blend of strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, tart cherry and pomegranate), lemon-lavender and mango-cayenne. As much as she can, she sources produce and herbs from local vendors. Her favorite local farms are Southern Fresh Farms off Daniels Parkway in south Fort Myers and Fruitscapes in Bokeelia.
In addition to her regular four flavors, she also carries limited addition and seasonal kombuchas. At the moment, she's running an apple-spice made with apple, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Her crowd-favorite specialty flavor is elderflower-mint.
"I've always been really good with flavors," Eagle said. "I can just smell something and know what would do really well together."
Flying Eagle Kombucha is available in bottles locally at Coastal Dayz Brewery, Crazy Dingo Brewery, El Pollo Rico, House of Ride Nature, Nice Guys, Point Ybel Brewing and Uhmazebowls.
Starting this month, Eagle and Zeltner will be making the tour of local farmers markets throughout the week. They're easy to spot. Zeltner hand-built a special kombucha cart with three taps for Flying Eagle's brew, where he also sells his woodwork.
"All of our products are very well-crafted and natural," Eagle said.
"It's really good stuff."

Meharry 'unapologetic' for Juul-funded research

Texto completo: Meharry Medical College this week staunchly defended its decision accept $7.5 million from an e-cigarette company to study vaping, pointing to a mysterious outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries and deaths as the strongest evidence yet that research was long overdue.
Meharry announced in June — before the outbreak became a national concern — it would launch a new health research center with a landmark study on the impact of vaping. As envisioned, the plan would put Nashville's historically black medical school on the forefront of vaping research.
But controversy built swiftly because Meharry's research would be mostly funded by a grant from Juul, the nation's largest e-cigarette company, a third of which is owned by Altria, a tobacco giant.
Patrick H. Johnson, a Meharry executive who sought funding from Juul, said Wednesday the lung injury outbreak shows criticism of the vaping research is misplaced and "uninformed." If this research had begun a few years ago, Johnson said, both scientists and the general public would now have a clearer understanding of the risks of vaping.
"We are unapologetic about this. It is the right thing to do," Johnson said. "We feel strongly that we should be here representing the communities that we serve, that trust us to serve them."
He added later: "It would be malpractice for us to not to wade into this right now when we can see it coming. We just can't stand on the sidelines and not do anything about it."
E-cigarettes have existed as a smoking alternative for nearly two decades but remain largely unresearched and unregulated. Vaping became vastly more popular in recent years, especially among teenagers and younger adults, and has further expanded as legal marijuana spread to most states. Concerns arose this summer due to a surge of severe lung injuries that are believed to be caused by vaping.
As of Wednesday, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention tallied 805 cases of lung injury and 12 deaths. Thirty-six cases have been reported in Tennessee, but no deaths. No single vaping product or ingredient has been identified as the cause of the illnesses, but the CDC says most cases appear to be linked to vaping of THC products, which remain illegal in Tennessee. Some health experts believe the outbreak may be related to vape cartridges that have been sold or modified on the black market.
Concern about the outbreak has seized the nation, prompting President Donald Trump to announce last month he planned to ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarette products. Juul later announced it removed its CEO and would halt most advertising and lobbying efforts related to its e-cigarette products.
But, at Meharry, the Juul-funded work is just beginning.
Johnson said the college is narrowing its search for a "world-class investigator" to lead the Center for the Study of Social Determinants of Health that will conduct the vaping research. Currently, the center is mostly funded with Juul's dollars, Johnson said, but Meharry is pursuing more money that should eventually outsize the grant from Juul.
The vaping outbreak also prompted Meharry to consider expanding its research, Johnson said. Initially, the Juul-funded study was envisioned to focus exclusively on nicotine vaping, but Johnson said the college is interested in researching THC and CBD vaping and the health impacts of counterfeit and black-market vape products.
Meharry, Juul, backlash and trust Juul's research grant drew criticism long before vaping illness worried the nation.
After the initial announcement in June, the New York Times reported vehement backlash from African American health experts and activists. Meharry President James Hildreth responded to criticism with a guest column in The Tennessean, insisting that the college knew "who we are dealing with" and "what we are getting into."
"As the president of Meharry," Hildreth wrote, "I am determined that, this time, we will be engaged on the forefront as our nation grapples with the emerging e-cigarette industry and its implications, including its allure for youth."
A few Meharry students and anti-tobacco activists opposed the Juul grant money during a town hall meeting held on campus in August. By accepting money from Juul, critics said, the college was participating in the tobacco industry's longstanding strategy of marketing specifically to black people.
"It essentially carries on the same playbook for the tobacco industry for the black community," said Phil Gardiner, an official from the University of California's Tobacco Related Disease Research Program. "It's really the people who are doing the main killing of black folk, essentially, buying a lot of evil science."
Johnson defended the grant at the forum, insisting Meharry could still produce independent research on vaping even if it took money from Juul. Historically, black people are among the last to benefit from health research, Johnson said, but this grant would allow Meharry — and by extension, black communities — to lead the way.
"My community is not going to be the last to know if its good or bad," Johnson told a crowd at the forum. "If it is devastating, I want to tell everybody to run from day one."
During his interview with The Tennessean last week, Johnson said the criticism of Meharry's decision was outsized in an academic world where industry-funded research is common.
Johnson said universities that are larger and predominately white often take donations or research funding from tobacco companies and opioid manufacturers, but aren't met with the same distrust.
Johnson, who is black, said he believes at least part of the difference is race.
"I've received more calls for interviews and we've received countless numbers of emails that questioned whether Meharry has the ability to do the same as our counterparts around this country," Johnson said. "The outlier of that is, which institution primarily employs and trains people who look like me?"

When Trump gets his alligator

Texto completo: If Watergate became, for Richard Nixon, a cancer on his presidency, then Donald Trump's Ukraine scandal is shaping up as something different: It's an alligator in his White House.
The alligator, for readers who missed its recent moment in the news cycle, is the predatory beast that the president reportedly wanted to swim hungrily in a moat along our southern border, sharing the waters with poisonous snakes, shadowed by spiked-tipped walls above.
But alligator mississippiensis is also a useful condensed symbol of how the Trump administration has survived Trump's own deeply unpresidential conduct: Because most of the time, when the president asks for an alligator, the people around him figure out a way to make sure the sharp-toothed reptile doesn't actually show up.
Their strategies have been various. Sometimes the president says "alligator!" and you just ignore him, which is how you get the spectacle of the man notionally in charge of the executive branch shouting "treason!" at his enemies with no discernible result.
The other day my colleague James Poniewozik wondered at the way that some of the president's defenders "seem to feel he should be treated like any person who watches TV news, gets worked up and blows off steam, not like a president making statements backed by the power of the U.S. government." But this isn't just how his apologists regard him; it's how his subordinates often manage him, signaling through their actions that his statements really are just rage-tweets, that the power of the government is not in fact behind them.
Of course that approach doesn't always work; sometimes the president asks you something directly instead of just yelling into the social-media void. Then you need delaying strategies, a promise to look into it, an "alligator cost estimate" proposal that will unfortunately never make its way through the bureaucracy.
Or you can give him some other lizard - ideally a gecko or a bearded dragon, but a Cuvier's dwarf caiman if you must - and tell him, Here's the alligator you wanted, sir!
If the president thinks that voter fraud cost him the popular vote, you create a voter fraud commission that will subsequently dissolve. If the president wants a "Muslim ban," you settle on a dumb but modest travel ban that leaves most of the world's Muslim countries untouched. If the president wants a bargain with North Korea no matter the strategic cost, let him have a handshake in the DMZ. If the president wants to leave NAFTA, you come up with a way to keep the deal but tweak it and rename it.
And if all else fails - well, sometimes you'll write up the alligator requisition orders and steal them off his desk.
The two biggest disasters in Trump's presidency have both been cases where these guardrails collapsed, and the president actually got his way in full. He actually fired James Comey, setting in motion the probe whose workings dominated his first term, and his Homeland Security apparatus actually separated thousands of migrant children from their families, creating the biggest moral scandal of his presidency.
But in other cases, he has been protected by the "don't-give-him-the-alligator" operations all around him. Indeed, the ultimate fizzle of the Mueller report was possible because that report ended up documenting a president whose staff let him rant about obstructing justice, but then - in Mueller's own words - mostly "declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."
With the Ukraine scandal, though, this protection has broken down again. (Not least because in Rudy Giuliani, Trump found an adviser even more enthusiastic about alligators than his boss.) The quest to get Ukraine's government to reopen an investigation that would touch the Biden family wasn't just a wish that Trump expressed; it was a policy objective that, however reluctantly and haphazardly, the U.S. government seems to have pursued. Trump's now-publicized conversation with the Ukrainian prime minister was itself an act of foreign policy, not just a spitballing conversation, and, whatever its intentions, so was the delay of military aid. We can't see the full body of the alligator, but you can see it moving in the water; it's right there.
Now clearly people around Trump still believed that they weren't going all the way to Alligatortown with Rudy, and maybe when we see the full shape of things, it will be clear that the president's men did actually prevent the most explicitly Biden-focused quid pro quo from taking shape. In which case there will be defenses of Trump that say, in effect: Look, he wanted an alligator, and we let one thrash around in the water for a while, but we always kept it on a leash.
I expect that will be the defense offered, eventually, by pained Republican senators voting to acquit - that this was bad behavior but happily the president's diplomats kept things from reaching the level of an impeachable offense.
The only difficulty will be that Trumpland will probably spend the next few months making a different argument: Actually, alligators are great.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Trump campaign threatened to sue a Minneapolis arena for passing along a half-million-dollar security bill from the city to cover costs of the president's political rally there on Thursday.
Minneapolis officials told the Target Center it would be responsible for the $530,000 the city says it will need to beef up security. The arena then passed the bill along to the Trump campaign and said the campaign would have to pay it, or it could not use the arena.
The ensuing battle has infuriated the Trump team, which is accusing Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey of trying to block Trump's visit.
Trump slammed Frey in a tweet Tuesday, calling him a "lightweight." Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, accused Frey of "abusing his power."
The campaign's legal team sent the Target Center's parent, AEG Management, a letter Monday declaring that refusing to allow Trump to hold his event there would be a breach of contract. The letter said the campaign "will aggressively pursue all remedies available."
In a statement, Parscale accused Frey of extortion by "conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally."
"The radical Mayor of Minneapolis, @Jacob_Frey,is abusing his power in an attempt to block the President's supporters from seeing him speak on Thursday," Parscale tweeted Tuesday. "We refuse to be bullied by a left-winger resister & won't let him stifle the speech of @realDonaldTrump or his supporters!"
Trump retweeted his campaign manager and wrote: "The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!"
Frey, an outspoken critic of Trump, responded to the president's tweet: "Yawn . . . to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors," Frey tweeted back.
After Trump announced his visit, Frey said while there was "no legal mechanism to prevent the president from visiting, his message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis."

Televangelist: Trump risks losing 'mandate of heaven'
WASHINGTON — Televangelist Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, is the latest of President Trump's supporters to decry the decision to abandon the Kurdish allies in Syria as Turkish forces approach.
"I believe . . . the president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen," Robertson said Monday on his CBN show, "The 700 Club."
In his unusually fiery criticism, Robertson said he was "appalled" by the president's decision, implying it was a betrayal to Kurdish allies. He went on to invoke the Armenian genocide, in which the Turkish government killed thousands of Armenian Christians amid World War I, and the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, ­assassinated last year in a ­Saudi consulate in Turkey.
"The president, who allowed Khashoggi to be cut into pieces, without any repercussions whatsoever, is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks," Robertson said. He also criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — with whom Trump has friendly rapport — as a "thug" and a "dictator."
"Now our government is saying you have a free hand to go into Syria, take out the democratic forces and take out the Kurds," Robertson said.

After heart attack, Sanders will slow pace of campaign
BURLINGTON, Vt. — Senator Bernie Sanders, a week after suffering a heart attack in Las Vegas, said Tuesday that he planned to slow his pace on the campaign trail and acknowledged that voters are likely to consider his health when deciding whether to vote for him.
Speaking to reporters outside his home following a visit to a cardiologist, Sanders gave no indication he was planning to drop out of the race and said he'd continue to campaign actively.
“We were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people," Sanders said. “I don't think I'm going to do that."
“I think we're going to change the nature of the campaign a bit," he added. “Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do."
Asked to clarify, he replied: “Probably not doing four rallies a day."
“Everything that happens everyday weighs on how people feel about you," he said. “And my own view is that — and I think it's the voters' view — you look at the totality of who a candidate is."

Texto completo: Readers worry that America is putting the Kurds, who have helped us fight ISIS, at the mercy of Turkey, and that bloodshed will follow.
To the Editor:
Re "Backtracking on Syria, President Mixes Signals, Inciting a G.O.P. Furor" (front page, Oct. 8):
President Trump's statement on Sunday that he was willing to let Turkey enter the Kurdish parts of northern Syria by withdrawing American troops is deeply concerning. The United States has de facto betrayed the Kurds, who took upon themselves a large part of the fight against ISIS.
What Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has in store is not a peaceful resettlement of Syrians. Instead, under the pretext of Syrian refugees' resettlement, his forces will move in to destroy Kurdish fighters and civilians.
Mr. Trump later warned that he would obliterate Turkey's economy if the Kurds are attacked, but Mr. Erdogan simply needs American troops out of his way. He will pay little attention to Mr. Trump's words.
The United States is sending allies in the region -- and anywhere really -- the wrong message: We will use you until we are done with you, and then we will throw you to the wolves.
Besides that, it is likely that 10,000 captured ISIS fighters -- held by the Kurds -- will escape as the Kurdish forces turn to repel Turkey. Congratulations, Mr. Trump.
I am afraid that this is the beginning of a Turkish genocide against the Kurds. And Mr. Trump will be to blame. This is not how you conduct foreign policy.

To the Editor:
So now the Kurds will learn what many others have learned during the Trump presidency: Loyalty and cooperation will bring you a knife in the back. As has happened to many officials, cabinet officers and allies, this president will cast you aside on a whim. And he will do it with a sneer and a smear. His implication that the Kurds were fighting only for money is patently untrue.
While there are valid arguments to be made for lessening American involvement in the Middle East, this kind of precipitous action is the worst possible course, and will only increase bitterness against the United States. That bitterness will linger long after this gang has left the White House. But this president has always left his messes for others to clean up. This one may involve a lot of spilled blood.
Howard Schmitt
Green Tree, Pa.
To the Editor:
You report that President Trump may allow Turkey to invade Syrian Kurdistan, an autonomous democracy with more rights for women than any state in the Middle East save Israel. Beyond Israel, the Kurds have been our only true regional ally for decades, and now we are abandoning them -- for the third time.
The United States betrayed the Kurds after the first gulf war when we kowtowed to Saddam Hussein and permitted him to crush a Kurdish uprising, leading to the slaughter of thousands of civilians. And Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger betrayed them after pledging autonomy in exchange for supporting Israel and Iran against Soviet-backed Iraqis -- only to sell them out in 1975 after the shah cut a deal with Iraq.
Yet to this day the Kurds have fought with us for American interests. After this day, they may never fight with us again. Given bipartisan criticism since the decision, Mr. Trump appears to be backtracking. This is a positive development.
The Kurds are a secular, democratic force in a region where both are scarce qualities. They were with us in the invasion of Iraq. They have been with us against ISIS. Why aren't we with them?

To the Editor:
Re "Turkey's Plan to Move Refugees to Syria Is Dangerous," by Ryan Gingeras and Nick Danforth (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Oct. 7):
What is so unashamedly ignored in the reaction to Turkey's plans is the complete lack of assistance by the West to resettle the Syrian refugees. This is the root of the problem. President Trump's anti-immigrant and anti-refugee policies have closed the door to the United States, and Europe's fears of a Muslim invasion reaching back to the days of the Ottoman Empire remain, even if glossed over with more politically correct rationalizations.
Most people in the region believe, perhaps rightly, that if this were a problem of white, Christian refugees, the response would be very different. The longer we ignore the problem of resettlement and leave Turkey to carry the weight of millions of refugees alone, the more Turkey will act out and pockets of radicalization in the region will grow.
Resistance to Turkey's plans without offering alternatives is not a solution.
Kerime Akoglu
New York
To the Editor:
In light of President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, which followed a phone call from Turkey's president, the path forward for now imperiled Kurdish forces in Syria is clear: Call Mr. Trump. He always does what the last guy on the phone wanted.

Nevius: A’s ready for a ballpark, but Oakland isn’t

Texto completo: I am concerned about baseball in Oakland. I am not sure the city can keep its team.
Oh come on, you say, just because the A’s lost (another) do-or-die playoff game? And what do you mean, no support? Did you see that crowd? Over 54,000. A wild-card playoff record.
All true. There’s a lot to like, beginning with the team.
The A’s are young, fresh and personable. If you wanted to pick an up-and-coming group on whose bandwagon to jump, this would be the call.
And they win. This year they went 97-65. That would have won the National League Central and tied for first in the NL East. And this is the second straight year they’ve won 97 games.
As for seeing the crowd. Yes, I was there. It was loud, proud and they were still chanting, “Let’s go . . . Oak-land!” in the bottom of the ninth. In a gut-punch of a game, one that seemed over after the fifth pitch, that was impressive.
I just have one question.
Where have you been?
In his postgame interview, manager Bob Melvin made a conscious effort to praise the turnout. He added that they draw large crowds at other times.
“We see it in fireworks nights and big series,” he said. “They come out for us.”
OK, so they like fireworks. And seeing the Yankees. Opening Day.
How about baseball? Do they like baseball? Because on a typical Wednesday afternoon game, the ballpark looks empty and Candlestick-ian. There are plenty of seats available and feel free to choose one closer to the action.
Before the wild-card game I was talking to a savvy baseball insider who said something that gave me a little chill.
“I question the market,” he said.
Meaning that all those years of low attendance may be telling us something. This isn’t baseball territory. Worse yet, he had facts to back it up.
This year the A’s introduced an innovative ticket plan called A’s Access. You could buy an entire season at rock bottom prices. In a recent New York Times story, the reporter said he paid $384 for the season, which also includes $10 parking and half off concessions. For an 81-game home season, that’s roughly $5 a game.
“They are,” my baseball savant said, “essentially giving tickets away.”
The result? Attendance was up some 88,000 for the season, Fine, but it works out to an average increase of about 1,100 fans a game. Which in the cavernous 46,867-seat Coliseum, doesn’t really move the needle.
Granted, the plan helped the A’s draw nearly 1.7 million. But that’s still 24th in baseball. The Giants attracted a million more fans and they are fretting about declining attendance.
Now loyal A’s fans are already writing angry emails. They support their team passionately, they’ll say.
OK then, you know what you should do? Go to Oakland City Council meetings. Turn out in numbers and make it clear to the council that their constituents support the new ballpark.
Because you know the ideologically pure and reality-challenged Oakland City Council. On the eve of the playoff game, they filed a lawsuit to block the sale of half of the Coliseum property to the A’s. It was the height of cluelessness.
Before the game, A’s President Dave Kaval was pacing the third-base line, exasperated. At the time no one, including Kaval, knew what was going to happen with the legal challenge.
They were “blindsided” by the suit, he fulminated. And to do it now, “just as we are in into the playoffs? Unbelievable.”
He’s not wrong. The city council seems to think the A’s are some sketchy group trying to pull a fast one during construction of a sports structure.
No, that was the Raiders. And that little trip to the cleaners cost the city millions.
This is different. A chance to build a legacy project in downtown Oakland. If anything can revitalize the fan base, it is a new stadium.
And by the way, take a stroll through Jack London Square. There’s an example of urban renewal that went nowhere. You know what it needs? An anchor tenant that would attract thousands of people. Like a ballpark.
The lawsuit traces a complicated path that eventually leads to the lack of affordable housing.
But make no mistake. The effect is to once again stop the Howard Street ballpark project. The A’s developing part of the Coliseum site is the financial linchpin for the new downtown facility. Without that land, the deal is dead.
Major League Baseball moves in slow and ponderous ways, but it seems to have finally roused itself to life. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told Chronicle reporter Susan Slusser that he’d met with City Council President Rebecca Kaplan and told her “It’s time for the city of Oakland to show concrete progress” on a stadium.
Will that be enough to get things going? Who knows? So far the council has set records for inaction and posturing. They need to hear from loud, loyal A’s fans.
Otherwise, we refer you to another stat from the New York Times story. In a 30-year period, 24 of the 30 MLB teams have moved to new ballparks.
Eventually, one way or another, the A’s will be one of them.
Will it be in Oakland? I am having doubts.

New Problems with Elizabeth Warren's Inequality Math; Just because the New York Times believes a tax claim doesn't mean readers should.

Texto completo: Faced with the collapse of their argument that income inequality has risen dramatically in recent decades, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's favorite economists have come back with an even more audacious claim. And some members of the press corps seem eager to buy it.
"The Rich Really Do Pay Lower Taxes Than You," asserts a New York Times headline above a column from David Leonhardt. The column contains a related assertion that is perhaps even more striking:
For the first time on record, the 400 wealthiest Americans last year paid a lower total tax rate — spanning federal, state and local taxes — than any other income group, according to newly released data.
Since the IRS hasn't yet published complete official statistics for 2018, there would seem to be grounds for skepticism. But Mr. Leonhardt does his best to credentialize the two controversial academics making the claim:
The data here come from the most important book on government policy that I've read in a long time — called "The Triumph of Injustice," to be released next week. The authors are Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, both professors at the University of California, Berkeley, who have done pathbreaking work on taxes. Saez has won the award that goes to the top academic economist under age 40, and Zucman was recently profiled on the cover of Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine as "the wealth detective."
Sen. Warren frequently cites the work of Messrs. Saez and Zucman and relies on their estimates to claim that her new wealth tax will raise close to $3 trillion over a decade. As for the Times detective, he suspects a particular response to the latest claim from the two economists. Writes Mr. Leonhardt:
I already know what some critics will say about these arguments — that the rich will always figure out a way to avoid taxes.
Sure, but what many critics across the philosophical spectrum are also saying is that Messrs. Saez and Zucman are simply wrong in their income and tax calculations.
David Splinter of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation writes in a new paper that , just as you would expect, the rich in America do pay higher tax rates than the poor, according to a range of sources:
U.S. federal taxes are progressive, as shown by Congressional Budget Office and Tax Policy Center estimates, with average tax rates increasing with income. In fact, the OECD estimated that the U.S. has the most progressive household taxes among developed countries. Moreover, the 2017 tax reform is expected to have little effect on overall tax progressivity (Tax Policy Center, 2017; Joint Committee on Taxation, 2019). But Saez and Zucman (2019) argue that average tax rates are nearly equal over the income distribution. To examine this claim, this paper compares other estimates of average tax rates by income group, all of which suggest a high degree of progressivity. Three issues are found to bias the average tax rates presented in Saez and Zucman (2019). After correcting for these issues, their estimates align more closely with other estimates that show U.S. taxes are progressive.
Mr. Splinter documents the Saez-Zucman errors at length, and he's not the only one finding flaws in the work of Sen. Warren's favorite economists. Former Obama Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman took to Twitter this week to point out that U.S. high-income earners pay at a higher rate than low-income earners, both before and after accounting for state and local taxation.
Economic historian Phil Magness finds an implicit rebuttal of the new Warren-friendly math in data from the Congressional Budget Office:
The CBO's figures diverge sharply from the findings in the New York Times report. Whereas Saez and Zucman place the top 1 percent's total tax burden (federal, state, and local) at around 30 percent of its income in 2016 (the latest year available for comparison in both series), the CBO's estimate for federal taxes alone is actually higher at 33.3 percent.
A similar inconsistency may be seen at the bottom of the distribution. According to the CBO, the bottom quintile (20 percent) of earners paid just 1.7 percent of their income on federal taxes. Saez and Zucman's numbers also include state and local taxation, but their estimates for the poorest segment's overall tax burden leap to nearly 25 percent. While state and local tax burdens do skew somewhat in a regressive direction, other data suggest this spike is entirely implausible.
Mr. Magness also cites work from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that undermines the new claim from the Warrenistas. He also details some of the flaws, beginning with the calculation of income and taxes among those in the lowest income bracket:
First, as Zucman recently admitted on Twitter, their series removes the refundable portion of the earned income tax credit (EITC) from the bottom quintile's federal tax burden. He claims this was done to separate the alleged "muddle" of transfer payments from the mix when looking at tax data, yet this produces highly misleading results.
Maybe one of Sen. Warren's opponents at next week's Democratic debate will challenge her on the inequality muddle at the heart of her economic policy.

Texto completo: Readers offer Joe Biden a succinct response to accusations against him, discuss the significance of "though" and suggest the term "Trumpwashing" to describe the president's strategy.
To the Editor:
Re "Under Attack, Biden Wrestles With Response" (front page, Oct. 6):
Your article states that Joe Biden has been uncertain about how to respond to President Trump's repeated accusations of corruption. Mr. Trump himself has famously responded to accusations by forcefully repeating slogans such as "no collusion, no obstruction" over and over again, regardless of their veracity.
Mr. Biden's response to Mr. Trump's baseless accusations could be equally succinct and forceful, with the additional merit of being correct: "He's lying." In fact, this simple, clear response could prove useful to Democrats in connection with any number of issues related to Mr. Trump. With repetition, it might sink in with the voting public.
For that matter, perhaps some energetic writer at The Times could draw on the paper's extensive coverage and analysis to put a book together with these same two words as the title: "He's Lying."

To the Editor:
There is no substantive proof of corrupt acts by Joe Biden or his son Hunter in their dealings with Ukraine. At the same time, the optics are ugly and disturbing. At the very least this is a prime example of influence peddling.
A Ukrainian oil and gas company put Hunter Biden on its board at a seemingly highly inflated level of compensation (reported to be $ 50,000 per month). Hunter seems to have had no skills or wisdom worth near that sum, just his familial ties. It is clear that Joe Biden did not counsel his son well about the wisdom of accepting such a post.
Still, President Trump is wrong to be calling out the Bidens for corruption, particularly when his own corrupt behavior is out there for all to see.
Ken Derow

To the Editor:
It appears that some of President Trump's most ardent supporters (for example, Tucker Carlson) are now suggesting that Republicans stop their fruitless efforts to label Mr. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president as appropriate but instead urge that such conduct does not merit impeachment and that his fate should be determined by the 2020 election. And, of course, Democrats agonized for months over impeachment versus a fair and free election by the people in 2020.
How can we wait for and rely upon an election when it is now absolutely established that Mr. Trump has done, is doing and without question will continue to do everything he can to make sure the 2020 election is neither fair nor free? There is no choice but to impeach.
Lawrence B. Lame

To the Editor:
In your coverage of the "do us a favor" conversation between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, there's one word that is consistently overlooked: "though." In the president's statement "I would like you to do us a favor though," "though" is qualifying (in a grammatical sense) the previous sentence, in which President Volodymyr Zelensky states his desire for more American military aid.
By using the word "though," the president establishes a conditional relationship between the military aid for Ukraine and the president's request for an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. If that isn't a quid pro quo, I don't know what is.

To the Editor:
Re "Mr. Trump, Self-Impeaching President" (editorial, Oct. 4):
You've nailed it. The president's strategy is not to conceal his wrongdoing, but to repeat it, more and more blatantly, in order to make us think, "Well, if he is so open about it, I guess it can't be a big deal." A term for this clever and destructive tactic comes to mind: "Trumpwashing."

Texto completo: A judge ordered President Trump to turn over eight years of tax returns, but the case raises constitutional issues that could end up in the Supreme Court.
On Monday, a federal judge issued a ruling that effectively ordered President Trump's accountants to turn over eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney.
Mr. Trump's lawyers immediately appealed the decision, and an appeals court temporarily blocked the ruling. So for now, the president can keep his financial information secret.
But the case raises sweeping constitutional issues that could reach the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Trump argued that sitting presidents are immune from criminal investigations, a position that has not been tested in a court.
In a 75-page decision, Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court called that argument an "extraordinary claim" that was "repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values."
Here are five takeaways:
Presidents are not immune from criminal inquiries, the judge says
The legal showdown started in late August, when the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., subpoenaed Mr. Trump's accounting firm for his personal and corporate tax returns dating to 2011.
Mr. Vance has been investigating whether any New York State laws were broken when Mr. Trump and his company reimbursed the president's former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments he made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who had said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president denies the affair.
In their lawsuit seeking to block the subpoena, Mr. Trump's lawyers argued that the investigation itself is unconstitutional. They asserted that presidents cannot be subject to the burden of investigations, especially from local prosecutors who may use the criminal process for political gain.
Judge Marrero rejected that argument wholesale. "Neither the Constitution nor the history surrounding the founding support as broad an interpretation of presidential immunity as the one now espoused by the President," the judge wrote.
Presidents might not even be immune from criminal charges
Federal prosecutors are barred from charging a sitting president with a crime because the Justice Department has decided that presidents have temporary immunity while they are in office. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was following that direction when he said in May that presidents could not be charged.
That position is outlined in two Justice Department memos written during the Nixon and Clinton administrations, citing the burden that a barrage of investigations would put on the president. But Judge Marrero called it into question. He said the memos rely on "suppositions, practicalities and public policy" as well as dire pictures of hypothetical scenarios -- and not on an actual case.
Either way, those memos -- themselves interpretations of the Constitution -- do not bind the hands of a local prosecutor such as Mr. Vance. Still, the question of whether a president can face state criminal charges also has never been tested, the judge noted.
The question could reach the United States Supreme Court
Mr. Trump's lawyers quickly appealed Judge Marrero's decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. Depending on what happens there, the losing side ultimately could try to take the case up to the Supreme Court.
The Department of Justice said on Monday that it planned to weigh in on the case as well.
That does not mean the high court would agree to take the case. But if it does, it could set a sweeping new constitutional precedent about presidential immunity. Did the framers intend for impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate to be the only vehicle for handling any wrongdoing by the president? Should prosecutors with possible political bias have the unfettered ability to disrupt a presidency? Is no American above the law?
Even if the district attorney wins, the president's tax returns would not be made public
The president has fought multiple attempts to obtain copies of his tax returns, which he said during the 2016 campaign that he would make public but has since refused to disclose.
Mr. Trump's lawyers have sued to block attempts by congressional Democrats to access his tax returns and financial records, and by New York lawmakers to release state tax returns to congressional committees. They also successfully challenged a California law requiring presidential primary candidates to release their tax returns.
But even if Mr. Vance prevails and obtains Mr. Trump's tax returns, they would not automatically become public. The documents would be protected by the rules governing grand jury secrecy unless they became part of a criminal case.
Time is running out for Mr. Vance
Aside from the constitutional question, the practicalities of the investigation are at stake. Mr. Vance has accused the president of trying to delay the subpoena until the statute of limitations on any possible crimes run out. The president's lawyers have denied this.
Mr. Vance's office has been investigating whether the Trump Organization falsely accounted for the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen as a legal expense. It was unclear why the office has attempted to obtain Mr. Trump's personal financial records as part of that inquiry.

Perry focused on energy, aide says

Texto completo: Energy Secretary Rick Perry encouraged President Trump to speak to Ukraine's president — but on energy and economic issues, Perry's spokeswoman said Sunday, addressing Perry's role in a telephone call that is at the center of a congressional impeachment probe for Trump.
"Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development," Perry's Energy Department spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, said in an e-mail.
Hynes's remark comes as Perry becomes the latest administration official drawn into inquiries in a House impeachment probe of Trump. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the July 25 call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, sparking a whistle-blower complaint and now the impeachment inquiry.
Trump on Friday evening told House Republicans that it was Perry who had set up the July call with Ukraine, according to a person familiar with Trump's new comments who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conference call.
But Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, or a US holdup in military aid to the country, the person said. Trump's remarks on the late Friday call were first reported by Axios.
Perry, the former governor of Texas and up to now a lower-profile but active member of Trump's Cabinet, has made repeated trips to Ukraine and met often with Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky. Perry and his agency say his involvement with Ukraine was part of US policy, predating the Trump administration, to increase US natural gas, coal, and other supplies to Eastern Europe to lessen Russia's control of the region's energy market.

Anti-Muslim group plans to host gala at Mar-a-Lago
An anti-Muslim organization plans to host its annual gala at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's private club in Palm Beach, Fla., in November.
ACT for America claims to be the nation's largest grass-roots national security organization, and is considered the largest anti-Muslim group in the United States, according to the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups.
Michelle Malkin, a conservative columnist, author, and television commentator, will be the keynote speaker, according to an invitation posted on the organization's website. Standard tickets are $1,500 per person and premium tickets, which put attendees at the head tables, are $2,500. Premium tickets are sold out, according to the website.
“I don't think it should occur," said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization. “It's really a violation of the US Constitution to funnel funds from a hate group directly to the president and his business," he said, referring to the emoluments clauses of the Constitution.
In an e-mail Sunday, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said, without elaboration, “This event will absolutely not be taking place at Mar-a-Lago." She did not respond to additional questions.

Trump to hold election eve rally against La. governor
President Trump is heading to Louisiana ahead of Saturday's election, for a last-minute rally aimed at peeling support from Governor John Bel Edwards and keeping the Democratic incumbent from a primary win.
Trump tweeted Sunday about the get-out-the-vote event, saying he's working to elect "a great new Republican Governor!" He hasn't endorsed one of the GOP candidates, Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone.
The president's event will be held Friday night in Lake Charles, in southwest Louisiana.
In Louisiana, all candidates run against each other, regardless of party, on the same primary ballot. Polls show Edwards well in the lead, ahead of his two main Republican challengers, within striking distance of topping 50 percent and reaching a primary win.
Trump's visit follows a GOP voter rally in Kenner featuring Vice President Mike Pence.

Former president Jimmy Carter 'feels fine' after fall
Former president Jimmy Carter fell Sunday at his home in Georgia and needed some stitches above his brow, but "feels fine," his spokeswoman said.
Deanna Congileo said in an e-mail that the 39th president fell Sunday in Plains and received stitches. Carter turned 95 on Tuesday, becoming the first US president to reach that milestone.
Congileo said Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who is 92, were eager to be at a Habitat for Humanity build in Nashville. The opening ceremony for the project was scheduled for Sunday evening and it runs through Friday.

Why don’t Trump’s enablers walk away?

Texto completo: We're all familiar by now with the reasons advanced for why elected Republicans shrivel like dry houseplants whenever they are asked to distance themselves from the president. They fear primary challengers. They dread his Twitter wrath. They like the judges. All true as far as it goes. And we might add that partisanship has reached radioactive levels — what with the siloing of information sources, the “big sort” in geographical choices, and so forth.
But pause for a moment over the people who work directly for Trump. Why do so few of them quit?
The turnover rate in this administration has set records, but with the exception of James Mattis and John Bolton, remarkably few have walked out. (For what it's worth, Trump contends that he fired both Mattis and Bolton.)
After Bolton's departure, Trump crowed that “we have 15 candidates” for national security adviser. “Everyone wants it badly, as you can imagine.” And why would that be? Because it's key to keeping America safe? Because it carries great responsibility and opportunities to make the world more stable and secure? No, “It's great because it's a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump.”
Thus does the job of national security adviser to the president of the United States get transformed into a game show slot.
The truth is that Trump is among the worst bosses in the world. He has tantrums, hurls insults and maintains a level of chaos that makes a Tilt-A-Whirl seem calm. But none of that seems to faze Trump's appointees, who have frequently accepted humiliation at his hands.
A recent New York Times account of Trump's behind-the-scenes fulminations about immigration illustrate the pattern. Dressing down his Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump demanded that she shoot down drones without legal authority. When she pushed back, he sneered: “Kirstjen, you didn't hear me the first time, honey. Shoot 'em down. Sweetheart, just shoot 'em out of the sky, OK?”
Bob Woodward's book “Fear” offers similar examples. He called his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, “mentally retarded. He's this dumb Southerner.” After Rudy Giuliani turned in a TV appearance that Trump judged insufficiently sycophantic, he jibed: “Rudy, you're a baby. I've never seen a worse defense of me in my life. They took your diaper off right there. You're like a little baby that needed to be changed. When are you going to be a man?”
He told Wilbur Ross that he didn't trust him to negotiate because “you're past your prime.” He called Reince Priebus “weak” and gave him the nickname “Reincy.”
If they won't even stand up straight and assert their own dignity, it's not surprising that they shrink from vindicating the honor of the United States and the rule of law. If more of Trump's people had resigned rather than silently assented to a presidency that displayed contempt for law, Trump might not be facing impeachment now.
Again and again, those surrounding Trump have taken to subterfuge (Gary Cohn snatching papers off the Resolute desk), or anonymous New York Times op-eds to proclaim their patriotic role in restraining the wilder impulses of the commander in chief.
But they do not protest that this administration is lawless. They don't resign. They don't go public. They wait to be fired and then insulted, and thereby reinforce the president's perception that there are no guardrails.

Texto completo: The NBA is facing widespread condemnation Monday, a day after the league apologized following Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's tweet supporting the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.
On Friday, Morey, in a now-deleted tweet, posted an image that also said, "Fight for Freedom. Stand for Hong Kong," amid increasing tension between Hong Kong and Beijing, which controls the territory. Morey later apologized for the tweet.
The NBA distanced themselves from the comment in a statement Sunday by NBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass, who said that the NBA has "great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together."
The NBA found themselves in a precarious position considering their overseas partnership with China. In the aftermath of Morey's tweet, the Chinese Basketball Association announced they were suspending their cooperation with the team. Further, Tencent Holdings, a Chinese tech conglomerate, reported that nearly 500 million people viewed NBA programming on the platform last year with more people tuning in to watch the final game of the NBA Finals than the number of Americans who watched it, according to The New York Times.
A number of people, including politicians on both sides of the political spectrum, have voiced their outrage that the NBA would issue an apology for supporting what many consider pro-Democratic protests.

A number of people also pointed out that the NBA has a track record on both supporting liberal issues as well as allowing players to speak on controversial matters. Back in 2014, a number of NBA players, including superstar LeBron James, wore pregame warm up shirts that read, "I can't breathe," which was a reference to Eric Garner, a black man who was killed by police officers through a banned move used to subdue suspects.
Further, the NBA moved the location of the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte as a result of North Carolina's House Bill 2, which limited anti-discrimination laws.

Nicholas Kristof: World leaders can again make miracles

Texto completo: We need a little uplift, a reminder that although world leaders today from Washington to London to Beijing may be dishonest vandals, it doesn’t have to be that way.
Even flawed presidents and prime ministers can act in noble ways, and we saw that in the 2000s when George W. Bush, Tony Blair and others made a heroic effort to tackle AIDS and malaria and save children’s lives around the world.
European and American leaders backed the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which since 2002 has saved 32 million lives. That’s not a misprint. And some 17 million of those lives are from PEPFAR, an AIDS program that Bush founded.
Then there’s Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, created in 2000 with public and private backing: It has saved 13 million lives. We live in an age of miracles when a group of public health nerds, backed by world leaders and front-line health workers, can save lives by the million.
These may be the greatest successes in the history of human governance. Only half as many children now die worldwide as did in 2000. That’s 5 million children’s lives saved each year.
Yet today the kind of global leadership we saw in the early 2000s is gone. Bravo to French President Emmanuel Macron for remaining a supporter of multilateral aid, but he’s the exception. President Donald Trump has tried to slash aid, although in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike have resisted, and Trump used his speech last month to the United Nations to preach nationalism.
I don’t want to wax too nostalgic: Bush and Blair also collaborated in the catastrophic Iraq War. Still, at their best, they aimed to use their powers for a cause larger than themselves — while Trump, Boris Johnson and Xi Jinping worship only at their own altars.
In the heady days of the early 2000s, leaders pledged to donate at least 0.7% of national income in assistance to poor countries. The only countries that now do so are Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Britain. The U.S. donates 0.17%, and the average in the rich world is 0.31%.
So that’s the conundrum: We have proved that we have the capacity to save lives, improve education and health, create opportunities for women and girls — yet we also seem to have lost interest.
Nations around the world have adopted 17 Global Goals — quality education, zero hunger, gender equity and so on — to achieve by 2030. We have a historic opportunity to end extreme poverty on our watch, but that will require more commitment in countries like the United States and Britain, and also in countries like South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
One ray of sunshine: Leaders at the United Nations last month committed themselves to achieving universal health coverage by 2030. Here in America, we’re still feuding about access to medical care, but countries like Chile, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Thailand and Kyrgyzstan are showing that moving toward universal coverage is possible even with limited resources.
If these countries can manage it, why is the most powerful country in the history of the world stymied?
Universal coverage is championed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, the director general of the World Health Organization. He knows as well as anybody the importance of access to medical services, for his younger brother, Yemane, died at the age of 4, apparently of measles.
“That was always haunting me,” Tedros told me.
Universal coverage not only saves the lives of children from measles, but it also serves as a global bulwark against epidemics.
“People ask what keeps me up at night,” Tedros said. “My nightmare is a pandemic flu.” One way to protect against such a pandemic — and against Ebola and other viruses — is to build up health care systems in the most vulnerable countries.
Ebola has been spreading in eastern Congo for more than a year. If it suddenly bounces to Europe or Asia, we’ll belatedly realize that our safety in America depends on improving health systems in Congo.
By some reckoning, half the world’s people can’t get simple medical care, especially surgery. I’ll never get over watching a mother of three, Prudence Lemokouno, die needlessly in a Cameroon hospital because she couldn’t get a C-section.
Likewise, more than 800 women die wretchedly and painfully each day from cervical cancer, which in poor countries is sometimes diagnosed partly by the smell of rotting flesh. Cervical cancer is also overwhelmingly preventable with cheap HPV vaccinations, just $4.50 a dose, yet only about 15% of girls get the shot.
I worry that in the coming year, Trump and impeachment will suck all the oxygen out of the room, making it impossible for us to think of anything other than him. Trump is critically important — but so are the 5 million children who will die this year, mostly for preventable reasons.

Ross Douthat: When Trump gets his alligator

Texto completo: If Watergate became, for Richard Nixon, a cancer on his presidency, then Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal is shaping up as something different: It’s an alligator in his White House.
The alligator, for readers who missed its recent moment in the news cycle, is the predatory beast that the president reportedly wanted to swim hungrily in a moat along our southern border, sharing the waters with poisonous snakes, shadowed by spiked-tipped walls above.
But alligator mississippiensis is also a useful condensed symbol of how the Trump administration has survived Trump’s own deeply unpresidential conduct: Because most of the time, when the president asks for an alligator, the people around him figure out a way to make sure the sharp-toothed reptile doesn’t actually show up.
Their strategies have been various. Sometimes the president says “alligator!” and you just ignore him, which is how you get the spectacle of the man notionally in charge of the executive branch shouting “treason!” at his enemies with no discernible result.
The other day my colleague James Poniewozik wondered at the way that some of the president’s defenders “seem to feel he should be treated like any person who watches TV news, gets worked up & blows off steam, not like a president making statements backed by the power of the U.S. government.” But this isn’t just how his apologists regard him; it’s how his subordinates often manage him, signaling through their actions that his statements really are just rage-tweets, that the power of the government is not in fact behind them.
Of course that approach doesn’t always work; sometimes the president asks you something directly instead of just yelling into the social-media void. Then you need delaying strategies, a promise to look into it, an “alligator cost estimate” proposal that will unfortunately never make its way through the bureaucracy.
Or you can give him some other lizard — ideally a gecko or a bearded dragon, but a Cuvier’s dwarf caiman if you must — and tell him, Here’s the alligator you wanted, sir!
If the president thinks that voter fraud cost him the popular vote, you create a voter fraud commission that will subsequently dissolve. If the president wants a “Muslim ban,” you settle on a dumb but modest travel ban that leaves most of the world’s Muslim countries untouched. If the president wants a bargain with North Korea no matter the strategic cost, let him have a handshake in the DMZ. If the president wants to leave NAFTA, you come up with a way to keep the deal but tweak it and rename it.
And if all else fails — well, sometimes you’ll write up the alligator requisition orders and steal them off his desk.
The two biggest disasters in Trump’s presidency have both been cases where these guardrails collapsed, and the president actually got his way in full. He actually fired James Comey, setting in motion the probe whose workings dominated his first term, and his Homeland Security apparatus actually separated thousands of migrant children from their families, creating the biggest moral scandal of his presidency.
But in other cases, he has been protected by the “don’t-give-him-the-alligator” operations all around him. Indeed, the ultimate fizzle of the Mueller report was possible because that report ended up documenting a president whose staff let him rant about obstructing justice, but then — in Mueller’s own words — mostly “declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”
With the Ukraine scandal, though, this protection has broken down again. (Not least because in Rudy Giuliani, Trump found an adviser even more enthusiastic about alligators than his boss.) The quest to get Ukraine’s government to reopen an investigation that would touch the Biden family wasn’t just a wish that Trump expressed; it was a policy objective that, however reluctantly and haphazardly, the U.S. government seems to have pursued. Trump’s now-publicized conversation with the Ukrainian prime minister was itself an act of foreign policy, not just a spitballing conversation, and, whatever its intentions, so was the delay of military aid. We can’t see the full body of the alligator, but you can see it moving in the water; it’s right there.
Now clearly people around Trump still believed that they weren’t going all the way to Alligatortown with Rudy, and maybe when we see the full shape of things, it will be clear that the president’s men did actually prevent the most explicitly Biden-focused quid pro quo from taking shape. In which case there will be defenses of Trump that say, in effect: Look, he wanted an alligator, and we let one thrash around in the water for a while, but we always kept it on a leash.
I expect that will be the defense offered, eventually, by pained Republican senators voting to acquit — that this was bad behavior but happily the president’s diplomats kept things from reaching the level of an impeachable offense.
The only difficulty will be that Trumpland will probably spend the next few months making a different argument: Actually, alligators are great.

Leonard Pitts: My, my, how the times have changed

Texto completo: You may, if you are old enough, recall a TV actor named Foster Brooks.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
He was a guest star on such classics of boomer kitsch as “The Monkees,” “The Munsters” and “The Mod Squad.” But if you do remember him, it’s likely for one thing only: his imitation of inebriation. Brooks made his slurring, stammering “funny drunk act” a TV staple, back when drunks were still considered, well … funny.
To recall his career is to marvel at what a difference a generation or two makes.
That era produced another TV trope that, in hindsight, seems equally bizarre: the funny sexual harasser. A hundred times, you saw it: the lecherous boss chasing the nubile secretary around the desk. A hundred times, it didn’t register as anything but a joke.
And again, the memory makes you marvel at how the times, they have changed.
In their new book, “She Said,” Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, The New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment story, remind us that early October contains three anniversaries, each a milestone of the progress we have — and have not — made in learning to take sexual assault seriously.
October 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases the now-infamous “Access Hollywood” video where presidential candidate Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. “And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” he says. “Grab them by the p—y. You can do anything.”
October 5, 2018: The Senate advances the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation that, as a drunken teenager, he attempted to rape a then-classmate, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Between those two dates — October 5, 2017 — The Times published its report on the film producer Weinstein and his alleged assaults on women in his professional circle, including the actor Ashley Judd. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra would also number themselves among the accusers.
The story opened a floodgate. By the time the wave of accusations crested, it had splashed dozens of famous men: Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mario Batali, Louis C.K., George H.W. Bush and Al Franken among them. Once-silent women found their voices under a hashtag — #MeToo.
“She Said” recounts the journalistic detective work that led to the breakthrough. It’s a compelling story that leaves one pleased to see the good guys — the good “gals,” really — get a win. But let us be clear on the limitations of that win. Indeed, the convergence of those anniversaries speaks eloquently to America’s ongoing irresolution on matters of sexual harassment and assault. Sure, Weinstein is facing charges, but Kavanaugh went to the Supreme Court, and Trump, to the White House.
Still, the story Twohey and Kantor broke changed gender politics. Predictably, there came a backlash, increasing numbers of male managers reportedly refusing to mentor female subordinates. That would seem to open them to civil sanctions. It will be fun to watch one of them try to defend his sexism in court, perhaps before a judge with lady parts.
Elsewhere, folks just want to know, where is the line? Is it allowed to tell a co-worker you find her attractive? Can you share — or laugh at — a bawdy joke? “So much was suddenly open to question,” write Kantor and Twohey.
And it is. And that is surely frustrating and difficult.
On the other hand, some of us remember when the boss chased the secretary while the laugh track howled. We thought nothing of it. Now people are wondering what’s acceptable?
Maybe that’s not the worst thing in the world.

Tokyo ticket packages 'running scarce'

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the Olympics? July 24 to Aug. 9. U.S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U.S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list.Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471.50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics? There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U.S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends flying into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U.S.
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10- to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay? Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling." Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o.d.o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, recommends a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo? Shibuya Crossing Who knew a crosswalk could double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails from early July to early September.
Animal cafes Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
Other notable sights Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do? Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Getting around The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances," Goldberg says. "It's just really expensive to take a taxi between distant regions."

Texto completo: When truth dissolves anything is possible.
The message of much of Kremlin propaganda is not to showcase Russia as a beacon of progress, but to prove that Western politics is just as rotten as President Vladimir Putin's. We may have corruption, the argument goes, but so does the West; our democracy is rigged, but so is theirs.
The latest scandal surrounding President Trump and his dealings with Ukraine is, for this reason, a godsend for the Kremlin: The son of an American presidential candidate is suspected of using his father's reputation to get himself a $ 50,000-a-month job at a Ukrainian gas company; the president of the United States is accused of acting like a geopolitical gangster, extorting kompromat about a political rival. American politics have become enmeshed in Russian and Ukrainian corruption, and much about the Trump administration seems pulled from the playbook of a post-Soviet kleptocracy. The Kremlin couldn't have put together a better script.
As I follow the news coming from America at my home in Britain, the political culture and language in the thing once known as "the West" reminds me of my years in Moscow, where I lived in the first decade of the 21st century. Perhaps in nothing more so than in its relationship to the truth.
The media manipulation of the early Putin years didn't try to convince you of a fabricated version of "truth." Instead, it worked by seeding doubt and confusion, evoking a world so full of endlessly intricate conspiracies that you, the little guy, had no chance to work out or change. Instead of conspiracy theories being used to merely buttress an ideology as under Communist rule, a conspiratorial worldview replaced ideology as a way to explain the world, encouraging the public to trust nothing and yearn for a strong leader to guide it through the murk -- a tactic that's as common in Washington these days as in Moscow.
Seeing all rules and norms as mere facades for a vast conspiracy also legitimizes getting around them to exercise unlimited corruption. The cynicism implicit in conspiratorial thinking frees you up to indulge in anything you want. Mr. Trump was, like many American businessmen, attracted to Russia in the 1990s and early 2000s, a time when rules -- both logical and financial -- were suspended. Throwing off the constraints of factuality goes together with throwing off political and legal norms, which for Mr. Trump means, among other things, turning his private lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, into a private diplomat.
There's a dark joy in being released from the constraints of legality and factuality, something Mr. Putin grasps well. When the Russian president went on international TV during the annexation of Crimea to smirk and say that there were no Russian soldiers on the peninsula, and that the soldiers the world could see were just locals who had bought Russian military uniforms, he wasn't so much lying as demonstrating that he doesn't care at all about facts and, by extension, the rules governing his behavior.
Mr. Trump, too, has doubled down since it was revealed he was exerting his own pressure on Ukraine. Despite all the protestations of State Department officials and Ukrainian journalists who painstakingly show that the accusations that Joe Biden helped fire a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son are specious, Mr. Trump and his allies have responded by repeating them. The president even suggested that Mr. Biden should be investigated for alleged corruption in China, too.
Mr. Giuliani has gone on cable news to spin an ever-greater web of insinuation, dropping in dark questions about whether Hillary Clinton's email server might be in Ukraine or why Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort was jailed because of evidence of his financial impropriety there. Watching clips of Mr. Giuliani, I am reminded of the catchphrase of Russia's most prominent current affairs TV host as he twirls from one conspiracy to another: "A coincidence? I don't think so."
This attitude is what makes Kremlin propaganda today different from its Soviet predecessor. The Soviets tried to make their lies sound factual. Even their disinformation in the West was meant to feel foolproof: For example, the 1980s campaign to show that the C.I.A. had invented AIDS was carefully curated through Soviet-controlled medical conferences. When President Ronald Reagan called out the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr. Gorbachev feigned horror at the idea that the Soviet Union would stoop to lies. Today, when the Kremlin pushes conspiracies claiming Americans invented Ebola or Zika, these stories are thrown online with no serious attempt to make them sound believable. Their aim as much to confuse as to convince. And there's no shame in being caught lying.
In my search for how and why the future arrived first in Russia, I've interviewed political strategists in Moscow and found their approaches anticipated what we have come to term "populism" in the West today. One spin doctor, Gleb Pavlovsky, who was a senior strategist in Mr. Putin's 2000 election victory, described how he was faced with a landscape where the ideologies of both communism and democratic capitalism had collapsed; the old social roles and political categories meant nothing. In order to win, he had to collect different interest groups, many of which resented one another, but which all felt they had lost out in the 1990s, and unite them around a vague feeling that they constituted a "majority" and "a people." Decades later, the Trump campaign likewise united different interest groups, which felt they had been "left behind," around vague feelings of grievance against "the establishment."
Mr. Putin skillfully managed to get rid of the old oligarchs by claiming he was cleaning up elite corruption -- only to replace it with his own corrupt elite. Mr. Trump and his supporters claim the president is draining the swamp, just as he replaces it with his cronies: Mr. Giuliani, his family, whatever allies and backers are willing to work with him in Washington or Kiev or wherever else.
Mr. Pavlovsky told me last year that the West is reaching a stage of post-ideological development similar to the one Russia reached decades earlier: "The Cold War split global civilization into two alternative forms, both of which promised people a better future," he said. "The Soviet Union undoubtedly lost. But then there appeared a strange Western utopia with no alternative, ruled over by economic technocrats who could do no wrong. Then that collapsed."
In Eastern Europe, communism once presented an ideology that claimed to be evidence-based and rational, guiding humanity toward a better future. In the West, the alternative was a vision of capitalism that would inevitably improve the world. Both have now collapsed.
But without an ideology that looks toward the future, there are no goals of progress. Instead of offering a coherent vision for the future, you peddle in nostalgia; you explain the world not through ideas but conspiracies. Instead of being a beacon of hope, you accuse everyone else of being just as corrupt as you are. We are all post-Soviet now.

Texto completo: Larisa Martinez and Joshua Bell were married Oct. 5 at their home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. David Brooks, a friend of the couple and a New York Times columnist based in Washington who is a Universal Life minister, officiated.
The bride, 32, a soprano, is a frequent recital partner of the Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. She has performed at the Hollywood Bowl, the Kennedy Center and Madison Square Garden. On Oct. 10, she is to make her Carnegie Hall solo debut in Mahler's "Symphony No. 2" with the Athens Philharmonic and the New York Choral Society. She studied vocal performance at the Music Conservatory of Puerto Rico, graduated with high honors from the University of Puerto Rico and received a master's degree in voice performance from Mannes the New School for Music.
She is the daughter of Luisa Torres of Toa Baja, P.R., and Dr. Daniel Martinez of Miami; and the stepdaughter of José J. Avilés.
The groom, 51, is the concert violinist and a Grammy Award-winning recording artist who has made more than 40 recordings. He is the music director of the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the London chamber ensemble. He graduated from Indiana University.
He is the son of Shirley Bell of Bloomington, Ind., and the late Alan P. Bell.
The couple are advocates for classical music education and are among musicians affiliated with Turnaround Arts at the Kennedy Center in Washington and Education Through Music in New York.
Ms. Martinez met Mr. Bell on Dec. 30, 2011, backstage at the Blue Note jazz club in New York after Chris Botti, the trumpet player, and their mutual friend, performed that evening as part of his annual holiday residency.
"I happened to pick the right night," Mr. Bell said. "I walked into the room and Larisa was sitting on the couch."
Ms. Martinez was in New York on vacation from Puerto Rico with her best friend, and even made time for a few voice lessons with a teacher at Mannes. She walked right up to Mr. Bell.
"I went to say hello because I knew who he was," Ms. Martinez said, and told him she had heard him play in San Juan. "He was down-to-earth and engaging," she said, and when asked, she told him she was a classical singer.
Mr. Bell found her engaging too, but reserved judgment on her singing. "Yeah, yeah O.K., everyone's a singer," he recalled thinking.
On New Year's Day they met for dinner at SushiSamba, a restaurant that was in the Gramercy Park area.
"We were nerding out," said Ms. Martinez, who had studied environmental science in college, and was in the middle of reading "The Fabric of the Cosmos" by the physicist Brian Greene. Mr. Greene is a friend of Mr. Bell (and to impress her, he later introduced her to him). "We talked about music. We talked about Brian Greene."
"We laughed a lot," she added. "He likes puns and jokes and wordplays. I was impressed with how his brain works."
Mr. Bell took note of the fact that the conversation never flagged. Her living in Puerto Rico was also never an issue.
"I felt like we started something," Mr. Bell said. "I travel so much, distance doesn't mean anything."
When she got back to Puerto Rico they spoke between his concerts, at least once a week. "It was a party every time he would call," she said. "We would laugh," and a month later when he played a concert in Florida, she flew out to meet him.
She also had some idea of what a relationship with him could be like. "I understood his lifestyle and art," she said, and six months later when she started studying at Mannes they were boyfriend and girlfriend.
But one thing still weighed on him. "Music is my life," he recalled thinking. "I worried about waiting to hear her sing. What if she's tone deaf?"
He soon got his answer when she sang a Mozart aria, a cappella, to him alone. "It was so beautiful," he said. "I was relieved, and way beyond. She sang like an angel."
"She's really got it all," he said. "We never run out of things to say. Sometimes when I suggest we watch 'Homeland,' she says 'How about we read some poetry and decipher it. We enjoy 'Homeland' too."
On their seven-year anniversary, Mr. Bell proposed to Ms. Martinez in Chris Botti's dressing room at the Blue Note.

Texto completo: What's on TV
MR. ROBOT 10 p.m. on USA. After tanking the world's economy, and then attempting to undo that hack with a bit of code, Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) has set his sights on taking down Whiterose, the shadowy leader of the Dark Army who has been manipulating him and his gang of vigilantes for her own gain. At the end of Season 3, "characters who thought they were smashing capitalism, winning back their family, bringing back their dead parent or fighting the good fight against cyberterrorism, learned that they were essentially pawns being pushed around a chessboard," Jeremy Egner wrote in his finale recap for The New York Times. Armed with that information, and a hunger for retribution, the hooded hacker will reunite with his other half, Mr. Robot, working in tandem to destroy "the top one percent of the top one percent."
THE WALKING DEAD 9 p.m. on AMC. Ten seasons into this survivalist thriller and there are still, somehow, more zombies to kill. Along with the undead, the show's remaining survivors will also have to look out for the Whisperers, a territorial tribe of humans led by a woman named Alpha. As if their whisper-only method of communication wasn't creepy enough, they also wear zombie skins over their bodies as a sort of camouflage.
WITCHES OF SALEM 10 p.m. on Travel. Through re-enactments and interviews with historians and authors, this four-part historical mini-series explores a particularly hysterical chapter of our nation's history -- the Salem witch trials. The docudrama follows transcripts from witnesses of the trials to re-examine the extreme beliefs that sparked a mass panic that gripped the Massachusetts village over an eight-month period in 1692. In each hourlong episode, actors play out the reports of demonic possession, mass arrests and public hangings that contributed to the death of 20 innocent men, women and children accused of witchcraft.
What's Streaming
PEAKY BLINDERS Stream on Netflix. Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy) and his smartly dressed, criminally enterprising family are back for a fifth season. This gangster crime drama picks up with Shelby, the crime lord-turned-member of British Parliament, reeling from the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street crash, attempting to fend off his many enemies and acclimating to his newfound political influence. This season opens with the British Labour MP and fascist Oswald Mosely (Sam Claflin) eager to start a hate-fueled political party and looking to Shelby for help.
IN THE TALL GRASS Stream on Netflix. Stephen King has created an impressive roster of terrifying villains over his decades-long writing career. But the sinister force at the center of this Netflix film (an adaptation of a novella King co-wrote with his son Joe Hill) is much more mundane -- some very tall and mysteriously inescapable grass. The story follows two siblings as they venture into a field in rural Kansas after hearing the cries of a young boy who seems trapped inside. But it's not long before the siblings realize they too have been trapped inside the bizarre herbaceous prison.

Texto completo: Donald Trump drags us down to Chinatown.
WASHINGTON -- Forget it, America. It's Chinatown.
Washington, once the guarantor of American values, is a crime scene. This capital of white marble is now encircled by yellow tape, rife with mendacity, cowardice and corruption. It's Chinatown on the Potomac.
Robert Towne, the screenwriter of the 1974 classic "Chinatown," wrote the movie as a eulogy to great things that were lost. He said that he was not conjuring a place on a map but a state of mind: the futility of good intentions.
Or, as Raymond Chandler, the premier chronicler of Los Angeles noir, once wrote: "We still have dreams, but we know now that most of them will come to nothing. And we also most fortunately know that it really doesn't matter."
"Chinatown" was set in 1937, right before the war. Like Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes, America was naïve about the forces of real corruption, real evil.
Towne wrote the movie in the early '70s, in the dark years of Vietnam, Watergate and Richard Nixon's doomed second term. Roman Polanski directed it a few years after his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was butchered by the Manson family.
In his latest fascinating dive into Hollywood, "The Big Goodbye," Sam Wasson dissects "Chinatown." "What makes Chinatown so uniquely disturbing as an American metaphor is that it is so unlike the whiteness of Ahab's whale or the greenness of Gatsby's light," he writes in the forthcoming book. "However illusory, these are totems of aspiration, of possibility."
He says that "Chinatown," by contrast, is black: It's about terrible truths you can't undo, about a cynical world where you can't beat the house and money wins, where you think you've got it figured out and then you realize you're dead.
Sound familiar?
The movie is a good metaphor for the Trump era, when you hope that this grotesquerie is an aberration but you worry that the bad guys have already won.
Even if Donald Trump is impeached, we know now that the Russians have figured out how to rig our elections -- and our dictator-loving president doesn't seem too disturbed about that.
What makes the metaphor so powerful is its unAmericanness. In democracy, we supposedly have the power. But in Chinatown, there's nothing you can do. Forget it, Jake. It's an oligarchy.
Is the impeachment inquiry the false hope, the cocky detective?
This was the week that made it glaringly clear that the president put his fragile ego, idiotic conspiracy theories and political prospects ahead of American national security interests. But watching Mike Pence and Marco Rubio and the red firewall of Republican lawmakers pervert principles to protect Donald Trump elicits dread that there will be more lawlessness.
As John Huston's Noah Cross says when Jake confronts him over his turpitude: "Most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place they are capable of ... anything."
In this desolate scenario, is Nancy Pelosi Jake?
Not really. The speaker is anything but naïve. She is well aware that Mitch McConnell -- an icy film noir villain if there ever was one -- will snuff out any threat that Trump will be ousted. (And don't forget, as the House demands documents from the vice president in the impeachment inquiry, if Trump and Pence have to go, we'll have our first Madam President.)
Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio predicted that being in the White House would distill Trump to his essence. And his essence, D'Antonio says, is a dark swirl of cruelty, violence and fear. That is on disturbing display in "Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration," the new book by Times reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.
"Privately," they wrote in an adaptation of the book in The Times, "the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That's not allowed either, they told him."
The sordid moment where we find ourselves is at once stunning and ineluctable: the House move to impeachment, Trump's lunatic denials about his blatant transgressions, and his even more lunatic bouts of self-incrimination.
Nothing good was going to happen when the spoiled attention addict was put in a position to demand the attention -- and favors -- of the whole world, or else.
As The Times's Maggie Haberman pointed out: "He has led a consequence-free life despite enormously self-destructive behaviors over time. The divorces were marriages he wanted out of. The bankruptcies impacted his lenders most, not him. All of his behavior in 2016 ended with him winning the presidency. And the Mueller obstruction inquiry ended with no definitive answer."
D'Antonio says Trump is "a man making his own nightmare come to pass. His performance with the Finnish president was a florid demonstration of his inner self. Enraged and irrational, he was incapable of hiding his contempt, which is ever-present, and heedless of his effect on others.
"Trump doesn't know that people who don't confront their demons are destined to be confronted by them."
And what is a better description of a film noir spiral than that?

Texto completo: BY TAMI ABDOLLAH
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Microsoft said Friday that hackers linked to the Iranian government targeted a U.S. presidential campaign, as well as government officials, media targets and prominent expatriate Iranians.
Overall, the hackers attempted to penetrate 241 accounts - four successfully - though none of those penetrated was associated with presidential campaigns or current or past U.S. officials, Microsoft said. A company spokeswoman declined to identify those targeted, citing customer privacy.
Reuters and The New York Times reported that the attack targeted President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, but this could not be independently confirmed. But a review of publicly available internet records by AP showed that the Trump campaign's official website is linked to Microsoft's email service.
Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, said there was "no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted."
Microsoft's announcement is the latest sign that foreign governments are looking for ways to potentially disrupt the 2020 presidential election. U.S. intelligence officials have sounded the alarm about the risks for months.
Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, as well as the subsequent leaks of emails during the 2016 election roiled the DNC, hurt the Clinton campaign and was a focal point in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.
Foreign hackers have long targeted U.S. government and politicians, generally with little notice. But the disruption caused by Russia's attack has heightened awareness and prompted fears that other nations will try to follow Russia's example. Iran in particular could have a stake in the outcome of the U.S. election after Trump withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear agreement up sanctions against the country.
"The Russians came after us and our election system in 2016 and they paid virtually no price for that activity," said Jamil N. Jaffer, director of the national security law and policy program at George Mason University, and former chief counsel of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "It's not surprising that China now more aggressively and maybe the Iranians are getting in that game. Why not?"
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was working with Microsoft to "assess and mitigate impacts." Chris Krebs, director of the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said much of the activity is likely "run-of-the-mill" foreign intelligence service work.
But, "Microsoft's claims that a presidential campaign was targeted is yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions," Krebs said.
In a blogpost released Friday, Microsoft's Tom Burt, corporate vice president for customer security and trust, said that owners of four accounts that were compromised by the hackers have been notified. The company would not identify those accounts.
The attacks by a group Microsoft calls Phosphorous occurred during a 30-day period between August and September.
Burt said the Iranian hackers used password reset and account recovery features to try to take over accounts. For example, they gathered phone numbers belonging to targets to help with a password reset. In other cases, they tried to get into secondary email accounts that might be linked to the Microsoft account to gain access via a verification email.
The hackers researched their targets, making more than 2,700 attempts to identify emails belonging to a specific Microsoft customer. A spokeswoman declined to provide more details.
The company has previously taken legal steps to combat Iran-linked hackers, suing them in federal court in Washington D.C., so Microsoft could take control of websites Phosphorous used to conduct hacking operations and to stop attacks.
The campaigns of Sen. Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet, Pete Buttigieg, and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock also said they had not been targeted. A campaign aide for Sen. Bernie Sanders said the campaign doesn't comment on matters of technical security.
Republican National Committee spokeswoman Blair Ellis said the RNC is "constantly working to stay ahead of emerging threats."
Meanwhile, the DNC sent an alert out to campaigns Friday, warning them about the Iran-linked hacking group's targeting of Microsoft accounts belonging to "journalists, politicians and at least one presidential campaign."
The DNC has taken several steps to improve the party's cybersecurity since 2016. The most public move was the hiring of Bob Lord, a veteran of Silicon Valley cybersecurity with stints at Yahoo, Twitter, AOL and Netscape, to serve as its cybersecurity chief.
Lord on Friday declined to provide details on the hacking efforts, deferring to Microsoft. He has worked to improve security protocols for DNC staff, state parties and campaigns with access to the central voter file that DNC maintains.
In July, Microsoft announced that it had detected more than 740 infiltration attempts by nation-state actors in the past year targeting U.S.-based political parties, campaigns and other democracy-focused organizations including think tanks and other nonprofits.
The company declined to name or further characterize the targets or the actors. It said at the time that such targeting had similarly occurred in the early stages of the 2016 and 2018 elections.
A memo prepared by DHS and the FBI was sent to state election officials this week outlining possible ways Russia could seek to interfere in the 2020 elections by discouraging voters or utilizing voter suppression tactics.
The document, which was dated Thursday and reviewed by The Associated Press, outlines a few possible scenarios for state and local election officials to be aware of. Those include the use of social media to exacerbate divisions within political parties during state primaries and the hacking of election websites to spread misinformation on voting processes or to alter voter registration data.

Texto completo: The state of California is home to some of the most infamous serial killers in U.S. history — from the Manson Family, to the Freeway Killers, all the way to the Grim Sleeper.
Well, another accused killer is now awaiting trial in California. This time it’s prolific Democratic donor and West Hollywood resident Ed Buck.
Buck was finally arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies and charged with operating a drug house, as well as providing methamphetamine to a 37 year-old man who suffered an overdose at Buck’s apartment.
This incident was the third known time a man suffered a meth overdose at Buck’s home. The previous two alleged victims, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, did not survive.
Days later, the feds announced that they too would be prosecuting Buck — this time on one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.
At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said investigators found 10 more victims, nine of whom said Buck, “administered drugs to them or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.”
The case is now generating national and international headlines; and I’m noticing that three false storylines seem to be emerging, and they need to be corrected.
First, The New York Times tried to minimize Buck’s power and influence by referring to him as “a small-time Democratic donor and political activist.”
That’s like calling Harvey Weinstein a “love-sick teenager.”
According to federal records, Buck has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and groups, and was classified by the California Secretary of State’s office as being a “major donor.”
Before he was nicknamed ‘Dr. Kevorkian’ by his West Hollywood neighbors, Buck could have easily gone by Ed ‘Big Bucks’ with all of the campaign cash he was throwing around.
Second, it has been reported in multiple publications that the politicians and political action committees who took contributions from Buck acted quickly to distance themselves from him.
Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

The Right Man for the Moment

Texto completo: A clinical and focused approach is called for in the face of Trump's theatrics and distraction.
President Trump and House Republicans are trying to cast the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Adam Schiff of California, as the lead villain in a partisan impeachment reality show. The president has road-tested some nicknames, called for Mr. Schiff's resignation and accused him of treason, and is now trying to spin out a new conspiracy theory, suggesting that Mr. Schiff "probably helped write" the whistle-blower complaint. House Republicans have indicated that they intend to force a vote to condemn Mr. Schiff when they return from recess.
But in all the ways that matter for this particular moment, Mr. Schiff seems to be coming off as the opposite of a slick political operator bent on betraying the country.
For starters, he was thrust into this role largely by happenstance. Jerry Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, has been pursuing an impeachment investigation for some time. But his efforts have largely fallen flat with both the public and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
News of a whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine changed all of that. The drama that ensued put Mr. Schiff in the driver's seat -- not because the call specifically addressed intelligence matters, but because the whistle-blower just happened to work in the intelligence community. A whistle-blower from the State Department with access to similar witnesses and facts could just as easily have submitted the complaint to a different committee.
Mr. Schiff is a stickler for process. When the whistle-blower approached him and his staff, they did precisely the right thing: They directed the whistle-blower to obtain legal counsel and file the complaint through the appropriate channels laid out in the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.
Mr. Schiff went public only after receiving a letter from the intelligence community inspector general indicating the acting director of national intelligence had not followed process requirements outlined in the law. The president can concoct all the conspiracy theories he wants, and Lindsey Graham and others may pick up the tune, but Mr. Schiff played it by the book.
Speaker Pelosi tagged Mr. Schiff as the lead on gathering facts on the Ukraine issue in anticipation of an impeachment vote. For now, Mr. Nadler has stepped into the background -- eventually, any articles of impeachment would go through his committee first. But Mr. Schiff is quarterbacking speedy efforts of his own staff and also two other committees, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform, that Ms. Pelosi has directed to assist in the effort.
Mr. Schiff is setting the tone and strategy of the inquiry, quickly setting up depositions of key witnesses and warning the administration that obstruction and delay could form the basis for a distinct article of impeachment similar to one approved by the Judiciary Committee against Richard Nixon in 1974.
In short, Mr. Schiff is the man of the moment -- and, without knowing it, he has been preparing for it for the past two years. As chairman, he followed Devin Nunes of California, whose handling of the committee's Russia investigation was specious and included cloak-and-dagger visits to the White House.
Mr. Schiff was vocal about his desire to tell the American people, in an open and public way, exactly what happened in the 2016 election. He also signaled he would seek to address wider issues, like the intersection of the president's foreign policies and the Trump family's global financial interests. Mr. Schiff has become the Democrats' go-to articulator of the importance of core American values like the rule of law, election integrity, respect for human rights and anti-corruption -- as well as broader foreign policy challenges like the rise of authoritarianism around the world.
But understand this: The role of the head of the House Intelligence Committee is not normally so high-profile. Traditionally, the chairman focuses on more mundane agency oversight topics -- and does so not in front of TV cameras but in closed-door settings.
There is also an element of personality and style. Before the 2016 election, Mr. Schiff was a well-respected but relatively obscure member of Congress. In a 2018 California Sunday Magazine profile, he was described this way: "Dressed in a crisp blue suit and sensible dress shoes, he cultivates a cheerfully beleaguered demeanor. He speaks without notes and tells jokes the way a dad would if that dad had access to highly classified intelligence."
He has been called solid, reasonable and mild-mannered. Sometimes too much so. Even awkward at times. Even now, his Democratic colleagues in the House view him as the prosecutor he once was -- not a political operator clawing his way to ever-greater heights of power. But for purposes of the investigation, clinical and focused is what is called for in the face of Mr. Trump's theatrics and distraction.
But Mr. Schiff has also shown that his patience has its limits and that he can be a very effective communicator. His characterization of President Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky as a "classic organized crime shakedown" is easy for people to understand. His lengthier, more impassioned remarks -- like his defense of his view that the Mueller report did not absolve the president of wrongdoing, after Mr. Trump and committee Republicans called for his resignation -- showed a backbone that left Republicans quieted.
Mr. Schiff's status as a credible, effective communicator who can speak to Americans in ways that ring true may be the most important contribution he can make over the next few weeks and months.
It is becoming clearer every hour that the impeachment inquiry is not over whether Mr. Trump pressed a foreign power to investigate a political rival. He admitted to that conduct, released the call memo and even doubled down on camera on Thursday, saying of the Ukrainians, "If they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens" and "China should start an investigation into the Bidens."
This is not a disagreement about facts or process. It is about whether what Mr. Trump is doing is improper and impeachable. The ultimate outcome of this process could depend on Democrats' ability to draw a straight line between the president's actions and the most profound concerns of the authors of the Constitution about the abuse of executive power.
This type of fight has always been Mr. Schiff's strong suit.

Texto completo: Is this Trump's public suicide or his genius for survival?
We all know President Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map, let alone find Finland, that happy country (the world's happiest, according to a United Nations agency) whose happiness Trump this week attributed to the following: "You got rid of Pelosi, and you got rid of shifty Schiff."
The Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, was staggered. He is not alone. We have hit uncharted political territory. An unstable president has lurched under the pressure of an impeachment inquiry into a form of madness that is either a very public suicide or some weird genius for survival. Trump is Robert De Niro, armed with a gun, in "Taxi Driver" gazing into the mirror repeating: "You talkin' to me?"
We are. Nixon wanted his profanities deleted from transcripts. Trump has no such qualms. He trumpets his view of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry on Twitter: "BULLSHIT." He will not be a one-term president! That's weak, like Carter, like Bush One! He cannot be WEAK like them! He cannot lose! It's all an attempted "coup"!
The White House, I hear, now operates like the 26th floor of Trump Tower during the campaign. There's no structure or plan. There's no war room or communications cell. People wander in and wander out, except they're all lawyered up now, no doubt. They're not even in crisis mode. Trump just goes out and shoots his mouth, as he has from Day 1. Like a good Mafia boss, he now has everyone complicit. They're all in this together -- Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and the rest. Since John Kelly escaped in January, Trump's henchmen are all that's left.
Thanks to a whistle-blower, Trump's attempts to get the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian-turned-politician, to investigate a rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, is now public knowledge. The United States gets this. Does it ever. This is not the double negatives and assorted convolutions of the Mueller report. This is President Pressures Foreign Leader to Find Dirt on His Political Opponent.
Houston, we have a problem! Polls show a plurality of Americans now supporting impeachment and Trump's approval rating sinking as low as 41 percent. He is vulnerable in several states he won in 2016, including Ohio. If he shrinks to his core unshakable support, he probably has no more than a third of the vote.
So what does he do? Double down! If there's any guiding principle it seems to be: If Trump says often enough in broad daylight that he tried to get foreign powers to interfere in our election to his benefit, how can it be wrong? "China should start an investigation into the Bidens," says Trump, as he leaves the White House to go to Florida.
The remark is met with justified outrage. This is abuse of power. This is abuse of foreign affairs authority. These are impeachable acts. But, guess what, everyone starts reporting and writing on what Biden and his son Hunter did or did not do in China. Trump is a mass-media magician. He got McLuhan -- "the medium is the message" -- without reading McLuhan.
The term self-impeachment is now doing the rounds. As with a self-immolation, it can be hard to watch Trump's blathering at its current crazed pitch. Can this be anything but the long-awaited and very public self-destruction of a man unfit for office? It may well be, but I am not entirely convinced.
As always with Trump, the rational and the Cartesian bump up against his fiendish antennae for the mass hypnosis of our age. He has his finger on the pulse of the technological character of evolution -- even though he knows nothing about it. Repeat something often enough, brazenly enough and aggressively enough to people dazed enough by the cacophony around them, and they will lose their bearings enough to believe anything, even that his conversation with Zelensky was "perfect."
There is no down range for this president. He's too disorganized. There is only the next minute. Let's talk Trump and golf for a minute. He likes to say, "I'm a feel player." He's not a believer in going to the driving range. Drop it and hit it. Fire and forget. Just hit the effing thing! Well, fire-and-forget got him to the White House, so why would he stop believing in it, even now?
Because, if Trump could manage a glimpse over the towering heights of his ego, he might see that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has him in her sights. She knows he will grow madder and madder under the pressure of the impeachment inquiry. As that happens, those working-class white women and suburban housewives who voted for Trump in large numbers in 2016 may well desert him: Derangement is not really their thing. Can the 53 Republicans of the Senate be far behind?
They are stubborn, those Republican senators. But watch one of them, Joni Ernst, being grilled at an Iowa town hall meeting recently and you start to believe that enough might defect for conviction of Trump in the Senate to be just possible. "Where is the line?" asks Amy Haskins of Manning, Iowa. "You still stand there, silent, and your silence is supporting him."
To which Ernst offers only evasions. The line, through all the madness, may be right here.

Texto completo: Readers react to the president's overture to China to investigate the Bidens and a so-called perfect phone call with Ukraine's leader.
To the Editor:
Re "In a Brash Public Move, Trump Asks the Chinese to Examine the Bidens" (front page, Oct. 4):
Even if the Trumped-up allegations about the Bidens turned out to be accurate -- and there hasn't been the least bit of evidence to support the claim -- the fact remains that, as president, Donald Trump violated the law by asking a foreign power (Ukraine) to dig up dirt on a political rival for his own personal gain, while he held back vital military aid to Ukraine, which had been appropriated by Congress.
And now he's compounding his lawlessness by publicly making a similar request of China.
Something new and ugly every day.
Joel H. Cohen
Staten Island
To the Editor:
Donald Trump once proclaimed that he could "stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters." He is now testing this with his open admission of influence-peddling in Ukraine.
This might be the final test of what democracy means to the American people if the president of the United States can do whatever he pleases despite the Constitution.
Kenneth Satir
Longboat Key, Fla.
To the Editor:
Many articles cite President Trump's description of his phone call with Ukraine's leader as being "perfect." Does anyone even know what that means?
I know what a "perfect" math exam paper looks like. A gymnastics judge can tell me the elements a routine must have to rate a "perfect" 10. Phone calls are different and are typically classified as pleasant, usual, productive, depressing and so on.
What must be accomplished for one of the people on the phone call to deem it "perfect"? It would take more than simply not committing treason.
For example, I might call a conversation "perfect" if I could persuade my children to behave in a way I would like without their realizing that it was my idea. Perhaps Mr. Trump felt that he was able to convey something nefarious without using specific words that would incriminate him.
If he had actually been able to accomplish that feat, we might agree that an argument for "perfection" could be made.
Harold Sackrowitz
Highland Park, N.J.
To the Editor:
Re "Facts vs. Baseless Claims About a Biden and China" (news article, Oct. 4):
What we do know about Hunter Biden's business in China is that without the name Biden he would be "a beggar at the door" in international financial circles, and so would various Trump family members who profit from the Trump presidency.
That "everybody does it" does not excuse such political profiteering or make it less unseemly. To avoid the appearance of quid pro quo, there should be strict laws enforcing the emoluments clause against politicians and their relatives while they hold office.

A better kind of pay to play

Texto completo: The National Collegiate Athletic Association has had many chances over many years to reform its exploitative rules. It has instead remained content to funnel millions of dollars a year to universities, coaches, athletic directors, broadcasters, sports-apparel companies and, naturally, NCAA executives -- while leaving student athletes out in the cold.
It's commendable, then, that California has taken matters into its own hands in an effort to get fairer treatment for students. We worry that its solution doesn't address the root of the problem -- that college should be more about learning than making money -- but it's a good start toward change.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, this week signed into law a measure to allow college athletes to earn money from endorsements. "Every single student in the university can market their name, image and likeness," he said. "The only group that can't are athletes. Why is that?"
The Fair Pay to Play Act, the first of its kind in the country, challenges long-standing rules that bar students on athletic scholarships from being paid beyond the value of their scholarship -- and the NCAA is apoplectic. In a letter to Newsom, NCAA's Board of Governors threatened to ban California athletes from its competitions, and it has suggested it might sue.
The law takes effect in 2023, so the NCAA has time to devise its own solution. Hoping to stave off California's legislation, it had convened a committee, but California officials were rightly skeptical.
"People said, 'You know what, we've got to force their hands,'" Newsom told the New York Times. "They only do the right thing when they're sued or they're forced to do the right thing." That the measure passed unanimously and has led other states to consider similar action should prod the NCAA to confront its hypocrisy.
Allowing student athletes to make money through endorsement deals, however, will help only a small number of college athletes in certain sports at certain schools in certain markets. Attention needs to be paid to the students recruited on sports scholarships who won't get endorsement deals, who won't go on to play professional sports and who find out the hard way that their four years on the field or in the gym have left them poorly prepared for life.

Texto completo: The latest book on Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a critical biography from two New York Times reporters that made new sexual assault charges that were immediately undermined, has suffered an epic sales crash, according to publishing insiders.
Expected to sell at least 10,000-12,000 in the first two weeks and propel The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation onto the newspaper’s bestseller hardcover list, it has sold about a third of that in the first two weeks.
A publishing source provided the latest BookScan numbers, which can account for about 80% of sales. That number is 3,120. “If you add in ebooks — they may have sold a total of 4,000. That's one of the most epic bombs in political publishing over the past decade,” said the source.
By comparison, another Kavanaugh book, Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court, which details the Democratic war on the Trump nominee, has sold 60,000 books and a total of 100,000 copies since its July 9 debut. It was written by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino and published by Regnery.
The book from Times staffers Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly was immediately panned by critics when a story excerpted in the paper failed to give all the details about another alleged sexual assault by the judge of a college student. Once provided, they undermined the charge.
For example, in the book but not in the initial Times coverage, friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the attack.
The pushback by conservatives and supporters of President Trump and Kavanaugh was harsh and hurt sales, said another publishing source who has handled several Washington-related nonfiction works.
Amazon on Friday ranked The Education of Brett Kavanaugh #6,795.

'More serious each day': Bob Woodward says impeachment 'almost certainly going to happen' to Trump

Texto completo: Veteran journalist Bob Woodward said he expects the House to impeach President Trump.
The famed Watergate sleuth made the prediction during a discussion Thursday with students from Whitworth University in Washington state hours after Woodward was booed by a D.C. crowd while interviewing two New York Times journalists who wrote a book about reporting on the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal.
He said Trump's behavior has not escalated to the level of President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal that led him to resign in the face of almost certain impeachment, according to the Spokesman-Review.
But, Woodward said, “It gets more serious each day," referring to Trump calling on Ukraine and China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival in the 2020 election, and his son Hunter.
“Impeachment, which of course is the charge from the House of Representatives, is almost certainly going to happen to Trump,” Woodward said. “But then there’s a trial in the Senate.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she supported a formal impeachment inquiry last week after Trump acknowledged he discussed Biden during a July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president that became the focus of an intelligence official's whistleblower complaint. Meanwhile Trump, who insists he said nothing wrong, is poised to send a letter to the California Democrat stating the White House doesn’t plan to comply with demands for documents related to an impeachment investigation because there was no official vote held on the House floor.
Woodward also said he is making progress on his follow-up to his 2018 book Fear about the Trump presidency.
“I’m working on a second book now, and I’m going through interviews with Trump, looking for one word that can be the title for the second book,” Woodward said after noting this is the same method for how he determined the title for his last book. “I think I’ve found it, but I’m not going to say.”

Bohls: Got a book in you? Austin's Otto Wheeler sure did

Texto completo: The thought occurred to Otto Wheeler. So he did just that.
Five years later, he finished it.
Because, after all, who doesn’t have a best-selling book in ’em? Isn’t it everyone’s dying wish to write the Great American novel?
There’s a freedom and an exhilaration in writing a book, and Otto Wheeler, 71, felt the same liberation and joy with a wonderful project endorsed by his wife, Suzy. What began as a fanciful whim turned into a full-fledged, 125-page manuscript called “The Greatest Game Ever Played (Maybe).”
For the half-dozen or so who have read the manuscript, it’s an entertaining read for the most part. Some might recommend he not quit his day job, had he already not abandoned his lifelong work as an Austin tax accountant two years ago, but that’s OK with him.
Wheeler doesn’t care. He can take criticism. He just had as much fun as the White Deer native in the Texas Panhandle has ever had.
This tall, silver-haired gentleman with the gold-rimmed glasses first conceived the idea years ago when the notion was borne of a chance meeting he had with former American-Statesman features writer Pam LeBlanc as they shared their love of bike-riding.
Wheeler told her he was considering writing a book.
“What’s keeping you?” LeBlanc asked.
“She kind of threw down the gauntlet,” Wheeler said.
So he began typing. Weekends. Evenings. Spare moments.
Occasionally, the project sat idle for a few months. But he always returned to it. One page led to another. By the time he was finished, he’d put 50,000 words on his Word document.
His fictitious story chronicles a current-day season pitting two junior college football powers in Mobile, Ala., and Houma, La., competing for the mythical Southern Athletic Conference championship.
Wheeler drew on his own experiences as a safety for his high school football team that reached the Class A quarterfinals his senior year, his torn knee ligaments suffered in August practice notwithstanding. Seven of his teammates went on to play college football for teams as diverse as Oklahoma and Abilene Christian.
But he went on the road for research, too.
He traveled to Memphis to check out the Liberty Bowl, the site of his title game. He spoke to broadcasting legend Bill Mercer, who has covered everything from wrestling to the Ice Bowl, about the ins and outs of announcing a game. He interviewed Ed Hochuli, the muscle-ripped referee who happened to be speaking to a convention of straight-laced CPAs and was more than happy to share insights on 17 years of NFL officiating. He spoke to former Longhorns quarterback Case McCoy, the hero in wins over Oklahoma and Texas A&M, for a lot of football terminology.
He traveled to Copperas Cove to check out an East Mississippi Community College game, the focus of the ESPN series “Last Chance U.” He scoured college rosters to come up with intriguing, real first names, long a fascination of his. Like Houma running back D’Quell Thibodeaux and defensive tackle Le’Veon Elmore, who spells his name “with the comma on top.”
Oddly enough, Wheeler considers himself one of the most unlikely people to take on the adventure of writing a book. Writing wasn’t the strong suit of this 1971 Texas Tech grad.
“I nearly flunked out of college because I couldn’t write,” he joked. “My first paper in English, I got a big red F. The next one was a D-minus. I eventually made a C, and that was the happiest C I ever made in my life.”
He later ran down that former English professor at San Angelo State to personally thank him.
“This has been one of the most fun things I’ve ever done in my life,” he said. “It was a hoot.”
The manuscript could use some editing here, some tightening there. Parts are way too formal, like boring descriptions of the duties of each official, and come off a bit stilted and dry. He can overdo some cornball phrasing. A little too much “like a fat boy on a see-saw.”
But there’s some really colorful writing and vivid phrasing and terrific character development. He goes overboard in his descriptions at times, but he brings his characters to life. He’s got an easy, readable style, but at times it reads more like a thesis than captivating fiction.
My absolute favorite was his chapter on side judge Trent Zurn, a Hochuli wannabe who meets a Southern belle wearing a LSU jersey in a Memphis honkytonk. It’s easily his best work, a free-wheeling style he should seek to copy in the rest of the book.
Some readers might be put off by his decision to write about every single play in his mythical game because, well, let’s admit, every play just isn’t that compelling. But there’s enough flavor with a streaker and trick plays and love interests to keep you turning the pages. Dan Jenkins would be proud of his effort.
We won’t spoil the ending here in case he eventually lands a publisher and winds up on The New York Times best-seller list. Who knows. He followed his dream, and he’s sent off for a copyright.
There’s even a second book he’s working out in his mind.
“Yeah, one about two lawyers at a firm who get divorced and ...”
Look out, John Grisham.

Texto completo: Speaking to reporters Thursday , President Trump said that China, along with Ukraine, should investigate the business dealings of former Vice President and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, R. Hunter Biden.
Here is what we know about the Biden family's dealings in China:
What are Hunter Biden's business interests in China?
Hunter Biden, a 49-year-old lawyer and the second son of the former vice president, owns 10% of a private-equity firm called Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co.
Over the past roughly six years, it has channeled $2.5 billion or more on behalf of its financial backers into automotive, energy, mining and technology deals, according to interviews with people familiar with the private-equity firm and a review by The Wall Street Journal of financial filings and other official business records.
Hunter Biden is one of nine directors of the firm, known as BHR Partners, which is controlled and funded primarily by large Chinese government-owned shareholders.
​What has President Trump said?
President Trump has alleged that Hunter Biden benefited from Chinese government largess and "walked out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund." Mr. Trump has also drawn attention to the fact that BHR Partners was officially registered 12 days after Hunter Biden in December 2013 flew to Beijing aboard Air Force Two, while his father made an official visit as vice president.
Mr. Trump hasn't provided evidence to support the $1.5 billion financial claim, which appears to be based on a fundraising target once announced by BHR Partners. The firm mainly invests by raising money deal to deal from other companies, according to a former employee, and its total paid-in capital is less than $5 million, according to its business registration.
​What does Hunter Biden say?
The board seat at BHR Partners isn't a paid position, and Mr. Biden hasn't recouped his original investment in the company, said his spokesman, George Mesires. The firm's business registration shows Mr. Biden's paid-in capital was about $425,000. Formation of the firm was negotiated for many months beforehand, and its shareholders applied to register the business in the month before the Air Force Two flight, according to the spokesman and the former employee, who described its official registration soon after the vice president's trip as a coincidence.
BHR Partners filings show that Mr. Biden has served as a director of the firm since it was founded but that he didn't become a shareholder until October 2017, after his father's term as vice president ended.
​What is BHR Partners?
BHR Partners calls itself a private-equity firm, and it acts on behalf of large financial backers to find companies to invest in, most of them in China.
Filings show BHR Partners winning a piece of several desirable transactions: a stake worth more than $900 million in a corporate spinoff of non-oil industry assets from China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.; a $10 million holding in China General Nuclear Power Corp., just before an initial public offering; and participation with a dozen other investment groups in a $4.4 billion privatization of a property business controlled by entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group. For a time, BHR Partners held a stake in Didi Chuxing Technology Co., China's dominant ride-hailing service, and has invested in a leading facial-recognition business, Megvii Technology Inc. BHR Partners has also launched a number of investment funds.
Investors in some of these transactions stood to score quick profits, while the firm hasn't yet made a profitable exit from others, the filings suggest.
In the U.S., BHR Partners participated in a $600 million buyout of Michigan automotive-suspension-systems maker Henniges Automotive in 2015, acquiring a 49% stake, but a banker involved in the deal said negotiations were handled primarily by Aviation Industry Corporation of China Ltd., a state-owned aircraft company that bought a 51% stake.
​Who are the primary investors in BHR Partners?
BHR Partners is 80%-controlled by Chinese entities, its business registration shows.
A consortium including the Chinese government's postal savings bank, its main development bank, a pension fund and the Bank of China controls 30%, while another 30% is held by a major mutual-fund group called Harvest Fund Management Co. Three other entities each own 10%, according to business filings.
Hunter Biden holds his 10% stake through a company he owns, Skaneateles LLC, named for his mother's hometown in upstate New York.
BHR Partners' chief executive is a Beijing investment banker named Jonathan Li, who explained his philosophy for a firm that could do deals in China and overseas on its website : "I wanted diversified ownership, including both Chinese and foreign partners, to make the firm more international," he said.
Executives at BHR Partners didn't respond to questions from the Journal.
What is Hunter Biden's role in the firm?​
It isn't clear what role Mr. Biden has played in the deal-making at BHR Partners. Details about how its transactions are structured aren't public.
Mr. Biden has had other ties in China, including with top executives of a now-collapsed Shanghai oil company, CEFC China Energy Co., as they were trying to break into the U.S. energy market, according to articles in the New Yorker and the New York Times. J. Michael Cole, a Taiwan-based analyst who has written critically about CEFC and wrangled with it legally, says its lawyers repeatedly described the Biden family as friends of the oil company.
What is the origin of the figure cited by Mr. Trump?​
The origin of the $1.5 billion figure cited by Mr. Trump about Hunter Biden's business in China is unclear, but the Journal in July 2014 quoted BHR Partners executives as saying the firm was trying to raise that much money to invest outside China. The plan, they said, aimed to take advantage of a new free-trade zone in Shanghai that Chinese authorities were promoting as a streamlined route to make acquisitions abroad for companies registered there, such as BHR Partners.
The Journal article was cited as the only source for the $1.5 billion figure when it appeared in a book published last year that is critical of Mr. Biden's business activities, and which has been praised by Mr. Trump. "Secret Empires," by Peter Schweizer, says that after Hunter Biden's flight to Beijing aboard Air Force Two, "Hunter's firm would seal a highly unusual $1.5 billion deal with funding from the Chinese government."
BHR Partners hasn't said if it met its fundraising target, but a former employee said it was never more than a long-term goal.
​Are Hunter Biden's business ties in China unusual?
When Mr. Biden acquired his foothold in the Chinese investment firm, U.S.-China relations were riding high, and money was flowing more easily than ever between the countries. China was just then embarking on a global buying spree, a trend that enthralled the financial industry, including the Americans who teamed up with BHR Partners, the former employee said.
China is also flush with private-equity firms that have adopted a famous-sounding name or tapped a politician's relative to hold a stake or join a board, which executives say reflects an effort to stand out in a crowded industry. The official name for BHR Partners in Chinese translates as "Bohai Sino-American."
"Perceptions count," says a Chinese private-equity investor who knows the principals at BHR Partners.

Chef's tastes: Simple, fine dining

Texto completo: Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is one of the most revered chefs in the world.
The Michelin-starred chef has fed Oprah, George Clooney and the Dalai Lama. His eponymous fine-dining restaurant in New York received four stars from The New York Times.
Born and trained in France, Vongerichten owns and operates 39 restaurants worldwide and has shared his work on programs like the "Good Morning America" and "Top Chef."
We caught up with the acclaimed chef as he prepped his latest restaurant Jean-Georges Philadelphia, which opens at Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia in August. Vongerichten dished on food trends and let us know what's fresh and what's past their expiration date.
Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.
Question: What's your favorite trend happening in food today?
Jean-Georges Vongerichten: When I came to New York in 1986, people were eating Chinese food on Sunday nights. I feel today, people eat Asian food two or three times a week because they're looking for new sensation, new flavors. ... palates have changed nowadays. They have more tolerance for spice, for acidity, for more flavor on the food.
Q: Are there any food trends you don't like?
Vongerichten: Molecular gastronomy. What I love is the last couple years, we went back to more basics, like simple food. I'm not too crazy about sous vide as well, because I feel like, if you live in a city like Philadelphia or New York, you don't need to put things in a bag or cook it in a bag. I like fire. I like live cooking. I think we're going back to that, to a more simple, more direct way of cooking. I feel we are going back in touch to more simple life and more simple things. Nobody needs chemicals in their food. I feel the molecular gastronomy was a little out of whack.
Q: What food will never go out of style?
Vongerichten: People are always going to eat Italian food. They're always going to have sushi. Is it creative sushi? Is it traditional sushi? I mean, it's still sushi. Same thing with Italian. But you know what's never going to go out of style? Good food. Delicious food. Some type of people are looking for weird combination, but, in the end, we're all going back to delicious.
Q: Your career in food and dining has taken you all over the world. Are there any food trends from other countries you wish were more popular in America?
Vongerichten: When I go to a new city I've never been to ... I drop my luggage in the hotel. I go straight to the market, and I see how people eat. I feel like all the markets in Asia are run by people cooking at the market. If you look at the food trucks and everything else, the only street food we had in New York for many years was hot dogs. Now we have all kinds ... I'm a big fan of street food.
Q: What's an older trend that isn't in style anymore but you think should be brought back?
Vongerichten: I feel like in the old days, everything was on a platter. Everything was cooked in a pot, and put the pot in the middle of a table, and people served themselves. I feel we're going back to that a little bit. I don't know if it's the "Game of Thrones" cooking, where you put the leg of lamb in the middle of the table and people slice their own. People want to see the real food. I feel like we're going back to bigger pieces, less plating, less touching the food.
Q: How important would you say presentation is to the overall dining experience?
Vongerichten: Oh, it's very important. I mean, everything has to be Instagramable. Is it a whole chicken on fire or is it something beautifully presented with edible flowers? I think today, visual is very important, as you know. Is it simple? Is it complicated? But the visual I think today where everyone is posting food, everybody is taking pictures of views of design, I think it's a way of communication today. Sometimes if I go to a restaurant, I go to Instagram to see what the food looks like before I actually make a reservation.
Q: How do you think people will be eating in the future?
Vongerichten:I believe that the future of food is really plant-based. I was saying that to all my chefs. We're still gonna eat steaks and fish and a lot of things, but I think, as a daily diet, we're probably gonna eat more plants and grains.
Q: Who are some celebrities or famous people you've served in your restaurants?
Vongerichten: Oh my God, I have a huge list, but I don't remember all the names. You know, George Clooney to Oprah. We cooked for the Dalai Lama once. Every day, we have people coming to our restaurants as well, but I feel like everybody is somebody. When you come to us, we treat you the same way.
Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten has 39 restaurants around the world, including two in Las Vegas.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'AMERICAN UTOPIA' at the Hudson Theater (previews start on Oct. 4; opens on Oct. 20). Heaven, David Byrne once sang, is a place where nothing happens. But Broadway is not. And it is hosting the latest theatrical experiment from Byrne ("Here Lies Love," "Joan of Arc: Into the Fire"). Byrne and 11 barefoot collaborators sing and discuss music and justice. Annie-B Parson does the choreography.
855-801-5876, americanutopiabroadway.com
'FOR COLORED GIRLS WHO HAVE CONSIDERED SUICIDE/WHEN THE RAINBOW IS ENUF' at the Public Theater (previews start on Oct. 8; opens on Oct. 22). Ntozake Shange's epoch-defining choreopoem, which premiered at the Public Theater in 1976, reappears this month. Okwui Okpokwasili and Adrienne C. Moore are among the actresses unpacking their lives and hearts. Leah C. Gardiner directs, with choreography by Camille A. Brown.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'GEORGIA MERTCHING IS DEAD' at the Ensemble Studio Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 10). A road trip garnished with ambivalence and pie, Catya McMullen's new play follows three young women (Layla Khoshnoudi, Diana Oh and Claire Siebers), one of them heavily pregnant, driving toward their shared past. Giovanna Sardelli directs this dark comedy about sex, road food and mourning.
ensemblestudiotheatre.org
'HEROES OF THE FOURTH TURNING' at Playwrights Horizons (in previews; opens on Oct. 7). Will Arbery's play, about Christian conservatives, takes its title from a sociological theory that tracks how America moves through crisis, recovery, awakening, unraveling and back to crisis. In a Wyoming backyard, four young adults and a college president have some crises of their own. Danya Taymor directs.
212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org
'LINDA VISTA' at the Hayes Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 10). A midlife crisis comes to Broadway, courtesy of Steppenwolf and Second Stage. Ian Barford stars in Tracy Letts's play about a recently divorced man with a talent for disappointing the women in his life and himself, too. Dexter Bullard directs a cast that includes Caroline Neff, Chantal Thuy and Cora Vander Broek.
2st.com
'MACBETH' at Classic Stage Company (previews start on Oct. 10; opens on Oct. 27). Scholars have argued that Macbeth and his lady have one of the better marriages in Shakespeare's canon, for a while anyway. Can Corey Stoll and Nadia Bowers survive it? The married actors star in John Doyle's revival of the supernatural tragedy, with Erik Lochtefeld and Mary Beth Peil.
866-811-4111, classicstage.org
[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'NOTES ON MY MOTHER'S DECLINE' at Next Door at NYTW (previews start on Oct. 6; opens on Oct. 13). A new dad cares for his old mom in Andy Bragen's semi-autobiographical piece, directed by Knud Adams. (Since Bragen's "This Is My Office" explored his relationship with his father, a companion piece seems only fair.) Bragen has written that it is the most personal play he has ever written and the most difficult.
212-460-5475, nytw.org
'POWER STRIP' at the Claire Tow Theater (previews start on Oct. 5; opens on Oct. 21). A play that doesn't protect from surges, this drama by Sylvia Khoury, set in the recent past, centers on Yasmin (Dina Shihabi), a young woman, originally from Syria, in a Greek refugee camp fighting for autonomy and amperes. Tyne Rafaeli directs for LCT3, with Peter Ganim, Darius Homayoun and Ali Lopez-Sohaili.
212-239-6200, lct3.org
'SLAVE PLAY' at the Golden Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 6). Jeremy O. Harris's play about race, sex and the deep wounds of inherited drama, which was a sensation at New York Theater Workshop last winter, hurtles onto Broadway. When this production, directed by Robert O'Hara, opened Off Broadway in December, Jesse Green called it a "willfully provocative, gaudily transgressive and altogether staggering new play."
212-947-8844, slaveplaybroadway.com
'THE WRONG MAN' at the Robert W. Wilson MCC Theater Space (in previews; opens on Oct. 9). Wrong place, wrong time, wrong girl. Right notes? MCC Theater presents a new musical from the celebrated songwriter Ross Golan about Duran (Joshua Henry), a drifter convicted of a crime he didn't commit. Thomas Kail directs and Alex Lacamoire is the music supervisor, orchestrator and arranger.
212-727-7722, mcctheater.org
'VICTOR' at Axis Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 6). Edgar Oliver, the eerie raconteur and one-man Gothic novel, returns to Axis with a new work of solo storytelling. This piece, which is directed by Randy Sharp and includes original music by Paul Carbonara, charts Oliver's two-decade friendship with a homeless man, Victor Greco.
866-811-4111, axiscompany.org
Last Chance
'NOVENAS FOR A LOST HOSPITAL' at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater (closes on Oct. 13). Rattlestick's site-specific autopsy of St. Vincent's Hospital, shuttered in 2010, reaches its conclusion. The show, directed by Daniella Topol and starring a luminous Kathleen Chalfant, traverses 16 decades and several locations, which is perhaps too much. According to Jesse Green, "'Novenas' often feels like it's trying to find the quickest way to connect its points, instead of the richest way."
866-811-4111, rattlestick.org
'WIVES' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Oct. 6). Jaclyn Backhaus's comedy, about the subjugation of women in a patriarchal culture, ends its Off Broadway run. Though Ben Brantley noted that the time-jumping play, directed by Margot Bordelon, "ultimately careens off the rails in its revisionist enthusiasm," it is, he wrote, "a gleeful work of historical subversion."

Texto completo: And the winner is ... Vladimir Putin.
For some Europeans, the most embarrassing revelation of the now very public phone conversation between Donald Trump and Ukraine's president on July 25 was not the attempt by Mr. Trump to interfere in the judiciary system of a foreign country for his own political benefit. Nothing the American president does could surprise any longer.
What they found particularly disappointing, instead, was the servility with which his young counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, sought to ingratiate himself with Mr. Trump, pretending that he had won the Ukrainian presidency by imitating him, claiming to have appointed a new prosecutor general who would be "100 percent my person," and happily joining in the Euro-bashing that has become one of Mr. Trump's trademarks.
Masks were falling off. So this popular maverick comedian turned real-life politician after playing one in a TV series, this promising reformer that President Emmanuel Macron of France had hosted at the Élysée even before he was elected, was in fact another spineless, unprepared leader jumping into President Trump's every trap.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Macron have been wise enough not to comment on this pathetic turn of events. Privately, French diplomats insist that Paris still actively supports Mr. Zelensky -- even more so in light of the American meltdown. What is at stake in Ukraine for the European Union is far too important, and the risk of seeing Mr. Trump's dirty work derail laborious efforts to reform that post-Soviet country far too real.
The issue is bigger than Mr. Zelensky. After a popular uprising in 2014 forced a corrupt predecessor of Mr. Zelensky to flee to Russia, Ukraine and its 44 million citizens became the new frontier of democratic Europe. To prevent that from succeeding, President Vladimir Putin's Russia annexed Crimea and intervened in the Donbas region, across its border.
Contrary to Mr. Trump's claims, the European Union has been very active in Ukraine -- and far more generous than the United States -- in supporting reforms in its governance, economy and civil society. Since 2014, European institutions have mobilized more than 15 billion euros in grants and loans, on top of bilateral assistance from member states.
Brussels has signed an association agreement with Kiev that includes the most wide-ranging free trade agreement ever concluded by the union: If Ukraine manages to bring its legal norms and regulations in line, it could end up fully integrating its economy into the European single market. Thanks to a new visa-free system, set up in 2017, millions of Ukrainians have been able to travel and work in Europe, mostly in neighboring Poland, and send remittances back home. The European Union Advisory Mission maintains 300 people in Ukraine to help transform the Ukrainian civilian security sector.
But in the field of military aid, the United States is Ukraine's main partner. That is why withholding $ 391 million of such aid, as the Trump administration did this summer, can so effectively put pressure on Kiev. In the five-year-old war with Russia over Donbas, which has claimed 13,000 lives, American support has been crucial. Defense experts point out that when the Pentagon sent Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine two years ago, Russian tanks pulled back.
So when a new, untested 41-year-old president of Ukraine gets ready to take on Mr. Putin, the ruler for two decades of the big power next door, the last thing he needs is his main military aid provider withdrawing its backing.
Indeed, the Trump mess could not come at a worse time for President Zelensky. Four months into his term, a big question mark still hangs over the direction this fast-learning political novice will choose for his country. "He is from another planet," reckoned a European diplomat who has watched him closely.
Mr. Zelensky campaigned on a promise to bring peace, unify the country and fight corruption, and won by a landslide. Voters were desperate for change, which he embodied, but his political program was so vague that analysts were left guessing. The kind of president Mr. Zelensky would be, they concluded, would be determined by who in his entourage ended up having the upper hand.
The young, earnest reformers who have joined his government, supported by new members of Parliament? His childhood friends and former associates of his TV production company? Or the immovable oligarchs, and one billionaire in particular -- Ihor Kolomoisky, whose PrivatBank was nationalized three years ago after financial regulators found that $ 5.5 billion was missing from its accounts?
Who wins this competition is of interest not just to Ukrainian voters. Ukraine's European partners and the International Monetary Fund, which has set up a major credit line to help the country rebuild its economy, are also watching closely. An I.M.F. delegation visited Kiev in September but left without an agreement on a new cooperation program; its members seemed both impressed by the reformers' ambition and wary of Mr. Kolomoisky's ostentatious presence.
The oligarch returned from self-imposed exile as soon as Mr. Zelensky, his protégé, took office in May. He is now talking to the government about $ 2 billion in "compensation" for the loss of PrivatBank. For foreign experts, whether the government gives in will be a test of President Zelensky's political strength.
In France, President Macron, having bet on Mr. Zelensky as a potential game-changer and eager to reopen a wider dialogue with Moscow, has been encouraging Ukraine to try to give new impetus to stalled peace talks with Russia on Donbas. President Zelensky and President Putin have talked on the phone, which led to a much-awaited exchange of prisoners in early September and, lately, into some positive steps in the negotiation over the future status of Donbas.
Enter Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, a whistle-blower and Nancy Pelosi. Very much an American story -- except that Ukraine is unwillingly dragged into the mud. While Washington wallows in the impeachment procedure, the consequences could be devastating for its relationship with Kiev. The resignation of Kurt Volker, the State Department special envoy for Ukraine, whom Ukrainians considered their most solid defender in negotiations with Russia, is seen as a big loss, especially coming after Washington's recall of Marie Yovanovitch as the American ambassador in May.
President Zelensky, his image now tarnished, is left to mend fences with his European allies. President Macron will have to adjust to this new situation. Last but not least, as the anti-corruption activist Daria Kaleniuk recently lamented on the Ukrainian television channel Hromadske, "The U.S. push for good governance in Ukraine is seriously undermined. What America was selling to the world used to be the rule of law."
And the winner is ... Vladimir Putin. President Jimmy Carter's former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski in his 1997 book, "The Grand Chessboard," described newly independent Ukraine as "a geopolitical pivot, because its very existence as an independent country helps to transform Russia." He added: "Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire. However, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state."
The stakes are still that high. Whether President Trump is aware of it is anybody's guess.

Texto completo: Acclaimed investigative journalist Bob Woodward was booed by a crowd while interviewing two New York Times journalists who wrote a book about reporting on the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal.
The event happened Thursday in Washington, D.C., and was attended by a number of reporters. Some took to Twitter to describe how the audience reacted to Woodward’s questioning of the Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor. The event centered around the duo’s book, She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement.
Woodward, 76, reportedly kept interrupting the women during the public interview. He also tried to steer the conversation toward talking about sex, according to the Washington Post.
About 20 minutes into the interview, after Woodward continued to interrupt and ask for clarification on facts, one person shouted, “You’re interrupting her!”
Woodward at one point told Twohey and Kantor that they were dodging his question about motivations behind Weinstein’s abuse, prompting a number of those in attendance to yell, “Stop!”
Journalist Kara Swisher tweeted that Woodward was “blowing this interview.”
“Interruptive, not focused on the women who were victimized by Harvey Weinstein and weirdly obsessed with that creep, it’s a exercise in how not to interview. The crowd no like,” Swisher said.

Some people reportedly walked out of the event.

At one point, Woodward accused the two of dodging a question about the motivation behind Weinstein’s behavior.
“I’ll tell you what we know. It’s that this story is an X-ray into power, and how power works,” Kantor responded.
“It’s also about sex, isn’t it?” Woodward queried, but was met by derision from the audience, with many shouting, “No!”
Woodward addressed the event in an email afterward.
“As a longtime believer in the First Amendment, I am glad people got to express themselves. Jodi and Megan signed a copy of their book for me after the session, which I enjoyed very much, and said, 'Thank you for the fabulous questions.’ So there may be a difference of opinion,” he wrote.
Twohey and Kantor didn’t address the matter in an email after the event.
“We’re just starting our book tour, and we’re grateful to all the moderators — Bob Woodward, Katie Couric, America Ferrera and many others — who have agreed to join us onstage,” they wrote.
“We welcome all questions, from them and especially from the audience, because each one is an opportunity to relate the wrenching decisions that many of our sources had to make and grapple with MeToo as an example and test of social change in our time,” the two added.

Bipartisan report says Trump’s abuse has pushed federal science to a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: Washington • In a single month in 2017, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency blocked scientists from speaking at a climate change conference, its Interior Department forwarded a policy letter to U.S. Customs and Border Protection only after deleting concerns from biologists about a border wall’s effects on wildlife, and the FBI issued a crime report that omitted dozens of tables of data on homicides and arrests.
That October was fairly typical for the Trump administration, according to a new report out of New York University, led by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney, and Christine Todd Whitman, who led the EPA for George W. Bush.
Every president over the past two decades has, to some degree, undermined research and injected politics into science, the report said. But, it concluded, “Now, we are at a crisis point, with almost weekly violations of previously respected safeguards.” The report calls for stringent new standards to enshrine scientific independence.
The study, to be formally released Thursday, follows reports that President Donald Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, pressured the commerce secretary to rebuke weather forecasters who appeared to contradict the president after he erroneously claimed a recent hurricane could affect Alabama. This summer a State Department intelligence analyst resigned in protest after the White House tried to edit scientific testimony about climate change and then blocked it from being entered into the permanent Congressional Record. For months the White House debated a plan to publicly question the established scientific conclusions about the severity of climate change.
“While the threat to the independence of scientific data did not start with this administration, it has certainly accelerated of late,” said Whitman, a Republican who also served as New Jersey’s governor, in an emailed statement.
A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the report’s findings.
The report is the second in a series of studies issued by a democracy task force that was launched last year at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. Both Bharara and Whitman have been critical of Trump, but they emphasized that stronger laws against financial conflicts, political interference with law enforcement and the suppression of science were needed to curtail the impulses of any president from either party.
Under President George H.W. Bush, the report noted, the White House altered the scientific testimony of James E. Hansen, a NASA scientist, to make his conclusions about climate change appear less certain. The EPA under President Barack Obama made last-minute changes to a report to downplay the risks of an oil and gas extraction technique known as fracking on the nation’s water supply. In another instance the Obama administration issued a memo discouraging members of EPA’s scientific advisory boards from speaking publicly without agency approval.
But the report reserved special condemnation for the actions of the Trump administration, which has disbanded independent scientific review boards, altered reports that contradict the administration’s political views and relocated researchers whose conclusions were politically uncomfortable. For instance, the Agriculture Department decided in May to move some of its economists out of Washington after they presented research indicating that the agricultural benefits of Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut would flow largely to the nation’s richest farmers.
On Oct. 13, 2017, the Interior Department sent a supportive letter to border patrol officials considering Trump’s proposed wall along the southwestern frontier, but deleted concerns by scientists about the harm that a physical structure could cause the habitats of rare cats and other wildlife in the area, according to the report. A few days later the EPA barred three agency scientists from speaking at a conference in Rhode Island about the effects of climate change on Narragansett Bay. A week after that the FBI issued its annual report of crime data with 70% fewer data tables. The changes, according to a report at the time, did not go through the normal review process.
“Policies governing the health and welfare of the public and of our shared environment have to be based in credible, independent science,” Whitman said in emailed remarks. “For the public to lose faith in that process will call into question everything that has been done to make our drugs and food safe and our environment healthier.”
The authors maintain that, without action from Congress, future administrations of either party could further erode the independence of federal scientific data. Among the changes it recommended was legislation to require that all federal agencies that perform scientific research articulate clear standards for, and report on, how political officials interact with career scientists.
While that seems like a long shot in the current Congress, where even the definition of scientific integrity is in dispute, the authors said they are optimistic that rules governing scientific advisory bodies could earn bipartisan support. Legislation by Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y., to develop scientific integrity standards has 217 co-sponsors, but none are Republican.
“There’s truth and there’s science, and that shouldn’t be swayed by whether someone is a liberal or a conservative, a Democrat or a Republican,” Bharara said in an interview.

Texto completo: If the latest impeachment push continues to backfire, Democrats can thank their duplicitous House Intelligence chairman, Adam Schiff.
The New York Times reported this week that the "whistleblower" who set off the latest inquisition provided an "early warning" to Mr. Schiff's committee that he or she was filing a complaint over Donald Trump's July 25 call to Ukraine's president. The media is now at pains to stress that whistleblowers do sometimes reach out to Congress, that all "procedures" were followed, and that what really matters is the accusation that Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.
Actually, it matters a great deal that Mr. Schiff knew about this early and withheld it deliberately from both the public and his House colleagues. He used his advance information to lay the groundwork steadily for later exploitation of the issue. He went so far as to charge the White House with a coverup—of a complaint he already knew about. The timeline of this orchestrated campaign is another knock to the legitimacy of the so-called impeachment inquiry. If the public can't trust Mr. Schiff to be honest about the origins of his information, why should they trust his claim that the information itself is serious?
Mr. Schiff on Sept. 13, a Friday night, issued the explosive news that he had been alerted a few days earlier by the intelligence community's inspector general of an "urgent" yet unspecified whistleblower complaint. But the complaint is dated Aug. 12, and news reports now say the whistleblower interacted with Mr. Schiff's staff prior to then. So Mr. Schiff knew about the topic of the complaint for more than a month—while the public did not. It is now clear why the intelligence chairman in that month suddenly developed an interest in all things Ukrainian, and began aggressively previewing his impeachment mantra.
On Aug. 23, for instance, Mr. Schiff tweeted that Mr. Trump tried to "get dirt on a political opponent" via personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's interaction with the office of the Ukrainian president. On Aug. 28, the chairman tweeted his newfound concern that Mr. Trump was "withholding vital military aid to Ukraine." And on Sept. 9, Mr. Schiff suddenly announced his committee would launch a full-fledged investigation into whether Mr. Trump was trying to "pressure Ukraine to help the President's re-election campaign." All this was priming the public and the media for what was to come—the better to take full advantage of the whistleblower "news."
Yet even after news broke of the complaint, Mr. Schiff played dumb. On Sept. 17, he flatly (and falsely) stated on MSNBC: "We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower." Two days later, he thanked the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, without whom "we might not have even known there was a whistleblower complaint." Really? Mr. Schiff wanted to make it sound as if the Trump administration was muzzling the complainant, when in fact the process was working and Mr. Schiff knew all about it.
The chairman also actively kept his information secret from Republicans on his committee. GOP members confirm that Mr. Schiff had multiple opportunities to acknowledge his awareness of the coming complaint, but kept mum about his side's early involvement. That included even during the committee's closed-door Sept. 19 briefing with Mr. Atkinson.
The whistleblower's early communication with the committee also bears on the complaint's credibility. The Times story explains that the whistleblowing Central Intelligence Agency officer initially alerted the CIA's top lawyer to concerns. Yet before even waiting for this procedure to play out, the officer went to Mr. Schiff's staff. This act has to be measured in light of Mr. Atkinson's acknowledgment that the source demonstrated an "arguable political bias . . . in favor of a rival candidate." It has become urgent that Republicans demand more information about the whistleblower's history and motivations—questions that are central to any whistleblower complaint, but particularly one being used as a basis for impeachment.
If all this has a somewhat familiar feel of subterfuge and ambush, it should. The episode is redolent of the sneak attack on Brett Kavanaugh. An unknown person levels nasty allegations; a Democratic lawmaker (in that case, Sen. Dianne Feinstein) conceals the claim before springing it at an opportune moment; the media jumps on board to distort and inflame the story. Lost in the carnage are little things like fairness, standards and due process.
Mr. Schiff's staff is suggesting its interaction with the whistleblower was limited. Maybe, but given Mr. Schiff's recent deceptions, it's reasonable to ask more questions about how involved his committee was with the creation of this complaint. The Democratic claim that Mr. Trump's Ukraine call rose to the level of impeachment was always absurd. But Americans have even more reason to doubt the legitimacy of this push in light of Mr. Schiff's scheming exploitation of the whistleblower charge.

R.I.'s SAT scores are in. Here's who did the best.

LEADING OFF
Happy Thursday and welcome to Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Ocean State. I'm Dan McGowan and I prefer Pizza Hut over Domino's. Follow me on Twitter @DanMcGowan or send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
Barrington High School has won the bragging rights for best average SAT score among Rhode Island's public schools during the 2018-19 school year, narrowly edging out East Greenwich for the crown.
A school-by-school breakdown of SAT and PSAT scores released by the state Thursday shows the average Rhode Island student scored 957 (out of 1,600) on the math and English sections of the SAT, and 904 (out of 1,520) on the PSAT.
The high school exams don't typically get as much attention as tests given to students in grades three through eight, but Rhode Island is now among the states that are using the PSAT and SAT as the go-to standardized assessment for high school students. The tests are now administered in school, and are free of charge.
Here's a look of the top performers on each test.
SAT
Barrington High – 1,194
East Greenwich High – 1,191
Classical High – 1,144
North Kingstown High – 1,115
South Kingstown High – 1,097
PSAT
Barrington High – 1,083
Classical High – 1,049
East Greenwich High – 1,045
North Kingstown High – 1,030
Exeter-West Greenwich High – 1,014
When you dig a little deeper, the results offer mixed news for the state.
More than 50 percent of 11th graders are meeting or exceeding expectations in English based on their SAT scores, but only 31 percent are reading at grade level. Roughly 60 percent of PSAT takers are at grade level in English, while 31 percent are proficient in math.
There are still wide achievement gaps between students with disabilities and English learners compared to their peers, and low-income students continue to score far behind more affluent kids.
In a statement, Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green called on districts to create action plans to increase participation and improve outcomes in the future. She said she remains alarmed that too many students are graduating from high school without being ready for college or their careers.
“There is a disconnect, and I want to work with our partners across the state to set explicit goals to get our high school students where they need to be in order to be successful after graduation," she said.
Now all eyes shift to results for younger students on the Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System (RICAS) exam, which are expected to be released by the end of the month.

Movie-goers shouldn't wear costumes with 'Joker' in theaters

Texto completo: FOND DU LAC – As the origin story of a Batman villain hits the silver screen in the movie "Joker" Thursday, The Odyssey Fond du Lac Theatre 8 has told patrons to leave the costumes and face paint at home.
Owned by the Minneapolis-based Odyssey Entertainment Inc., the theater said in a statement on its Facebook page that while it does not comment on security protocols or operating procedures, neither employees or patrons will be allowed to dress up at theaters screening the film, as many costumes, particularly the Joker, involve face paint, which could not be taken off at the theater's request for "identification purposes," according to the statement.
"We believe in strongly having events which often involve great times with costumed characters, but we also have to balance that with the safety of our patrons and employees as well. We greatly appreciate your understanding," the post reads.
The company, which owns nine theaters under the names Odyssey and CineMagic throughout Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio and South Dakota, posted the statement on the Facebook pages of other locations as well.
"Joker" stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man who plays a clown by day and seeks to be a comedian, while feeling disconnected and mistreated by those around him in Gotham City. In response, "he slowly descends into madness" to become the Joker, according to the movie description.
The film has received much critical acclaim, garnering the top award at the Venice Film Festival and Oscar buzz for Phoenix. Currently, it has a certified-fresh rating of 76% on Rotten Tomatoes, which complies critics' reviews to give movies a score of "fresh" or "rotten."
Controversy surrounding the film stems from its human depiction of the Joker character, who retaliates against society with violence. Critics of the film say it calls to mind violent episodes in the United States history, such as the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado during a screening of the Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises," according to The New York Times. Families of that shooting wrote a letter to Warner Bros., stating their concerns over the film, according to Entertainment Weekly.
In response, the company issued a statement saying that the function of storytelling is "to provoke conversations around complex issues," and the film is not intended to encourage violence, according to CNBC.
"Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero," the statement reads.
In September, military officials issued a notice from Oklahoma's Fort Sills Army base of a potential threat to a movie theater somewhere in the United States based online chatter, however, Army officials say they have received no credible information, according to USA TODAY.
The post on Odyssey's Facebook page generated positive feedback, with comments saying it is a "good call" and lamenting "sad that it needs to come to this, but solid thing to do ... just in case."
The theater chain is not the only issuing such a policy for the film.
The Los Angeles-based Landmark Theaters, which has 56 theaters in its chain, will not be allowing employees or customers to wear masks, costumes or face-paint to the showings, according to Entertainment Weekly.
Since the Aurora, Colorado shooting during a screening of the Batman film, "The Dark Knight Rises," AMC Theaters out of Kansas has not allowed masks, face paint or weapons at any movies at its more than 650 theaters, according to CNBC.
On Monday, Marcus Theatres, which has 21 locations throughout the state including Ripon and Oshkosh, posted on social media that it will change its bag and package policy so bags no bigger than 12 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches will be allowed in. The movie was not cited in the post, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Other movie theater chains in Milwaukee, including the Neighborhood Theatre Group, also changed their policy.
Other theaters are also stepping up security, such as Texas' Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, which has 40 theaters, according to Entertainment Weekly. In New York City and Los Angeles, uniformed police officers will be at theaters playing the film on opening weekend, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
The film with not be shown at the Aurora theater where 12 people were killed and 70 injured in 2012, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
In an interview with the Associated Press, Co-writer and Director Todd Phillips said the film is meant to look at "comic book world of movies" and ask why they are celebrated and "what are the real-world implications of violence." He also hopes that it inspires conversation on violence and mental illness, according to the interview.
Screenings for the film begin at 4 p.m. Thursday at the Fond du Lac Theatre, and will continue into the weekend. The film is rated "R."

Springsteen is still telling stories – but now he's exploring new creative formats

Texto completo: Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
Now Springsteen, who turned 70 Monday, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' (I said) That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and the of the famed Columbia Records talent scout. .
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
There no official events planned to recognize Springsteen's 70th birthday, but"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, opens Sunday at the historical association in Freehold. Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," Springsteen said to applause at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today.
This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever.
In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter.
What to expect at Samin Nosrat's Mesa show It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it.
The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, called "What to Cook."
She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience.
On Saturday, Oct. 5, she'll join chef Mark Tarbell at Mesa Arts Center. Ahead of her Phoenix tour stop, we chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about, which I'm sure people in Arizona must think about all the time, is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.
How her new book will be different from 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat' But as far as the book, one of things I've seen is that people feel kind of stuck about deciding what to make.
Even really good home cooks create a menu for a dinner or a party page for page, word for word out of a magazine spread of recipes. Or because they saw such-and-such-thing on TV or Instagram. I started to think about how there's so much I can share with those people about how to make their lives easier by understanding what decisions to make about what they should be cooking.
I did my best with "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" to teach people how to translate how professional cooks think about how to cook. What I've realized is I haven't really that similar translation about how professional cooks decide what to cook.
I think people have a really romantic notion that chefs show up at work and are like 'today I feel like making this grand and wonderful creation' or something. And maybe some people do that. But the constraints of a real kitchen are what chiefly make a professional cook decide what to make. If I can teach that to home cooks I think it would make people's day-to-day cooking a lot easier.
So that's what I'm going to do with the book that I have not started writing yet. (laughs)

Did President Trump commit treason?

Texto completo: Let's say we had a president who did the following: Redistributed wealth by taxing the rich and giving to the poor. Boosted entitlements. Signed a law to strengthen workplace safety. Poured money into cleaning up the environment. Even helped finance National Public Radio. Liberals would be pleased, right?
We did have such a president. His name was Richard Nixon.
Of course, all this is largely forgotten today, overshadowed by Nixon's involvement in Watergate -- the scandal that drove him from the Oval Office in 1974, as House impeachment and possibly even Senate conviction were nipping at his heels.
Because of this mixed legacy, Nixon ranks as the 28th best president (or the 16th worst, depending on how you look at it) in a 2017 C-SPAN survey of historians. In 10 categories, he scores near the middle for most, though 10th for "International Relations." But in terms of "Moral Authority" he's near the bottom, ranked 42nd. Lying to the American people and covering up a Constitution-shredding crime will do that to a guy.
President Donald Trump will be included in the next survey, which is taken every time we have a new president. Where do you think he'll rank? For starters, let's compare his actions with all the Nixon accomplishments mentioned above.
Trump is the anti-Nixon. After lying through his teeth in 2017 about how "the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan," he gave them (and himself) a huge tax break.
Entitlements? He has reportedly told Senate Republicans that cutting Social Security and Medicare could be a second-term project. We got a preview of his plans to do just that in his 2020 budget blueprint. Funny, Trump likes to run his mouth on Twitter and at his rallies, but this is something he hasn't blabbed to his wide-eyed, believe-whatever-he-says base.
Strengthen workplace safety? "We want to protect our workers," Trump said in 2017. But that was another lie. His administration has rolled back worker protections, making already dangerous jobs like coal mining, working on oil rigs and in meat processing plants even more so. Overall, "they've done more things to hurt workers than they have to help them," AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said last month on Fox News Sunday.
Public health endangered
And cleaning up the environment? Nixon proposed a new Environmental Protection Agency in July 1970, and it began operations five months later. Trump has gutted it, and when he brags about all the regulations he has cut -- to the wild applause of his base -- what he's not telling them is that he is endangering the air they breathe and the water they drink. They applaud and then go home, apparently oblivious to the 85 (and counting) rules he has rolled back. Air pollution, water pollution, toxic substances, on and on and on.
There's more, but you get the point: Trump is worse than Nixon. And I haven't even gotten to the scandals. What Trump has done is far more damaging to our country. To me, it can be summed up from just one event: his infamous meeting in the Oval Office in May 2017 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
It was bad enough that Trump revealed highly classified information that, according to two unnamed officials cited in The New York Times, exposed an intelligence source in the Middle East. But we've since learned -- based on three sources obtained by The Washington Post -- that Trump told his Kremlin guests he didn't care that the Russians had interfered in our 2016 election.
'Aid and comfort' to an enemy
An enemy attacks us and our commander in chief doesn't care? If this is true then I will use, for the first time, a word that distresses me deeply: treason. This isn't just my view. Article 3, Section 3 of our beloved Constitution says: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."
The Russians attacked us. If the commander in chief who swore to defend us said it didn't bother him, this is "giving them aid and comfort." The Russians are surely gearing up for more mayhem in 2020, and what does Trump care? Treason.
Now we learn that Trump has leaned on foreign governments like Ukraine and Australia to dig up dirt that would help him politically. For all his dirty tricks, Richard Nixon never would have dreamed of doing that.
Trump is a man with no ethical compass or shred of decency. Worse than Nixon? Worse in every way. And worse than all the rest.

BUSINESS BEAT; Future of Boeing CEO tied to fate of 737 Max jetliner; Crucial tests loom for grounded plane as it tries to resume flight.

Texto completo: Boeing Co. is entering a crucial month for its grounded 737 Max jetliner and its chief executive.
Dennis Muilenburg's future is inextricably tied to that of the plane, which is nearing a key test with the Federal Aviation Administration amid a flying ban in its seventh month after two deadly crashes. If regulators approve the aircraft to return to the skies, Boeing's bestselling jet must still win acceptance from flight crews and the flying public.
For Muilenburg, there's no playbook for charting a comeback from one of the worst calamities in the history of the aerospace industry. But investors have been betting on Boeing's resurgence in recent weeks, and any fresh setback for the company's biggest source of profit would increase the murmurs for a leadership change.

"This is not about me, right? It's about our company and what we do for our customers," Muilenburg said in an interview when asked if he is the right person to lead Boeing through the crisis. "I will serve in this role with everything that I have as long as the board wants me serving in this role."
Muilenburg, an aerospace engineer by training and a Boeing lifer, has served as the plane maker's public face throughout the Max crisis. That's made him a target of critics who contend Boeing was too slow to fully explain the role its flight-control software played in the crashes that killed 346 people and prompted the global grounding in March.
The Max's design and safety face renewed scrutiny after the Seattle Times and New York Times published excerpts from a whistleblower complaint filed internally by a Boeing engineer who helped design the Max's flight controls. Boeing tumbled 2%, closing at $367.56 after the reports, amid a broad market sell-off.
In the document, later shared with U.S. Justice Department investigators, Curtis Ewbank said his managers and Michael Teal, the 737 Max's chief project engineer, repeatedly rejected adding a safety backstop on the basis of cost and impact on pilot training. The synthetic airspeed system, used on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, might have counteracted a sensor that malfunctioned in both crashes.
Muilenburg faces a grilling before the U.S. Congress on Oct. 30, a year and a day after a Lion Air jet plunged into the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia. An Ethiopian Airlines jet fell out of the sky less than five months later.
Inside Boeing, Muilenburg is carrying out a board-ordered revamp that gives directors an unfiltered view of concerns flagged by employees, while adding initiatives of his own to sharpen the focus on safety.
The overhaul is "a very clear note that the board is paying very, very close attention and monitoring things," said Jim Schrager, a professor of entrepreneurship and strategy at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.
"Dennis has, and has always had, the full, unequivocal and enthusiastic support of the Boeing board of directors," the company's lead outside director, David Calhoun, said in a statement.
Muilenburg has been "incredibly supportive" of the board's new Aerospace Safety Committee, said Edmund Giambastiani, a Boeing director who will lead the oversight panel. "Dennis has the board's confidence," he said in an interview Sept. 25.
Boeing has taken to heart the aerospace industry's tradition of studying tragedies for ways to make flying safer, Muilenburg said in the interview at Boeing's Chicago headquarters. But he reiterated Boeing's oft-repeated refrain that there was no breakdown in the design and testing of the software feature known as MCAS that was implicated in both tragedies.
A report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Boeing classified MCAS' risk of failure as "major," the second-lowest of four hazard assessments. In addition, the manufacturer failed to conduct simulator testing of failure modes, such as a broken angle-of-attack vane, that could confuse pilots with multiple alarms.
"While that accident investigation and all the work we've been doing has been deep and intensive, we haven't found anything there that I would characterize as a problem or issue we're trying to solve," Muilenburg said. "Rather, when we look across what we've learned from both accidents, we always identify areas where we can improve."
In addition to the board oversight panel, Boeing is establishing a new product and services safety organization, which will have sweeping responsibility including investigating concerns raised anonymously by employees.
The head of the new unit, Beth Pasztor, will report to the board's safety committee as well as to Boeing's chief engineer, Greg Hyslop. Muilenburg is also restructuring Boeing's engineering corps. They will now report to Hyslop instead of business-unit managers.
Boeing is tackling the final technical work to persuade U.S. regulators to lift the grounding. Although no date has been set, the company is discussing the timing of the crucial certification flight with U.S. officials, and Muilenburg says the process is in the "endgame." Boeing is working to clear the plane for service in the fourth quarter.
Regulatory approval would be followed by the logistical challenges of putting hundreds of airplanes back in the sky after months in storage -- and eventually nursing the Max's 600-company supply chain back to working at full speed.
Before the grounding, the 737 program generated about 35% of Boeing's operating profit and cash flow, and 30% of the plane maker's revenue, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.
"If you're Dennis, the program that matters absolutely the most to you beyond any other at the company is the 737," said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "You have to get that right."
Boeing shares have rallied over the last six weeks on the first signs of the Max's reentry into the commercial market. Since closing at $320.42 on Aug. 14, the stock had risen 17% through Tuesday.
But the profit Boeing is able to reap from the Max ultimately will hinge on the willingness of flight crews and travelers to set aside months of deep anxiety and bruising publicity surrounding a keystone of Boeing's future, said Schrager, the University of Chicago professor.
"The great unknown is how they fix this," he said, "and whether the 737 goes back into the world again as one of the safest airplanes ever made."

Texto completo: The process could be better, the judge said, but that was no reason to "dismantle a very fine admissions program."
In one of the most closely watched lawsuits concerning affirmative action and higher education, a federal judge on Tuesday ruled that Harvard could continue considering race in its admissions process in pursuit of a diverse class.
The plaintiffs, Students for Fair Admissions, made four claims: that Harvard had intentionally discriminated against Asian-Americans, used race as a predominant factor in admissions decisions, used racial balancing and considered the race of applicants without first exhausting race-neutral alternatives.
In her ruling, Judge Allison D. Burroughs detailed in a 130-page document why she believed the Harvard admissions process was not only fair, but committed to attracting applicants "who are exceptional across multiple dimensions."
An applicant's race was 'never viewed as a negative.'
The judge acknowledged that the Harvard admissions process was "not perfect," but that when the university considered race, it did so only to benefit applicants' chances -- as a "plus" factor -- not to hurt them.
Harvard admissions officers are allowed to take students' race directly into account only when assigning their "overall rating," at the end of the process, when race is one of several factors on the table. The magnitude of the plus factors that Harvard gives for race, the judge said, is modest, and never a "defining feature" of applications. On the whole, "race has no specified value in the admissions process and is never viewed as a negative attribute," the judge wrote.
The plaintiffs had argued that Harvard had given considerable weight to applicants' race, violating strict guidance by the Supreme Court.
In 2018, Harvard provided its admissions officers with more explicit guidelines on when and when not to use race in reviewing applications and during interviews.
There was no pattern in stereotyping Asian-Americans.
Asian-Americans have long been dogged by stereotypes that categorize them as "quiet," "hardworking," "bland" and "not exciting" -- stereotypes that the plaintiffs said appeared in Asian-American admissions files.
But the judge's ruling noted that the plaintiffs did not show that any applicant had been "referred to by these types of descriptors because of their race or that there was any sort of systemic reliance on racial stereotypes."
She also pointed out that African-American and Hispanic applicants had been described as "quiet," "shy" and "understated" by admissions officers.
The plaintiffs had argued that Asian-American applicants scored consistently lower than other races on their so-called personal ratings, a subjective measure that takes into account a student's background and character. The judge recognized that there was a disparity, but said that it was "small" and reflected neither intentional discrimination nor a process that failed to take unintended discrimination seriously.
'Sparse country' disparities did not sway the judge.
Students for Fair Admissions pointed out that in some of its search and recruitment efforts, Harvard lowered the required test scores for students from "sparse country" -- rural areas with historically low numbers of Harvard admits -- who identified as white, other or unidentified, but it did not lower the score for students from the same states who identified as Asian-American.
The judge dismissed the argument that this was proof the Asian-American population at Harvard was being intentionally suppressed. She pointed out that in more urban states where Asian-American and white students had similar backgrounds, Harvard had identified Asian-Americans for recruitment based on their lower ACT scores.
"Overall, the inconsistencies in the search criteria do not seem to be linked to efforts to advantage or disadvantage any particular racial group, and it was unclear from the testimony at trial whether these variations were accidental or intentional," she wrote.
'Race-neutral alternatives' are not sufficient.
The judge accepted Harvard's argument that it had adequately studied and exhausted race-neutral ways to maintain diversity on campus.
Some race-neutral alternatives, like admitting only students at the top of their classes, were simply unworkable, the judge said. To admit every applicant with a perfect grade-point average, Harvard would need to expand its class size by approximately 400 percent and then reject every applicant with an imperfect grade point average without regard to other factors, including extracurricular activities and life experiences.
The plaintiff had put forth other ideas, including considering socioeconomic background instead of race and eliminating strong admissions preferences for so-called A.L.D.C. students -- athletes, legacies (or children of alumni), those on the dean's and director's interest lists, and the children of faculty or staff.
The judge was skeptical that a socioeconomic approach would be truly race-neutral.
On A.L.D.C. students, the judge was somewhat deferential. Removing these preferences "would improve socioeconomic diversity," she wrote, but have limited impact on racial diversity and come at a steep cost to the university's athletics, donor relations and student life. Reasonable minds could differ on the importance of these things, she said, but the court "takes no position on these issues other than to note that these are topics best left to schools to figure out for themselves."
The admissions process at Harvard remains flawed.
While the judge found there was no intentional discrimination, the admissions process could likely be improved, she wrote.
Judge Burroughs made note of implicit bias a number of times in her decision, saying that it was conceivable that the unintentional biases of admissions officers -- and the guidance counselors and teachers who write recommendations -- could explain some of the statistical disparities between Asian-American students and other races.
But the likely effects of unintentional bias, while regrettable, were very slight, the judge said, and could not be totally eliminated in a process that requires judgments about individuals.
Harvard has made some changes since the plaintiff brought the lawsuit. The admissions procedures for the current freshman class explicitly directed officers that they "should not take an applicant's race or ethnicity into account in making any of the ratings other than the overall rating" and that for the overall rating the "consideration of race or ethnicity may be considered only as one factor among many."
The personal rating criteria has also been changed. Officers are instead asked to consider "qualities of character" such as "courage in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles," "leadership," "maturity," "genuineness, selflessness, humility," "resiliency," "judgment," "citizenship," and "spirit and camaraderie with peers."
"Harvard perhaps should have instituted an explicit written policy stating which ratings could take race into account before 2018, but that error has now been remedied," Judge Burroughs wrote. She also wrote that the process would likely benefit from implicit bias trainings for admissions officers.

Boeing Rejected Safety System For 737 Max Jet, Engineer Says

Texto completo: A senior Boeing engineer filed an internal ethics complaint this year saying that during the development of the 737 Max jet the company had rejected a safety system to minimize costs, equipment that he felt could have reduced risks that contributed to two fatal crashes.
Boeing has provided the complaint, which was reviewed by The New York Times, to the Department of Justice as part of a criminal investigation into the design of the Max, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry, who requested anonymity given the active legal matter. Federal investigators have questioned at least one former Boeing employee about the allegations, said another person with knowledge of the discussions, who similarly requested anonymity.
It is unclear what, if any, assessment investigators have made of the complaint.
The complaint, filed after the two crashes, builds on concerns about Boeing's corporate culture, as the company tries to repair its reputation and get the planes flying again.
Many current and former Boeing employees have privately discussed problems with the design and decision-making process on the 737 Max, outlining episodes when managers dismissed engineers' recommendations or put a priority on profits. The engineer who filed the ethics concerns this year, Curtis Ewbank, went a step further, lodging a formal complaint and calling out the chief executive for publicly misrepresenting the safety of the plane.
During the development of the 737 Max, Mr. Ewbank worked on the cockpit systems that pilots use to monitor and control the airplane. In his complaint to Boeing, he said managers had been urged to study a backup system for calculating the plane's airspeed. The system, known as synthetic airspeed, draws on several data sources to measure how fast a plane is moving.
Such equipment, Mr. Ewbank said, could detect when the angle-of-attack sensors, which measure the plane's position in the sky, were malfunctioning and prevent other systems from relying on that faulty information. A version of the system is used on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, a new plane model.
Mr. Ewbank did not respond to requests for comment.
In both crashes of the Max, an angle-of-attack sensor is believed to have failed, sending bad data to automated software designed to help prevent stalls. That software, known as MCAS, then activated erroneously, sending the planes into irrecoverable nose dives.
Mr. Ewbank noted in the complaint, "It is not possible to say for certain that any actual implementation of synthetic airspeed on the 737 Max would have prevented the accidents" in Ethiopia and Indonesia. But he said Boeing's actions on the issue pointed to a culture that emphasized profit, in some cases, at the expense of safety.
Throughout the development of the Max, Boeing tried to avoid adding components that could force airlines to train pilots in flight simulators, costing tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft. Significant changes to the Max could also have required the more onerous approval process for a new plane, rather than the streamlined certification for a derivative model.
According to Mr. Ewbank's complaint, Ray Craig, a chief test pilot of the 737, and other engineers wanted to study the possibility of adding the synthetic airspeed system to the Max. But a Boeing executive decided not to look into the matter because of its potential cost and effect on training requirements for pilots.
"I was willing to stand up for safety and quality, but was unable to actually have an effect in those areas," Mr. Ewbank said in the complaint. "Boeing management was more concerned with cost and schedule than safety or quality."
His account, and the description of the system's benefits on the 787 Dreamliner, were backed up by a former senior Boeing employee involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing Justice Department investigation. The former Boeing employee, who worked on the Max, confirmed that executives had discussed the system. The employee said they had determined that trying to install such new technology on the 737 Max, a plane based on a 1960s design, would be too complicated and risky for the project, which was on a tight schedule.
But the former Boeing employee said Mr. Ewbank's complaint overstated the importance of such a system and understated the complexity of adding it to the 737 Max. This employee said Boeing had installed the system only on the 787 Dreamliners, noting that it was unclear how or whether the Max could similarly calculate synthetic airspeed, because it has fewer sensors. The employee also did not recall Boeing executives citing the potential impact on pilot training when deciding not to study adding the system.
A company spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, said in a statement, "Boeing offers its employees a number of channels for raising concerns and complaints and has rigorous processes in place, both to ensure that such complaints receive thorough consideration and to protect the confidentiality of employees who make them."
Boeing's chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, said in a speech on Wednesday that "it is critical we take a step back to humbly look at our culture."
"We're taking action as a result of the accidents to reinforce our values of safety, quality and integrity because we know we can always do better," Mr. Muilenburg said at the Economic Club of New York.
Shares of Boeing fell 2 percent in trading on Wednesday.
Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, declined to comment on the complaint.
Mr. Ewbank worked as an engineer at Boeing from 2010 to 2015, and was generally well regarded by his colleagues, according to two people with knowledge of his work, who requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive internal inquiry. Mr. Ewbank's complaint said he had left the company in part because he had become concerned that it was not making safety its priority. He returned to Boeing in 2018, and is working on the development of a new 777.
Mr. Ewbank said he hadn't filed a complaint during the development of the Max because, in part, the "fear of retaliation is high."
He stepped forward this year, he explained in the complaint, because of the "ethical imperative of an engineer -- to protect the safety of the public."
"Boeing is not in a business where safety can be treated as a secondary concern," Mr. Ewbank wrote in the complaint. "But the current culture of expediency of design-to-market and cost cutting does not permit any other treatment by the work force tasked with making executive management's fever dreams a reality."

Texto completo: Rather than split the contenders into two groups, party officials will guarantee that the leading candidates have a chance to face off against one another.
It's official: Biggest. Debate. Ever.
The next Democratic presidential primary debate, on Oct. 15 in Westerville, Ohio, will feature a super-size lineup of a dozen candidates onstage at once, party officials said on Wednesday.
Never before have so many presidential candidates shared a single stage in a primary debate, according to political historians who keep track of such things.
Eleven Republicans appeared together in September 2015 at a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. And lineups of 10 candidates have been relatively common in recent campaign years.
But the 12-candidate milestone had yet to be reached, setting up a challenge for the event's moderators, the CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and the national editor of The New York Times, Marc Lacey.
[What question would you ask the Democratic candidates? Our debate moderator wants your suggestions. ]
The Ohio debate, on the campus of Otterbein University, will feature the 10 candidates who appeared at last month's matchup in Houston. In addition, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Tom Steyer, a billionaire and former hedge fund investor, qualified to appear, the party said.
Candidates had until 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday to meet the Democratic National Committee's requirements: amassing 130,000 individual donors and receiving 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls.
The number of hopefuls sharing the stage is on the rise, but the overall field has grown smaller. Earlier this year, 20 candidates qualified for Democratic debates in Miami and Detroit. The party split those events into two nights, so that a maximum of 10 candidates appeared together.
This time around, Democratic officials opted for the jumbo format to ensure that viewers could see the party's top presidential contenders face off.
The 12-candidate format is likely to generate more than a few moments of cross talk and interruptions, particularly as lower-polling candidates seek a possible last opportunity to break out in front of a national audience.
But for party officials, the alternative formats carried drawbacks, too. One option -- dividing the candidates across two nights -- might have separated the leading candidates through a random drawing. Splitting the candidates by polling performance, as the Republican Party did for its initial round of 2015 debates, would likely have prompted criticism about unfair treatment.
The Oct. 15 debate will broadcast on CNN from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Excluding commercials, explanations of the rules and closing questions, it is expected to have a running time of less than two and a half hours.
Television audiences remain deeply invested in the 2020 race, judging from recent ratings. One of the Miami debates, hosted by NBC and Telemundo in June, drew 18.1 million viewers, a record viewership for a Democratic primary matchup. Last month's debate in Houston, broadcast by ABC News and Univision, surpassed 14 million viewers, the second-highest audience on record.
The candidates appearing at this month's Democratic primary debate are:

-
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
- Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey
-
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
- Julián Castro, the former housing secretary
-
Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii
- Senator Kamala Harris of California

Texto completo: In his quest to rewrite the history of the 2016 election, President Trump's personal attorney has turned to an unusual source of information: Trump's imprisoned former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
Rudolph W. Giuliani in recent months has consulted several times with Manafort through the federal prisoner's lawyer in pursuit of information about a disputed ledger that would bolster his theory that the real story of 2016 is not Russian interference to elect Trump, but Ukrainian efforts to support Hillary Clinton.
The alliance, which Giuliani acknowledged in an interview this week with The Washington Post, stems from a shared interest in a narrative that undermines the rationale for the special counsel investigation. That inquiry led to Manafort's imprisonment on tax and financial fraud allegations related to his work in Kiev for the political party of former president Viktor Yanukovych.
Giuliani's effort is gaining traction on Capitol Hill. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, have announced their renewal of an inquiry into any coordination between Ukraine and Democratic Party officials.
Manafort, who is serving a 7 1/2 -year term in a federal prison in Pennsylvania, has continued to express support for Trump, and Trump has never ruled out giving him a pardon.
Trump's push on a July 25 call to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the matter, and also probe former vice president Joe Biden, triggered an impeachment inquiry in the House. Many of the accusations Giuliani has been making about Ukraine recycle those that Manafort's team first promulgated.
Giuliani joined Trump's legal team in April 2018 to help defend the president against special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe, and the former mayor said he launched his own investigation into Ukraine late last year, which led him to consult with Manafort. He said he has not spoken directly to Manafort in two years.
"It was that I believed there was a lot of evidence that the [Democratic National Committee] and the Clinton campaign had a close connection to Ukrainian officials," Giuliani said, noting that he was never advocating for a pardon of Manafort. "It was all about Trump. I don't think I could exonerate Manafort."
Manafort's lawyer, Kevin Downing, did not respond to a request for comment.
Giuliani said his consultation with Manafort centered on trying to ascertain the veracity of a secret black ledger obtained by Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which the New York Times revealed in an August 2016 story. The Times said the ledger recorded $12.7 million in cash payments from Yanukovych's political party to Manafort. The revelation led Manafort to resign from the campaign.
Giuliani's narrative recasts Ukrainian accusations in 2016 against Manafort and efforts by Democratic operatives to gather research on Manafort after he took a leading role in Trump's campaign as a conspiracy involving both Ukrainian and American officials to swing the election for Clinton.
As part of that, Giuliani has focused on a theory that Manafort's team was promoting as early as 2017: that the Ukrainian government separately interfered in the 2016 campaign on behalf of Clinton through the activities of a Ukrainian American contract worker for the DNC, Alexandra Chalupa.
Chalupa confirmed she worked part-time as an outreach worker for the DNC to Ukrainian Americans and others, and met with Ukrainian officials from the embassy in Washington during that time. She said she "sounded the alarm" on Manafort outside her duties for the DNC, and sought to circulate that information, because she said she was concerned about Manafort's ties to Yanukovych, who was backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. She said the Ukrainian Embassy stayed clear of U.S. election matters, even with regard to Manafort.
"The White House has been pushing this narrative to distract from Donald Trump's gross abuse of power in pressuring a foreign country to interfere in our elections," DNC press secretary Adrienne Watson said in a statement.
There were Ukrainian Americans and people in the Ukrainian anti-corruption movement who were motivated to "shine a light" on Manafort's activities in Ukraine during 2016, and some Ukrainian Americans were active on behalf of Clinton, said Jeffrey Mankoff, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, but he said those activities aren't equivalent to Russia's state-sponsored intervention, which included the release of stolen emails and an extensive online disinformation campaign.
"One theory has been documented with extensive detail in the Mueller Report," Mankoff said. "The other is something that Rudy Giuliani and people in his orbit have conjured up as a way to cast aspersions and confuse the story."
Giuliani said he needed to consult with Manafort through the latter's lawyer this spring to ask whether a black ledger ever existed.
"I said, 'Was there really a black book? If there wasn't, I really need to know. Please tell him I've got to know,'" Giuliani recalled asking Manafort's lawyer. "He came back and said there wasn't a black book."
Giuliani said he was interested in the matter to prove his theory that the ledger's release, which he has claimed was done in conjunction with U.S. officials, was part of a falsified pretext for U.S. authorities to reopen a case against Manafort.
The FBI, however, already had a case open against Manafort before the 2016 campaign, having interviewed him twice about his work in Ukraine in 2013 and 2014.
The special counsel's office did not introduce the "black ledger" at Manafort's trial in Virginia in August 2018, nor did Manafort's defense team mention the document during his trial on tax and financial fraud charges, or try to show that it had been forged.
After a jury convicted Manafort of eight felonies, the former Trump campaign chairman pleaded guilty in Washington to avoid a second trial. As part of his plea, Manafort acknowledged that he made more than $60 million in Ukraine, laundering more than $30 million of it through foreign companies and bank accounts to hide it from the IRS and cheating the government out of $15 million in taxes. He also agreed that he had lobbied in the United States on behalf of Ukrainian officials without registering and that he conspired to tamper with witnesses in his case.
Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian journalist, anti-corruption campaigner and former member of parliament, said the ledger "was obtained by an anonymous source in the burned-out ruins of the headquarters of Yanukovych's party." His involvement in the release of part of its contents at a news conference, he said, was motivated by a desire that Manafort be brought to justice for his activities in Ukraine.
"Giuliani's entire approach is built on disinformation and the manipulation of facts," Leshchenko said in an op-ed in The Post. "Giuliani has developed a conspiracy theory in which he depicts my revelations about Manafort as an intervention in the 2016 U.S. election in favor of the Democratic Party."
In a text conversation with Manafort from August 2017 released by prosecutors, Fox News host Sean Hannity mentions "Ukraine interference" as one of the issues he was highlighting to attack Mueller. On his show that year, Hannity repeatedly claimed Ukraine had intervened in the 2016 election by sharing information on Manafort with a DNC contractor. Manafort did not respond directly to those claims but frequently encouraged and praised Hannity throughout the summer.
The White House also promoted the allegation.
"If you're looking for an example of a campaign coordinating with a foreign country or a foreign source, look no further than the DNC, who actually coordinated opposition research with the Ukrainian Embassy," White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in July 2017.
Grassley and Johnson, writing this week in a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr, again mentioned the allegations as a matter they intend to investigate.
"Ukrainian efforts, abetted by a U.S. political party, to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored," the senators wrote. "Such allegations of corruption deserve due scrutiny, and the American people have a right to know when foreign forces attempt to undermine our democratic processes," the senators wrote in the letter.

Texto completo: President Trump accused House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of helping write the whistleblower report during a press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö.
Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Schiff since the whistleblower complaint became public, ramped up the attacks on Wednesday after it was reported that the CIA officer who filed the complaint went to a House Intelligence aide before filing it.
While taking questions from reporters, Trump was asked about that report.
'It's a scam': Trump accuses Schiff of helping to write whistleblower complaint
"I love that question. It shows that Schiff is a fraud. I love that question. Thank you, John," Trump began. "I think it's a scandal that he knew before."
"I think he probably helped write it, OK, that's what the word is. I give a lot of respect for The New York Times for putting it out. It just happened as I’m walking up here, they handed it to me, and I said to Mike, I said, 'Whoa, that is something. That is big stuff.' That's a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it, too. It’s a scam," he said. "It’s a scam. Just to finish on this, I appreciate it, I love that second question by the way. Should’ve asked it first. But let me just tell you, the whole thing is a scam."
Trump has repeatedly called for Schiff's resignation after he read a fake copy of the president's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's testimony in front of his committee last week. The president asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

Democrats Lost in Ukrainia; The impeachment case Trump was supposed to be 'understandable.' In two weeks, it has become incomprehensible.

Texto completo: As the Trump impeachment narrative descends into the familiar bog of incomprehensibility, some guidance: Do not confuse Ukraine with Ukrainia.
Ukraine is a real country. Ukrainia is an imaginary place created by the national Democratic Party and the Washington press corps.
It was probably inevitable that after 2½ years of the Trump presidency, the Democrats and the press would end up in Ukrainia. For years, they have accused Mr. Trump, with some justification, of creating his own reality. Last week, they decided to create their own.
This story began two weeks ago, on a Thursday, with reports of a whistleblower filing a complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general about Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, the real president of the real Ukraine. For about 48 hours, the issue was simple: Had Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter?
That Sunday, Mr. Trump said he did bring up Mr. Biden during a conversation about corruption. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she had approved a formal inquiry into Mr. Trump's impeachment. Then, in what became the working headline for everything else last week, "the dam broke."
If you live in Peoria, most likely you can't fully understand the meaning of "the dam broke." It's not that people in Peoria don't know what's going on. But like virtually everyone today, they get most of their news from screens—on cellphones, PCs or television. That isn't how Washington gets the news.
Besides the inevitable screens, people working in Washington still get their news as they did during the Watergate scandal—from the front pages of the print editions of national newspapers.
Those front pages were once the political world's official dam, releasing information into the world at a rate appropriate to the news of the day. Last week, that dam collapsed in an indiscriminate torrent.
The day after the White House released the text of Mr. Trump's conversation with Mr. Zelensky, the New York Times, under a banner headline—"Trump Asked for 'Favor' in Call, Memo Shows"—spread a reproduction of the transcript across the top half of the page, with six sections highlighted portentously in yellow marker. That day's Washington Post filled its first section with an astounding 19 separate "impeachment inquiry" stories, each more or less pegged to this single transcript.
On Friday, the Times returned with another banner headline: "Complaint Asserts a White House Cover-Up." Below that, again filling the top half of the page, is text from the unnamed whistleblower's semi-hearsay complaint and the inspector general's letter.
This is Ukrainia, the impeachment world inhabited by Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler and the rest of Washington—a world of newspaper melodrama, nonstop talking heads and hysterical social-media posts.
It's hard to recall the paint-by-numbers story line that presumably caused Nancy Pelosi to pull the trigger on impeachment—the notion that Mr. Trump's raising the investigation of a political opponent in a national-security conversation with a foreign leader was an abuse of presidential power and an impeachable offense.
At long last, the Democrats believed, they had a violative Trump act the public could understand, as opposed to what the New York Times described—with an utter absence of irony—as "months of murky messaging around a confusing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign."
It is barely a fortnight since this "understandable" impeachment charge emerged and already the story line is descending, again, into deep insider minutiae and ultimately something incomprehensible to the general public.
Adam Schiff—who admitted Wednesday that the sainted whistleblower touched base with the House Intelligence Committee days before unloading the complaint against Mr. Trump—is as always carpet-bombing the administration with subpoenas. He wants Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to testify. He wants to depose a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and various others in the U.S. diplomatic corps no one's ever heard of. George Papadopoulos must be in there somewhere.
Meanwhile, the real Ukrainians look like they don't want to pursue the matter further, and that includes Mr. Trump's predictable exhortation to investigate Joe Biden.
The Democrats will fall back on the media to keep the impeachment game going, which it will. For much of the media, its primary activity has become feeding a voracious internet, which means the most minimally relevant anti-Trump stories are reported in microscopic detail whose purpose is to hold on to eyeballs with a permanent and presumably addictive sense of dread.
Politicians like Nancy Pelosi used to be better at assessing the political importance of events, but their judgment is now being overwhelmed by the ideological frenzies of modern media, culminating in the past two wild weeks.
For more than two years, the Democrats have asked the American people to buy into a succession of Trump takedowns—Russian collusion, Mueller obstruction, tax abuse and Stormy Daniels. Now they expect voters to spend the next year living with them in Ukrainia. There has to be a limit, and this may be it.

Parker: The other victim of the Kavanaugh saga

Texto completo: She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn't recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn't what places Keyser on the heroes' roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser's erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn't remember the party, not that it didn't happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford's story isn't true and doesn't make sense, according to the book. Given their close friendship during their school days, isn't it likely that Ford would have told her about such an attack? And, had Keyser been at the alleged party, since she already had her drivers license and often gave Christine a ride, wouldn't she have taken her younger friend home?
According to the book, Ford's team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford's narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford's acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls' high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart." And, "I don't care, frankly, how f--ed up her life is."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys' school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn't come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser's "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I'm happy that she's focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser's credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN's "Reliable Sources," Kelly pointed to Keyser's "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that's heroic.
Kathleen Parker is a columnist for the Washington Post.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Democrats' investigation of corruption allegations against Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao are based on a "web of innuendo and baseless inferences" crafted by the media, the Transportation Department argues in a letter to Congress.
The letter comes in response to a probe launched more than two weeks ago by the House Oversight Committee seeking explanations for why Chao (inset) appeared in numerous broadcast interviews in China with the official department seal, talking up her family's shipping business and her father's book. Using official symbols for private interests is barred under federal law.
The committee also is demanding to know why Chao said on her financial disclosure statements in 2017 that she was essentially cashing out her shares in a company that does business with the department, but didn't until the middle of 2018 after news reports.
The committee listed 18 different categories of information it wanted, including unredacted copies of emails that were released in redacted form to media outlets.
In its letter to the committee, the department provided documents that mostly appear to be in the committee's custody already, such as Chao's financial disclosures. It promised further information, but also flatly denied any impropriety.
"The allegation that the secretary has used her official position to benefit her family's business is simply false," wrote Assistant Transportation Secretary Adam Sullivan in the letter sent Monday.
A senior Democratic committee aide told the News the response was not impressive.
"Unfortunately, the department provided only generic denials and mostly public documents, but it failed to produce the majority of documents the committee requested relating to these troubling ethics allegations," the aide said.
Various reports that include transcripts and photos of Chao with her father on Chinese television have pointed out that high-level connections are vital for winning business in China. According to a New York Times report, emails obtained from the State Department raised red flags over one proposed trip by Chao to China where her family members would attend official meetings.

All Roads Lead to Mueller

Texto completo: Watergate comparisons are in the air but a big difference is overlooked. Only a few days elapsed between news breaking of anonymous whistleblower allegations against Donald Trump (the actual report hadn't even been seen yet) and Nancy Pelosi's opening of an impeachment inquiry.
No Ben Bradlee. No weeks and months as the story developed to ponder and reflect on what it might mean. Luckily, media ranks today are overflowing with people who don't need to labor their minds over the matters that come before them. They instantly know the answer because Twitter tells them.
And yet, once again, their rush to judgment is getting ready to blow up in their faces.
Numerous press accounts claimed falsely, even with the evidence in hand, that Mr. Trump had asked for a "favor" from Ukraine's president in the form of "dirt" on Joe Biden. Yet the plain words of the available transcript show the "favor" he sought was cooperation with the Justice Department's perfectly proper investigation of the 2016 election.
Now come reports in the Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post that at the behest of Attorney General William Barr, the administration has reached out in similar fashion to other governments, including Italy's, Britain's and Australia's.
House Democrats, of course, are free to impeach over any charge that can win a majority, including a claim Mr. Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 election. But they didn't bargain on the Russia-collusion fiasco forcing its way into the drama they are trying to create. Even a daily email blast from the Trump-unfriendly Columbia Journalism Review acknowledges that the "Trump-Ukraine story, it's safe to say, is now about much more than Trump and Ukraine."
Democrats were going to face powerful counterarguments anyway: The U.S. media itself had raised questions about Mr. Biden; Mr. Trump had merely asked Ukraine to take up the allegations with the U.S. attorney general, which is a pretty good shield against Mr. Trump himself lapsing toward any illegalities.
But more important is the new outpouring of reporting that sets these questions in the broader context of a legitimate inquiry into the actions of U.S. intelligence agencies in the last presidential election. The implications are not small. Democrats may have to reconsider their selection of Adam Schiff as impeachment frontman because of his role in promoting the Russia-collusion canard. Questions will have to be asked about the motives of the whistleblower -- a CIA official who dropped his highly polished bomb on the eve of a Justice Department inspector general's report that will begin opening the lid on FBI and CIA actions during the 2016 campaign.
At least by the public, questions should also be asked about the mainstream media's conspicuous reluctance to look into Democratic and Obama administration behavior in the Russia-collusion matter. Why, it's almost like the press doesn't want the subject investigated, for fear of what might be learned about the press.
Three years ago, I had an epiphany watching the George Stephanopoulos show on ABC. Mr. Trump behaved badly (typically) when the family of a slain soldier appeared at the Democratic convention, but he never equated the dead soldier with a radical Islamic terrorist, as one of the ABC show's panelists said.
An unspoken decision seems to have been made that Mr. Trump has no reputation to injure; he is an illegitimate president, so the media is free to put words in his mouth. It happened with his Charlottesville comments. It happened with his infamous tweet that tried to say something a lot more complicated than just that four congresswomen of color should "go back" to their countries of ethnic origin.
And it continues. The magical ellipses have been rolled out again to make Mr. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president sound a lot less ambiguous and a lot more incriminating than it was.
The media's hopscotching from one impeachment cause to another, until they landed on one Mrs. Pelosi would endorse, is not likely at this late date to convince a broad spectrum of Americans. How fitting, though, that they hopscotched to one that serves Mr. Trump's own obsession with 2016. All roads lead back to Mueller, and the fact that Mr. Trump, surely one of the most controversial and sinning of presidents, may also be the most sinned against.
He is the paradox that keeps on giving. Illicit actions by FBI chief James Comey may have helped elect him. Joe Biden, said to be the opponent he fears most, is being taken out by friendly fire. Questions about 2016 that could have been aired years ago, if the mainstream media had played it straight, may soon crowd out the Democratic hopes of a 2020 campaign focused on his manifest deficiencies.
If liberals are looking for someone to blame, they might start with their own favorite news outlets, which owed it to them to keep their critique of Mr. Trump grounded in realities and even mention the occasional unwelcome truth once in a while.

LIKELY TO BACKFIRE IS THE BEST OPTION FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT?

Texto completo: Here's a take no one will like: I'm confident he did it. I'm confident it's impeachable. I'm just not so sure he should be impeached for it.
Let's start at the top. It's obvious to me that President Donald Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to launch a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden in order to tarnish the image of the Democrat best positioned to defeat him in 2020.
In the rough transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Mr. Trump says America has been very good to Ukraine, but he wants the relationship to be more "reciprocal." Mr. Zelenskiy agrees and asks for more anti-tank missiles to deter ongoing Russian military aggression. Mr. Trump responds by asking for a two-part "favor."
First, he asks Mr. Zelenskiy to look into the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers (a bat-guano-crazy request, but whatever). Then, Mr. Trump mentions "the other thing" he wants.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great," Mr. Trump says.
The context matters as much as the text. Mr. Trump had already blocked the transfer of congressionally approved military aid. Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had been hectoring the Ukrainians for months to go after Mr. Biden (and it remains his singular obsession even now). Mr. Giuliani even admitted it last May in an interview with The New York Times. He said he was lobbying the Ukrainians to investigate Mr. Biden because "that information will be very, very helpful to my client."
And that's why Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelenskiy to work with Mr. Giuliani.
There's more context as well. There were reportedly other calls in which Mr. Trump importuned the Ukrainians this way. Mr. Trump's explanation for why he froze the military aid to Ukraine in the first place keeps changing. On Sept. 21, he said he blocked it out of concern over Ukrainian corruption (the only corruption in the world he's passionate about, apparently). On Sept. 22, he said the real reason was that he wanted our allies to pony up even more money for the government he claimed was too corrupt for our aid in the first place.
Normally you'd think an inadvertent confession would settle things. But when Mr. Trump said of his call with Ukraine, "There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden," the assumption was that he misspoke.
We also learned Sept. 24 that the "whistleblower" alleges the White House took extraordinary measures to hide the transcript of the call, which, if true, suggests wiser heads understood that the conversation crossed a line.
Regardless, I think Mr. Trump did it. I think it's obvious he did it. I think as more facts come to light, it will become even more obvious he did it. I also think it's obvious that this is an impeachable offense.
However, that doesn't mean I'm persuaded he must be impeached over it.
Impeachment doesn't mean "removal from office." It's the political equivalent of a grand jury indictment, with the House fully empowered to impeach any action it deems impeachable. It's up to the Senate to decide whether a president should be removed.
The Federalist Papers are clear: Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. Illegal acts are surely impeachable, but not all impeachable acts are illegal.
Impeachment is ultimately a question of whether a president violated the public trust. But there's nothing in the Constitution that says a president must be impeached for violating the public trust.
It's a prudential question with good arguments on both sides. If I were Nancy Pelosi, I'd be even more torn than she's clearly been. In the modern era, we've never had the drama of an impeachment process in a president's first term or in the run-up to a re-election. We've never had a lot of things that we've had under Mr. Trump.
Absent new facts, the GOP-controlled Senate will not remove Mr. Trump. The president would claim "exoneration," and his behavior would become normalized for future presidents. So I'm not sure Democrats are right to pursue impeachment. I'm sure Republicans are wrong to pretend that what Mr. Trump did was totally fine.

Is Cory Booker's 'nice guy' brand what Democrats need to beat Trump?

Resumen: Democrats say they want a return to civility in politics. But can a civil person like Cory Booker win against Trump, one of the meanest guys in D.C.?

Texto completo: One question predominates among Democratic voters assessing which candidate to nominate as the Democratic standard-bearer for 2020: “Can they beat Donald Trump?”
One person who thus far has not been deemed up to the task by prospective voters is New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who has been languishing deep in the second tier of candidates in national polls. So dire was the situation that his campaign put out a memo a little over a week ago warning that if it didn’t raise $1. 7 million by Sept. 30, Booker would be forced to drop out of the race. His supporters rallied, and on Monday his campaign announced he had reached its target.
Is there a place for politeness?
Booker has been dogged by concerns that his message of love and togetherness might not be right for the times. The New York Times summed it up in a headline: “Is Cory Booker too nice? (And is that bad?)”
But Booker believes strongly that his approach is the winning way.
In a recent interview, Booker told me that “grace and decency is the way to beat Trump. You can't beat him using his tactics, fighting him on his turf. ” Put another way: Never wrestle with a pig. The pig likes it and you get dirty.
Bad news for Biden and Sanders: Democratic activists want youth and diversity
What we need is to have “a revival of civic grace, to have a more courageous empathy, to get back to understanding that we share a common cause and common purpose, and most certainly share a common destiny. ” He lamented that Americans are “falling into tribalism in this country where we hate each other so much. ”
On some level, we all know this is true. Yet to many Americans, this kind of talk sounds weak. This is because we have a real misunderstanding about what strength is in politics. There is “this sort of toxic masculinity that is this idea that to be strong, you have to be an ass,” Booker noted. “The antidote to this moment and time is not more Trumpiness. That's why I constantly remind people that love is not weak. Do not confuse strength with meanness. Do not confuse being tough with being cruel. In fact, they are opposites. ”
Still, grace for your political enemies feels unnatural, even wrong. It’s a posture that takes a lot of work to achieve. Booker himself admitted on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" in July that he sometimes feels like punching Trump. Many of us know that feeling, so Booker is in no way suggesting that anyone stop hating what Trump is doing to the country. He’s not suggesting we have to be perfect and never utter a bad word about Trump or his allies. He’s just outlining an approach to beating Trump that sounds counterintuitive in the era of clapbacks and cancel culture.
Kindness does not mean never scrutinizing
It also doesn’t mean that Booker can never criticize his Democratic opponents. When Booker pointed out after the last debate that some people were concerned former Vice President Joe Biden might fumble the ball if he became the nominee, many commentators said he was off brand. But that’s because our culture is confused about what grace looks like. Grace does not ask you to be a doormat or have no opinions or never criticize. Loving people does not require you to stay silent when you see something that merits being called out. Certainly, Booker’s concerns about Biden deserved to be heard and considered.
Dem debates don't match the moment: Time to get serious about beating Trump
When I presented Booker with the disturbing math I’ve heard from too many Democrats behind the scenes that it will take a white man to beat Trump, he replied, “This idea that we need a safe candidate that we may not all be excited about, but he's the safe choice, is so contrary to our self-interest. ” He added, “And by the way, you make a big mistake if during the campaign the person says something that's racially offensive. That steps in it. And that's why, as a lot of people have written after the last debate, please, Joe Biden, clarify what you were saying about black parents. Please give the guy a chance to clarify because what he said was offensive to black people. ”
This pointed criticism is certainly within bounds. A lack of grace involves much more than critiquing an opponent. It looks a lot more like the ad hominem attacks the president launches nearly daily against all who aren’t actively worshiping him. It looks like Trump’s relentless attempts to pit Americans against one another. Trump does this because he cannot survive in an ordered universe free of hatred and chaos, so he works overtime to create disorder. His best hope is that Democrats will sink into the mud with him so that voters will ultimately tune out in disgust, leaving only the most hardened partisans showing up to vote.
Cory Booker gets this. Whether he will break through with his message and vision remains to be seen. But he deserves a real hearing.

Kamala Harris is the new Kirsten Gillibrand

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris should take a note from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s 2020 playbook and put her primary campaign out of its misery.
It is over for the California lawmaker. This is not her moment. Voters are not interested. It is only a matter of time before reality forces Harris to end her candidacy, so she may as well do it while she can still bow out with some dignity.
The senator’s 2020 campaign, which has imploded in the polls, is making major changes to its senior staff, according to reports. That alone is a bad sign for the senator. What is worse is that the changes have also reportedly taken her senior aides by surprise, creating an additional layer of anxiety within an already struggling campaign.
In other words, it is a mess for Harris.
Her 2020 campaign is adding her Senate Chief of Staff Rohini Kosoglu and senior adviser Laphonza Butler to the mix. The two Senate staffers will assist in Harris’ 2020 bid on a permanent basis. The senator’s current campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, will stay right where he is, focusing on budgeting and long-term strategies while Kosoglu and Butler will take over whatever campaign duties remain.
The staff changes come amid Harris’ pitiful attempts to ingratiate herself to the Democratic base. In recent weeks, she has embraced ludicrous gimmicks, including calling on Twitter to suspend President Trump's account and calling also for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh based on a heavily amended and deeply flawed New York Times op-ed.
“We need to get to the truth about Kavanaugh. And I believe the best path to truth and accountability is through a formal impeachment process,” she said in an op-ed published last week by Elle. “That’s why I called on the House Judiciary Committee to open an impeachment inquiry and take a serious look at whether Kavanaugh lied under oath during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.”
Calling for an impeachment inquiry over a since-corrected and widely criticized op-ed is definitely a thing a serious candidate does. Yep. Yessir.
On a more serious note: Sudden staff changes and absurd fantasy fulfillment are not the things of winning primary campaigns. In fact, this is all extremely reminiscent of the Gillibrand 2020 candidacy, and you know how that ended. But you try telling that to Harris’ team.
For his own part, campaign manager Rodriguez assured reporters that the changes in campaign staff had been in the works for some time. Harris, for her part, downplayed concerns that her candidacy is running on fumes.
"I'm very proud of our team," the senator said this week in an interview with CNN. "We have accomplished a great amount of work thus far, which makes me a top-tier candidate, and by many accounts within the top four, maybe five, in a field of over 20 people. So something's been going right and we're going to continue moving ahead."
Harris’ polling average has plummeted from its high of 15.2% in early July, according to a RealClearPolitics, to 4.6%, just behind the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
Good luck in Iowa, senator.

Texto completo: London • A weakening world economy, President Donald Trump’s trade war with China and fears of a potentially tumultuous Brexit have combined to produce a dramatic slowdown in global commerce, the World Trade Organization said Tuesday.
The Geneva-based organization slashed its forecast for trade growth for this year and 2020, a troubling indicator as economists warn of continued weakness in the global economy.
World trade in merchandise is now expected to expand by only 1.2% during 2019, less than half the 2.6% pace of growth anticipated in April, the WTO said in a statement. World trade is forecast to expand 2.7% next year, below the 3% previously foreseen.
“Risks to the forecast are heavily weighted to the downside and dominated by trade policy,” the organization said.
The pronounced deterioration of trade reflects risks that have been building around the globe in recent months, diminishing fortunes in major economies.
“China has been slowing noticeably,” said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB Group, a global investment bank based in Stockholm. “India is slowing. The United States is slowing as well, and Europe in particular is slowing quite sharply. That’s the main reason behind the slowdown in world trade.”
But if the slowdown in trade is still largely an outgrowth of broader economic weakness, concerns are building that less trade could itself spur retrenchment going forward.
Germany has become a prominent source of concern in Europe as its factory orders plunge, a trend that deepened in September, according to a survey released Tuesday. German manufacturing troubles stem in part from the fact that Chinese companies facing tariffs on exports to the United States are shrinking their purchases of German-made machinery. German companies are also reluctant to invest amid perpetual uncertainty over Brexit.
As German companies produce and export less, some are cutting jobs. That is likely to dampen German consumer spending, contributing to weakness in other European economies like Spain and Italy.
These strains are only intensifying as Trump ratchets up his trade war with China. In April, when the WTO released its last forecast, sentiments were influenced by hopes that Washington and Beijing were nearing a deal to resolve their trade disputes. That now seems like a long time ago.
In September, Trump increased tariffs on $112 billion worth of Chinese imports, threatening American consumers with higher costs for shoes, apparel and electronics. As China slapped retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion of American imports, Trump threatened to extend tariffs to $550 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The president last month delayed by two weeks a planned increase in tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, briefly rekindling hopes for a deal. But many experts are skeptical that, with both sides dug in, an agreement will be struck.
The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies, collectively comprising 40% of the world’s annual output. As they are locked in conflict, every other trading nation is vulnerable to the effects.
Singapore’s economy is now contracting, and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have suffered diminished prospects as their exports to China slow.
“The policy uncertainty about the future and the real enforcement of trade restrictions is starting to be felt in other places,” said Meredith Crowley, an international trade expert at the University of Cambridge in England.
The WTO, which promotes global trade and adjudicates disputes, warned that intensifying trade conflicts pose a direct threat to jobs and livelihoods, while discouraging companies from expanding and innovating.
The organization issued its forecast on the assumption that global economic growth would register a disappointing pace of 2.3% this year and in 2020.
“Trade conflicts heighten uncertainty, which is leading some businesses to delay the productivity-enhancing investments that are essential to raising living standards,” the organization’s director-general, Roberto Azevêdo, said in a statement. “Job creation may also be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export.”
The organization singled out as an especially potent risk the threat that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a deal governing future trade.
Ever since Britain set Brexit in motion through a referendum in June 2016, Europe has faced uncertainty over the rules that will govern trade across the English Channel. With weeks to go before the deadline, the situation is especially bewildering.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the Europe Union on Oct. 31, regardless of whether he can secure a deal with authorities in Brussels, and despite widespread assumptions that a no-deal Brexit would entangle trade in bureaucratic and logistical chaos.
He has demanded a scrapping of a provision negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May, to prevent the reimposition of a hard border separating Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, from the independent Republic of Ireland to the south. The Europeans have held firm, while Johnson has proposed no formal alternative.
But the British Parliament, alarmed by the possibility of an unruly no-deal Brexit, last month adopted emergency legislation that would force Johnson to seek an extension of the deadline if he fails to strike a deal. Speculation persists that he might opt to ignore that directive, setting up a constitutional crisis. He is also dealing with allegations that, while he was mayor of London, he directed government funds to a woman with whom he was having an affair.
That an election will soon transpire is accepted as a given, but no one knows when.
None of this enhances the motivation of companies to invest in Britain. The British economy contracted between April and June. Across Europe, the spectacle of Britain at once getting poorer and stuck in the Brexit quagmire is not good for business.
“The British situation is much more uncertain today,” said Crowley, the Cambridge trade expert. “That is feeding into the weakness of trade growth for other European countries.”

Texto completo: Last year was very good for Sara Bareilles. She co-hosted the Tony Awards and was nominated for an Emmy and a Grammy for her role as Mary Magdalene in NBC’s “Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert.” The Songwriters Hall of Fame also honored her with the Hal David Starlight Award, acknowledging her talents as a gifted songwriter.
This year those good vibes are continuing. Bareilles recently celebrated her three-year anniversary with her boyfriend, actor Joe Tippett. Meanwhile, she’s crisscrossing the country on her “Amidst the Chaos Tour.” Bareilles, 39, will be at Mohegan Sun Arena on Saturday, Oct. 12, with special guest Emily King. The tour is in support of her critically-acclaimed new album of the same name.
“Amidst The Chaos,” her fifth full-length record, is her first collection of original material since 2013. Among its standout tunes is “A Safe Place to Land,” featuring John Legend. Others include “Poetry by Dead Men” and “Saint Honesty.”

Variety said the album “establishes that there’s no one in contemporary pop better at flexing mezzo-soprano sensitivity and social empathy like a muscle. It’s the perfect album for anyone who could use a little fierce snowflake pride.”
Bareilles achieved mainstream praise in 2007 with “Love Song,” a hit from her debut album, “Little Voice.” The song reached No. 1 in 22 countries. She’s received seven Grammy nominations since then, and her 2015 memoir, “Sounds Like Me: My Life (So Far) in Song,” was a New York Times best seller.
The California native made her Broadway acting debut in 2017, when she stepped into the lead role in “Waitress.” Bareilles also composed the music and lyrics for that show; she received her first Tony Award nomination for Best Score and a 2017 Grammy Award nomination for Best Musical Theater Album.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that President Donald Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence agencies’ examination of possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.
And Trump has assisted with Barr’s efforts by calling other countries’ leaders, including the Australian prime minister in a recent phone call.
Justice Department and White House spokesmen, as well as an Australian government spokesman, confirmed and defended the efforts after The Washington Post and The New York Times reported them, citing people familiar with the matter.
Barr’s personal involvement is likely to stoke further criticism from Democrats pursuing impeachment that he is helping the Trump administration use executive branch powers to augment investigations aimed primarily at the president’s adversaries.
But the high-level Justice Department focus on intelligence operatives’ conduct matches Trump’s and conservatives’ "investigate the investigators" rallying cry. Barr has voiced his own concerns, telling lawmakers in April that he believed "spying did occur" when it came to the U.S. investigation of the Trump campaign.
The direct involvement of the nation’s top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing U.S. intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.
Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct in the three-year-old election.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not name the countries in her statement. But Barr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.
It was not Barr’s first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said. The Trump administration has made similar requests of Australia, said people who discussed the interactions on the condition of anonymity.
In a recent phone call, Trump urged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide assistance to the ongoing Justice Department inquiry, the people said. Trump made the request at Barr’s urging, they said. The Trump phone call was first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by an Australian government spokesman who said his government was ready to "help shed further light on the matters under investigation," Bloomberg reported.
Trump administration officials defended the moves as above board.
"I’m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. "The Democrats clearly don’t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened. The DOJ simply requested the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that’s all."
Kupec said, "Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr’s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials."
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government said it has "always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The [prime minister] confirmed this readiness once again in a conversation with the President."
Trump still complains frequently that those involved in the investigation of his campaign should be charged with crimes, asserting the FBI search for possible election season collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials was a witch hunt spurred by agents and bureaucrats opposed to Trump becoming president. That investigation ended earlier this year when special counsel Robert Mueller determined there was insufficient evidence to charge any Americans with conspiring with Russia and declined to reach a decision about whether the president had sought to obstruct justice.
David Laufman, a former Justice Department official who was involved in the early stages of the Russia probe, said it was "fairly unorthodox for the attorney general personally to be flying around the world as a point person to further evidence-gathering for a specific Justice Department investigation," and especially so in Barr’s case.
Barr’s direct involvement in the effort also helps explain part of the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of that call shows Trump said he wanted Ukrainian assistance to help find out "what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine," and possible involvement with the Democratic National Committee computer system that U.S. agencies have determined was hacked by Russian intelligence ahead of the 2016 election.
Some of the president’s supporters have suggested Ukraine had a more direct role in the 2016 investigation than currently known, an assertion denied by current and former officials who were involved in the original probe.
A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment, citing the ongoing review.
A former senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation denied that the CIA was involved in monitoring any members of the Trump campaign. Any such operations were conducted by the FBI and were lawful, the former official said, emphasizing that the CIA focused on Russia’s interference in the election, and the role that Russian officials and intelligence agencies played.

Economics Needs More Black Women

Texto completo: Black women are underrepresented in economics, which is bad for everyone.
Economics is neither a welcoming nor a supportive profession for women. In 2017, Alice H. Wu, now a doctoral student in economics at Harvard, published an eye-opening study of online conversations among economists that provided convincing evidence that overt sexism was a serious problem in the field. Last year the economist Roland G. Fryer Jr., a star of the Harvard department, faced sexual misconduct allegations, prompting calls to condemn the widespread sexual harassment and discrimination in the profession. (In July, Harvard suspended Professor Fryer for two years.)
But if economics is hostile to women, it is especially antagonistic to black women. Black women account for 6.8 percent of bachelor's degrees in the social sciences. But in 2017, only 0.6 percent of doctoral degrees in economics and only 2 percent of bachelor's degrees in economics were awarded to black women.
Sadie T.M. Alexander, who in 1921 became the first African-American to receive a Ph.D. in economics, switched to law because of the racism and sexism she encountered. A century later the experience of black female economists is disturbingly similar.
This month the American Economic Association published a survey finding that black women, compared to all other groups, had to take the most measures to avoid possible harassment, discrimination and unfair or disrespectful treatment. Sixty-two percent of black women reported experiencing racial or gender discrimination or both, compared to 50 percent of white women, 44 percent of Asian women and 58 percent of Latinas. Twenty-nine percent and 38 percent of black women reported experiencing discrimination in promotion and pay, respectively, compared to 26 percent and 36 percent for whites, 28 percent and 36 percent for Asians and 32 percent and 40 percent for Latinas.
"I would not recommend my own (black) child to go into this field," said one of the black female respondents. "It was a mistake for me to choose this field. Had I known that it would be so toxic, I would not have."
Many black women who might want to study economics are effectively prevented from doing so at a young age. Research by the economist Dania V. Francis provides evidence that, all else being equal, black girls are disproportionately recommended less by teachers for Advanced Placement calculus (a gateway course for taking economics), STEM classes and college preparation in general.
Black women who do become economists face discrimination when it comes to publication citations, which play a critical role in recognition and promotion in the profession. "There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that underrepresented minorities and women are under-cited," another respondent to the American Economic Association survey noted, "and that publication lags are longer for them."
Change in the profession will require addressing the lack of information black women are given about the field and the profession's climate. Fortunately, several efforts to do to this are already underway, including by various committees of the American Economic Association and the newly formed Sadie Collective, which one of us (Ms. Opoku-Agyeman) co-founded.
A small practical step that the American Economic Association and individual economics departments could take is to find alternatives to student evaluations of teachers. A large and growing literature finds evidence of the ineffectiveness of student evaluations in assessing instruction as well as evidence of gender and racial bias. "As a black and female lecturer," another respondent to the survey said, "I believe my student/course evaluations would be higher if I were white and/or male. The majority of my students are white" and some still "have a problem in seeing a black woman as an expert/authority figure."
Last year, Janet Yellen, the former head of the Federal Reserve Board, argued that a lack of diversity among economists was a liability for the profession because it could lead to a myopic sense of the most pressing problems and the most relevant solutions. "Women and men have significantly different approaches and views on public policy issues," she said, "which means that women's voices and those of minorities need to be heard."
The American Economic Association's survey is cause for optimism, since it takes the first step of acknowledging the problem for black women in the profession. Now senior economists and institutions employing economists must meaningfully tackle it.
