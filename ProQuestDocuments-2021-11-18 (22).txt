Texto completo: It’s easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump’s well-documented and much-ballyhooed “war” on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he’s felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He’s taken action after action against this state’s best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California’s unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality. Even though Trump and his handpicked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can’t actually do it because California’s right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the President of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump’s administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don’t meet federal clean air standards – even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards. So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves “seem counterintuitive.”
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California’s many “sanctuary cities.” He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don’t do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he’s had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum’s observation that “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, “the only rule is that there are no rules.”
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America’s longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It’s an approach completely unlike any previous President, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he’s made against California.
Top state officials say they are fairly certain of that, despite a Supreme Court that’s upheld some other unprecedented Trump actions, like his condoning the caging of small immigrant and refugee children.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President’s new show, “If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California…and other diseases. But that’s the state of things today in this country…We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts.”
Added Becerra, “If the arguments in the President’s tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we’re looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court.”
The trick here is to see Trump’s real apparent motive: Less to hurt California or the potential victims of his actions than to keep the spotlight constantly on himself, impeachment investigation or not, and thereby help ensure another presidential term and even more personal profits while he steers government and foreign spending to his many properties.

Texto completo: Food52, a digital bazaar that sells upscale home goods, said it sold a majority stake to venture firm TCG for $83 million, a deal that gives TCG an entree into the world of fine dining and home accessories.
The companies said the stake sale values Food52 at more than $100 million. Food52 said it generated about $30 million in revenue last year but isn't profitable.
Food52 previously raised $13 million from investors including Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments Inc. and Scripps Networks Interactive, which was acquired by Discovery Inc. last year.
Founded in 2009 by Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, veteran food journalists who worked for the New York Times, Food52 offers recipes and home-improvement tips as well as selling its own products to online shoppers. Two of its top sellers are an apron with built-in potholders ($45) and a double-sided cutting board with an extra-deep juice-trough ($59).
Food52 incorporates guidance from its audience while developing its products, Ms. Hesser said. The popular apron and cutting board were informed by suggestions from Food52 readers, who responded to a survey on the company's website.
"In retail, there's almost no interaction between the consumers and producers," Ms. Hesser said. "We wanted to break down those walls."
Food52 is among a crop of media companies that make much of their revenue from e-commerce -- both by selling their own products and by referring their readers to online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. to buy other products.
Food52 gets a tiny fraction of its revenue from affiliate sales, a spokesman said.
Ms. Hesser, Food52's chief executive, and Ms. Stubbs, the company's president, said in an interview that they decided to sell a stake in the company after a process that began last year with an email from a TCG employee. The company's line of custom home goods was selling briskly, and the co-founders decided to take on additional investment to expand that business.
"We realized that there was huge potential to really blow this out," said Ms. Stubbs.
TCG was founded in 2018 by Peter Chernin, the former chief operating officer of News Corp, the parent company of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co., alongside Mike Kerns and Jesse Jacobs.

A Fake Psychologist Treated Troubled Children for Years, Prosecutors Say

Texto completo: "The alleged conduct in this case is truly outrageous," the district attorney said.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The parents all needed a therapist who could help their children with behavioral and mental health issues.
Glenn Payne, 60, appeared to fit the bill. He said he was a neuropsychologist with advanced degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, affiliations with two Brooklyn hospitals and years of experience.
But those credentials were a lie, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said.
For at least six years, Mr. Payne provided therapy that he was not qualified to give, prosecutors said. His degrees were fake, and the hospitals had no records that he had been affiliated with them. Despite practicing clinical psychology, he was not licensed to do so in either New York or California.
On Thursday, prosecutors formally charged Mr. Payne in a 55-count indictment in Brooklyn Supreme Court. They accused him of pretending to be a licensed psychologist and treating at least 12 people, including children, who were described as "troubled," between June 2012 and May 2018.
The Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, said in a statement that "the alleged conduct in this case is truly outrageous and potentially endangered vulnerable people."
"It is unbelievable that someone would put patients, including children, at risk by pretending to be qualified to diagnose and treat them," Mr. Gonzalez said.
Both Mr. Payne and his girlfriend, Vernette Tobierre-Desir, 46, were accused in the indictment of working together to steal more than $ 30,000 from his patients.
Among the charges were grand larceny, unauthorized practice of a profession and scheme to defraud, as well as six counts of child endangerment.
Mr. Payne and Ms. Tobierre-Desir, who have two children together, have pleaded not guilty to all 55 counts.
"I think sometimes people see the volume of charges and jump to conclusions and make assumptions," said Mr. Payne's lawyer, Michael Chessa. "I truly do think Mr. Payne is going to be vindicated."
On his LinkedIn profile, which is referenced in the indictment, Mr. Payne said he had been in private practice since 2011. He claimed to have a master's degree in public health and a doctorate in psychology (which he spelled incorrectly).
But Mr. Payne has no formal counseling that prosecutors were aware of. He told investigators that he was a doctor with a "home-schooled, unconventional education during the Black Panther era," according to court papers.
None of Mr. Payne's patients had been hospitalized or physically harmed, an official said. Some of his patients liked him and his treatment methods.
But others became suspicious during therapy sessions. Mr. Payne would often talk about his own life and not ask patients about theirs, the official said. He would also repeat exercises and worksheets in some of his sessions with little explanation, giving patients the sense that he had run out of ideas to treat them.
According to prosecutors, Mr. Payne and Ms. Tobierre-Desir worked at three locations: his main office in a large building in Brooklyn Heights, a smaller building in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens and the offices of a nonprofit based at Kings County Hospital Center, one of the hospitals with which Mr. Payne claimed to be affiliated.
Mr. Payne's relationship with the nonprofit, the Kings Against Violence Initiative, was unclear. The group did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.
According to the indictment, patients were referred to Mr. Payne by their doctors or friends, though it was unclear how Mr. Payne built his professional network.
Patients would then set up appointments by email or phone with Ms. Tobierre-Desir, who acted as Mr. Payne's office manager for the six years covered in the indictment, prosecutors said.
As she set up appointments, Ms. Tobierre-Desir would tell patients that Mr. Payne, like many therapists, did not take insurance, according to the indictment. Patients were required to pay his fees out of pocket, either in cash or through electronic transfers.
When some of Mr. Payne's patients, looking to file out-of-network claims with their insurance companies, asked her for a provider number or license information, she refused to give it, the indictment said. Then the sessions would taper off.
In a statement, Ms. Tobierre-Desir's lawyers, Arthur A. Edwards and Rodney T. Doyle, suggested that she was not responsible for the operation.
"By all appearances, she herself was a victim of someone whom she trusted and with whom she had a relationship, albeit a tumultuous one," they wrote.
Among Mr. Payne's patients was a child under probation, according to the indictment. Mr. Payne repeatedly filed court-ordered paperwork on his behalf to the city's Probation Department.
The department's general counsel, Wayne McKenzie, said the patient was already being treated by Mr. Payne before he was put under probation. The department does not typically choose or pay for providers when courts order psychological services, he added.
Prosecutors began to interview some of Mr. Payne's patients in April 2018, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office said.
Around the same time, the spokesman said, Mr. Payne fled New York, adopting aliases and changing his phone numbers and bank accounts. He spent time in Las Vegas before heading to Los Angeles, where he was recently arrested and extradited.
Mr. Chessa, Mr. Payne's lawyer, disputed that his client was running from the charges, saying he left New York because of "family circumstances."
Mr. Payne was ordered held on $ 100,000 bond or $ 50,000 bail and remained in custody as of Friday. Ms. Tobierre-Desir was arraigned in January and was released.

Food52, a digital bazaar that sells upscale home goods, said it sold a majority stake to venture firm TCG for $83 million, a deal that gives TCG an entree into the world of fine dining and home accessories.
The companies said the stake sale values Food52 at more than $100 million, declining to be more specific. Food52 says it generated about $30 million in revenue last year but isn't profitable.
Food52 previously raised $13 million from investors including Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments Inc. and Scripps Networks Interactive, which was acquired by Discovery Inc. last year.
Founded in 2009 by Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, veteran food journalists who worked for the New York Times, Food52 offers recipes and home-improvement tips as well as selling its own products to online shoppers.

"In retail, there's almost no interaction between the consumers and producers," Ms. Hesser said. "We wanted to break down those walls."
Food52 is among a crop of media companies that make much of their revenue from e-commerce—both by selling their own products online and by referring their readers to online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. to buy other products. If a reader buys a product from Amazon, Food52 gets a cut of the sale.
Sales of products from the company's own line, dubbed "Five Two," are much more common and more profitable than affiliate sales on Amazon. Food52 gets a tiny fraction of its revenue from affiliate sales, a company spokesman said.

Ms. Hesser, Food52's chief executive, and Ms. Stubbs, the company's president, said in an interview that they decided to sell a stake in the company after a diligence and negotiation process that began last year with an email from an employee at TCG. The company's line of custom home goods was selling briskly, and the co-founders decided to take on additional investment to grow that business.
"We realized that there was huge potential to really blow this out," said Ms. Stubbs.

Ms. Hesser said Food52 is using some of the new money to develop a bricks-and-mortar store that will sell its line of home goods. The company also plans to hire staffers for computer engineering and product development.
"We're planning to open our first store over the next year, as well as pop-up [stores]," Ms. Hesser said.
Some of TCG's investment is being used to buy out existing shareholders.
Mr. Kerns of TCG said Food52's product line and affiliate revenue made it attractive among media operators.
"With respect to verticalized digital media companies, we think it's important for those businesses not to be advertising-based," Mr. Kerns said. "We look for diversified business models."

Texto completo: I miss Travis Kalanick. Sure, the former Uber CEO was known to attack colleagues in the boardroom and berate his drivers from the back seat. And yes, when I met him in 2013 , he was pacing around with a golf club looking as if he wanted to break a window in his conference room.
But he told me the story of when Uber received a cease-and-desist order from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. Did you cease? I asked. "No." Did you desist? "No" he repeated, asserting that Uber is perfectly legal, and that the agency didn't have jurisdiction anyway. That was a bold move—just the kind that Silicon Valley is missing these days.
I'm not condoning the culture that festered under Mr. Kalanick. He famously wrote an email to the "Uber Team" before a Miami off-site meeting in which he advised, among other things: "Do not throw large kegs off of tall buildings." It isn't bad advice, but it shows he had a lot of growing up to do—much like the 22-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, whose card read: "I'm CEO, Bitch." Uber during his tenure was also known for shrugging off sexual-harassment claims. Mr. Kalanick was replaced for a reason.
The problem is that too many in the media don't distinguish between Uber's rotten corporate culture and its legitimately bold business practices. Instead both get placed under the same umbrella of "toxic bro culture," as if everyone in Silicon Valley is a misogynist Neanderthal strutting around with his baseball cap on backward.
Tragically, the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. Silicon Valley has gone wussy on us—wait, can I even say "wussy" anymore? The New York Times suggests tech workers are all experiencing "existential dread" and in need of therapy. Bad leadership is to blame.
Everyone is caving in like an overcooked soufflé. Mr. Zuckerberg says the era of self-regulation is over. Microsoft President Brad Smith says the tech sector should embrace regulation. Apple's Tim Cook, who practically invented the global supply chain, met with President Trump to beg him to lift tariffs—from Apple, but not everyone else.
Amazon has surrendered on multiple fronts, raising its minimum wage to $15 to quell claims it paid "starvation wages" and committing to carbon neutrality by 2040 despite knowing full well that the real problem is Chinese coal plants, which power the factories that make the products Amazon ships.
What happened? Silicon Valley suffers from a classic case of Stockholm syndrome: Its leaders have developed sympathy for their government and social-justice captors. Facebook and Uber spent millions on cringeworthy TV commercials apologizing for misdeeds. Facebook ought to update its iconic signs to read, "Move fast and break things—and then apologize profusely."
Through his bravado, Mr. Kalanick (along with John Zimmer at Lyft) invented a revolutionary business model that has changed how as many as a billion people work, live and don't drive home after a few beers. Could such a breakthrough happen today? Who will cattle-prod economic deadweights like health care, education and government?
Investigations into tech's competitive behavior make the problem worse. It came out last week that Snap has been collecting examples—in a dossier it calls "Project Voldemort"—of aggressive tactics Facebook uses to try to squash Snap. Of course Facebook uses aggressive tactics, much as GM did to Ford, Macy's to Gimbels, Boeing to Airbus, Coke to Pepsi. If done legally, that's the American way. Without competition, you get stagnation.
Are there any leaders with backbones anymore? I've met a few but most seem timid. The hot companies are fake-meat producers whose "burgers" taste like burned Styrofoam, and some crypto and blockchain companies with almost zero real-world applications. Autonomous cars have been subsumed by traditional auto makers. I'm not sure many of the fashion/fitness/lifestyle companies should even be considered technology plays. Then there's the WeWork dude who was only good at squandering $10 billion, allegedly self-dealing and smoking weed until stepping down as CEO. He's not the role model we're looking for.
It's time for Silicon Valley to stop being defensive and start playing offense again. There are tiny signs of hope. Facebook refused, at first, to take down a fake video of Nancy Pelosi that made her seem drunk. After the inmates took over the asylum at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai banned "political debate" on internal discussion boards, in effect telling his workers to #ShutUpAndCode.
Then there's Uber's response to California's new rule that reclassifies temporary and gig workers as full-time employees unless their jobs are "outside the usual course" of business. Not quite a cease-and-desist order to ride-sharing companies, but close. Uber reacted by claiming "drivers' work is outside the usual course of Uber's business, which is serving as a technology platform for several different types of digital marketplaces." Sounds a tad far-fetched—but woo-hoo, some backbone! Mr. Kalanick would be proud.

Food52, a digital bazaar that sells upscale home goods, said it sold a majority stake to venture firm TCG for $83 million, a deal that gives TCG an entree into the world of fine dining and home accessories.
The companies said the stake sale values Food52 at more than $100 million, declining to be more specific. Food52 says it generated about $30 million in revenue last year but isn't profitable.
Food52 previously raised $13 million from investors including Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments Inc. and Scripps Networks Interactive, which was acquired by Discovery Inc. last year.
Founded in 2009 by Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, veteran food journalists who worked for the New York Times, Food52 offers recipes and home-improvement tips as well as selling its own products to online shoppers. Two of its top sellers are an apron with built-in potholders ($45) and a double-sided cutting board with an extra-deep juice-trough ($59).
Food52 incorporates guidance from its audience while developing its products, Ms. Hesser said. The popular apron and cutting board were informed by suggestions from Food52 readers, who responded to a survey on the company's website.
"In retail, there's almost no interaction between the consumers and producers," Ms. Hesser said. "We wanted to break down those walls."
Food52 is among a crop of media companies that make much of their revenue from e-commerce—both by selling their own products online and by referring their readers to online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. to buy other products. If a reader buys a product from Amazon, Food52 gets a cut of the sale.
Sales of products from the company's own line, dubbed "Five Two," are much more common and more profitable than affiliate sales on Amazon. Food52 gets a tiny fraction of its revenue from affiliate sales, a company spokesman said.

Ms. Hesser, Food52's chief executive, and Ms. Stubbs, the company's president, said in an interview that they decided to sell a stake in the company after a diligence and negotiation process that began last year with an email from an employee at TCG. The company's line of custom home goods was selling briskly, and the co-founders decided to take on additional investment to grow that business.
"We realized that there was huge potential to really blow this out," said Ms. Stubbs.
TCG was founded in 2018 by Peter Chernin, the former chief operating officer of News Corp., the parent company of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co., alongside Mike Kerns and Jesse Jacobs. TCG owns a controlling stake in MeatEater Inc., a digital media company aimed at hunters, fishermen and home cooks, and has also invested in Action Network, a sports-betting analytics startup.

Considering all that has happened in the past few weeks, it's remarkable that author Tom Mueller spent nearly seven years working on his latest book - "Crisis of Conscience: Whistleblowing in an Age of Fraud" - which will be released this week, exactly when the subject of whistleblowing is on everyone's mind.
Mueller's previous book, "Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil," was a New York Times bestseller in 2011 and 2012. In that book, he showed that a deeply reported story about a subject few might think of for such a long-form exposé can be a wildly entertaining read in the hands of a talented writer.
At close to 600 pages, "Crisis of Conscience" accomplishes the same thing for whistleblowers, only with an incredible relevance that is almost startling at times.
He's written for The New Yorker, National Geographic, the New York Times and The Atlantic Monthly while living or working in 48 countries, yet Spokane is his official residence. On Monday, Oct. 28, Mueller will come home as a featured author for The Spokesman-Review's popular Northwest Passages book club and community forum series. Tickets are on sale now, and the event is expected to sell out.
Last week, while in Italy, Mueller answered questions via email about his new book. The following interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
Curley: How was writing this book different than "Extra Virginity?"
Mueller: Actually, given the vast difference in subject matter, the two books have surprising similarities. Both started as a relatively limited project, and evolved/morphed/exploded to fill my entire mental field of vision. Both are rooted in fraud, misconduct and abuse, the dark shadow behind the brightest scenes. And above all, the key to both books - the high octane fuel for their narratives - were a cast of truly exceptional characters, whose acts, courage and philosophies of life permanently enriched my own.
What were some of your biggest "aha" moments through researching and writing "Conscience of Conscience?"
There were two big surprises.
One, when I began to see that the many different whistleblower classes I've been looking at, including national security whistleblowers - all of which I assumed were radically different in form and in substance - actually were members of the same human species with almost identical group-individual dynamics, identical retaliation patterns, identical attitude of the whistleblowers before, during and after their disclosures.
And two, the growing realization that my book, almost of its own volition, was becoming as much about the drivers of whistleblowing - institutional corruption and decline of conscience that prompts people to speak out - as about the whistleblowers themselves. Pioneering whistleblower lawyer Mary Louise Cohen, in one of our interviews, told me, "You should just write about whistleblowers. You should write about what on Earth has happened to corporate America."
She was right, and I've done that  or done my best, anyway.
What are your initial takes on the current White House whistleblower, based upon all of your research for "Crisis of Conscience"?
Many observers have described this case as unprecedented. I strongly disagree. In my book - in the chapter "Ministries of Truth" - I detail how numerous national security insiders blew the whistle on severe wrongdoing, and paid a terrible price in their work and their private lives - even when they made their disclosures strictly through official channels. The broken whistleblower structure currently being revealed in the DNI (Director of National Intelligence) whistleblower case is very much par for the course.
From your book, there is a feeling that for a whistleblower to really have success, there are almost certain protocols that need to be followed. Does it appear that's the case with the current White House whistleblower? And does it look like those protocols were followed?
It is clear to me and to all careful observers that the DNI whistleblower, at every phase of the process, rigorously followed the law and the regulations on how to make whistleblower disclosures. This person only suggested they might deviate from protocol - by testifying directly to Congress - when it appeared that their disclosure would not be transmitted to Congress, as the law clearly requires. (Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire) himself stated that this whistleblower followed the law throughout.
What's your take on the things Maguire said in his testimony?
My sense from reading transcripts and watching Maguire's testimony is that he was a basically honorable man caught in a tricky situation, without sufficient knowledge to know how to navigate it, and with too much deference to his political leaders. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 states without a shadow a wiggle room that, if the Inspector General reviews a whistleblower complaint and finds it both "credible" and "urgent," then that complaint "shall" be transmitted to Congress within seven days. "Shall" is the statutory language that Congress uses when they want to take all room for interpretation out of the situation.
Nevertheless, showing what I think was an excessive sensitivity to political pressure, Maguire consulted both the White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel - the same folks who gave us the torture memos, among other legal monstrosities - instead of just following the law. But to his great credit, Maguire has repeatedly expressed his support for this whistleblower, and his belief that the whistleblower acted in good faith and according to law.
Early on in the book, you note William Barr's take on whistleblowers from earlier in his career. What does that mean now that he is the Attorney General?
It means that the current Attorney General of the United States has a visceral hatred of whistleblowers and the laws that protect them. He believes them to be legal "abominations." Even if he cannot expunge whistleblowing from the law books as I suspect he would like, he can put his very heavy thumb on many scales at the Department of Justice, until the balance moves away from whistleblowers in specific cases, as well as in formulation of new laws and the application of old ones.
Your book shows the White House's reaction to the Pentagon Papers through different presidential administrations, as well as to prolific whistleblower Ernie Fitzgerald. How do you read the current administration's reaction to this case?
(Richard) Nixon was outspoken that such acts of conscience were, in his view, betrayals and probably treason. Nixon's Plumbers unit considered doing bodily harm to (Pentagon Papers leaker) Daniel Ellsberg. Trump echoes this, including saying that this "spy" should be dealt with as spies were in the good old days - implying he should be rubbed out.
Do you agree with Ellsberg that leaking is not treasonous, but instead the ultimate act of patriotism?
That depends on what is leaked. If someone leaks top-secret plans of nuclear weapons to the Russians, that's treason, not patriotism. But if someone leaks, as Ellsberg did, proof of lies, malfeasance and wrongdoing by a series of presidents and other high officials that was perpetuating an illegitimate and unwinnable war, they are patriots.
"Crisis of Conscience" basically makes the case that this nation's Founding Fathers are the ultimate examples of whistleblowers - thus wanting to protect, even encourage, whistleblowing as a core element of a this country's democracy. That was one of the first moments of surprise in the book for me. How did you come to that conclusion?
The Founders treated whistleblowers with great respect, and passed laws that protected them. What's more, the Founders themselves behaved like whistleblowers. Think about it: These men consciously, and at enormous risk, denied the authority of their divine monarch King George III to follow a higher authority: truth and justice.
They broke their loyalty to Mother Britain to follow higher loyalties to their new nation and to humankind. They believed in the sovereign importance of the individual and of the individual conscience. They affirmed not just the right but the duty of each individual to reveal wrongdoing that puts the public in harm's way.
This all sounds like whistleblower behavior to me.
In many ways, your book uses the whistleblower as a vehicle to explain the most important concepts of our democracy, but done in a way that's never boring or overbearing. Was that your original point for this book or more of a powerful byproduct?
It was a byproduct, an emergent phenomenon. As I went deeper into whistleblowing, I began to wonder why it was on the rise in so many different areas of our society. This led me to delve into the motivations of individual whistleblowers, and look for a common factors that united many whistleblower stories.
Again and again, I saw the same drivers of a person of conscience denouncing wrongdoing: conflicts of interest like the revolving door; cults of secrecy and money; unhealthy melding of public and private; and so forth. These underlying causes of the Age of Whistleblowing became the yin to whistleblowing's yang in my book - the cause and effect that I felt needed to be discussed in tandem.
And, hopefully, as you say, without boring too many people!
It feels like there still is a real stigma tied to whistleblowers. Why?
Because loyalty is one of the most powerful human emotions, and we apply it uncritically, even in contexts where it should not exist. If you discover that your sister, a nurse at a local hospital, has been quietly euthanizing elderly patients in her care, do you remain loyal to her and not inform the police? Or if you are a member of the mafia, and after many crimes of your own, get sick of the killing and report your fellow henchmen to the authorities, should you be branded as a traitor?
The answers here seem clear in the abstract, but in our gut, no matter how many lives a whistleblower saves, no matter how noble and courageous they are, we still have that little voice of loyalty in our minds whispering, "Yeah, but they turned on their own - they crossed the line. And they deserve what they get." Which often isn't pretty.
Do you think people understand what drives many whistleblowers, and all that these people typically lose in their lives because of their moment of committing truth?
I think most of us, when presented with a hypothetical case, feel we would do the right thing, just as the whistleblower does. But when we are acting in the midst of a strong, tight-knit team, at the orders of a charismatic leader, most of us do not have the clarity of thought or the strength of character to resist the actions of the group and do the right thing. Stanley Milgram's shock experiments, and countless other social psychology experiments of the last 50 years, prove this.
And, no, most people emphatically do not understand the terrible losses that whistleblowers suffer, in their careers, their personal lives, their finances, their physical and psychological health. People routinely cheer whistleblowers as David vs. Goliath success stories, marvel at the big bounties they collect - which rarely are a patch on the money they would've made by keeping silent - and enjoy warm feelings watching whistleblower heroics in Hollywood films.
But they completely fail to see the de facto destruction of whistleblowers in real life.

Texto completo: On a recent business trip to Denver, I was able to grab breakfast at one of my favorite morning spots.
Snooze Eatery is a funky, retro-themed breakfast joint with incredible food and service. They have an inventive menu and cool vibe, but so do many other AM cafes.
As I sat down, I wondered what made them so special and what compelled me to eat there whenever possible?
I placed an order with Chris, my enthusiastic server. Considering the fruit as a healthier option to home fries, I asked him specifically which fruit they served? His answer blew me away. "All the good stuff! Raspberries, strawberries, pineapple, and a couple blackberries," Chris exclaimed. "We used to include cantaloupe, but people always left it behind so we changed our approach."
It took me a couple minutes to process it all. Let's think about this mechanically. In a busy restaurant, as bussers frantically cleared tables to make room for more guests, a mechanism was in place to:
a) Notice what food was left on plates
b) Spot a recurring pattern
c) Care enough to speak up with a suggestion for improvement
d) Elevate to someone in a position of authority
e) Then, the decision maker quickly embraced the change to better serve customers
All despite the fact that berries cost more than melon and that the side-of-fruit contents aren't even listed on the menu.
Wow.
Speaking further to Chris, he told me that's just the way his company rolls. They are constantly tweaking their menu and processes to better delight customers. Even items that sell "pretty well" are quickly replaced with new dishes that will deliver guests something special.
Canary in the coal mine The proverbial leftover cantaloupe is the perfect canary in the coalmine signal for change, but most of us are so busy being heads down in the daily grind we don't even notice. On the other hand, getting up close and personal to the voice of our customers is what drives competitive advantage.
What are the leftover cantaloupes in your business? When we take time to focus on and improve the little stuff, we're able to liberate the biggest of gains. Let's stay on the hunt for those early-warning signs where we may be able to inject a micro-dose of innovation in order to go from a decent alternative to a fan favorite.
Snooze Eatery has a commitment to being extraordinary, even in those small areas that may largely be unnoticed. But think about the message that sends to their team and customers. If they're going to great lengths to optimize the side of fruit, think how fantastic the rest of their business must be.
So keep an eye out for the little stuff; those nooks and crannies that can be filled with a little inventive thinking. Embracing this mind-set for the long term will pack more punch than the perfect double espresso I sipped down slowly with my breakfast.

Texto completo: From where I stand, the majority of newspaper opinion pages are utterly broken — and have been for quite some time.
The best are resource-intensive labors of love led by teams of veteran journalists who write, collect, vet, edit and present a balance of informed opinions on their community's — or nation's — most pressing issues.
But in 2019, few newsrooms have the resources of the New York Times, Washington Post or Boston Globe opinion staffs — and it shows. Far too many facing staff reductions have moved the opinion editor from a full-time post to "other duties as assigned."
Overburdened editors tasked foremost with informing their communities often end up serving up something — anything — to "fill the page" with opinion content by the next looming deadline.
What you, the reader, often ends up with is a hodgepodge of benign thank-you notes and caustic rants that only serve to widen the divides in our society.
Or, even worse, you receive a page of ghost-written propaganda penned by special interests and peddled by public relations firms as the views of influential locals.
I've cringed at both offerings and, during my time as an overburdened editor, have probably published a few myself.
I've also lamented the type of pingpong discourse that the traditional opinion page promotes. You say this one day, I disagree with you a couple of days or weeks later, you rebut the following week, and by the time we've spent all our capital arguing over an issue, level heads have worked quietly toward addressing disagreements and building consensus around a solution.
Frankly, too much of what I see does too little to advance civic discourse.
That's why, when faced with budget cuts and the looming long-term absence of columnist and opinion editor Kevin Duggan earlier this year, I made the unpopular decision to cease publication of the Coloradoan's opinion page.
It was either that or divert additional resources away from the Coloradoan's exclusive reporting on Fort Collins issues during Duggan's absence. Less reporting will never be a palatable solution to any of the news industry's challenges.
However, fostering civic dialogue is core to the mission of the Coloradoan and our parent USA TODAY Network. It's why we write solutions-based stories, host forums for the public to interact with candidates for public office and write it into our principles of ethical conduct:
"When sharing editorials and other opinion articles, we will encourage and promote views that foster understanding, insight and civil discourse. We seek to offer viewpoints that represent various views on a particular topic."
Today, I'm excited to launch a new take on achieving that goal — "2020 Vision."
The traditional opinion page at the Coloradoan may be dead, but from where I stand, we can help civic discourse in Fort Collins thrive — together.
Coloradoan editor Eric Larsen can be reached at ericlarsen@coloradoan.com or 970-224-7745. To support local journalism in Fort Collins and help the Coloradoan reach its goal of reaching 20,000 digital subscribers by the end of 2020, visit offers.coloradoan.com/specialoffer.

Texto completo: The accolades for the Finger Lakes wine region of New York to continue to accumulate.
The most recent example: "Wine & Spirits Magazine" has named Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery as one of the Top 100 Wineries of 2019.
Also on the worldwide list is such prestigious wineries as Champagne Krug in France; Penfolds in Australia; and Stags' Leap Winery and Tablas Creek in California. Dr. Frank was the only winery named from the Finger Lakes region of New York. The winery previously was named in the "Wine & Spirits Magazine" Top 100 in 2016.
Over the past few years, the winery has rolled out more personalized tasting experiences geared toward the varied interests of its visitors. It remodeled its tasting rooms and allowed each guest to choose wines to taste from the entire list including reserve and single vineyard wines. The Terrace at 1886 allows guests to enjoy flights of wine paired with local cheeses on the new outside terrace overlooking the vineyards on Keuka Lake. Now in its fourth year, the 1886 Food and Wine Experience offers guests a thorough educational tour and tasting paired with creative small bites.
Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery is at 9749 Middle Road, a few miles north of Hammondsport, Steuben County. The winery, which opened in 1962, was at the forefront of the post-Prohibition wine movement in the Finger Lakes. The vineyards on Keuka Lake are home to some of the oldest vines in the U.S.
More Finger Lakes accolades • For the second year in a row, the picturesque Finger Lakes wine region was named top wine region in the USA TODAY 10Best Reader's Choice poll. The Finger Lakes Wine Festival in Watkins Glen and F.L.X. Table in Geneva also finished in the Top 10 in their respective categories.
• Finger Lakes wines regularly have strong showings in the national wine press. The most recent example: New York Times wine writer Eric Asimov included Nathan K Finger Lakes Dry Riesling in a list of 20 wines under $20.

Texto completo: BANGOR -- On Sept. 8, the headline on the column by Editorial Page Editor Greg Kesich (Page D2) says: "We're more than just consumers." We're citizens, he goes on to say, which "means you are a member of a political community. In the United States that means you have rights - like the right to vote."
Not true. The largest plurality of voters in America (over 40 percent of all registered voters) are independent voters. Of America's future, the millennials, about 50 percent now identify as independents. And these voters cannot participate in primaries, where nominees for president are selected.
Maine voters don't think that this is right. In 2017, Mainers for Open Elections and the national Open Primaries organization sponsored a survey, and it found that nearly 75 percent of all registered voters in our state - Democrats, Republicans and independents - believe that taxpayer-funded primaries should be open to all voters. Why do the Maine Legislature and Congress support party control over primary ballot access? Isn't this undemocratic and un-American? Why support this "party voter prison"? A 2017 Harvard Business School study by political reformer Katherine M. Gehl and professor Michael E. Porter gives this reason: "The (U.S.) political system isn't broken. It's doing what it is designed to do. ... The real problem is that our political system is no longer designed to serve the public interest, and has been slowly reconfigured to benefit the private interests of gain-seeking organizations: our major political parties." Gehl and Porter conclude that the system's rigged!
Former U.S. Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., warns us about the need to end party control in his New York Times best-seller, "The Parties vs. the People: How to Turn Republicans and Democrats Into Americans." U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., does the same in a 2014 New York Times op-ed headlined "End Partisan Primaries, Save America." However, politicians in his state are saving "We the Party"-preserving partisan primary elections. Maine stumbles down a similar political road. But for how long?
Is an election lawsuit in Maine's future? The Independent Voter Project recently filed a voting rights lawsuit against the state of California. From paragraph 18 of the complaint: "A semi-closed primary gives private political parties and their loyal members a decided advantage in the public election process." Maine also has a partisan primary. Let's do better. Let's not settle for a semi-open or semi-closed anything!
Let's heed Maine's motto and lead and act with vision like the giants of Maine's past. At Maine's centennial kickoff anniversary celebration, Gov. Mills noted that the first Maine governor, William King, ensured in 1820 that Maine bestowed voting rights on all men regardless of race. It was the political moon shot of that day. This was more than 40 years before the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Can't we Mainers dream a dream as big as the one Gov. King dreamed and achieve it for the sake of Maine and America?
Let's call upon Gov. Mills, the Maine Legislature and our congressional delegation to rise above impossible odds and reshape the Maine and national political systems once more! Our parties need to win the people's hearts and minds rather than enchain voters in a prison financed by public funds. Otherwise, the demographics of this voter tidal wave will sweep the parties away like sand pebbles upon a beach.
Mainers, let's lead America to total voter freedom and greater candidate choice in the primaries through the presidential elections within a public (nonpartisan) election system. Since we pay, we should have the final say on how our election system is designed, built and operated. Let's put "We the People" before "We the Party." We are all Mainers and Americans first. America's life depends upon it.

Texto completo: New York City is one of the great food cities, has been for decades, centuries, even as a rising tide of interest in the delicious has made it possible to eat brilliantly in places around the world.
The five boroughs are home to gilded dining rooms and steamy, slightly sticky ones, to restaurants serving amazing duck or vegetables or broth or noodles, often all four -- and to every sort of restaurant in between.
The city plays host to a huge variety of food fairs, to a pageant of food trucks and carts arrayed across its immigrant byways, its Midtown avenues and the canyons of Wall Street. It is where pizza rose to its highest incarnations, where you can eat a tasting menu of 15 courses and stop off for a griddled hot dog on the way home, before arising in the morning to fetch smoked fish, breakfast congee, Trinidadian doubles.
The diversity and quality of our restaurants' offerings are staggering. If you want to eat well in New York City, just walk down the block, ask questions, walk a little farther, eat and then eat again.
That's what we do, anyway, here at the Food section of The New York Times. We travel the city in search of the delicious and unknown, and sometimes -- often! -- we succeed. We taste new flavors, or old ones reimagined, and we interview the kitchen geniuses who make them happen as if by magic trick, by alchemy.
We find deliciousness in small, cramped kitchens and giant, gleaming ones, in homes and commissaries, in food stalls and on side streets and political offices and next to ball fields, in parking lots and office buildings, private homes and public schools.
Our journalism is the who and the what, the where and the why and the when of excellent eating, drinking, shopping, cooking, farming, winemaking, fishmongering and more.
We talk politics with line cooks, culture with sommeliers, history with restaurateurs, science with cheesemakers. We examine the art of hospitality, the architecture of dining rooms and kitchens, the love and craft that goes into the creation of a perfect home-cooked meal.
We cook a lot of recipes and experience the joy of passing them along to readers as if to friends, as if to family. We revel in the delight of discovery -- the new and the forgotten, the dark news along with the light -- and we take great pleasure in reporting on what we have found.
It is a marvelous way to make a living. And we put together The New York Times Food Festival to celebrate that world, to introduce our readers to what we cover as we cover it, to offer the chance to experience New York City as we ourselves experience it, at its best.
So we have asked the chefs and owners of more than two dozen of the city's best restaurants to join us in Bryant Park on Saturday and Sunday to serve their interpretations of the food you might generally find at a street fair, along with the best of the Brooklyn-based, open-air food market Smorgasburg.
We put together a marketplace there, selling our favorite ingredients, and we invited some of the city's best chefs to demonstrate their singular cooking techniques, on a stage, in conversation with our reporters. At the same time, in TheTimesCenter, nearby, we will gather some of the most influential and interesting voices in food, restaurants, policy and design to talk onstage with our reporters and critics about the subjects that fill our pages and motivate our reporting.
Finally, we'll dive deep into the world of our restaurant critic Pete Wells, at a series of dinners at restaurants that are among his favorites in the city, dining rooms in which he'd spend his own money on his own time, for pure pleasure.
These restaurants -- among them one of the city's most exclusive sushi emporiums and what amounts to a neighborhood pizza shop -- have created menus for the event that celebrate the virtues Mr. Wells highlighted in his reviews of their work. They offer a view into his sensibility: catholic in taste and technique; unstinting in excellence; and they celebrate some of what makes New York City's restaurants great, right now, in the fall of 2019.
So far as we know, this is the first food festival The Times has presented in its 168 years in print. We very much hope that you will join us for it in New York during the first weekend in October and that it will become a regular event for us and you for years to come.

Texto completo: With happiness harder to come by these days, people are grasping at any moment of joy they can get.
Joy, it seems, is everywhere these days.
It is used to sell boxes at Ikea. It is included in ads for drinks at McDonald's and as a prescriptive for female hygiene. There are T-shirts that tout joy as "an act of resistance." There is the "Chasing Joy" podcast. And a number of books are being published this year devoted to joyful living, including marriage, productivity, even how to live more like Hugh Jackman.
But if joy is everywhere, why does happiness feel so elusive? Haven't we learned anything since 2014 when Marie Kondo taught us that cleaning our closets was a path to bliss? Well, so much has changed since then. Politics in the era of President Trump has divided Americans into two camps: angry and angrier. Our world is threatened by climate change. And the booming United States economy is showing signs of fatigue.
It is no wonder then that people are calculating well-being in mere moments. "In an age of despair, choosing joy is a revolutionary act," said Douglas Abrams, an author of "The Book of Joy: Lasting Happiness in a Changing World," a 2016 best seller he wrote with Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama. Joy is more attainable, he said. "Happiness seems like it is outside of us, in some perfect moment."
So, are we living in a post-happiness world? According to the World Happiness Report, which ranks 156 countries based on inhabitants' perception and well-being, happiness in the United States is declining. Americans said they were less content in 2018 than a year earlier, ranking No. 19 behind Australia and Canada. The 24-hour news cycle, combined with the onslaught of natural disasters, social upheaval and political strife, has left Americans exhausted. Worse, the agita shows no sign of abating; psychologists suggest anxiety is on the rise.
To explore this question, I called Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of "Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness." Many people do not know what happiness is, she said, and find the definition hard to pin down. Indeed, happiness does have a certain subjectivity to it. Experts, though, describe it as a positive state of overall well-being combined with a sense that one's life has meaning.
Joy, by contrast, is delight in moments that, by their nature, are fleeting. "I don't need to be happy to feel joy," Ms. Fetell Lee said. Joy can be inspired by something as simple as tossing confetti or taking a walk outdoors. She added, "I don't have to worry about making everything awesome in my life."
Michelle Shiota, an associate professor of social psychology at Arizona State University, tried an experiment last January. "I started to do a diary of 'a moment of joy' per day," said Dr. Shiota, who goes by Lani. "I lasted until mid-February. Then I was toast." Tabulating a daily moment was overwhelming. And joy can be found in quiet, she said. "It shouldn't always mean high arousal."
Social media, though, has hastened a cultural shift toward instantaneous gratification. "We've moved more to a microview of well-being, having positivity in the minute," said Dacher Keltner, director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. And that makes him wonder, "Are we just careening from moment to moment?"
While seeking joy can be uplifting, Dr. Shiota said, it should not mask emotions like anger, sadness and disappointment. "What people call negative emotions are a symptom that something is wrong and we have to change," she said. "We learn from them."
Today, researchers find it troubling that businesses have co-opted joy to market soda pop, productivity planners and storage containers. "Contentment is the next growth industry," Dr. Keltner said. "Marketers will tell you buying things will make you happy even though the opposite is true."
A 2017 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that people who spent money on things that helped them save time -- delivery or cleaning services, for example -- were more satisfied than if they bought baubles or expensive wine. Having more free time helped reduce stress, the study found.
But Dr. Keltner said something else is making happiness harder to attain: a lack of togetherness. He pointed to churches and other religious congregations, which have historically been central to a community's integrity. "Church gave you awe, joy and ecstasy," Dr. Keltner said. "You collected in a group. You sang a little. You gave money. You got to chant."
With the rise of Facebook, Instagram and other social media sites, virtual communities are replacing real-world gatherings. With it, the way we relate to one another is changing too. "Awe and laughter have been undermined," Dr. Keltner said. "We don't have the means to physically gather like we used to."
Sharon Salzberg, a teacher of Buddhist meditation and the author of "Loving-Kindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness," said people are re-examining happiness because they are worried: about health care, the economy and the unrelenting chaos in today's politically divisive world.
"I was the defender of happiness when my books came out," Ms. Salzberg said. "A number of people have been saying, 'Why don't you say 'joy'?" Happiness was dismissed as purely the pursuit of pleasure, she said. But it is significantly more complex. "I like redeeming the idea and meaning around happiness, to have more clarity and deep understanding," she said. "So people know what happiness actually is."
Does Ms. Fetell Lee believe Americans are living in a post-happiness era? No, she said. But she has observed a shift. "I don't think about happiness anymore," she said. "I think about joy. And if you string together enough moments of joy, maybe you can have a happy life."

What the Press Doesn't Know About Ukraine

Texto completo: We might not be here if the mainstream media, which loved the Steele Dossier when it seemed to incriminate Donald Trump, had later shown an equal interest in investigating its origins as a partisan fabrication.
In his now-famous transcript, Mr. Trump mainly presses Ukraine's new president for dirt not on the Bidens but on the known unknowns of 2016. "I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine," he says. "There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation."
This is the "favor" he actually seeks from Ukraine's president.
Yes, Mr. Trump's musings about the Democratic National Committee's server may be deluded, though it remains true that the FBI never directly examined the server. His next reference, however, begins "I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people." Here he may be referring to Ukrainian legislator Serhiy Leshchenko, who injected into the U.S. race a secret document on Paul Manafort's finances that later became a major factor in the Mueller investigation. Only intermittently have outlets like Politico and the Hill ever shown interest in the alleged pro-Clinton efforts of the previous Ukrainian government. Ukraine at the time was pell-mell becoming a U.S. client. Billions in civilian and military aid were starting to flow from the Obama administration. Vice President Joe Biden was dispatched to help clean up Ukraine's reputation and make it an acceptable partner.
This was the moment when Hunter Biden, with no relevant expertise, and last seen being booted from a short-lived career in the Navy Reserve because of a failed drug test, received a lucrative role with a Ukrainian company. Where might Mr. Trump have gotten the idea there was something fishy about this? From the U.S. media of course:
"Was Hunter Biden profiting off his dad's work as vice president and did Joe Biden allow it?" asked an ABC News "investigation" just weeks before Mr. Trump's call with the Ukrainian president. A lengthy account in the New Yorker quoted a 2017 divorce allegation that Hunter spent his considerable earnings on "drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations."
As recently as this week, the New York Times allowed only that there is "no evidence so far to support Mr. Trump's claim that Mr. Biden improperly intervened to help his son's business in Ukraine".
And simply fraudulent are news reports insisting that Mr. Biden wasn't influenced by his son's presence on the Burisma board, because it's impossible to know. Mr. Biden, instead of insisting that Ukraine's chief prosecutor be fired, might have insisted he prove his bona fides by reopening his dormant Burisma investigation. We just can't know. This is why the mere "appearance" of a conflict of interest is rightly considered compromising to U.S. policy (as the vice president's own aides reportedly tried to warn him).
But all such questions now are illegitimate in a rush to paint Mr. Trump as impeachable. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough quotes the White House transcript until its words no longer suit him and then invents his own to portray Mr. Trump as asking for information to "smear an opponent."
The transcript says no such thing. Mr. Trump certainly has political motives, as all politicians do, but asking a foreign government what it knows about a story that fills the U.S. media (the New Yorker's extraordinarily detailed report had appeared that very month) simply may not be the unprecedented act that some assume. (They haven't seen transcripts of other presidents' calls.)
OK, you aren't shocked that much journalism is conducted not in a spirit of inquiry, but to realize the desired talking points. Everything in the Ukraine call is ignored that doesn't fit the reductionist trope of "inviting foreign interference" in a U.S. election. I get it. Journalism is a business. The "talent" is rewarded for bringing in the desired demographic. But if we really want to restore measured discourse, let's go back to being reliable arbiters of fact and reason, rather than producing home pages designed as clickbait for target audiences (the Washington Post is an especially ignominious showpiece in this regard).
More than anything, today's coverage dumbifies everything it touches in our interesting country, in our interesting time.
A final point: A consensus has formed that Joe Biden will be collateral damage in the Democrats' desired Ukraine-related impeachment spectacle, with some progressives seeing this as a feature and not a bug. Mr. Biden never struck me as presidential material but he might well be the best we can do in 2020. He doesn't think America wants a socialist revolution. He's old. He might decide he doesn't care about a second term. He'd be free to enter office with a mandate from himself to govern from the middle, to work with the GOP regardless of his party's Twitter shriekers.
That possibility, which might look pretty good a year from now, is likely disappearing fast in the media's latest half-cocked frenzy.

House Again Votes to Reject Trump's Border Emergency

Texto completo: The vote mirrored one taken seven months ago, when lawmakers first tried to undo President Trump's national emergency declaration to pay for a border wall.
WASHINGTON -- Congress voted on Friday to terminate the national emergency that President Trump has declared at the southwestern border, delivering a bipartisan rebuke of his efforts to redirect federal money to a border wall without congressional approval.
The resolution of disapproval -- the second time in two months that Congress has rejected Mr. Trump's scheme to allocate large sums for a border barrier over lawmakers' objections -- fell short of its goal. With only 11 Republicans joining House Democrats in supporting it, the measure did not draw the two-thirds majority that would have been needed to overcome a veto. The Senate, which passed the measure this week, also did not muster a veto-proof majority.
But the action underscored the continuing struggle between Mr. Trump and Congress over his signature political promise and domestic priority, a symbol of an immigration agenda that has divided the country and the two political parties.
"The president had said Mexico will pay for his wall, not military families," said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. "The administration's decision also dishonors the Constitution by negating its most fundamental principle: the separation of powers. It's an assault on our power of the purse."
The 236-to-174 tally mirrored the vote taken seven months ago, when lawmakers first tried to undo Mr. Trump's national emergency declaration. Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the Republican Party in the months since, again voted to block the declaration.
Lawmakers can force a vote on the issue every six months, and Democrats have been using the opportunity to pressure Republicans to choose repeatedly between protecting their own powers of the purse and backing the president's use of executive authority to steer more money than Congress has been willing to devote to the border wall.
Republicans argued on Friday that Congress had forced the president's hand by refusing to allocate funds to the barrier, with Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a close ally of the president's, arguing "this has nothing to do with really legislating."
But Democrats, armed with a list of 127 military construction projects set to lose money under the declaration, accused their colleagues of prioritizing the border wall over their constituents and their constitutional prerogatives to allocate spending.
The $ 3.6 billion list of projects, which the Pentagon unveiled this month, includes military facilities in nearly half the 50 states, as well as three territories and 19 foreign countries. While military officials have stressed that the projects will see their funds delayed, Congress could replace the money in upcoming spending legislation and an annual defense policy bill.
Democrats have called that alternative a nonstarter, while Republicans have argued that Congress has an obligation to ensure that the projects continue without delay.
Mr. Trump on Friday signed a short-term spending bill that would prevent a lapse in funding on Oct. 1, leaving the broader issues of whether to pay for both border wall and diverted military funding unresolved.
In budget requests submitted to Congress over the past couple of years, the Pentagon has warned of critical consequences if the projects are not addressed. Here, according to some of those documents reviewed and obtained by The New York Times, are some of the warnings.
"Deficient, inadequate and undersized facilities."
Fort Campbell, the sprawling Army base along the Kentucky-Tennessee border, was slated to receive a renovated middle school. Pentagon officials warned that if $ 62.6 million was not dedicated to the construction of the new school, the "deficient, inadequate and undersized facilities" would continue to "impair the overall education program for students."
"Complete structural collapse is probable during a seismic event."
Roughly $ 11 million was slated to replace a fire station at the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina, where officials warned that it was a "significantly undersized and unsafe facility" and that it was possible that there could be serious injuries and casualties if the building collapsed. Since the facility's construction in 1959, only minor repairs have been made.
"Aging dilapidated buildings that were never intended for the purpose they are now serving."
At Hill Air Force Base in Utah, officials had asked for $ 28 million in order to ensure that "two dilapidated WWII era warehouses" would no longer be used as mission control and air traffic control centers. Because they are working in "aging dilapidated buildings that were never intended for the purpose they are now serving," military officials on the base have had to contend with "roof leaks from failing asbestos panel roofing systems" and aging lighting and electrical wiring.
"Airmen and their families will not have a safe and nurturing environment for child care."
Officials had asked for funds for a new child care center at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, which they said needed to accommodate about 165 children and staff. The current facility "has suffered from sewage backups, heating, ventilation and air conditioning failures and mold and pest management issues."
"Quality of life will be severely degraded," officials said of the base, which also is responsible for housing Air Force One. "Airmen and their families will not have a safe and nurturing environment for child care."
"Cramped and austere living conditions."
At Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, which suffered damage during Hurricane Michael in 2018, officials had asked for funds to construct a new fire station to replace the existing one, which had been built in 1965. The facility's inadequacy, officials warned, "will continue to degrade emergency response," and "cramped and austere living conditions" for firefighters would most likely result in retention problems.

Texto completo: A reader worries that details about the whistle-blower published by The Times "put that person's career, life and, perhaps, family in danger."
To the Editor:
Re "Why The Times Published Details of the Whistle-Blower's Identity" (Reader Center, nytimes.com, Sept. 26):
I was appalled by The Times's decision to publish crucial details about the patriotic whistle-blower who outed the Trump corruption.
The whistle-blower had already been vetted by the intelligence community's inspector general, as had the content of the complaint, within the structure of a policy that ensures confidentiality.
By lighting the path to the person's identity, you have not only put that person's career, life and, perhaps, family in danger, but also given yet another reason no one in his or her right mind should come forward to expose government wrongdoing. He or she might want to do the right thing, but not at the severe cost that public exposure entails.
I fully understand the desire for the big scoop. It drives all journalists and editors. Yet as I read the excellent "She Said," by your reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, I was struck by how well they and their editors also understood the need to protect people who did not want to subject themselves to personal and professional attacks. Your editors and reporters should have exercised the same restraint here.

Texto completo: On Oct. 2, the world will mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mohandas Karamchand "Mahatma" Gandhi. Gandhi never visited the U.S., but few non-Americans have had such a great impact on American life. His work as a freedom fighter and social reformer in India was closely followed in the U.S.
In the 1920s, when Gandhi launched a nonviolent mass movement against British colonial rule in India, his struggle was widely reported in the African-American press. Thinkers such as W.E.B. Du Bois and E. Franklin Frazier wrote about him, and several influential African-Americans visited him to seek advice, including Howard Thurman, later a mentor to Martin Luther King, Jr. Thurman wrote of how he had been subjected to an intense examination by the Indian leader: "persistent, pragmatic questions about American Negroes, about the course of slavery, and how we had survived it." As Thurman prepared to leave, Gandhi offered him this hopeful prediction: "It may be through the Negroes that the unadulterated message of nonviolence will be delivered to the world."
As a young man, King read Gandhi closely. In 1958, as he was making his name as a civil rights leader in the American South, King published a tribute to Gandhi in an Indian newspaper describing the deep influence the "Father of the Indian Nation" had on his thought: "I came to see at a very early stage that a synthesis of Gandhi's method of nonviolence and the Christian ethic of love is the best weapon available to Negroes in this struggle for freedom and human dignity.... His spirit is a continual reminder to oppressed people that it is possible to resist evil and yet not resort to violence."
During Gandhi's lifetime, however, his most fervent American admirer was another clergyman, the white New York pastor John Haynes Holmes, who in 1920 helped to found the American Civil Liberties Union. The following year, Holmes delivered a sermon titled "Who Is the Greatest Man in the World?" His answer was Gandhi, who reminded him of Jesus: "He lives his life; he speaks his word, he suffers, strives, and will some day nobly die, for his kingdom upon earth."
At the time, Gandhi was in the middle of the Non-Cooperation Movement, his first major campaign against British rule in India. This involved the burning of foreign cloth to promote indigenous Indian industry, the nonpayment of colonial taxes, and the withdrawal of Indian patriots from serving in colonial offices, universities and law courts. The struggle was widely covered in the American press. In a "cynical, materialistic and disillusioned" age, wrote the liberal journal the Nation, there had emerged a man "whose singular devotion, unselfishness and spiritual power have won him the almost superstitious reverence of his own people and the respect of the skeptical critics."
Gandhi appealed to American radicals because of his anti-colonialism, and to American Christians because of his simple life and message of brotherhood. While he opposed British imperialism, he often said that he had no hatred for individual Englishmen. Indeed, his closest friend was a British priest, C.F. Andrews, who wrote several books and many articles praising Gandhi for an American audience. The Chicago-based magazine the Christian Century repeatedly proposed Gandhi's name for a Nobel Peace Prize, though it failed to persuade the Anglophilic Norwegians to award him the honor.
In 1930, Gandhi launched another mass nonviolent struggle, known as the Salt March, since its principal target was an oppressive colonial law that prohibited Indians from making their own salt. Following the Salt March, Gandhi spent many months in prison. When he was released, he received a flood of letters conveying the admiration of Americans for his struggle. A particularly moving letter came from a Chicago resident named Arthur Sewell. The "Negroes of America," Sewell wrote, were "keenly and sympathetically" following Gandhi's movement. African-Americans "sympathize and suffer" with India and Indians, "for here, in America, they not only rob us of our possessions and hurdle us into the prisons unjustly, but they mob, lynch and burn us up with fire.... May God Bless you," Sewell declared, "and enable you to carry on the great battle for righteous adjustment until you win a glorious victory for the common cause of the lowly."
The Salt March made Gandhi immensely famous in America; Time Magazine named him Man of the Year. A certain James B. Pond of New York's Pond Bureau, self-professed "Managers of American Tours for World Celebrities," urged Gandhi to capitalize on this acclaim by making a tour of the U.S. "When you visit this country," Pond promised, "you will receive a welcome such as no man has ever had, and it is going to require the utmost knowledge, the utmost sympathy and utmost tact on the part of a manager to meet the situation." But the idea of a lucrative lecture tour didn't appeal to the austere and ascetic Indian.
Despite never setting foot in the U.S., Gandhi remained much on the mind of Americans. In 1932, a charming tribute appeared in the form of an advertisement by Saks, the New York department store, playing on the fact that Gandhi made his own clothes. Filling almost a whole page in the New York Times in 1932, the ad featured an illustration of four men wearing suits, each reading a newspaper, with the slogan "EVERYBODY BUT GANDHI." The text underneath said, in part: "The Mahatma chooses to spin his own…such as it is…and that's his business! He needn't read this ad. But all the rest of you gentlemen prefer to wear good suits…and that's our business." Evidently, the well-dressed man in New York knew very well what the Indian leader wore—or didn't wear.
Gandhi was murdered in 1948 by a Hindu fundamentalist enraged at his insistence that, in an independent India, Muslims and Christians must have the same rights as Hindus. Six decades later, an African-American became president of the U.S., his rise made possible by the struggle for racial equality that had Gandhi as one of its exemplars. In an interview shortly after taking office, Barack Obama was asked to choose a figure from history he would like to dine with. Gandhi, he answered, adding that of course it would be a frugal meal.
Today there are statues of Gandhi in many American cities, and courses on him are taught in numerous colleges and universities. His name and example once inspired the civil-rights movement; now it animates environmental debates. Visiting Arizona State University in Tempe, I saw a campaign for public transportation that invoked my most famous countryman with the tagline "Even Gandhi walked."
Gandhi wore little and ate even less. Yet he may have influenced the citizens of the most prosperous society on earth more than any non-American in modern times.

Texto completo: UNITED NATIONS - The Trump administration barred senior Iranian government officials from entering the United States on Wednesday, just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani as he attended an annual gathering of world leaders in New York.
The order followed a new round of American economic penalties against China, Iran's largest oil customer to further squeeze the Iranian economy and force Tehran into new negotiations to limit its nuclear and military programs.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.
"We want peace and we want a peaceful resolution," Pompeo said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon with President Donald Trump. "In the end, it will be up to the Iranians to make that decision whether they choose violence and hate."
The White House announced the new travel restrictions on senior Iranian government officials and their family members shortly after the news conference ended. In a statement, it described the Iranian government as a state sponsor of terrorism that threatened the stability of the Middle East and beyond.
It was an extraordinary declaration, given its timing: Rouhani and more than 80 of his top diplomats and aides were in New York attending the annual U.N. General Assembly. However, the travel ban was not expected to force them to leave; the United States generally issues visas to allow foreign leaders to come to UN. headquarters but tightly restricts their movements while in New York.
A similar travel ban was issued against members of President Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela, which the Trump administration is trying to oust.
In a speech to the General Assembly, Rouhani appeared to shut down any attempt at detente with what he called an "enemy who uses sanction and poverty as a tool." He also berated the Trump administration for inviting him to talk while threatening Iran.
"If you want a 'yes' response, then the only road to negotiations is returning to your commitments," Rouhani said, referring to Trump's repudiation of a 2015 nuclear accord that eased international sanctions in return for limiting Iran's nuclear activities. "A photo opportunity is the last stop, not the first stop."

Beto O'Rourke cites Kent State massacre as he calls for firearm confiscation

Texto completo: Here is a thought: If you are going to advocate for the forcible confiscation of an estimated 16 million rifles from lawful American citizens, it is probably best not to do it against the backdrop of one of the most famous incidents of unarmed citizens being shot to death by government forces.
Looking at you, Beto O’Rourke.
The former Texas congressman, who is still running in the 2020 Democratic primary despite a lack of any sort of meaningful support, appeared at a campaign event Wednesday at Kent State University in Ohio. As O’Rourke spoke about his pet issue of gun control, demonstrators legally open-carrying firearms, including the style of rifle he believes should believe forcibly confiscated by the federal government, made their presence known.
"It is not enough to stop selling AR-15s and AK-47s when there are more than 10 million of those potential instruments of terror," the 2020 candidate said. "We must mandate that every one of them be bought back — back home, off the streets, out of our lives — no longer a threat to every single one of us."
O’Rourke then turned his attention to the protesters specifically, saying, "Nobody should show up with one of these weapons to seek to intimidate us in our own democracy. That's wrong. That's wrong."
His campaign said later on social media, “Yesterday, people brought assault weapons to our rally at Kent State — where 4 students were shot dead in 1970. I told them nobody should show up with an AK-47 or an AR-15 to seek to intimidate us in our own democracy. We need to buy back every single one of them.”
Tweet
As a reminder, this is what happened on Kent State’s campus 49 years ago, as told by the New York Times on May 5, 1970:
KENT, Ohio, May 4 — Four students at Kent State University, two of them women, were shot to death this afternoon by a volley of National Guard gun fire. At least 8 other students were wounded. The burst of gunfire came about 20 minutes after the guardsmen broke up a noon rally on the Commons, a grassy campus gathering spot, by lobbing tear gas at a crowd of about 1,000 young people.
Highlighting one of the most high-profile examples of government forces killing unarmed citizens to advocate for the disarmament of citizens by government forces is probably not the smartest route for a gun control advocate to take. Just a thought.
The funny thing is: O’Rourke has a point about the abuse of open-carry laws. Responsible gun ownership involves educating fellow citizens about existing gun laws, safety, and best practices. Responsible gun-owners ought to challenge the perception that they are intimidating, maybe lawless, and possibly unhinged. They should be mindful and accommodating as well of those who are uncomfortable around firearms. That is a basic courtesy. Showing up to political rallies with the explicit purpose of flaunting firearms to make people uncomfortable is the opposite of all of that, and I say this as a lawful gun owner.
But O’Rourke could not even make these points. Instead, he used the Kent State massacre, of all things, to advocate for gun control.
And that, dear reader, is likely one of the reasons why the supposed reincarnation of John F. Kennedy is polling at only 2.5%, according to a RealClearPolitics polling average. He is just not very good at this. That and the fact that his platform still amounts to nothing more than: “Man, I'm just born to be in it."

Texto completo: Los presidentes demócratas de tres comités de la Cámara de Representantes citaron el viernes al Secretario de Estado Mike Pompeo para que entregue documentos relacionados con Ucrania que, según dicen, pertenecen a la investigación de juicio político contra el presidente Trump, reporta Fox News.
Los presidentes de los comités de Asuntos Exteriores, Inteligencia y Supervisión de la Cámara solicitaron inicialmente una larga lista de documentos el 9 de septiembre y enviaron una carta de seguimiento el lunes.
“Su incumplimiento o negativa a cumplir con la citación constituirá evidencia de obstrucción a la investigación de destitución de la Cámara”, escribieron el presidente de Inteligencia, Adam Schiff, D-Calif .; Eliot Engel, presidente de Asuntos Exteriores, D-N.Y .; y el presidente de supervisión Elijah Cummings , D-Md.
Los presidentes mencionados también solicitaron correspondencia y documentos del Departamento de Estado que datan del 20 de enero de 2017 hasta el presente. Los documentos se relacionan con informes de que Trump presionó a los funcionarios ucranianos para que investiguen al posible rival electoral de 2020 Joe Biden, su hijo Hunter y la actividad comercial de los Bidens en Ucrania.
Los legisladores demócratas también exigieron copias de la transcripción de la controvertida llamada de Trump el 25 de julio con el presidente ucraniano Vladimir Zelenski y una lista de funcionarios del Departamento de Estado que podrían haber estado involucrados en la conversación, según la carta. También solicitan cualquier registro del Departamento de Estado sobre Rudy Giuliani, el abogado personal de Trump, y cualquier registro relacionado con la ayuda militar de EE. UU. a Ucrania.
Pompeo tiene hasta el 4 de octubre para cumplir con las solicitudes.
En una carta separada, los presidentes notificaron a Pompeo que habían programado deposiciones para cinco funcionarios del Departamento de Estado entre el 2 y el 10 de octubre.
Esos funcionarios son el ex embajador en Ucrania, Marie Yovanovitch, el Representante Especial de Estados Unidos para las Negociaciones de Ucrania, Kurt Volker, Subsecretario Adjunto George Kent , el Consejero T. Ulrich Brechbuhl y el Embajador de los Estados Unidos en la Unión Europea, Gordon Sondland.
Todos los funcionarios, excepto Kent, son nombrados en una queja por un denunciante de la comunidad de inteligencia que acusó a Trump de “usar el poder de su oficina para solicitar la interferencia de un país extranjero en las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020”.
“El hecho de que ninguno de estos empleados del departamento comparezca para sus deposiciones programadas constituirá evidencia de obstrucción a la investigación de juicio político de la Cámara”, dijeron los presidentes.
NYT reportó la renuncia de Kurt Volker a su cargo el viernes.

Texto completo: Here's a take no one will like: I'm confident he did it. I'm confident it's impeachable. I'm just not so sure he should be impeached for it.
Let's start at the top. It's obvious to me that President Donald Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to launch a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden in order to tarnish the image of the Democrat best positioned to defeat him in 2020.
In the rough transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump says America has been very good to Ukraine, but he wants the relationship to be more "reciprocal." Zelenskiy agrees and asks for more anti-tank missiles to deter ongoing Russian military aggression. Trump responds by asking for a two-part "favor."
First, he asks Zelenskiy to look into the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers (a bat-guano-crazy request, but whatever). Then, Trump mentions "the other thing" he wants.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great," Trump says.
The context matters as much as the text. Trump had already blocked the transfer of congressionally approved military aid. Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had been hectoring the Ukrainians for months to go after Biden (and it remains his singular obsession even now). Giuliani even admitted it last May in an interview with The New York Times. He said he was lobbying the Ukrainians to investigate Biden because "that information will be very, very helpful to my client."
And that's why Trump asked Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani.
There's more context as well. There were reportedly other calls in which Trump importuned the Ukrainians this way. Trump's explanation for why he froze the military aid to Ukraine in the first place keeps changing. On Monday, he said he blocked it out of concern over Ukrainian corruption (the only corruption in the world he's passionate about, apparently). On Tuesday, he said the real reason was that he wanted our allies to pony up even more money for the government he claimed was too corrupt for our aid in the first place.
Normally you'd think an inadvertent confession would settle things. But when Trump said of his call with Ukraine, "There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden," the assumption was that he misspoke.
We also learned Thursday that the "whistleblower" alleges the White House took extraordinary measures to hide the transcript of the call, which, if true, suggests wiser heads understood that the conversation crossed a line.
Regardless, I think Trump did it. I think it's obvious he did it. I think as more facts come to light, it will become even more obvious he did it. I also think it's obvious that this is an impeachable offense.
However, that doesn't mean I'm persuaded he must be impeached over it.
Impeachment doesn't mean "removal from office." It's the political equivalent of a grand jury indictment, with the House fully empowered to impeach any action it deems impeachable. It's up to the Senate to decide whether a president should be removed.
The Federalist Papers are clear: Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. Illegal acts are surely impeachable, but not all impeachable acts are illegal. If the president stood on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and shouted obscenities on national television while dancing in the nude, that would be impeachable but not illegal (FCC violations notwithstanding).
Impeachment is ultimately a question of whether a president violated the public trust. But there's nothing in the Constitution that says a president must be impeached for violating the public trust. I can list any number of occasions when presidents have done that and it never even occurred to anyone that they should be impeached for it.
It's a prudential question with good arguments on both sides. If I were Nancy Pelosi, I'd be even more torn than she's clearly been. In the modern era, we've never had the drama of an impeachment process in a president's first term or in the run-up to a reelection. We've never had a lot of things that we've had under Trump.
Absent new facts, the GOP-controlled Senate will not remove Trump. The president would claim "exoneration," and his behavior would become normalized for future presidents. So I'm not sure Democrats are right to pursue impeachment. I'm sure Republicans are wrong to pretend that what Trump did was totally fine.

Now Trump's risking whistleblower's life

Texto completo: We now know that the government official who blew the whistle on President Donald Trump's attempts to use a foreign government for his own corrupt purposes was, according to The New York Times, a member of the CIA detailed to the White House. We should not know this, because in a matter of days or perhaps hours -- maybe even by the time you read this -- we will probably know the man's name and everything else about him.
This is a problem, because there are people who want to do harm to this whistleblower and his colleagues. Prominent among them is the president of the United States himself, who has already said that he would like to know the identities of those who have placed him in jeopardy (or, in yet more jeopardy) of impeachment. Indeed, Trump thinks the whistleblower should be dealt with as an enemy spy and a traitor to the state.
In his usual emulation of the mob bosses and dictators he admires, the president said: "I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now."
Trump means the death penalty, of course.
This is the same president who thought he could mend fences with the intelligence community at the start of his term by giving a speech at the most sacred place at the Central Intelligence Agency, in front of the wall of unmarked stars that commemorate American intelligence professionals who gave their lives in the course of their duties. As usual, Trump couldn't help himself, and instead of showing respect to the people who died in anonymity to protect the nation, he talked about his favorite subject: himself.
National security
This time, a CIA officer is trying to protect his nation by warning his superiors of a danger emanating from the Oval Office itself. This was not some rogue nitwit stuffing classified material in her pantyhose like Reality Winner, or a self-important stooge like Edward Snowden collaborating with our avowed enemies overseas.
This is an intelligence community professional who, as Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire confirmed repeatedly to the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, went through all the proper channels and observed every legal necessity to alert his colleagues that the president was trying to muscle an American friend under attack by Russia into doing his personal bidding.
The whistleblower's reward for observing proper procedure has been a chorus of orchestrated Republican talking points aimed at discrediting him and his motives. The message from the GOP is clear to this and any other whistleblower who might ever threaten a Republican president: Cross our Dear Leader, and we will destroy you.
Such is the patriotism of a party that is now nothing more than a seedy cult of personality. Even Sen. Mitt Romney -- not exactly a tower of courage himself these days -- said recently about the Republicans trying to avert their eyes from Trump's misdeeds: "I think it's very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that's most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power."
Who's the scum?
Trump's apologists will wave away his comments (including his reference to journalists as "scum") as just another meaningless example of the president's swaggering New York style of verbal venting. It might be acceptable for a rich kid from Queens to talk like a sociopathic mobster or beetle-browed junta enforcer when he's trying to bully the local stonemasons and carpenters on his latest slapdash condo project, but it is utterly unacceptable in a president of the United States. The House Judiciary Committee should add this threat against a CIA officer to its list of impeachable offenses.
Trump's unhinged rhetoric has inspired unstable people to take matters into their own hands, including one who is now in prison for sending bombs. The president must be called to account for his abuses of power sooner rather than later, but every decent American left in public life must immediately demand that he stop any further attacks on this whistleblower, before it's too late and there's another star on the wall at Langley.

Life &amp; Arts -- Television Review: 'The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia': Fair Weather Friend?

Texto completo: The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia
Tuesday, 9 p.m., PBS
The PBS investigative program "Frontline" begins its 38th season Tuesday with a murder story -- though this one might also be called "Anatomy of a Police State." Given that Americans are likely en route to defend the state in question, calling the show a "must see" doesn't quite do it justice.
"The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia" examines the power trajectory and policies of the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, Mohammed bin Salman, who is suspected of ordering the gruesome murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 2 of last year. The Central Intelligence Agency thinks he did it; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he didn't. Veteran reporter and documentarian Martin Smith does manage to get MbS, as he's been branded, to address his complicity in the killing directly, with the results being less than entirely satisfying. "It happened on my watch," he says, essentially admitting nothing. Given that there's no smoking bone saw, so to speak, the prince's support at the Trump White House has been unwavering.
And yet the case Mr. Smith builds against MbS -- bit by incremental bit, with the input of ex-CIA agents, Middle East analysts and journalists, including The Wall Street Journal's Warren Strobel, who was made privy to damning information presumably from inside the CIA -- would seem enough to convince most juries that the death of Mr. Khashoggi satisfied a royal decree.
What's invaluable about the documentary, which was co-written by Mr. Smith and Linda Hirsch, is that within the frame of its portrayal an outrageous murder hardly seems like an aberration.
When he was first designated heir in 2017 by his father, King Salman (who simultaneously pushed out the once-powerful Mohammed bin Nayef), MbS became a darling of progressives: He reined in the religious police, lifted the ban on women drivers and embraced various aspects of Western culture, notably Hollywood movies. As we're shown, Michael Bloomberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, the New York Times's Thomas Friedman and Harvard University, among others, lined up to drink the MbS Kool-Aid.
The bread-and-circuses aspects of the prince's reforms -- and his initial foray into global P.R. -- will not be lost on viewers of "The Crown Prince," which proceeds to unveil the real Saudi royal agenda: In addition to consolidating his powers in a manner described as Putinesque, the prince has waged a three-year proxy war against Iran in Yemen; condoned a policy of imprisonment, torture and sexual humiliation against women dissidents; waged a cyberwar against his own citizens (with the assistance of the Zelig-like Saud al-Qahtani, who is also implicated in the Khashoggi murder); and even jailed an economist, for questioning the valuation of Aramco, the state oil company.
Mr. Smith doesn't always get the right answers, but he always asks the right questions. He's dogged, while never overly impassioned or indignant; he's relentless, but can be almost gentle. "What Trump seemed to have forgotten," he says politely -- regarding White House support of the Saudi-instigated diplomatic crisis with Qatar in 2017 -- "was that Qatar is a major U.S. ally that hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East." As explained, the ostensible reasons for the Saudi-Qatar hostilities are Qatar's relations with Iran and its support of the news service Al-Jazeera, but the subtext is personal power: The prince, says Middle East analyst Emile Hokayem, "wants to turn Qatar into a vassal state."
"The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia" is, to repeat, a murder story, circling back again and again to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi and making a convincing case. And not only about that murder. Regardless of where viewers sit, or stand, they'll spend two hours riveted.

Embattled Leader of Hong Kong Comes Face to Face With Angry Residents

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- After months of public unrest and criticism that she was ignoring the demands of protesters, Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, came face to face on Thursday with the fury and frustration coursing through the city during a question-and-answer session billed as a community dialogue.
Inside a stadium ringed by hundreds of chanting protesters, Mrs. Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive, acknowledged the widespread anger after 16 weeks of protests that have presented the government with its biggest political challenge in decades.
"In recent days, the people have lost trust in the police and the government. This is hard to fathom but it is a reality," she said. "In a time when trust is lacking, we need to have a dialogue with one another."
Many of the 70 people randomly chosen to ask questions among the 150 allowed inside were visibly emotional, and they did not mince words, harshly criticizing Mrs. Lam and at times ending their allotted three minutes by reciting a phrase often heard during raucous street protests: "Five demands, not one less."
They expressed anger over the detention of protesters, asked why the government had so far refused to appoint an independent panel to investigate allegations of police brutality, and one woman lobbed an insult at Mrs. Lam and demanded she resign.
[ What to know about Hong Kong's protests .]
"You may be a really smart official, and I believe you are really tough -- but you are not fit to rule," the woman said, drawing hearty applause from the audience.
There was widespread public cynicism surrounding the session even before Mrs. Lam stepped onstage at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in the Wan Chai neighborhood. Given that Mrs. Lam largely serves at the pleasure of the Chinese leadership in Beijing, she will most likely be unable to satisfy a primary demand of young protesters: genuine democracy. That point was made abundantly clear on Wednesday by a top Chinese official at the Foreign Ministry's Hong Kong office, who told reporters that further concessions were out of the question.
Midway through the session on Thursday, one speaker sought to highlight the elephant in the room. "We all know you are not in charge," he said, "so there's not much to say, really."
Mrs. Lam announced one notable concession, saying the police would no longer send protesters to the widely despised San Uk Ling detention center after a public outcry over allegations of abuse there.
Outside the stadium, hundreds of protesters formed a human chain and chanted slogans asking that Mrs. Lam meet their demands, including an independent investigation into allegations of police abuse and amnesty for the more than 1,500 protesters who have been arrested over the past three months. Mrs. Lam has previously rejected those demands.
"This forum is just a political stunt, because our demands have always been clear but she has never listened to us," said Amanda Au, 15, who came directly from school and was wearing a crisp white school uniform and a black face mask.
After the event ended, protesters massed near the entrances of the stadium, calling on one another to block the road so that Mrs. Lam's car could not leave. Police officers with batons and shields stood in a row inside the stadium as chants grew more raucous outside.
In an Op-Ed for The New York Times that was published on Wednesday, Mrs. Lam wrote: "It remains this government's hope that conversation will triumph over conflict and that through its actions, calm can be restored and trust can be rebuilt within the community.
She also wrote that in an upcoming policy address she would be laying out "bold initiatives to tackle deep-seated problems, such as access to affordable housing."
Hong Kong is bracing for more protests and clashes in the coming week, with demonstrations likely to happen on Saturday, the fifth anniversary of the start of the 2014 Umbrella Movement; on Sunday, in a global march against totalitarianism; and on Tuesday, Oct. 1, a national holiday that this year commemorates the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The government said the community talks on Thursday were designed to be open to participants with a wide variety of political views, though most of the speakers were critical of Mrs. Lam's response to the unrest. The 150 participants invited to the stadium on Thursday were selected through a lottery from more than 20,000 people who had registered online.
People were searched before entering the stadium. Protective gear commonly worn by protesters, including respirator masks and helmets, was banned, but a number of speakers wore face masks in a gesture of defiance. Mrs. Lam, a soft-spoken bureaucrat, listened patiently for more than two hours and repeatedly appealed for understanding. "Don't say I can't hear your voices," she said plaintively. "I hear your voices."
In July, Mrs. Lam offered to speak with students in closed-door meetings, but university student unions publicly rebuffed the idea, calling for more transparency. In a closed meeting with business leaders, Mrs. Lam said she would quit if she could, according to a leaked audio recording published by Reuters.
During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, amid protests that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong's central business district for months, Mrs. Lam, then chief secretary, met with five student leaders in a session that was broadcast live on television. Those talks, during which the protest leaders demanded that Hong Kong voters be given the right to directly elect their leaders, were largely seen as a failure. Four of those students were later arrested, and three sentenced to prison.

Texto completo: This early version of the striking "Women of Algiers" was lost for more than a century and a half, until a French gallerist encountered it.
The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, has acquired a long-lost early version of Eugène Delacroix's famed 1834 masterpiece, "Women of Algiers in Their Apartment," that hangs at the Louvre in Paris.
The sumptuously colored 18-inch-high canvas, showing an elaborately dressed woman and a maidservant in a Moorish interior, had been in a Paris apartment until the private collector who owned it, suspecting it might be a Delacroix, reached out to the French art dealer Philippe Mendes in 2018.
His research revealed the work to have been owned by Count Charles-Edgar de Mornay. In 1832, the count led a French diplomatic mission to North Africa, and Delacroix, eager to experience the culture there, accompanied him. The painting disappeared from public sight when the count sold it at auction in 1850.
During Delacroix's six-month journey, a port authority official in Algiers, who was a Muslim, took the unusual step of inviting the artist into his home and allowing him to sketch the women of his household. The reclining woman in the Houston canvas, painted a year after the visit, is derived from one of those studies. The slightly later, much larger Louvre canvas, painted in landscape rather than portrait format, includes two more female figures recorded in those sketches. That pioneering work, depicting an intimate North African subject on a monumental scale, was one of the star pieces in the 2018 Delacroix retrospective organized by the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
Delacroix painted a third version of the subject in 1847-49. Just over a century later, Picasso painted more than a dozen versions of Delacroix's "Women of Algiers."
"We didn't know he created a first version of the composition," said Gary Tinterow, the Margaret Alkek Williams director of the museum in Houston. "It shows us how Delacroix composed in an additive fashion."
The work in Houston, purchased for an undisclosed sum from Mr. Mendes, has been authenticated by the leading Delacroix expert, Virginie Cauchi-Fatiga. It will be shown in Houston starting Oct. 3.
Mr. Tinterow said that Delacroix was the first artist to introduce North African motifs to the Paris Salon. "This makes a fine Orientalist painting by Delacroix, a holy grail for collectors of his work," he said. He noted that the painting was made shortly after France invaded Algeria in 1830.
Roberta Smith co-chief art critic at The New York Times, writing about the Louvre version of the painting in a review of the 2018 retrospective, said, "Criticisms that this and similar works amplify the male gaze with colonialist power dynamics are well deserved, but the scale and self-containment of these women are welcome in a show where so many are presented for display, abducted or killed."

Texto completo: Does your mind wander? Do your managers stop you in the middle of presentations to ask, "What are you thinking?" Do you constantly lose your car keys, not remembering you don't own a car?
These are classic symptoms of people who have trouble with focus.
I'm not a neurologist, or a psychiatrist, or even a veterinarian, but I do believe that an inability to focus is the result of too many distractions. So does Chris Bailey, a productivity consultant and the author of the opinion piece, "Distracted? Work Harder!" (The article appeared in The New York Times over a year ago. I would have brought it to your attention earlier, but I was distracted by the 10th season of "The Bachelor." This is a temporary situation. I only have 13 seasons to go.)
The way Bailey sees it, the real reason for being distracted is not the constantly breaking and infinitely depressing news flow or the urgent posts from friends on Facebook. (Yes, it is exciting that your college roommate has a new goldfish, but is this any reason to forget the Monday morning staff meeting?)
The problem is your work. It simply "isn't complex enough" and "there isn't enough of it."
"This idea isn't a popular one," Bailey admits, "especially with those who feel they're already working at capacity." Is it a popular idea with you? Before you say yes, try to remember the last time you went to your supervisor to ask for more work -- and the more complex, the better.
I thought so.
Author Bailey endorses complex assignments because they "demand more of our working memory." (What they do to your goofing-off memory is not considered.) By taking on a difficult and demanding assignment, your mind doesn't have time to be seduced by the distractions around you such as the internet, the cellphone or the centerfold in your monthly copy of Miniature Donkey Talk magazine.
On the other hand, the total immersion required by a complex project will make you more productive. If you doubt it, immerse yourself in "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience," a book by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (or, as his closest friends call him, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi).
To achieve flow at your job, you want to approach every assignment with the level of concentration demanded of, say, an ice climber clinging to a frozen waterfall with grizzly bears nipping at their heels.
Chris Bailey calls this state of total attention "hyperfocus." It can only be experienced when "the challenge of completing a task is roughly equal to our ability to complete it." While the assignments you receive at work may be equal to the ability of a banana slug, you can find areas of your life where a high level of complexity leaves no room for distractions to slip in.
Yes, I'm talking about the menu at McDonald's. So many choices. So many decisions. Simply contemplating the varieties of McNugget offerings produces a state of flow so fluid it passes and surpasses the hyperfocus required by that ice-climbing idiot, risking their life to climb a popsicle.
And what if your regular work assignments do not equal the death-defying feats of an ice climber or the mind-absorbing effort of navigating the menu at Mickey D's? You are advised to ask for more work.
If asking for more mind-bending, bone-crushing assignments goes against your moral code, there are ways you can limit distractions without taking up ice climbing -- ways that go far, far beyond Chris Bailey's suggestion of "downloading a distraction-blocking application for your computer" and "putting your phone in Do Not Disturb mode."
As your first step to going distraction-free, pick up a chainsaw and go Stephen King on your computer and your cellphone. You can also rip the electric wires from under your cubical floor and fill the USB outlets with chocolate pudding. If this doesn't work, have your manager move your workstation to a dark, damp cave. There are very few distractions in a cave, assuming you pay no attention to the spiders and the bats.
Working in a cave to cure a lack of focus may seem like an extreme solution, but the productivity generated by removing distractions could be a game changer. As Chris Bailey says, "once we've removed distractions ... we discover how much, or how little, we truly have on our plate."
Which brings us back to that menu at McDonald's.
I say, fill your plate with the vegetarian wings. They're epic!

Texto completo: The PBS investigative program "Frontline" begins its 38th season Tuesday with a murder story—though this one might also be called "Anatomy of a Police State." Given that Americans are likely en route to defend the state in question, calling the show a "must see" doesn't quite do it justice.
The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia
Tuesday, 9 p.m., PBS
* 'Now Hear This: The Riddle of Bach'
"The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia" examines the power trajectory and policies of the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, Mohammed bin Salman, who is suspected of ordering the gruesome murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 2 of last year. The Central Intelligence Agency thinks he did it; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he didn't. Veteran reporter and documentarian Martin Smith does manage to get MbS, as he's been branded, to address his complicity in the killing directly, with the results being less than entirely satisfying. "It happened on my watch," he says, essentially admitting nothing. Given that there's no smoking bone saw, so to speak, the prince's support at the Trump White House has been unwavering.
And yet the case Mr. Smith builds against MbS—bit by incremental bit, with the input of ex-CIA agents, Middle East analysts and journalists, including The Wall Street Journal's Warren Strobel, who was made privy to damning information presumably from inside the CIA—would seem enough to convince most juries that the death of Mr. Khashoggi satisfied a royal decree.
What's invaluable about the documentary, which was co-written by Mr. Smith and Linda Hirsch, is that within the frame of its portrayal an outrageous murder hardly seems like an aberration.
When he was first designated heir in 2017 by his father, King Salman (who simultaneously pushed out the once-powerful Mohammed bin Nayef), MbS became a darling of progressives: He reined in the religious police, lifted the ban on women drivers and embraced various aspects of Western culture, notably Hollywood movies. As we're shown, Michael Bloomberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, the New York Times's Thomas Friedman and Harvard University, among others, lined up to drink the MbS Kool-Aid.
The bread-and-circuses aspects of the prince's reforms—and his initial foray into global P.R.—will not be lost on viewers of "The Crown Prince," which proceeds to unveil the real Saudi royal agenda: In addition to consolidating his powers in a manner described as Putinesque, the prince has waged a three-year proxy war against Iran in Yemen; condoned a policy of imprisonment, torture and sexual humiliation against women dissidents; waged a cyberwar against his own citizens (with the assistance of the Zelig-like Saud al-Qahtani, who is also implicated in the Khashoggi murder); and even jailed an economist, for questioning the valuation of Aramco, the state oil company.
Mr. Smith doesn't always get the right answers, but he always asks the right questions. He's dogged, while never overly impassioned or indignant; he's relentless, but can be almost gentle. "What Trump seemed to have forgotten," he says politely—regarding White House support of the Saudi-instigated diplomatic crisis with Qatar in 2017—"was that Qatar is a major U.S. ally that hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East." As explained, the ostensible reasons for the Saudi-Qatar hostilities are Qatar's relations with Iran and its support of the news service Al-Jazeera, but the subtext is personal power: The prince, says Middle East analyst Emile Hokayem, "wants to turn Qatar into a vassal state."
"The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia" is, to repeat, a murder story, circling back again and again to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi and making a convincing case. And not only about that murder. Regardless of where viewers sit, or stand, they'll spend two hours riveted.

The Senate Takes On Campus Censorship

Texto completo: Universities have long been centers of political correctness. But campus administrations increasingly seem to be indulging students who, when faced with uncomfortable ideas, complain of feeling "harmed" or "unsafe." This is reaching its breaking point and making it hard for professors to teach.
As part of my oversight work in the Senate, I'm seeking answers from some of the nation's top universities about incidents that have taken place on their campuses. These incidents give me concern about the state of academic freedom:
-- Last spring, Harvard dismissed Ronald Sullivan and his wife, Stephanie Robinson, as faculty deans of the residential college Winthrop House. Their offense? Mr. Sullivan, who is also a defense lawyer, had agreed to join Harvey Weinstein's legal team. Every criminal defendant in this country, rich or poor, should have access to a lawyer. The American Bar Association states that a lawyer's client representation is not an endorsement of that client's activities. But students protested and are suspected of vandalizing areas outside Mr. Sullivan's home with graffiti stating "Down w Sullivan!" Administrators caved in to the protesters, and the couple were forced out of their administrative roles.
-- Duke fired an award-winning professor, Evan Charney, after 20 years. The reason? He challenged his students to think beyond their own ideology with a "radical free speech" teaching method. Duke's administration cited the professor for a "tendency to provoke negative reactions, and perhaps harm" his students. If asking students to consider arguments other than their own and analyze an issue from all angles causes "harm," I think it's fair to ask what the point of higher education is.
-- A professor at Sarah Lawrence College, Samuel Abrams, published an op-ed piece in the New York Times last October discussing the widespread liberalism among college administrators. Students responded by defacing his office door and demanding he be fired. Media reports indicate school administrators may have taken a blame-the-victim approach, supposedly even accusing the professor of creating a "hostile work environment."
-- In March, two Villanova professors, Colleen Sheehan and James Matthew Wilson, wrote in these pages how new course-evaluation questions, such as rating professors on "diversity and inclusion," have created a chilling academic environment in which faculty are afraid to teach once-common subjects such as Frederick Douglass. They're even afraid to teach "Catholic doctrine on marriage and the family" at Villanova -- a Catholic school.
Campuses were once places of vigorous debate. Now many appear dominated by groups of angry students with closed minds and the administrators who kowtow to them. On many campuses, "Bias response teams" investigate allegations of supposed discrimination. True cases of discrimination need to be investigated and handled with care. But media reports indicate many such complaints are frivolous and politically motivated.
Students who can think critically for themselves are best equipped to tackle the most difficult challenges we face in our democracy. College professors must be free to teach in order for this to happen.

Mr. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

Texto completo: There was a viral video going around this month that got the attention of Texas guitar hero Gary Clark Jr. The clip captured a moment of innocence in an unnamed American city as a pair of toddler boys, one black and one white, recognized each other on the sidewalk and ran into a brotherly embrace.
"That's what life is like before the old ways start to infiltrate their lives," says Clark, 35, who grew up in Austin, with his own memories of casual racist slurs and worse as a young African American in central Texas.
Protest and social justice haven't previously been the central focus of Clark's songs, with a few notable exceptions on his first two studio releases for Warner Records. He's been celebrated mainly as a next-generation master of molten blues guitar and a new hope for old ways in the digital era, but his latest album, "This Land," begins with a title song of genuine anger and deep, raging funk.

"Right in the middle of Trump Country ... I see you looking out your window," he sings, outraged and practically taunting a race-baiting neighbor named "Mr. Williams" amid blasts of organ and guitar. "Can't wait to call the police on me." The words were inspired by a real incident outside his 50-acre ranch near Austin, where a white neighbor asked to speak with the owner, not believing that a black man could possibly afford to own the property. Clark's 3-year-old son witnessed their heated confrontation.
"I kind of stay in my lane -- I'm quiet. I've always had songs of protest, but nothing so blatant," says Clark, who points to vintage outspoken songs by Big Bill Broonzy, Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie as inspiration. "It's just been in the news. I wanted to express my take on it."
In interviews, Clark tends to be laid back and welcoming, a sharply dressed but unpretentious rocker of few words. But as he spoke recently from a tour stop in Seattle, he was in an especially talkative mood, reemphasizing the message of "This Land" and his means of expressing it.
"I'm surrounded by more love and positivity than I am negative. But [racism] has also had an impact on my life and on the way that I see things."
The explosive song was the last written and recorded for the album. For Clark, who headlines the Hollywood Bowl this Sunday, it was just part of an evolving statement of purpose as a musician and a claim on the present. Across many of its 16 songs, the guitarist strays far beyond blues nostalgia and samples a variety of sounds and styles, from folk to reggae to punk, fusing them into something of his own.
"What About Us" is seething, swaggering funk in the Sly Stone tradition, taking on his "Mr. Williams" again with a message on evolving America: "You can call it what you want, but the young bloods taking over / Don't get too comfortable, just plan on moving over."
In recent years, Clark has collaborated on records by Alicia Keys, Childish Gambino and Tech N9ne, suggesting other paths to explore. "Blues, gospel, folk, country, that's American music," he says. "That's where we come from. I know the past, but I want to be a part of the future too. I don't want to be a museum piece."
"This Land," a leading rock contender for Grammy recognition this season, earned accolades from critics at Pitchfork and the New York Times alike. It debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, matching the performance of his 2012 major-label debut, "Blak and Blu."
Clark is a major draw on the road and in 2019 has had stops at Lollapalooza and Red Rocks without a large radio presence. At Warner, his A&R guru Lenny Waronker helped sign him after a 2010 performance at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Festival. A longtime record executive, Waronker believes guitar-based music will continue to find a place in the hip-hop-driven streaming era. "When somebody has such facility and knows how to weave it into different genres," he says," anything's possible."
On stage, Clark stands tall beneath a wide-brimmed hat, a soft-spoken gunslinger who lets his music do the shouting, as he unfurls a lava flow of melody and muscle on electric guitar. He's been touring with the same lineup of complementary musicians since 2011 but prefers to do much of the playing by himself in the studio.
Back in July, Clark performed at a Texas-style BBQ for an industry crowd in Hollywood to share a bit of his hometown culture and promote his Grammy prospects. His wife, model Nicole Trunfio, was there with their two small children and pregnant with their third.
Clark was an Austin teenage phenomenon embraced by the blues and rock community of the renowned local nightclub Antone's and beginning to draw outsize attention. He grew up in nearby suburbia, the son of a car salesman father and accountant mother, where the soundtrack in constant rotation included the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Dionne Warwick.
That influence can be heard in the Prince-flavored "Pearl Cadillac," a warm tribute to his mother, and the deep classic soul of "Feed the Babies," weaving brass, organ and guitar with Clark's aching falsetto.
"This Land," recorded in Austin (with co-producer Jacob Sciba), was designed to return him to a time of excitement and innocence, destination unknown. "I wanted to be at home with people that I trust and make music the way I used to make it, when I was a 15-year-old in the garage," Clark says. "That's what gave me the most happiness, the most freedom."
As Clark heads to the Bowl for his biggest Los Angeles headline show yet, the comparisons to Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan will continue as long as he wields his guitar so skillfully. "Yeah, the blues is my foundation," he says, "but that's just because you've got to know your history before you can figure out where you're trying to go."

Texto completo: Headnote Check It Out
Last month, Democratic presidential front-runner, Joe Biden, was accused of racism after a town hall meeting hosted by the Asian & Latino Coalition in Des Moines, Iowa. (The host group was made up of Asians and Latinos, but the audience Biden addressed was mostly White.) Newspapers across the country quoted Biden saying, "We should challenge students in these schools...We have this notion that somehow if you're poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as White kids."
Here, Biden's tongue slipped. He said "White kids" when he meant "wealthy kids," but Biden caught the error, corrected himself, and the audience applauded. But a New York Times headline said: Biden says "poor kids" are just as bright as "White kids," and Biden was accused of assuming "Whites" had superior intelligence.
Then I watched the video footage of Biden in Iowa and discovered there was a sentence missing from the quote in print. Right after Biden said "we should challenge students in these schools," he mentioned that "these schools should have advanced placement programs."
That sentence makes a big difference.
According to a University of New Hampshire study, the availability of advanced placement courses decreases as schools get smaller and farther from major cities. The study found rural students have considerably less access to AP courses than their peers in more urban areas: 47.2 percent of rural school districts have no students enrolled in AP courses, compared with only 20.1 from town districts, 5.4 from suburban districts, and 2.6 from urban districts.
Maybe, in Iowa, Biden tried to address something the Democratic Party's 2016 nominee ignored.
At the recent Democratic presidential debate, an ABC News moderator informed Biden that she wanted to discuss inequality in schools and race. She set up her question by reminding Biden of comments he made 40 years ago against reparations for slavery, then asked what responsibility Americans had to repair the legacy of slavery?
Biden stumbled through his answer, and after the debate, Biden was attacked for insulting Black parents. Biden began by admitting there was institutional segregation, but it was addressed by the federal government. He listed his education proposals such as tripling the amount of money spent on poor schools and increasing teachers' pay. Then Biden mentioned support systems and bringing in the help students need. Biden stated, "the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. We have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. We have to make sure that every child (three, four, and five years old) goes to school not daycare. We need to bring social workers into the homes to help [parents] deal with and raise their children. It's not that they don't want to help. They don't know quite what to do. Play the radio...Make sure the record player is on at night, make sure they hear words. A child coming from a poor background will hear 4 million fewer words by the time they get to school." But Biden was off the mark here. A study at Stanford University tested the language processing of 18- and 24-month-old toddlers. By 18 months, children in different socioeconomic groups display dramatic differences in their vocabularies. By age 2, the disparity in vocabulary development has grown significantly, and by 3 years of age, there is a 30-million-word gap between children of the wealthiest and poorest families.
Biden tried to put this word gap in the public record, but the public laughed at him for mentioning a record player in the 21st century, and completely ignored the problem Biden was trying to resolve with the outdated device.

Employers Used Facebook to Keep Women and Older Workers From Seeing Job Ads. The Federal Government Thinks That’s Illegal.

Two years ago, ProPublica and The New York Times revealed that companies were posting discriminatory job ads on Facebook, using the social network’s targeting tools to keep older workers from seeing employment opportunities. Then we reported companies were using Facebook to exclude women from seeing job ads.
Experts told us that it was most likely illegal. And it turns out the federal government now agrees.
A group of recent rulings by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found “reasonable cause” to conclude that seven employers violated civil rights protections by excluding women or older workers or both from seeing job ads they posted on Facebook.
The agency’s rulings appear to be the first time it has taken on targeted advertising, the core of Facebook’s business. “It answers the question from the EEOC’s perspective,” former agency commissioner Jenny R. Yang said. “If you’re excluding older workers from seeing your ads for jobs it does violate” anti-discrimination laws. The EEOC declined to comment.
The decisions stem from complaints filed by the Communications Workers of America, the American Civil Liberties Union and plaintiff’s attorneys after our reporting. The agency made the rulings in July, but they are becoming public now as part of a separate pending class-action suit in federal court accusing companies of age discrimination.
The ads are all from 2018 or earlier. Since then, Facebook has agreed in a settlement to make sweeping changes to the way employers, landlords and creditors can target advertising. The changes are scheduled to take effect by the end of the year.
A Facebook spokesperson pointed to the company’s recent changes and said, “Helping prevent discrimination in housing, employment or credit ads is an area we believe we lead the advertising industry.”
In the latest rulings, the EEOC cited four companies for age discrimination: Capital One, Edwards Jones, Enterprise Holdings and DriveTime Automotive Group. Three companies were cited for discrimination by both age and gender: Nebraska Furniture Mart, Renewal by Andersen LLC and Sandhills Publishing Company. The companies can now work out a settlement with the EEOC or go to court.
Read Our Original Investigation
Facebook Lets Advertisers Exclude Users by Race
Facebook’s system allows advertisers to exclude black, Hispanic, and other “ethnic affinities” from seeing ads.
Most of the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nebraska Furniture Mart declined to comment. A spokesperson for financial firm Edwards Jones said, “We strongly disagree with the claim that our firm engaged in discriminatory practices in advertising of job opportunities, recruiting or hiring.”
Dozens of other complaints have been filed with the EEOC about discrimination in targeted advertising on Facebook. Most of the allegations are still pending.
The EEOC’s batch of decisions are significant, attorney Peter Romer-Friedman of Outten & Golden says, because they are the first time companies besides Facebook have had to defend how they use Facebook’s tools to advertise jobs.
His firm also filed a suit against seven real estate companies last week for allegedly discriminating by age in housing ads. We first reported on discriminatory housing ads on Facebook three years ago. The company changed its process for screening housing ads after we retested the system two years ago and showed it was possible to buy dozens of ads that excluded people by gender, race, religion, national origin, age and other categories protected by civil rights laws.

Texto completo: Science and entertainment come together 7:30 p.m. Thursday when the Squirrel Census comes back to Atlanta, celebrating their adventures in New York's Central Park. Including a multimedia presentation, the event takes place at Constellations, 135 Auburn Ave., Atlanta.
The Squirrel Census, a multimedia science, design and storytelling project, focuses on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis) in Central Park. In October 2018, Atlantan Jamie Allen and his team, tallied the squirrels in New York.
This first phase of the Central Park Squirrel Census--the on-the-ground research and data-gathering conducted by the Squirrel Census Team and over 300 volunteers, with help from the Explorers Club, NYU Department of Environmental Studies, Macaulay Honors College, the Central Park Conservancy and New York City Department of Parks & Recreation -- was covered in a number of media outlets, including The New York Times and Popular Science. Additionally, they have performed two counts of Inman Park (Atlanta's first suburban settlement, in 2012 and 2015).

Texto completo: "Fleabag," Billy Porter, a plague of Masked Singers. Here were some of the highs and lows of Sunday's Emmy extravaganza.
The 71st Primetime Emmy Awards began with awards for "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" and ended with a final big win for "Game of Thrones." But between those expected results were plenty of genuine surprises and exciting outcomes. "Fleabag," Phoebe Waller-Bridge's biting and moving Amazon series, dominated the comedy category, including beating out the longtime Emmy favorite "Veep" for top comedy. Unexpected but welcome acting awards went to Jodie Comer and Waller-Bridge. Billy Porter made history as the first openly gay winner for best actor in a drama. Michelle Williams and Patricia Arquette gave memorably heartfelt acceptance speeches.
Inevitably, some bits flopped hard: A misguided announcing gimmick tried people's patience and Masked Singers infested the Microsoft Theater like gigantic, colorful vermin. Here are some of the highs and lows of Sunday's Emmy extravaganza. -- JEREMY EGNER
Homer and Friends Fill the Host Void
Much of the pre-ceremony coverage focused on the fact that the Emmys were going hostless this year, and sure enough the night opened with none other than Homer Simpson, who appeared to stroll across the stage (augmented-reality-style) before getting leveled by an animated piano.
The bit went on with Anthony Anderson, star of "Black-ish," leaping from his seat. "We're going to go without a host tonight!" he said, making it his mission to save the show. He found his savior in the multi-Emmy winner Bryan Cranston, who introduced a montage of clips by saying: "Television has never been this damn good."
The opening was A-list enough that some viewers may not have even realized there wasn't a ringleader. Or at least, didn't care.
But some people did, or at least pretended to, which prompted plenty of laughs from the audience. In a bit later in the telecast, the late-night hosts Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel dragged the show's format. "Well, well, well, how's the old no-host thing going?" Colbert said.
"What a dumb idea," Kimmel responded. "You know what has a host? Applebee's has a host."
We're "the real victims," Colbert said. "If we let this slide, the next thing you know, they'll start using Alexa to present the nominees." Which, of course, cued the voice of Amazon's smart speaker assistant, Alexa: "O.K., here are the nominees for lead actress in a comedy series." -- MAYA SALAM
Thomas Lennon Sort of Agreed With His Critics
In lieu of a host, the actor and comedian Thomas Lennon was on hand to offer commentary and jabs between segments. But the jokey announcing just did not work, which he himself seemed to admit at one point, saying "This is why people don't do this, because it sucks." Part of it was the material -- I'm not sure Chernobyl jokes are the way to go -- but a bigger issue was how tacked on it felt, too separate from the actual broadcast. Some comments felt like a mic was accidentally picking up snark, and the timing never seemed quite right, so it never developed a real rhythm. -- MARGARET LYONS
Phoebe Waller-Bridge: The Pervy, Angry Belle of the Ball
"This is a love story." The line introduced the staggering second season of "Fleabag," and it fairly described the Emmys' reception of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who won awards for writing and starring in the Amazon series, which beat out "Veep" for best comedy and also collected an award for comedy directing. And Waller-Bridge, with the casual, quick-witted charm she displayed in the series, was the insouciant queen of the awards. "It's really wonderful to know, and reassuring," she said, "that a dirty, pervy, angry, messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys." And this year, she made the Emmys her own. -- JAMES PONIEWOZIK
Billy Porter Makes History
Billy Porter, who stars in "Pose," the FX drama set in the New York City ball scene during the 1980s and '90s, broke ground on Sunday. The actor became the first openly gay winner for best actor in a drama, and true-to-form, his speech was soul-stirring and heartfelt. As Porter quoted James Baldwin and asserted that "We all have the right" to exist, the ceremony took on a new layer of significance. -- AISHA HARRIS
Masked and Ubiquitous
Did you know there's a show called "The Masked Singer"? If you watched this year's Emmy ceremony, you certainly know now.
It's to be expected, of course, that the network showcasing the awards will find opportunities to plug their own content. But the shilling for Fox's bizarre-o competition show -- in which celebrities of varying stature and relevance sing pop songs while hidden behind ridiculously elaborate costumes and masks -- was next-level.
Before the ceremony began, the disguised contestants for the upcoming second season were trotted out on the purple carpet. During the show, they popped up onstage, as a logo in the corner of the screen and in multiple commercials. Perhaps worst of all was a too-long and very unfunny bit between the "Masked Singer" host Nick Cannon and one of the judges, Ken Jeong. It's doubtful this overkill converted the once-blissfully oblivious into believers. -- AISHA HARRIS
About That Bit ...
Social media segments are common at awards shows these days, but they're always a complete drag. No one quite seemed to get Jeong and Cannon's tedious TikTok routine, which included making a video of the audience. It was also awkwardly sandwiched between Alex Borstein's speech about her grandmother surviving the Holocaust and the award for best comedy writing, which went to Phoebe Waller-Bridge. It was a lousy bit unto itself, but the placement made it seem even worse. -- MARGARET LYONS
Michelle Williams Brings the House Down
Michelle Williams, named outstanding lead actress in a limited series for "Fosse/Verdon," had one of the most enthusiastically received speeches of the night. It was a rallying cry for giving women in Hollywood the same money and resources as those granted to male actors. "When you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value, and then where do they put that value?" she asked. "They put it into their work."
Williams has drawn the salary short straw before: She was slated to earn less than 1 percent of what her co-star Mark Wahlberg was getting for the film "All the Money in the World." -- NANCY COLEMAN
Your Next Emmy Hosts?
Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Bill Hader presenting the award for best actor in a limited series was bright, silly and short. "What's a limited series, Bill?" "A limited series is a show that's been canceled." The show didn't suffer from a lack of hosts per se, but if the Academy wanted to go a different way next year, consider these two for the gig. -- MARGARET LYONS
A Poignant Moment for the Exonerated Five
Jharrel Jerome's win as best actor in a limited series, for playing a wrongfully convicted youth in Ava DuVernay's "When They See Us," was a welcome surprise enough. But the most striking moment of his acceptance speech came when he called attention to the Exonerated Five -- the men whose story of injustice and racist stereotyping the series brought to life -- who stood, free and vindicated, in the audience. The Emmys is always a celebration of entertainment and imagination, but for a moment it became something else: history. -- JAMES PONIEWOZIK

Texto completo: The New York Times published a scathing opinion of President Trump that featured 40 unique criticisms including that "He genuflects to murderous dictators," and that "He spends hours on end watching television."

The collection of accusations and insults against Trump were penned by David Leonhardt, an Op-Ed columnist for the New York Times who has several critical essays on the president including an assertion that he is a "raging racist," and that migrant detention facilities were Trump's "concentration camps."

The article published on Monday and simply titled, "Donald Trump vs. the United States of America," lays out its intention in a brief, straight-to-the-point lede. "Sometimes it’s worth stepping back to look at the full picture," Leonhardt wrote before listing 40 reasons he feels that Trump is unfit to be president.

"He has pressured a foreign leader to interfere in the 2020 American presidential election," Leonhardt wrote of recent allegations that Trump encouraged the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden.

"He urged a foreign country to intervene in the 2016 presidential election. He divulged classified information to foreign officials," Leonhardt said, further espousing unproven accusations against the president.

"He tells new lies virtually every week — about the economy, voter fraud, even the weather," Leonhardt wrote of the president. "He has aides, as well as members of his own party in Congress, who mock him behind his back as unfit for office," he wrote, citing the content of a book written by legendary reporter Bob Woodward.

"He has encouraged his supporters to commit violence against his political opponents," Leonhardt wrote, linking to his own opinion essay on several of Trump's previous quotes. Leonhardt goes on to assert that the president is guilty of obstructing justice, despite congressional findings to the contrary.

Leonhardt also mentions Trump's repeated criticisms of the late Sen. John McCain, his comment that First Lady Barbara Bush "was nasty to me," and various criticisms he has made toward women as condemnation of his character.

Leonhardt concludes simply, “He is the president of the United States, and he is a threat to virtually everything that the United States should stand for."

Be Transfixed by Vija Celmins’ Simple, Hypnotic Renderings at the Met Breuer

Looking at the work of Vija Celmins requires deep concentration. Not because it is dense with information but, rather, because of what it is lacking. Adornment is expelled, meaning is vanished. They can at first read as cold and impersonal. What is there is simply there: the ocean waves, the desert floor, the night sky are a few of her recurring visual motifs. Standing far enough back, it could be a photograph. But something about the banality catches your eye. Move closer and you see the precise markings of the artist, the time and labor accrued, and realize it is something else altogether. “It is visibly and infinitely handmade,” John Berger wrote of her work.
Shadowed by many of her peers and virtually unknown (or at least underappreciated) by a larger art-viewing audience, Celmins is now the subject of a large-scale retrospective, called “To Fix the Image in Memory,” opening at the Met Breuer on September 24 (the exhibition debuted at SFMOMA in December 2018, and then moved to the Art Gallery of Ontario in May 2019). It is her first major retrospective in over 25 years, and encompasses work—paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints—made between 1964 and the present.

Born in Riga, Latvia in 1938, Celmins spent most of her early life in the throes of war. She and her family managed to escape Latvia in 1944 and, after a number of years in limbo, bouncing from place to place, they arrived in America with the help of a Christian aid organization. The family settled in Indiana, which Celmins told the New York Times in 2017 is “one of the worst states.” She didn’t stay too long. After a stint at the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis, she made her way to California, enrolling at U.C.L.A, meeting other artists and moving to a studio near the beach in Venice, where she began to produce what she has called her “first mature works.”
The biographical details are important here. Those paintings that she began making in California were where she developed her unique way of both looking and being looked at in the work. After becoming increasingly frustrated with futile attempts to make work that stood up to others, she decided to break everything down. Letting her eyes wander around the studio, she began painting what she saw: a space heater, a hot plate, a ripped envelope, a gun. Presented as plainly as possible against murky brown and dark grey backgrounds, they were followed by paintings based on clippings from newspapers burning planes and explosions at sea. Color began to disappear, the paintings rendered in shades of grey. The work became more distant, as if threatening to fade from memory.
Reduction would become a key element in Celmins’s work, which coincided with her move, around 1968, to working almost exclusively with pencil on paper. Obvious representation began to recede. Drawings she made of the surface of the moon or waves in the ocean are abstract in an almost perverse way. They are quiet, calm. There is a hint of something recognizable, but no markers leading you toward a conclusion. They pull you inward, like a whisper, but always leave you in doubt.
This doubt can also be read in the repetition of images. Whole years seem devoted to certain kind of surfaces, which are worked over and over again. Beginning around 1973, Celmins moved from the sea to night constellations and arid desert floors. Working from photographs, the content of these works are in some ways meaningless. What matters are the distinctions that result from the process, an almost unconscious personality that reveals itself within material and gesture. It finds itself as it is being made.
But does this kind of rigorous exercise result in anything more authentic? It’s a question that, in some ways, is embedded in the work, and a question that Clemins herself slyly pokes fun at. Her humor is something that is not often commented on in critical appraisals, but can be seen clearly in a work such as To Fix the Image in Memory , 1977-82, from which the exhibition takes its name. Celmins took eleven rocks found while walking in New Mexico and made bronze casts of each one, later painting the casts to have them appear as duplicates of their source. Placed together, it’s nearly impossible to tell the rocks and non-rocks apart.
That comedy is born out of a deep uneasiness that Celmins’ work brings out in the viewer. Little is left to grasp, which leaves understanding in flux. Because of its context you know this is a work of art, but what it makes it so? The answer is always out of reach. So you continue looking, again and again.

Will America's massive debt really doom us?

Texto completo: America’s massive debt will doom us. That’s common wisdom, but wrong.
In Manhattan, a giant clock displays not only the total – almost $23 trillion for now – but your share, ticking up every second. Pundits say it's trouble. But U. S. debt fears have lurked forever, and those troubles are no closer now than decades ago. In some ways, they’re further off.
Here’s how to see that, using tools that show when debt truly becomes problematic.
The $23 trillion total seems jaw-dropping but says little about what really matters: How readily Uncle Sam can pay the piper.
Pundits cite our debt-to-GDP ratio as evidence of a debt addiction. With $21 trillion of GDP, that ratio is 103% — lower than Italy’s and Japan’s, but higher than Germany’s and Britain's. Debt topping GDP sounds dire. But that's misleading. The federal government itself owns more than a quarter of U. S. debt, money the government essentially owes itself. It’s an accounting entry. As an asset and a liability, it effectively cancels out. Otherwise, net outstanding public debt is $16. 7 trillion— 76% of GDP. That’s still unimportant.
Walmart ends seat recycling Walmart ending car seat recycling event early due to 'overwhelming response'
Studebakers shine at vintage shows: The automaker died but its cars live on
Why? Because debt-to-GDP is apples-to-nonsense. Debt piles up year after year. GDP is an estimate of economic activity in a single year, ignoring long-term assets that back a country’s liabilities. America’s hard assets via Federal Reserve data — business equity, real estate, fixed income holdings, cash — amount to $175. 3 trillion, 10 times public debt. But again, that's irrelevant.
Government solvency isn’t about paying off debt. It’s about affording interest payments and rolling over maturing bonds. Currently, annual U. S. interest payments represent just 9. 8% of tax revenues, lower than any time in the 1980s and 1990s, when they peaked at 18. 4%. If debt didn’t doom us then, why would it now?
Naysayers often rebut that by saying it’s all thanks to low-interest rates, which may reverse. Fair point. A 30-year Treasury bought 30 years ago carried 8. 15% interest. Today, we can refinance at about 2%, a heckuva deal. Plus,10-year debt is cheaper too. But rates only matter to the government’s finances at issuance. Since America’s debt averages about six years in maturity, short-term rate wiggles don’t create danger.
For debt to become a problem, Uncle Sam must spend like a drunken sailor for decades (which he may). Or interest rates must skyrocket and stay there, with the country's interest payments ballooning and investors demanding more return for more risk. Do you see any signs of that now? Maybe someday. But not any time soon.
Pockets of debt trouble do exist around the world. To see them, look to markets. Compare low-default-risk Treasury rates to similar-maturity rates from other issuers — it's called a credit spread. For example, South Africa and Turkey are both suffering significant debt pressure. How do you know? America can borrow for 10 years at 1. 62%. Investors demand 8. 82% to lend to South Africa. Turkish rates are 15. 18%.
Use that same approach to assess corporate debt. Corporate America doesn’t have a debt problem, despite frequent fears that hinge on its debt total alone. Overall corporate spreads have declined this year. To be sure, oil price pressures have squeezed the tiniest U. S. shale-oil drillers. Bonds of less-creditworthy drillers now yield 10. 3%, up from 7. 4% a year ago. That rise — while rates overall plunged — signals trouble. No shock: Driller defaults are climbing.
But while problems with debt darken isolated patches, debt doom doesn’t loom over America.

Is a new car always the best? Think again

Texto completo: From the first month of ownership, you'd owe more on your car than it's worth. Four years later, you'd still have a year or two of payments left, but your car would've lost most of its value.
Car payments are so prevalent in society today that people think they're a normal part of life. But if you took the average car payment of $545 and invested it into a Roth IRA instead, 30 years later you'd be sitting on a cool $1.4million.
Look, I like my car too – but not that much!
For me, that's motivation enough to save up and pay cash for a car instead of financing one. But I get plenty of objections to this way of thinking.
Here are some of the excuses I hear. And the truth about them:
'But the 0% interest rate is a great deal!' No, it's not. That new car starts losing value the instant you drive it off the lot.
From the first month of ownership, you'd owe more on your car than it's worth. Four years later, you'd still have a year or two of payments left, but your car would've lost most of its value.
And let's not forget that 0% is not the same as cash, and not everyone who falls for the 0% marketing pitch actually qualifies for the deal. But by then, you're already in love with the car of your dreams and are willing to sign anything to drive it home. And of course, some of those "deals" aren't quite as attractive once you read the fine print.
Making money off car loans is their business. You're not outsmarting anyone!
'I just had a baby, so I need a "safe" car. . . like a new Tahoe.' This is one I hear all the time from people I know who have kids – especially new parents. Do babies take up more room? Yes. Do you want your baby to be safe in the car? Yes! But those things don't equal a new SUV. Safe does not equal new.
There are plenty of safe, preowned cars out there. And you shouldn't let your desire to keep up with the Joneses drive your money habits and decisions. The Joneses are broke. Keeping up with broke people who are just trying to look rich is a really bad plan.
'How am I supposed to buy a car without a car loan?' Save up and pay cash for your cars. Yep, I mean it!
All it takes is making the decision to pay yourself instead of the bank. If you have a car loan, go crazy and pay it off quickly. Or, sell it to get the process rolling to pay yourself instead of the bank.
The first car you buy with cash might not be your dream car, but that's okay. Just because it's not your dream car doesn't mean it has to be a junker. Pick out a car with a body style that doesn't change often. I can't tell you how many luxury-brand cars I see on the road, and yet have no idea what year they were made.
The moral of the story is simple. Own your cars. Don't let them own you!

Who's the Best? It Really Depends On Whom You Ask

Texto completo: Tim Sparv takes his responsibility seriously. It is not, on the surface, especially onerous. All he has to do, after all, is answer a single question once a year: Who is the best soccer player in the world?
Still, Sparv does not make his decision lightly. He has thought about what values he wants his response to reflect. He does a little research. He makes sure he is not being lazy, or unduly influenced by unconscious bias. He knows that a simple question does not always have an easy answer.
It is Sparv's duty, though, as captain of Finland's national team, to offer his view. Like the captain and coach of every national team, as well as an accredited journalist from each of FIFA's 211 member federations, he has a vote in the organization's annual Best awards. Each group -- captains, coaches, journalists -- accounts for 25 percent of the final tally; a public vote decides the other quarter. Together, they elect the men's and women's players and (with a little less fanfare) coaches of the year.
The prizes themselves are presented at a flashy ceremony -- this year's is in Milan on Monday -- in front of the sport's great and good, but that should not disguise the fact that they occupy an uneasy space in soccer's landscape.
This is not simply because this particular incarnation is new -- it is a successor to FIFA's World Player of the Year Award and a rival, or complement, to the much longer running Ballon d'Or, handed out by the journalists of France Football magazine -- but because soccer's relationship with individual honors has traditionally been complex.
For many years, the game resisted much of the M.V.P. culture that has long been an integral part of American sports. Only recently have the player of the tournament awards at World Cups, say, been announced immediately after the final. It is telling, too, that for a long time, the only individual prizes of note were awarded by the news media. France Football awarded the first Ballon d'Or in 1956, and the Italian magazine Guerin Sportivo's Bravo Award, rewarding the brightest young prospect in European soccer, was created in 1978.
In England, too, the award handed out by the Football Writers' Association predates the one conjured by the players' union by almost three decades. All of them carried no little prestige; they were a marker of greatness, or a signpost toward it. They were not, though, central to a player's ambitions. They were a consequence of success, not a success in themselves.
Over the last few years, though, that has changed. Players, from Paul Pogba to Neymar, now count winning either the FIFA award or the Ballon d'Or as a hotly anticipated ambition, no less a part of their planned career trajectory than lifting a domestic title or claiming the Champions League.
That prioritization of the individual has, without question, been accelerated by the decade-long tussle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to see who can claim the crown as FIFA's best player most frequently. What was once an afterthought is now a crucial yardstick in their rivalry. Both currently have five, and are finalists, alongside Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk, for this year's prize, too.
Last year was the first since 2007 in which neither Messi nor Ronaldo won it; it went, instead, to Luka Modric, a winner of the Champions League and the inspiration behind Croatia's run to the World Cup final. Ronaldo was second. Few doubted that Modric deserved the award, and yet the proclamation of his victory was still, somehow, controversial, if only because Messi had finished only fifth.
This is the problem with individual prizes, whether the FIFA Best awards or the Ballon d'Or. The criteria for winning are enigmatic at best, obscure at worst. The only guidance FIFA provides voters like Sparv is Article 3 of its rules: "The awards are bestowed according to on-field performance and overall behavior on and off the pitch" over the course of the previous (European) season.
That leaves plenty of room for interpretation. Should it go to the most talented player, in which case Messi would be a shoo-in every year? Should it go to the most important to his team? Does it have to be given to someone who has lifted a major trophy?
Perhaps this is why soccer has long been so skeptical of these things: If a player as accomplished and high achieving as Modric could be seen as a divisive choice, then it is not entirely clear what the captains and coaches and journalists are being asked to vote for, because it is not immediately apparent what the prize means. It is much easier to dismiss it as a trinket or a bauble, the calorie of celebrity rather than the nutrition of sport.
That is not how those who vote see it. A selection of national team captains and coaches, polled by The New York Times, invariably said they put serious thought into the selections. The criteria they use, too, are remarkably similar, even if they reach their conclusions independently.
"I try to choose a player that is not the obvious choice," said Sparv, the Finland captain. "Instead of lazily just going for Ronaldo and Messi, I have gone for Modric and van Dijk in the last two seasons. Being the world's best player is more complex than just being the one that scores the most goals."
Perhaps, he said, that reflects the player he is. "I value the less sexy things," he said. "Winning the ball back, reading the game, organizing, putting pressure on the referee, covering ground. Unfortunately, the award is not nuanced enough yet: It is more an award for the best attacking player."
He is not the only one who sees it that way. Dante Leverock, Bermuda's captain, is a central defender: He said he voted for van Dijk as well, a nod of appreciation for the Dutchman's mastery of his own art. "I could appreciate how good a player he is, and how hard it is to have the impact he has had with Liverpool," Leverock said.
To give its voters at least the same base of knowledge, FIFA sends each one an email containing a few basic statistics on each candidate, but Leverock did his own research, too. "The fact no opposition player managed to complete a single dribble past him in the Premier League was out of this world," he said, adding, "He was integral to Liverpool winning the Champions League."
That, to many, is the defining factor: Most of those interviewed said they would not vote for someone who did not win a major trophy, but all made clear that -- in their eyes -- what mattered was not the individual stardust, but what a player contributed to the collective.
"I choose depending on how well they do for club and country," said Karma Shedrup Tshering, the captain of Bhutan. "When you win a trophy, it is because of the sacrifice and hard work you put in on the training field."
Thierry Sardo, the coach of New Caledonia, said that he tries to go for "not necessarily an attacker, but a player who has been very important to his team."
There is, at times, a perception that the award can be political. Every year, FIFA releases the votes, for transparency, and it is easy to flick through and see who has voted -- or pointedly not voted -- on the basis of club loyalty, friendship or rivalry.
That, to those who think through their votes and call it an honor to cast one, is beyond the pale. "The most important thing is that the vote is for what players have done, not through affinity to a player, or even worse, a team," said Henry Hernández, the El Salvador captain.
Like all of the others, he knows that even a simple question -- who is the best soccer player in the world? -- does not necessarily have a simple answer. But the least he and his fellow members of the jury can do is vote "on merit, to make it fair," to say which player they think it should be, not which player they would like it to be.

Texto completo: When the Supreme Court, under a previous ideological majority, was handing down decisions favorable to the left, Democrats were fine with deferring to that third branch of government to achieve what they declined to produce in legislation. Some Democrats in conservative states took the position that it wasn’t their fault that cases voters regarded as constitutionally wrong and morally unprincipled were being decided. Blame the justices, not them.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
The assault on the court has become worse now that Democrats see their primary avenue to legal and cultural change slipping away. The latest is the post-confirmation assault on Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Opponents failed to deny him a seat on the court with testimony from Christine Blassey Ford, who couldn’t remember important details of a sexual assault she claimed Kavanaugh perpetrated on her.
But frustrated Democrats at The New York Times keep trying. The Times published a story last Sunday that alleged Kavanaugh while at Yale, “exposed himself and friends pushed his penis into the hands of a female student.” The incident was supposedly witnessed by a classmate, Max Stier, who went on to become a lawyer for Bill Clinton (oh, the irony), who supposedly communicated the story to the FBI and senators at the time of Kavanaugh’s nomination.
According to AP, the Times story “was based on an upcoming book by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, ‘The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,’ about the junior justice’s brutal confirmation battle last year.”
Kavanaugh denies the incident ever happened. The young woman the incident supposedly happened to has declined to be interviewed, and, according to friends, “doesn’t recall the incident.”
The Washington Post reportedly had the same secondhand information about Kavanaugh a year ago, but “did not run the article because they could not confirm key details of the story.”
The Times, unconcerned with key details, went full-steam ahead. The rather weak editor’s note they were forced to publish on Sunday “correcting” the story pointed out quite glaringly its journalistic ineptitude. And in what can only be described as an assault to its reputation as a trusted media outlet, the Times, said Andrew Sullivan in New York magazine, has “abandoned liberalism for activism.”
There’s an old journalistic cliché that says don’t let facts get in the way of a good story and once again the Times is so eager to keep the Supreme Court and government in general under the control of Democrats that they will print anything, whether it is true or not, to further that goal.
You’d think the Times’ troubles would give other newspapers pause before they tried smearing a person’s reputation in pursuit of political goals, but no.
After the Times’ half-hearted correction, The Washington Post jumped into the mud pit with stories about previous attempts to impeach Supreme Court justices and promoting claims by those who say Kavanaugh’s confirmation wasn’t fair (it wasn’t for him, but that’s not what they mean).
As one would expect, several Democratic presidential candidates rushed to judgment and demanded Kavanaugh be impeached. Questions have been raised, after all, but liberal Democrats are the ones who are raising them. It’s always the seriousness of the charge, not whether the charge has merit. When the charge is proved bogus, the left moves on to new charges against the same or other persons whose views they oppose.
As a Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “It’s important to understand that this assault on the justice is part of the left’s larger campaign against the legitimacy of the current Supreme Court and an independent judiciary.”
This is all the left has in their dwindling arsenal. They’re still after President Trump’s tax records. They hate his Supreme Court appointments. They are livid that his economic policies are working when they have always believed the economy was their issue — never mind their failure to achieve any level of success close to what Trump’s administration has accomplished.
If the current Democratic Party was a defendant in court, it could credibly plead insanity. Let’s see how far this insane behavior gets them with voters in the next election.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump reconoció este domingo en el jardín sur de la Casa Blanca que en su conversación el 25 de julio con el recién elegido presidente de Ucrania, Vladimir Zelensky, habló sobre uno de sus principales competidores electorales, Joe Biden .
Esta afirmación llega después de que se acusara al mandatario estadounidense de forzar a su homónimo ucraniano para que investigara a Biden y a su hijo, Hunter Biden , por las actividades empresariales de este último en su país.
“La conversación que tuve fue en gran medida de felicitación”, dijo el presidente a los reporteros. “ No queremos que nuestra gente, como el vicepresidente Biden y su hijo, generen corrupción en Ucrania . Ucrania tiene ya muchos problemas”, añadió Trump antes de trasladar las intenciones de Zelensky de deshacerse de la corrupción en su país.

El viernes, el presidente había dicho que “no importaba” lo que había hablado con el ucraniano pero, después de que este domingo New York Times, Washington Post y World Street Journal revelaran nuevos detalles, salió al paso con el cambio estrategia discursiva. Hay quien especula con la idea de que Donald Trump detuvo la ayuda militar a Ucrania hasta que Zelensky accedió investigar al candidato presidencial demócrata, algo que el presidente negó tajantemente este domingo.
Los demócratas han exigido al presidente que publique la grabación de la llamada para demostrar que no tiene nada que ocultar. El senador demócrata por Connecticut, Chris Murphy dijo que si se confirma que Trump solicitó ayuda extranjera para interferir en su carrera a la reelección, habría traspasado los límites. Por su parte, Biden dijo ayer que el republicano había “abusado de su poder” presidencial.

How to make layoffs less terrible Some companies taking kinder, more generous approach

Texto completo: It's no secret that large companies struggle at times to treat their employees humanely. Many businesses, especially one of my favorite punching bags, General Motors, still opt for a traditionally heartless approach to layoffs.
Other companies have found slightly more generous approaches - recently Ford showed a little kindness by giving employees a few days to pack up their things and say goodbye to co-workers - but companies can do better than that.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, along with other top CEOs, seems to agree. They recently expressed their belief that companies have a real responsibility to stakeholders like customers and employees. Dimon and the others said, in an ad they took out in The New York Times, that businesses can't focus solely on shareholders. The regular working stiff matters too.
That's where a recent WSJ report provided a little hope. It turns out that several large German companies are enacting more socially responsible approaches as they face economic turbulence or stagnant revenue. Here are some of those approaches, which American companies can learn a thing or two from.
Work-time accounts and early retirement
Diesel components giant Bosch is one of the better examples of companies trying more humane approaches to downsizing.
The company directly negotiated with labor representatives (a much more common practice in Germany) to come to agreements on cutting staff. They decided to use something called work-time accounts, which aren't well known in the U.S. Essentially, with these accounts, employees stock up on overtime pay when times are good, and can then access that money when their hours get cut during a downturn.
Bosch also hired fewer temporary workers and used severance programs and early retirement offers to shrink their workforce.
One of the aspects of this strategy that feels more sustainable to me is that by avoiding drastic cuts, companies like Bosch don't have to suddenly hire a bunch of new people who need training when the market bounces back. The approach helps companies maintain a better balance between workforce costs and revenue while continuing to give workers some type of paycheck. It's more stable for everyone involved.
Plant retooling
Then, there's Volkswagen. Company executives saw financial trouble and announced more than 20,000 layoffs. But they avoided any "forced layoffs."
The German car company started retooling three plants so that it would need fewer workers. The reduction plan includes not replacing certain administrative and factory positions over the next five years. As the Baby Boomer workers that occupy those jobs near retirement, Volkswagen will provide early retirement packages and remove those positions.
The factory retooling also involves ramping up electric vehicle production. This again feels more sustainable than other companies' approaches. Volkswagen is cutting the workforce more slowly while also addressing changing vehicle market demands, all in one plan.
Buyouts
Bayer is handling the need to reduce its workforce in a way similar to Volkswagen's. The German pharmaceutical giant is offering generous buyout packages that include up to five years of severance pay.
This gives Bayer more control over workforce reductions. Plus, it can reduce confrontations between management and workforce that lead to strikes. Although the severance packages are expensive, they tend to be a better deal than the expenses involved in dealing with those lengthy labor strikes.
Part of why these German companies are seeking more humane solutions is rooted in German legal history. The country's labor law states that the supervisory board of any company with more than 2,000 employees has to be made up of half shareholders and half labor representatives. The approach balances employee interests with those of shareholders.
American law doesn't require companies to take worker needs into consideration this extensively. And you can make the case this causes more harm than good. Investors might be more inclined to put their trust in companies that avoid making large-scale, herky-jerky layoffs. Those equal instability, not only for the company but for thousands of former workers, as well as the regions they're from.
It's inherently smarter to lay off people more strategically. Many of your workers may be interested in early retirement or some kind of special severance package. Why not take advantage of that? It should be an attractive option to many entrepreneurs, especially those with the foresight to know that if they lay off too many people they'll just have to train new workers and lose organizational knowledge should the economic climate improve (and then go south again).
These socially responsible best practices may be especially critical with signs and predictions of a looming recessionary period. Hopefully, more American entrepreneurs realize this and make changes that will help their businesses and the economy overall.

AJC EXCLUSIVE THE NFL: NFL's image problem not just a lack of Luck

Texto completo: Falcons coach Dan Quinn spent part of his summer looking at game video of the Colts, his team's opponent today. That meant close study of quarterback Andrew Luck. The Falcons hadn't faced Luck during his six NFL seasons because he was sidelined by injury when the teams played in 2015 (the Colts beat the Falcons at the Georgia Dome with Matt Hasselbeck at QB).
It turns out the Falcons won't ever face Luck. He abruptly retired last month at age 29. His decision stunned observers who wondered why Luck would give up the game after a Pro Bowl season. But Luck said years of injuries had sapped his enjoyment of football and leaving it behind was the only way to "live the life I want to live."
Luck was dealing with a calf/ ankle injury he suffered in May. He could have returned to play but he said was done with the "injury-pain-rehab cycle" that had come to dominate his life. Quinn's review of Luck's play in 2018 confirmed he still was a good, tough quarterback.
"When I heard, I said, 'Man, something must really be bothering him if it's gotten to that spot,'" Quinn said.
Luck is the latest NFL player to leave football because of its physical and mental toll. Patriots star Rob Gronkowski made the same decision months earlier. Last season two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Vontae Davis gave up football in the middle of a game because he decided it was "better to walk away healthy than to willfully embrace the warrior mentality and limp away too late."
The retirement of star players for health reasons is part of an existential crisis for football and its top league. There are more questions than ever about the game's safety. The NFL settled a class-action concussion lawsuit after years of denying and undermining the science regarding the effects of repetitive head trauma. Since then the league adopted game rules meant to protect players, touts a helmet it claims is safer and launched a PR campaign to convince the public that football isn't dangerous.
But those efforts are undercut by the reality of top professionals quitting football because of the health risks. Luck, Davis and Gronkowski all missed games because of concussions (Gronkowski recently said he suffered about 20 of them, including five that made him "black out"). They gave up lots of money and then explained in detail the ways in which their bodies are broken and their minds tired.
The real conundrum for the NFL is that violence is central to the game's appeal. The league and media used to be honest about it. NFL Films produced videos glorifying the biggest collisions (readers of a certain age may remember receiving one with their Sports Illustrated subscription). ESPN once ran a regular "Jacked Up!" segment in which Chris Berman, Tom Jackson and the gang whooped and hollered over highlights of potentially life-altering collisions.
I used to enjoy that kind of stuff, but not so much anymore. I'm not alone. That's why the NFL can't be so straightforward about selling violence now.
The league still views its players as commodities. Plenty of bloodthirsty fans are offended by the notion that they should care about player safety. But more people are starting to see players as human beings. It can make us queasy to watch players damage their bodies and minds for entertainment.
Even some of the fans who like the violence of football may not want their kids to play it. A 2017 UMass Lowell-Washington Post poll found that most of the public believes tackle football is not safe for children before high school and only 57% think it's safe for older students. The National Federation of State High School Associations said its most recent annual survey showed a decline in participation for 11-person football for the fifth consecutive year, to its lowest level since the 1999-2000 school year.
That's bad for the NFL. It needs a constant supply of fresh bodies for its grinder just as much it needs customers for its product. Both goals are hindered when players such as Luck quit the game. The NFL loses players its customers want to see play, and for reasons that at least make them think about the cost of playing football.
Luckily for the NFL, its PR efforts are aided by a player culture that tends to downplay the game's risks. The "warrior mentality" Davis cited leads some players to lament rules on player safety. That makes sense for self-interested defensive players who are flagged for hits, but even players on the receiving end criticize the rules meant to protect them.
That includes Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. During the Jaguars-Titans game on Thursday, Brady tweeted his complaints about too many penalties. A roughing penalty called against Titans linebacker Kamalei Correa apparently prompted Brady to write: "I'm turning off this game I can't watch these ridiculous penalties anymore."
Former Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman was calling the game for NFL Network. Told about Brady's tweets, Aikman said: "I agree, this is ridiculous."
Aikman suffered at least eight concussions during his 10-year career with the Cowboys. He has said he has no memory of playing in the January 2014 NFC Championship game after a knee to the head knocked him from the game. Aikman's concussion history was among the data that a New York Times investigation found was omitted from what the NFL claimed was its comprehensive study of the issue.
There always will be people willing to sacrifice their health to play football. Luck decided he couldn't be one of them any longer, even though he's still one of the best. More youth players (or their parents) are making the same decisions.
It's not yet a real, full-blown crisis for the NFL. Here's hoping it becomes one eventually. If so, the NFL could only blame its own greed and callousness.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Bernie Sanders has long wanted to remake the health care system so no one will have to pay directly for medical care again. Now, he also wants to go back and cancel all the medical debts of people who have been billed under the current system.
In a plan released Saturday, Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and presidential candidate, proposes wiping out an estimated $ 81 billion in existing debt and changing rules around debt collection and bankruptcy. He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a "public credit registry" that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores.
The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders's concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care -- but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy.
The plan is Mr. Sanders's latest effort to transform the health care system in America, a goal on which he has staked not just his second presidential run, but much of his political legacy. His proposal also separates him from other presidential candidates: While several of them have come to embrace his "Medicare for all" plan to create a government-run health insurance system, he is the first top-tier contender to call for such drastic measures on medical debt.
"We're addressing it on both ends," Mr. Sanders said. "We're addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we're addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses."

Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also increasingly affecting people who have insurance with holes, like high deductibles or limited networks of doctors whose care is paid for. Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt, according to a study published last year in the journal Health Affairs.
The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism.
While eliminating every American's medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders's plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt, estimated that the market price for $ 81 billion in debt could be as low as $ 500 million. Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar.
The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to "replace" for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections.
Studies suggest that medical debts can be less damaging to people's credit than other kinds of debt, in part because the credit reporting agencies treat people's ability to pay medical bills as less predictive of creditworthiness than, say, their ability to pay credit card bills or car payments. And, despite the news media's focus on particularly large medical bills, the typical bill in collections is less than $ 600, according to the Health Affairs article.
But medical debts do affect credit somewhat, and they can cause psychological stress, beyond the financial consequences. A survey of people with medical debts conducted by The New York Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2016 found that 44 percent of adults under 65 who had problems paying medical bills said those bills had a "major effect" on their lives.
Fear of medical debts causes some people to avoid needed medical care. And medical bills can affect other parts of people's finances that are harder to measure, showing up as an unpaid credit card bill or a missed loan payment.
"I have a belief that if a plan like this could eliminate the debt that's causing hardship, it could make a huge difference in people's lives," Mr. Antico said.
The Sanders campaign circulated statistics suggesting that more than 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. That number, derived from a survey of bankrupt individuals, overstates the impact of medical bills on bankruptcy. The study itself noted that health problems can cause bankruptcies in two ways, through direct medical bills and through lost income due to illness itself. The 500,000 figure includes both groups.
Other research has shown that income losses due to illness are often the bigger financial hit than medical bills. Neither Mr. Sanders's "Medicare for all" plan nor his medical debt program would address that secondary issue, though he has also called for guaranteeing workers paid medical leave.
The plan "is well targeted," said Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who studies medical debt. "It just may not be that much relief."
[ Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week? ]
Mr. Sanders said that, in conversations with people around the country, he had come to see medical debt as the most consistent and visceral manifestation of a broken health care system.
At an event this month in Carson City, Nev., for instance, he heard from a veteran who said he had $ 139,000 in medical debt. When Mr. Sanders asked the man how he would pay off the debt, the man responded: "I can't. I can't. I'm going to kill myself."
Those kinds of deeply moving moments, he said, drove him to seek a new way to ameliorate that particular pain as part of his overall vision for changing the health care system.
"I have always believed that health care is a human right, and it has always disturbed me immensely that so many of our people are uninsured or underinsured and can't go to the doctor," Mr. Sanders said. "But I have learned in this campaign something else, which I didn't talk about previously, and that is the financial pain that this dysfunctional health care system is causing people."
The new plan is part of a burst of policy-related activity from the Sanders campaign, which also released a housing plan last week that included a proposal to establish a national rent control standard.

Texto completo: Here is a timeline of events leading up to President Trump's call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky:
May 2014: Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma Group , a privately owned Ukrainian gas producer. The company is run by a former government official whom Ukrainian and British authorities would investigate for alleged criminal wrongdoing, including money laundering. The younger Mr. Biden's move drew criticism given that Ukraine was at the time within his father's portfolio as vice president.
December 2015: Vice President Biden visited Kiev, where he pressured the country to do a better job of rooting out widespread corruption and called for the "reform" of the office of Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Mr. Shokin had long been criticized by the U.S. and other countries for not doing enough to address corruption in Ukraine.
March 29, 2016: Ukrainian Parliament voted to remove Mr. Shokin. By the time he left office, Mr. Shokin was no longer pursuing the Burisma investigation.
Jan. 23, 2018: Mr. Biden, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event , recounted a trip he took to Kiev as vice president after then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had promised and failed to "take action" against the state prosecutor. Mr. Biden said he told Mr. Poroshenko that the U.S. would withhold a $1 billion loan unless he ousted Mr. Shokin. "I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money," Mr. Biden said. "Well, son of a bitch. He got fired."
April 21, 2019: Mr. Zelensky elected as president of Ukraine.
April 25: Mr. Biden launched his presidential campaign.
April 28: Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted about investigations in Ukraine, charging that the "media blackout of the investigations in Ukraine of alleged Democrat corruption" proves there is a "double standard."
May 9: The New York Times reported that Rudy Giuliani planned to travel to Kiev to pressure the Ukrainian government to press ahead with investigations into Joe Biden and into possible interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Mr. Giuliani subsequently canceled the trip, which he says Mr. Trump knew about.
May 16: Ukraine's prosecutor general told Bloomberg that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son.
June: Mr. Giuliani met in Paris with an official from the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office to discuss a possible Biden investigation.
July 21: Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Zelensky's party in parliamentary elections, cementing the political newcomer's power.
July 25: Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky spoke by phone. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Mr. Trump urged Mr. Zelensky about eight times to talk to Mr. Giuliani about an investigation into Mr. Biden's son, according to people familiar with the matter.
August: Mr. Giuliani met with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky, in Madrid. The two also spoke by phone later in the month. Mr. Giuliani described Mr. Yermak as "very receptive" and said the aide told him Mr. Zelensky would "get to the bottom of all this."
Late August: The Trump administration began reviewing $250 million in foreign aid to Ukraine, meant to help the country ward off Russia.
Aug. 29: Mr. Trump canceled his planned trip to Poland to deal with Hurricane Dorian. He had been scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky there. Mr. Yermak later called Mr. Giuliani to ask whether the president's decision to cancel his trip was related to Mr. Zelensky; Mr. Giuliani says in an interview he assured him it wasn't.
Sept. 12: The Trump administration released foreign aid to Ukraine.
Sept. 25: Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky are expected to meet in person for the first time at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.

Why Trump Is Winning on Iran

Texto completo: Delicacy forbids resorting to the suggestion that comes to mind in response to an Arab academic declaiming in the pages of the New York Times against Donald Trump's restraint with respect to Iran's military provocations. "Trump, in his response to Iran, is even worse than Obama,"" Abdulkhaleq Abdulla told the paper, which described him as "a prominent political scientist in the United Arab Emirates."
He went on: "Now an Arab Gulf strategic partner has been massively attacked by Iran -- which was provoked by Trump, not by us -- and we hear Americans saying to us, you need to defend yourselves! It is an utter failure and utter disappointment in this administration."
The Trump sanctions are having their desired effect, weakening the Iranian regime and indicating why its regional machinations are ultimately leading toward a dead end. This is already serving Arab interests incidentally. If there is some regional blowback, such as the drone and cruise-missile attack on a Saudi oil facility, in the spirit of burden-sharing let the Saudis take the steps necessary to repay or repel such attacks if they wish.
Our policy is working. Only when and if it serves our interest do we need to respond militarily (though it might be useful to strengthen the effect of sanctions by attacking under-the-table Iranian oil exports). It does not need to be done, as Arab and other critics suggest, to validate the 40-year U.S. policy of preventing any rival power from dominating the gulf and its oil resources.
We don't have to prove that commitment at the drop of every hat. One of the many benefits of the U.S. domestic oil resurgence is that we don't have to overreact to lesser disruptions of the oil flow from every regional spat or upset. The world economy remains adequately supplied. If prices go up a bit, the U.S. now benefits as a major producer, offsetting some of the damage on the consumer side.
Our position is stronger than ever. Only weak nations need to overreact.
Which is just as well. Even Donald Trump's most devoted followers, for better or worse, have little desire to see him become a war president. They sense that recent wars haven't served U.S. interests. They understand that the peculiar dynamics of the Trump presidency would not provide the unifying and rallying oomph that sometimes makes war an attractive domestic political proposition. Nor would being a war president particularly suit Mr. Trump's episodic and wandering leadership style.
Which is also fine. There is no reason to oblige the Iranians and the Saudis, in their different ways, in how we respond to the attack. The Iranian goal is to lure the U.S. into a confrontation that Washington would eventually be wiling to pay to get out of, presumably by lifting sanctions and resuming the Obama nuclear payola. For the Saudis and their local allies, they wish to see the world's superpower expend some of its military stockpiles to degrade Iran's offensive capabilities in ways that would convenience them but wouldn't do much for us.
Let's recall that the billions the U.S. invests in global military power are aimed not just at keeping the Gulf open, but also at making others feel how much they rely on the U.S. to keep it open. The Chinese, in particular, hardly need at this exact moment to see us reflexively allowing ourselves to be baited by local tinpots into protecting China's ability to consume Mideast oil. On the contrary, the present occasion represents a nice opportunity to demonstrate the flexibility America now enjoys in this matter thanks to its own fracking revolution and rising energy power.
There are no guarantees, but the evidence so far is encouraging. Sanctions have cut Iran's oil exports by 90% since April 2018. The regime is plodding toward a domestic crisis that, as of now, Iran's leadership appears to hope it can escape by initiating provocations meant to suggest a wider war unless the U.S. backs down. Yet these war threats, if allowed to materialize, would only accelerate Iran's domestic crisis. Though more provocations may be coming, these would only make it tougher for a future Democratic president to cancel the sanctions and reinstate the Obama nuclear deal. It's hard to see a way out of Iran's sanctions trap except by meeting U.S. demands to curb its obnoxious regional behavior.
Whether from shrewdness or instinct or an inability to reconcile his bellicose Twitter style with his urge for deals, Mr. Trump's administration has defaulted to a useful strategy. It consists of letting sanctions work while leaving it to our local partners to cope with any spillovers that don't fundamentally affect U.S. interests.

EXCHANGE --- Human Capital -- On Business: The Fine Art of Harnessing Impatience --- My former boss taught me, and thousands of others, the importance of giving a damn

Texto completo: Three a.m. phone calls are rarely welcome. A few have come my way over two decades of reporting, but the one that woke me in the summer of 2006 left a mark.
I was staying at the Tropicana in Las Vegas, having flown in late the night before to cover a United Auto Workers convention amid the American car business's rapid decline.
Paul Ingrassia, then the executive running the company's Dow Jones Newswires, was on the other end of the line from the East Coast, calling from three hours in the future. He wanted to know if I'd seen the New York Times business section. I'd been scooped on a story about the UAW leadership's plans. The brief call sent a clear message: We sent you to Sin City to work. Get moving.
Paul died Monday at 69, and that led to a flood of stories online and in print about his legacy as a newsman, leader and gearhead. Memories could fill several weeks worth of columns, but the leadership lesson he left fills one line.
"Paul mastered the art of impatience," his younger brother, Larry, told me.
Winning requires belief in a cause and disdain for the red tape and naysaying -- or a good night's sleep -- that gets in the way. Paul had no appetite for what many consider the necessary evils in business.
For instance, more than once I was on an email chain that he was copied on. These conversations can continue on message after message, with multiple people weighing in on whether we should do the story, who should do the story, what the story line should be.
The response from Mr. Ingrassia inevitably went like this: For the amount of words and time we've wasted talking about the story, we could have had it published by now.
Gordon Crovitz, a former Wall Street Journal publisher, said if executives signaled support for an Ingrassia initiative, he would go in for the kill even as others were still thinking it over.
"He was a master of the presumptive close," Mr. Crovitz remembered. "He would say, 'Are we going to announce this on Tuesday or Thursday?' It forced more urgent discussion."
I owe much of my career to Paul's ability to accompany his high bar, direct feedback and sense of urgency with consistent gestures that showed he gave a damn about me and thousands of others under his care. I've chased CEOs, heads of state and even the pope around the U.S. and Europe, and it is a rare bird who cares as much about the success of others as they do about their own.
Paul started his career at Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, in the Journal's Chicago bureau in 1977, the same year I was born. I was hired as a Dow Jones Newswires reporter 28 years into Paul's tenure. By then, he'd collected a Pulitzer Prize for covering the troubled American car industry and was several years into his stint running the wire service.
My first day in the Detroit bureau came with a surprise visit from Paul. I had never met him before when he asked me to tag along to lunch with a top auto executive.
As we ate, the executive started spitting out news. Paul nodded toward my notebook, his trademark grimace indicating I should put down my fork and pick up my pen.
This immediately cemented a 14-year mentorship that will endure past his death. The last time I heard his voice was when I was reporting a piece on Lee Iacocca's death this summer. Paul told me that cancer he had battled for years had returned, but figured he'd beat it again. Then we talked about the former Chrysler boss and K-Cars and government bailouts for God knows how long.
Paul, who chronicled the epic downfall of General Motors, was allergic to anything that smacked of unnecessary bureaucracy, whether it was born from laziness, an unwillingness to change or hubris.
It showed up in his last great battle at Dow Jones, pushing for the integration of the Newswires and Journal news-gathering operations. Paul agitated to elevate the stature of the Newswires' journalists, who often played second fiddle to the Journal colleagues.
It never happened in Paul's time at the company, but today, after much cultural angst, the two newsrooms are one.
He retired from Dow Jones management in 2007 and wrote books for a while. His goal with "Crash Course" was to publish the first book on the bailouts of GM and Chrysler. He talked the Journal into allowing me to help him rush the project even while I remained a beat reporter. I later followed him to Reuters, a Journal competitor, after I took a brief detour into public relations.
A short time into my Reuters career, I told him that the Journal wanted me back to run its Scandinavia bureau. Paul knew where my heart was. He practically pushed me out of the door, telling me it was the job of a lifetime.

Texto completo: Twice an All-American, he scored 37 touchdowns in 36 games at Ohio State, then won an N.F.L. title with the Lions.
Hopalong Cassidy, the cowboy hero of the movies and TV, had been a longtime favorite of youngsters when another Hopalong arrived.
This one spelled his name a bit differently, and his exploits were played out on the football field.
But sportswriters of the 1950s couldn't resist the obvious. He was invariably known as Howard (Hopalong) Cassady.
Cassady, the Ohio State running back who won the 1955 Heisman Trophy as college football's most outstanding player, and who was a member of the Detroit Lions' 1957 N.F.L. championship team, died on Friday in Tampa, Fla., his longtime home. He was 85.
His death was announced by Ohio State, which did not cite the cause.
Cassady, a two-time All-American, ran for 958 yards and 15 touchdowns and was named Athlete of the Year by The Associated Press in his Heisman season.
He amassed 2,466 rushing yards in his four seasons with Ohio State, a team record at the time.
A native of Columbus, Cassady was a hometown star with the Buckeyes, and he was a redhead, matching the Ohio State color.
He was only 5 feet 10 inches and 180 pounds or so by the time he got to the National Football League, but he was speedy enough to score 37 touchdowns in 36 games at Ohio State, playing from 1952 to 1955. He was also an outstanding player in the Buckeyes' secondary.
When he was a freshman, Cassady impressed Coach Woody Hayes in practices, and he received a uniform the Thursday before the Buckeyes' opener against Indiana.
"That was a big deal because Mom and Dad got tickets if you dressed," The Associated Press quoted Cassady as saying.
He picked No. 40 because the only other number left was 13.
Cassady came off the bench to score three touchdowns in that game, one on a pass reception and two on running plays.
He was an All-American for the first time in 1954, when Ohio State went 10-0 over all and defeated Southern California, 20-7, on a rain-soaked field in the Rose Bowl.
He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1979, and Ohio State retired his No. 40 in 2000.
The Lions selected Cassady in the first round of the 1956 N.F.L. draft, the third pick over all.
He played for Detroit from 1956 to 1961 and caught a touchdown pass in the Lions' 59-14 rout of the Cleveland Browns in the 1957 N.F.L. title game.
Cassady split his 1962 season with the Browns and the Philadelphia Eagles and concluded his N.F.L. career playing in two games for the Lions in 1963.
He ran for 1,229 yards in the N.F.L., averaging 3.9 yards a carry and scoring six touchdowns, and caught 111 passes for 1,601 yards and 18 touchdowns.
Cassady was also a shortstop on the Ohio State baseball team.
George Steinbrenner, who had taken graduate courses at Ohio State when Cassady played there, hired him in 1976 as a conditioning coach for the Yankees. He went on to work for the organization for many years, also becoming a scout and a coach for their Columbus Clippers farm team.
His hometown fans did not forget him.
"When they would call out the lineups, you'd just get the usual cheers for players, nothing big," Andy Phillips, a Yankee first baseman who had played for the Clippers, told The New York Times in 2007. "And then they would call out the coaches at third base and first base. When they got to him, the place would just go crazy every time."
Howard Albert Cassady was born on March 2, 1934, and graduated from Columbus Central High School.
In addition to working for the Yankees, he founded a company that manufactured concrete pipes and other industrial products after his football years.
His survivors include his wife, Barbara; two sons, Craig, a defensive back with Ohio State and with the New Orleans Saints in 1977, and David; and a daughter, Rayne.
In the late 1990s, Cassady's Heisman Trophy was stolen from the home he maintained in Columbus.
"The guy that stole it thought it had gold or something in it," Cassady told The Times. "The garbage man found it in a bag, and the hand was sticking out of it. He pulled it out from the trash and called the school, and they took it to the police department."
The Heisman was restored to good health and returned to Cassady.
William Boyd, who portrayed Hopalong Cassidy on the screen, and, like Cassady the football player, was an Ohio native, met up with him before the kickoff for the 1955 Rose Bowl game.
"I had his guns on, and I got on his horse," Cassady said. "He said he was awfully proud that I was called Hopalong, too."

Texto completo: Three a.m. phone calls are rarely welcome. A few have come my way over two decades of reporting, but the one that woke me in the summer of 2006 left a mark.
I was staying at the Tropicana in Las Vegas, having flown in late the night before to cover a United Auto Workers convention amid the American car business's rapid decline.
Paul Ingrassia, then the executive running the company's Dow Jones Newswires, was on the other end of the line from the East Coast, calling from three hours in the future. He wanted to know if I'd seen the New York Times business section. I'd been scooped on a story about the UAW leadership's plans. The brief call sent a clear message: We sent you to Sin City to work. Get moving.
Paul died Monday at 69, and that led to a flood of stories online and in print about his legacy as a newsman, leader and gearhead. Memories could fill several weeks worth of columns, but the leadership lesson he left fills one line.
"Paul mastered the art of impatience," his younger brother, Larry, told me.
Winning requires belief in a cause and disdain for the red tape and naysaying—or a good night's sleep—that gets in the way. Paul had no appetite for what many consider the necessary evils in business.
For instance, more than once I was on an email chain that he was copied on. These conversations can continue on message after message, with multiple people weighing in on whether we should do the story, who should do the story, what the story line should be.
The response from Mr. Ingrassia inevitably went like this: For the amount of words and time we've wasted talking about the story, we could have had it published by now.
Gordon Crovitz, a former Wall Street Journal publisher, said if executives signaled support for an Ingrassia initiative, he would go in for the kill even as others were still thinking it over.
"He was a master of the presumptive close," Mr. Crovitz remembered. "He would say, 'Are we going to announce this on Tuesday or Thursday?' It forced more urgent discussion."
I owe much of my career to Paul's ability to accompany his high bar, direct feedback and sense of urgency with consistent gestures that showed he gave a damn about me and thousands of others under his care. I've chased CEOs, heads of state and even the pope around the U.S. and Europe, and it is a rare bird who cares as much about the success of others as they do about their own.
Paul started his career at Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, in the Journal's Chicago bureau in 1977, the same year I was born. I was hired as a Dow Jones Newswires reporter 28 years into Paul's tenure. By then, he'd collected a Pulitzer Prize for covering the troubled American car industry and was several years into his stint running the wire service.
My first day in the Detroit bureau came with a surprise visit from Paul. I had never met him before when he asked me to tag along to lunch with a top auto executive.
As we ate, the executive started spitting out news. Paul nodded toward my notebook, his trademark grimace indicating I should put down my fork and pick up my pen.
This immediately cemented a 14-year mentorship that will endure past his death. The last time I heard his voice was when I was reporting a piece on Lee Iacocca's death this summer. Paul told me that cancer he had battled for years had returned, but figured he'd beat it again. Then we talked about the former Chrysler boss and K-Cars and government bailouts for God knows how long.
Paul, who chronicled the epic downfall of General Motors, was allergic to anything that smacked of unnecessary bureaucracy, whether it was born from laziness, an unwillingness to change or hubris.
It showed up in his last great battle at Dow Jones, pushing for the integration of the Newswires and Journal news-gathering operations. Paul agitated to elevate the stature of the Newswires' journalists, who often played second fiddle to the Journal colleagues.
It never happened in Paul's time at the company, but today, after much cultural angst, the two newsrooms are one.
He retired from Dow Jones management in 2007 and wrote books for a while. His goal with "Crash Course" was to publish the first book on the bailouts of GM and Chrysler. He talked the Journal into allowing me to help him rush the project even while I remained a beat reporter. I later followed him to Reuters, a Journal competitor, after I took a brief detour into public relations.
A short time into my Reuters career, I told him that the Journal wanted me back to run its Scandinavia bureau. Paul knew where my heart was. He practically pushed me out of the door, telling me it was the job of a lifetime.
"You'll be my best friend in Stockholm," he said.

2001 'Arabian Nights' May Sink Trudeau

Texto completo: Canadians have seen the face of social justice, and it's rather dark. On Wednesday Time magazine published a yearbook photo of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dressed in a turban and white robes, his face covered with brown makeup. It was taken at an "Arabian Nights"-themed gala in 2001 for the Vancouver private day school where he was teaching drama, French and math.
"It was a racist thing to do," said the Liberal leader. "I should have known better then, but I didn't and I'm sorry." Mr. Trudeau, who was 29 at the time, hopes self-laceration will pre-empt a whipping from opponents. It won't, especially with an election Oct. 21. "Like all Canadians, I was extremely shocked and disappointed," said Conservative chief Andrew Scheer, adding that the Aladdin costume betrayed "a complete lack of judgment and integrity" and that Mr. Trudeau is "not fit to govern."
Mr. Scheer can be accused of opportunism. Not so Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party. "Tonight is not about the Prime Minister," he tweeted. "It's about every young person mocked for the colour of their skin. The child who had their turban ripped off their head. And those reliving intense feelings of pain & hurt from past experiences of racism. To you, I say you are loved."
Mr. Singh, a Sikh, wears a turban himself. Good luck, Mr. Trudeau.
The prime minister only recently emerged from the "Lavscam" affair, in which he pressured Attorney General Judy Wilson-Raybould to stop the corruption prosecution of a major Liberal donor, fired her when she refused, and spread lies about her. Mr. Trudeau is fond of saying, "I'm proud to be a feminist," and, "When women speak up, it is our duty to listen to them and to believe them." A lot of good that did Ms. Wilson-Raybould.
Within 12 hours of the Aladdin photo, two others surfaced of Mr. Trudeau wearing blackface in the 1990s. His explanation: "I've always -- and you'll know this -- been more enthusiastic about costumes than is sometimes appropriate."
That's the problem. As prime minister, Mr. Trudeau is still playing dress-up. He donned traditional garb on an official visit to India in 2018 and looked ridiculous alongside bemused Indians in Western clothes. Even his political correctness seems put on, as when he interrupted and scolded a woman for saying "mankind." He told her "peoplekind" was the "more inclusive" term.
The press, especially in America, loved Mr. Trudeau's theatrics: appointing a "gender balanced" cabinet "because it's 2015," greeting Syrian refugees at the airport, and claiming "there is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada," only tolerant multiculturalism. His government even launched a "feminist foreign policy." It sounded good, earning him praise in the New York Times, a spread in Vogue and a fawning profile in Rolling Stone.
Breezy, preening progressivism masked what everybody knew: The dilettante son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Justin was ushered into Liberal politics after an extended adolescence and abruptly made party leader because of his surname. This new scandal is damaging mostly because it reminds Canadians who leads them -- not a racist but a hectoring, hypocritical high-school drama teacher who's in over his head, not an ideologue but an empty turban.

Canadians Grapple With Racism Question

Texto completo: OTTAWA -- Canadians from Newfoundland to British Columbia struggled with the past misdeeds of their leader this week when images surfaced of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in blackface and brownface makeup.
Could this be the same Mr. Trudeau who has welcomed thousands of refugees and has frequently apologized for Canada's history of Indigenous abuse? Did the images from his past diminish his efforts in public life? And when it comes to October's national election, could Canada, a nation that prides itself on its cosmopolitan cities and generous citizens, forgive a prime minister for actions that even he called racist?
Some found themselves wondering about the real Mr. Trudeau.
"Is it the one behind closed doors, the one when the cameras are turned off that no one sees?" asked Jagmeet Singh, a Sikh and the leader of the left-leaning New Democratic Party. "Is that the real Mr. Trudeau? Because more and more, it seems like it is."
Mr. Trudeau apologized on Wednesday and on Thursday for his conduct, saying he was "deeply sorry" for the three occasions he wore blackface or brownface, as a student in the 1990s and as a teacher at a private prep school in 2001. But many people on social media and national talk shows rejected Mr. Trudeau's claim that wearing brownface was not generally viewed as racist in 2001, when he appeared in dark makeup and a turban in two photos.
[Read about the photos and video that surfaced this week showing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in blackface and brownface.]
"Do I think Trudeau is a racist? No," said Jaskaran Singh Sandhu, a political consultant who has worked for all three major parties in Canada. "Do I think these acts in and of themselves are racist? Yes. It seems to me that this really, really reeks of privilege."
Evan Sambasivam, from Toronto, which has a large South Asian population, said it was difficult to reconcile his support for Mr. Trudeau's Liberal Party with his Sri Lankan descent. "I don't know if I will end up voting for someone else, but if I excuse Trudeau, then I excuse anyone else guilty of making a mockery of my skin color," he said.
Some Indigenous people expressed similarly conflicted feelings. Kim O'Bomsawin, a leading Indigenous filmmaker who has documented the murder of Indigenous women, said it was initially shocking to see Canada's prime minister partying in brownface.
Jody Wilson-Raybould, an Indigenous lawmaker who clashed with Mr. Trudeau while she was in his cabinet, told reporters that at first she did not believe the reports of the brownface photo were real, according to The Canadian Press. "It's completely unacceptable for anybody in a position of authority and power to do something like that," she said.
But Ms. O'Bomsawin also stressed that the cultural context had changed dramatically since 20 years ago, when parents dressed their children as Pocahontas for Halloween without fear of a backlash. Mr. Trudeau, she said, looked foolish but shouldn't be judged too harshly.
"In 2001, we didn't have the same debates about cultural appropriation as we have today," she said. "Justin Trudeau is constantly doing ridiculous things, but this episode is more ridiculous than offensive. If he had done it in today's context, it would be much more offensive, as things have evolved since then."
Political columnists who rarely favor Mr. Trudeau criticized him on Thursday for not being forthcoming about the episodes until his hand was forced by the first photo's publication by Time magazine on Wednesday.
"This election is about who voters should trust to lead this country in difficult times," the writer John Ibbitson wrote in The Globe and Mail. "How can they trust a leader who committed a racist act and then kept it hidden, hoping no one would find out?"
In The National Post, the columnist Christie Blatchford wrote, "It seems unlikely to me that Trudeau would have forgotten either the incident or the picture that was taken, especially as over the years, white people wearing blackface came to be recognized as racist and absolutely toxic to politicians."
And at least one candidate for Mr. Trudeau's Liberal Party criticized him on Thursday -- an unusual break, since Canadian politicians are expected not to challenge their leaders publicly.
In a Facebook post, Katie Omstead, a Liberal candidate in southwestern Ontario, noted that Mr. Trudeau did "apologize sincerely and accept full responsibility." But she suggested that his explanation was not entirely satisfactory.
"I simply don't care how old these images are," she wrote. "I know, as does he, how serious this is. We need to continue to have conversations about discrimination, and what we can do to teach our children, and those of us who lead, to respect the diversity of all Canadians."
Peter Donolo, the former director of communications for former Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, said that he hoped the upheaval would convince Mr. Trudeau to stop suggesting that his party holds a moral high ground over its rivals. "I never thought that was a good look for him," Mr. Donolo said.
But Mr. Donolo said that the extent to which the revelations would affect Mr. Trudeau's re-election bid remain to be seen.
"We're in a white hot moment now," Mr. Donolo said. "I honestly don't know how significant the impact will be."
Many voters may conclude that Mr. Trudeau's record of championing ethnic diversity and immigration, he said, offsets the offensive acts he did years before entering politics. As prime minister, Mr. Trudeau has welcomed thousands of refugees, promised to improve the lives of Indigenous people and apologized for historical abuses.
In line at a Tim Hortons coffee shop in Brampton, Ontario, a Toronto suburb, a conversation about Mr. Trudeau broke out among people who said they were immigrants who supported the prime minister.
"My kids wear different kinds of costumes and it's O.K.," said Jatinder Singh. "To me, he didn't do anything wrong."
Even people who thought Mr. Trudeau behaved inappropriately shared a similar sentiment. "I found it offensive," said Rose Noseworthy, outside the grocery store where she works in the Brampton Mall. "But I don't see him losing votes over that. I would still vote Liberal."
[New York Times readers respond : Some see faults, but others lean toward forgiveness.]
In majority French-speaking Quebec, a region with outsize influence in Canadian elections, Mr. Trudeau's pro-immigration stance appeared to soften the blow of the photographs.
The issue of multiculturalism has been center stage in Quebec in recent months, after the right-leaning government passed a law banning teachers, judges and police officers from wearing religious symbols while at work. Mr. Trudeau has firmly castigated the law, saying it is an affront to Canadian values.
In Papineau, Montreal, the electoral district Mr. Trudeau represents and an area with a dense immigrant population, Georges Azar, an I.T. technician who emigrated to Canada from Lebanon in 2008, said he would be voting for Mr. Trudeau again in these elections and the photos had no effect on his decision.
"I don't think the photo changes anything," he said. "What makes a difference is that it was a night with friends, with people he liked. Yes, he painted his face, but I don't feel it was to make fun of people or to hurt."
Suraj Shing, 35, an Uber driver from India, said he wasn't voting for Mr. Trudeau because he was annoyed about his rising rent. But the photographs didn't bother him. "Maybe somebody thinks it's racist," he said. "I don't think so because he's a very nice guy, he goes to mosques, he's a very multicultural guy."

Texto completo: Nonpartisanship wonk offered to tell FBI of a recollection from Yale
Brett M. Kavanaugh worked for independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr in the late 1990s, writing the rationale for impeaching President Bill Clinton, who was accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in a case stemming from sexual misconduct allegations.
In response, a Clinton defense lawyer named Max Stier, who had attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, co-signed a document ridiculing the idea of removing the president over "vague and nonspecific accusations."
Two decades later, the paths of Kavanaugh and Stier crossed again, and once more, the matter involved alleged sexual misconduct.
By this time, Kavanaugh had been nominated to the Supreme Court and Stier was the president and chief executive of the Washington-based Partnership for Public Service. Stier wanted to tell the FBI anonymously that he recalled having seen "Kavanaugh with his pants down" at a "drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student," the New York Times reported online Saturday. The student declined to be interviewed, and friends said she doesn't recall the event, according to an updated version of the Times story.
As a result, Stier finds himself in the middle of a partisan brawl at the very time he has stressed that nonpartisanship is crucial to fixing what is broken in Washington. He has been attacked and supported on social media. On the basis of the Stier account and related revelations, some Democrats called for Kavanaugh's impeachment, or at least for a new investigation. President Trump has tweeted, "What's happening to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace."
Stier, 53, a registered Democrat who has worked for members of both political parties, declined to comment. He may be best known for being portrayed heroically as an earnest do-gooder seeking to fix government in a recent best-selling book, "The Fifth Risk," by Michael Lewis. Stier might have been "the American with the greatest understanding of how the US government worked," Lewis wrote.
As soon as Stier's role in the Kavanaugh matter was revealed, however, some Republicans latched on to his having worked for Clinton, saying that it signals he may have had political motivations when he offered the FBI information about Kavanaugh's days at Yale.
"It is very relevant to potential motivation and thus newsworthy that Max Stier just happened to be a defense attorney during the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton when Brett Kavanaugh was lead prosecutor," said Mike Davis, who was the chief counsel to then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) during the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. "It showed Max Stier may have a political ax to grind."
But another Clinton impeachment lawyer, David Kendall, who worked closely on the case with Stier as well as serving with him at the Washington firm of Williams & Connolly, said Stier's work should not be cast as a partisan mission.
"Lawyers represent clients," Kendall said. "In this case, Max was on the side of the president, Brett was on the side of the independent counsel. I don't think taking opposing positions in formal litigations necessarily means there is an any animus between the opposing counsel."
Stier had hoped that the FBI would interview witnesses and report to Congress while he remained anonymous, according to associates.
"He was very, very hesitant to come forward," said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), who talked with Stier about the matter in early autumn 2018 and passed his name to the FBI. "Because he was concerned about exactly what is happening now. He was concerned that it would harm the mission of his organization, that he would be mischaracterized as being politically motivated."
The paths of Stier and Kavanaugh have crossed several times. Stier, who was born in California, interned in the office of Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) before attending Yale, where he and Kavanaugh were classmates.
It was then, during the 1983-1984 academic year, that Stier allegedly witnessed the sexual misconduct described mainly in two paragraphs of "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," the book published Tuesday by two New York Times reporters.
As Stier attended law school at Stanford, Kavanaugh was earning his law degree at Yale. Stier and Kavanaugh continued to follow similar paths as both clerked for justices of the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in the 1993-1994 term. Stier clerked for Justice David Souter in the following term. (Both justices were nominated by Republican presidents).
Then they both worked for high-powered Washington law firms: Kavanaugh went to work for Kirkland & Ellis, and Stier joined Williams & Connolly.
Faceoff over Clinton Their paths soon intersected again. Kavanaugh joined the office of the independent counsel, overseen by Starr, who was investigating a number of matters involving President Clinton. Stier, meanwhile, was asked by Kendall, a colleague at Williams & Connolly, to help defend Clinton.
A review of legal records shows that Stier and Kavanaugh were on opposing sides in a number of Clinton-related cases. In 1998, they faced off on the question of whether the independent counsel could compel the testimony of deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled for Kavanaugh's side, saying the White House could not assert attorney-client privilege if the president's lawyer had information related to possible criminal violations.
Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh wrote a memo outlining questions that the independent counsel should ask Clinton, including whether the president thought the intern Monica Lewinsky was lying when she described her sexual activities with Clinton.
Stier was part of the Clinton defense team that produced a memorandum urging the Senate not to remove the president - a view that prevailed in the Senate.
Stier went on to work as a lawyer in the Clinton administration, but his experience watching the impeachment battle - and other partisan fights - led him to think about developing nonpartisan solutions for making government work better.
As it happened, Stier met a financier named Sam Heyman, a Republican former assistant U.S. attorney who wanted to back a group dedicated to promoting public service. Heyman provided $25 million in 2001 to fund the Partnership for Public Service and $20 million later. Stier was put in charge of the operation, which has grown to a full-time staff of 100 and dozens of interns.
The Partnership has a singular goal: To make the federal government more effective and efficient by attracting and engaging the best workforce possible. At the core are managers who are good leaders. When government fails, the group's motto goes, it is because managers were not doing their jobs.
Besides its research team devoted to finding trends in government and its leadership seminars for managers, the group is best known for recognition programs for federal employees.
(The group also works with The Washington Post to publish a database of how many key positions are filled in the Trump administration.)
A wound reopened Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Stier is "very unpretentious, unassuming, matter-of-fact, dedicated to public service but not to partisan politics."
Stier's wife, D.C. Superior Court Associate Judge Florence Y. Pan, who had clerked for judges appointed by Republicans, was nominated in 2016 by President Barack Obama to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia. Her nomination was unanimously advanced from the Senate Judiciary Committee but, like a number of those put forward in the last year of Obama's presidency, Pan's nomination languished in the Republican-controlled Senate and was never put to a vote. With the election of President Trump, she was not renominated.
Trump, meanwhile, nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, prompting a summerlong fight between Democrats and Republicans after allegations surfaced that he had sexually assaulted a woman named Christine Blasey Ford at a home when he attended Georgetown Preparatory School. Kavanaugh denied the allegation.
Stier got in touch with Coons. The senator sat on the Judiciary Committee and had met Stier at one of the Partnership's awards ceremonies. In the first of at least two conversations, Stier "was gravely concerned about coming forward" with his recollection about the dorm incident involving Kavanaugh because of concern it might taint the Partnership as partisan, Coons said, and he did not come forward.
"He did not think the risk was worth it," Coons said in an interview. But after Blasey Ford testified that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her - and her testimony was questioned by Republicans - Stier again telephoned Coons.
With the FBI set to spend a week investigating other claims against Kavanaugh, Stier agreed to let Coons write to the bureau and urge that investigators speak with Stier about his information. Coons asked of FBI Director Christopher A. Wray in an Oct. 2 letter that an "appropriate follow up" be made with Stier.
But Stier was never interviewed by the FBI - a revelation from the new book that infuriated multiple Democratic senators, who complained about the narrow scope of the background investigation. That concern festered and the wound was reopened with Stier's account.
"What we were looking for was an honest, professional investigation," said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), the second-ranking Senate Democrat. "That didn't happen."

Nicholas Kristof: American soldiers are not the Saudis’ mercenaries

Texto completo: Robert Gates, the former defense secretary, once scoffed that Saudi Arabia “wants to fight the Iranians to the last American.”
The danger is that we slip toward that nightmare. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says that Iran has committed an “act of war” by attacking Saudi oil processing centers. Influential hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have suggested carrying out strikes on Iranian oil refineries.
Meanwhile, Iran is warning that it will retaliate for any strike with a “rapid and crushing” response.
President Donald Trump faces a conundrum. If Iran was behind the attack on Saudi Arabia, that was a serious provocation. It’s reasonable to wonder if Iranian leaders are emboldened because they see Trump as someone full of just bluster and bombast.
“He is not a lion; he is a rabbit,” said Ali Bigdeli, a political analyst in Tehran, according to a New York Times article by David D. Kirkpatrick and Farnaz Fassihi.
Iran may have concluded that Trump is the mother of all bunny rabbits after the lack of any kinetic response to attacks on oil shipping in May and June, or to Iran’s shooting down of a U.S. drone in June.
The upshot is that hawks are urging Trump to be tougher this time and to consider bombing Iranian targets. That would be even more dangerous than a perception of weakness, for it could quickly escalate. Iran would strike back at sites in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or Bahrain, and it would target American troops in Iraq or Afghanistan.
A full war with Iran would be a catastrophe. Iran has twice the population of Iraq and would be a much more formidable foe than Iraq was.
So Trump has a genuine dilemma: Inaction may be perceived as weakness, while military strikes may escalate and drag us into cataclysm. But this is a dilemma of Trump’s own making.
We are in this mess because Trump abandoned the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. Hawks argued that we could apply maximum pressure on Iran and inflict such pain that it would buckle, without appreciating that Iran could also ramp up the pressure on us.
That’s the problem with hawks. They plan out their chess games and triumphantly plot a checkmate without appreciating the basic lesson of Sun Tzu or Clausewitz that the other side also gets to move.
Unfortunately, without the Iran nuclear deal, all options are bad. We should be searching for ways to return to the agreement, with face-saving tweaks that would allow both Trump and the Iranian supreme leader to claim victory.
Instead, I’m afraid we risk slipping into conflict. Nobody wants a war, but getting out of this will require skillful diplomacy, which isn’t something the Trump team has much demonstrated.
We need not be Saudi Arabia’s guard dog or lap dog. Yes, Iran is a threat to international security — but so is Saudi Arabia. It is Saudi Arabia that kidnapped Lebanon’s prime minister, caused a schism with Qatar and created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen.
Attacking Saudi oil installations was a breach of global norms — as was murdering and dismembering a columnist for The Washington Post who was a resident of the United States. Saudi Arabia has the gall to call for an international inquiry into the attack on its oil installations, even as it blocks any international investigation into the murder of my friend Jamal Khashoggi.
Macabre new transcripts show that the Saudi hit squad was discussing the dismemberment even before Jamal walked into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. “I know how to cut very well,” one member of the team said. “I have never worked on a warm body, though.”
Saudi Arabia continues to imprison a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Loujain al-Hathloul, after earlier torturing and sexually assaulting her for advocating women’s rights. The kingdom apparently offered Hathloul freedom if she would publicly deny that she had been tortured; she bravely refused.
Trump might seek Saudi input on whether to go to war with Iran by placing a call not only to a killer on a throne but also to a hero in prison.
If Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to respond militarily to the airstrikes on its oil facilities, he can go ahead with the kingdom’s own fighter jets and missiles. But this is not our fight. Nor should it be our graveyard.
This is a struggle between two misogynistic, repressive regimes that are both destabilizing the region. And Trump’s suggestion that we will be well paid for defending Saudi Arabia is an insult to our troops, casting them as mercenaries working for a thuggish potentate.
Our task instead should be to cooperate with European countries to get out of this muck and find a way back into the Iranian nuclear agreement.

Education Department Orders Duke, UNC to Revamp Mideast Program; Government says joint curriculum reflects anti-Israel bias, raising alarms over academic freedom

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The Education Department ordered Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to overhaul their joint Middle Eastern studies program, which the department determined after an investigation presented students a biased curriculum.
The federal government rarely intervenes in the intricacies of college curricula, but the agency has broad authority to demand changes of schools that accept federal grants and financial aid. The department under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has taken an unprecedented role in addressing what the Trump administration has called pervasive anti-Israel bias at colleges and universities.
Mrs. DeVos has publicly criticized activists who support "Boycott, Divest, Sanctions" policies against Israel over its treatment of Palestinians, a movement the secretary once called a "pernicious threat" on college campuses. The department's civil rights chief, Ken Marcus, previously ran an advocacy organization that filed civil rights complaints against BDS groups on campuses, arguing that they discriminated against Jewish students.
In a letter it issued to the two schools in August after a monthslong investigation, the department concluded that the curriculum doesn't align with guidelines for a $235,000 federal grant the program receives for international studies and foreign language programs.
"Federal funding is conditioned on a demonstration that a given center program is a 'national resource,'" the department's assistant secretary for postsecondary education, Robert King, wrote in the letter. "We are concerned that most of the Duke-UNC [Center for Middle Eastern Studies] activities supported with Title VI funds are unqualified."
The New York Times first reported the delivery of the letter.
Mr. King wrote in the letter that the Middle East program's emphasis on foreign-language instruction was unclear and took issue with the extent of its cultural offerings, saying they didn't advance U.S. economic or national security goals, and pointed specifically to a conference on art and film.
"Although Iranian art and film may be…subjects of deep intellectual interest and may provide insight regarding aspects of the people and culture of the Middle East, the sheer volume of such offerings highlights a fundamental misalignment" between the university's goals and those of the federal government, the letter states.
The department also concluded that the Middle Eastern studies program, among other things, "offers very few, if any, programs on the historic discrimination faced by, and current circumstances of, religious minorities in the Middle East."
The investigation found that the program put "considerable emphasis" on the positive aspects of Islam, while not attempting to similarly demonstrate the positive aspects of Judaism and Christianity. The letter stated that the program's offerings were unduly focused on "advancing ideological priorities."
The department ordered the two universities to submit a revised curriculum, listing events it plans to host and the professors it employs. The universities were given a deadline of Sept. 22, before the department awards new grants at the end of the month.
In a statement, UNC-Chapel Hill said it is "committed to working with the department to provide more information about its programs." Duke didn't respond to a request for comment.
The letter's demands, particularly those taking issue with the viewpoints of the program's courses and professors, raised concern among advocates of free speech and academic freedom. Suzanne Nossel, chief executive of PEN America, a nonprofit group promoting freedom of expression, said that, while the letter raises legitimate concerns if federal funds are going toward courses that don't prepare students to speak Middle Eastern languages, as the grant requires, its reference to ideological positions is troubling.
"Where it gets tricky is that a piece of this seems to touch on a sort of ideological policing," Ms. Nossel said. "The Department of Education needs to be scrupulous that they're not policing viewpoints."
As reports of the letter circulated, some advocates went further, accusing the Education Department of anti-Muslim bias, a notion the agency rejected.
"Pro-Islamic programming isn't the concern—it's the lack of diversity and foreign-language learning," spokeswoman Angela Morabito said in a statement. "The department is absolutely not criticizing the school for teaching the positive aspects of Islam."

Texto completo: Canadians have seen the face of social justice, and it's rather dark. On Wednesday Time magazine published a yearbook photo of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dressed in a turban and white robes, his face covered with brown makeup. It was taken at an "Arabian Nights"-themed gala in 2001 for the Vancouver private day school where he was teaching drama, French and math.
"It was a racist thing to do," said the Liberal leader. "I should have known better then, but I didn't and I'm sorry." Mr. Trudeau, who was 29 at the time, hopes self-laceration will pre-empt a whipping from opponents. It won't, especially with an election Oct. 21. "Like all Canadians, I was extremely shocked and disappointed," said Conservative chief Andrew Scheer, adding that the Aladdin costume betrayed "a complete lack of judgment and integrity" and that Mr. Trudeau is "not fit to govern."
Mr. Scheer can be accused of opportunism. Not so Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party. "Tonight is not about the Prime Minister," he tweeted. "It's about every young person mocked for the colour of their skin. The child who had their turban ripped off their head. And those reliving intense feelings of pain & hurt from past experiences of racism. To you, I say you are loved."
Mr. Singh, a Sikh, wears a turban himself. Good luck, Mr. Trudeau.
The prime minister only recently emerged from the "Lavscam" affair, in which he pressured Attorney General Judy Wilson-Raybould to stop the corruption prosecution of a major Liberal donor, fired her when she refused, and spread lies about her. Mr. Trudeau is fond of saying, "I'm proud to be a feminist," and, "When women speak up, it is our duty to listen to them and to believe them." A lot of good that did Ms. Wilson-Raybould.
Within 12 hours of the Aladdin photo, two others surfaced of Mr. Trudeau wearing blackface in the 1990s. His explanation: "I've always—and you'll know this—been more enthusiastic about costumes than is sometimes appropriate."
That's the problem. As prime minister, Mr. Trudeau is still playing dress-up. He donned traditional garb on an official visit to India in 2018 and looked ridiculous alongside bemused Indians in Western clothes. Even his political correctness seems put on, as when he interrupted and scolded a woman for saying "mankind." He told her "peoplekind" was the "more inclusive" term.
The press, especially in America, loved Mr. Trudeau's theatrics: appointing a "gender balanced" cabinet "because it's 2015," greeting Syrian refugees at the airport, and claiming "there is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada," only tolerant multiculturalism. His government even launched a "feminist foreign policy." It sounded good, earning him praise in the New York Times, a spread in Vogue and a fawning profile in Rolling Stone.
Breezy, preening progressivism masked what everybody knew: The dilettante son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Justin was ushered into Liberal politics after an extended adolescence and abruptly made party leader because of his surname. This new scandal is damaging mostly because it reminds Canadians who leads them—not a racist but a hectoring, hypocritical high-school drama teacher who's in over his head, not an ideologue but an empty turban.

Texto completo: Here are the reasons, in no certain order, that the accusations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh will never stop and his foes on the progressive left never let up.
Because progressives have to prove they were right to advance the sexual-assault accusations of Christine Blasey Ford. They lost that battle; Justice Kavanaugh sits on the court. They won't stop the assault until they can prove they were right to launch it.
Because people become fixated on their targets. Because #MeToo continues as a potent cultural force. Because as the court assumes an ever more powerful role in American life, confirmation hearings and their aftermath will become more brutal and never-ending.
Because the authority and legitimacy of future rulings that are not pleasing to progressives (most prominently, perhaps, on Roe v. Wade) can be undermined through footnotes that say "the 5-4 decision was joined by a justice credibly accused of sexual assault."
Because the steady drum of allegations diminishes not only Justice Kavanaugh's stature but that of the court itself, which will be helpful when Democrats attempt to pack it.
Because the crazier parts of the progressive left increasingly see politics as public theater, with heroes and villains, cheers and hisses from the audience, and costumes, such as outfits from "The Handmaid's Tale." Because modern politics is, for the lonely and strange on all sides, entertainment and diversion. And one's people must be entertained.
Because many progressives believe deep in their hearts that conservative men are both sexually obsessed and repressed, that conservatism is a way of looking at the world in which women are lesser, mere prey. They think this is behind everything, including conservative reservations about or opposition to abortion. In this view, conservative jurists who say things like "60% of my clerks were women" and "I coach the girls' soccer and debate teams" are engaged in an elaborate cover. They hate the modern world. Behind closed doors they're always swinging caveman's clubs.
Because where there's smoke there must be fire. There was Ms. Ford, then the Yale rumors. There's no way there isn't something to it.
So it will never end.
For Democrats, it is not "good politics," and most of them know it. What was done to Justice Kavanaugh had a positive impact on 2018 Senate outcomes—for Republicans. There was a backlash. Women worried their sons and husbands would be targeted in a prosecutorial atmosphere that had abandoned due process.
People are complicated. Jill Abramson, who covered the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, told a story years later. Anita Hill had just testified. During a break, Ms. Abramson went for lunch in the Supreme Court cafeteria. As she stood waiting to pay for her food she chatted with another reporter about how Ms. Hill's testimony had been lethal for Judge Thomas. The cashier, a middle-aged black woman, overheard, gave Ms. Abramson a baleful look, and said: "They'll do anything to bring down a black man." It was clear she supported him. In Ms. Abramson's view it was an early sign of broader public opinion.
In an excerpt from a new book by two of its reporters, the New York Times this week famously reported another allegation of sexual misconduct by an undergraduate Mr. Kavanaugh. The Times later corrected its story to note the purported victim refused to be interviewed for the book and friends say she has no memory of such an incident. Democratic presidential contenders had already called for Justice Kavanaugh's impeachment. Soon they changed the subject. But they'll return to it.
What is kind of horrifying is the extent to which all this stems from the charges brought last year by Ms. Ford. Mr. Kavanaugh, she said, had drunkenly attempted to force himself on her at a high-school party.
I watched her testimony, as I've written before, with a bias. In my experience women in such matters are telling the truth. I assumed her charges would be substantiated.
And yet they were not, not at all, not even after a year. Not a single witness emerged to corroborate her account. The woman Ms. Ford described as a close, lifelong friend who could back up her account said she remembered no such party or gathering and had in fact never met Brett Kavanaugh. Now she admits she does not herself believe Ms. Ford's story.
Throughout the drama those who believed Judge Kavanaugh's denials operated at a disadvantage: Any criticism of Ms. Ford would be treated as a smear, so there was almost none.
I'm reminded of this by the riveting book "Justice On Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Most such investigations are written by liberal journalists for a liberal audience; Ms. Hemingway and Ms. Severino are conservatives who went forward with journalistic seriousness and paid attention to information others might ignore. They suggest "where there's smoke there's fire" can't be applied to the Kavanaugh case because from the moment he was nominated to the court he was targeted by pyromaniacs.
A leftist feminist group linked him to allegations of sexual harassment against another judge, for whom he'd clerked a quarter-century before. An activist group accused him of supporting the "problematic trope that the Constitution should be 'colorblind.' " Another group said his judicial philosophy amounted to supporting the "white supremacist patriarchy."
This was par for the course for a Republican nominee, but soon after Ms. Ford's charges came the New Yorker story in which a Yale classmate of Judge Kavanaugh said that during her freshman year he exposed himself at a drunken dorm party and caused her to touch his genitals. But the story didn't hold—the reporters were unable to find a witness to corroborate it, the accuser had "significant gaps" in her memories, and it took six days of "carefully assessing her memories" and consulting with an attorney provided by Democrats, to name Judge Kavanaugh.
The since-disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti then brought forward a woman who claimed she was gang raped at a high-school party by Mr. Kavanaugh and his friends, as were other young women. Her story fell apart too.
Then a charge came in through Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. A constituent had called his office to say a man believed to be Mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a woman on a boat in Newport, R.I., in 1985. Now there was a fourth accuser! Eventually the Judiciary Committee tracked down the constituent, an anti-Trump activist who'd called for a military coup. He later recanted his accusations on Twitter and apologized.
A letter to Sen. Kamala Harris's office claimed Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a woman while driving home from a party. The accuser was a political activist who later admitted her charge was "just a ploy" made because she was angry. Asked if she'd ever met Judge Kavanaugh she said, "Oh Lord, no."
In both cases the accusers seemed shocked you couldn't just . . . lie.
"Normally the burden of proof is on the accuser," write Ms. Hemingway and Ms. Severino, "but the media were not even paying lip service to that principle."
They weren't.
The charges will probably never stop, but at this point many of us, having seen what Justice Kavanaugh was put through because of ideology and politics, will never find them believable.

The Stoning of Brett Kavanaugh

Texto completo: For years, an enduring story line of American politics was that "the far right" was taking over the Grand Old Party of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and the Bush family. Then Donald Trump, a political idiosyncrasy running as a Republican, blew up the right-wing takeover.
Today we have a more relevant story line: The Democratic Party of Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK, Bill Clinton -- even Barack Obama -- is being taken over by the far left.
Unlike the presumed capture of the Republicans by a mishmash of disorganized groups and intellectuals, the Democrats today are making the public's perception of their party easier by defining themselves from now until Election Day with their treatment of one person -- Brett Kavanaugh.
Within hours of publication of the New York Times's tissue-thin piece on Justice Kavanaugh's years at Yale, a succession of Democratic presidential candidates posted denunciations on social media.
Elizabeth Warren: "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
Kamala Harris: "He must be impeached."
Beto O'Rourke: "He should be impeached."
Julian Castro: "He should be impeached."
Bernie Sanders: "I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable."
Impeachment, until now, has been a grave step in the American political process. But impeachment has become like popcorn for Democrats. They can't get enough of it.
This extraordinary exercise in instantaneous groupthink by so many of the party's presidential candidates is disturbing. There are several ways to interpret it, and the first requires diving to untouched depths of cynicism.
By midevening Sunday, the Times had issued a clarification of the original piece by two of the paper's staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In what now appears to be an editing fiasco of historic proportions (almost on a scale with the Washington Post's epic and must-read correction of a recent piece about racism in the paper's food section), the Times acknowledged that the woman involved in the purported Kavanuagh episode "declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."
But Democrats seem to live in a political world now whose standard of proof for judicial confirmations or any public- policy proposal is "whatever." On Monday morning, well after the Times's clarification of the original piece, the Harris campaign sent out an email grinding through "Brett Kavanaugh's illegitimate nomination." Then it asked for money: "Can you add a contribution of any amount to Kamala's campaign?" The short distance from moral high horse to money grovel is breathtaking.
About 3 p.m., Mr. Castro asked the people on his email distribution list to sign a self-promoting "emergency petition calling for Brett Kavanaugh's removal."
Still, something more serious than back-alley political cynicism is reflected in the statements from these Democratic presidential candidates. An issue raised by the entire Kavanaugh process is whether the Democratic Party as defined by its current generation of party activists is willing to conduct politics outside any conceivable definition of acceptable behavior.
Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed by a Senate vote nearly a year ago after a hearing process of unprecedented political bitterness. This New York Times article and the piling on by five Democratic presidential candidates amount to a ritualistic stoning of Brett Kavanaugh. If the established system doesn't go their way, they'll conduct politics outside the system. Whatever it takes.
The day after Donald Trump's victory in 2016, left-wing activists took over streets throughout Manhattan and shut down commuter traffic. It always struck me as a telling event, insofar as most of the New York workers these activists were shafting voted for Hillary Clinton. But their point was clear: We'll disrupt and even smash the system when we want to. This is becoming the ethos -- a politics without norms or boundaries -- that now defines the Democratic Party.
An argument against such a dire interpretation is that the activists' anything-goes politics is precisely what is at stake in the struggle between the party's left and "moderates" such as Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar. I'm not sure I believe that now, and the reason is Minnesota's Sen. Klobuchar.
After the Times piece appeared Saturday and her fellow candidates outputted their serial impeachment demands, Ms. Klobuchar somehow felt compelled to say the Kavanaugh confirmation "process was a sham." This from a candidate who has tried, like Mr. Biden, to present herself as the adult in the room. That Ms. Klobuchar caved says a lot about the requirements of party membership now.
It raises the question of how real the whole "moderate" Democratic phenomenon is, or whether Ms. Warren has accurately identified the party's near-term future -- progressivism without nuance or quarter.
If Mr. Biden somehow got elected, the pressure from the far left to conform his administration's policy to its agenda would be overwhelming and relentless. That's the lesson of the Kavanaugh stoning. Today Brett Kavanaugh, tomorrow whoever gets in the way, including a moderate Democratic president.

Having a Conversation, One Cliche at a Time

Texto completo: In "It's Been Said Before," Orin Hargraves's excellent study of cliches, he maintains that "journalism is demonstrably the greatest depository of cliches in English," with talk radio and social media coming up fast on the outside. The reason is not merely that journalists write under pressure but that "consumers of journalism accept conventional and stereotyped ways of expressing ideas, whether consciously or unconsciously, as part of the diet."
Mr. Hargraves is more tolerant of cliches that crop up in speech, since "none of us has much of an opportunity to edit our extemporaneous speech." He even allows that "you would probably sound stilted and peculiar if you trained yourself to speak extemporaneously without the use of cliches." Imagine if you will -- I can't -- a postgame interview with an athlete who doesn't say that he's going "to take things one day, one game at a time, and try to stay focused."
In the realm of cliches in extemporaneous speech, politicians surely lead the field. Without such cliches as "going forward," "bring to the table," "level playing field," "at the end of the day," "tipping point" and "the American people," most would be reduced to stuttering, if not rendered speechless. The characteristic cliche-studded political sentence might run: "At the end of the day, given a level playing field, we have to bring to the table [blank] to allow the American people to go forward before we reach a tipping point."
The most recent political cliche is the word "conversation" -- an illegitimate child of "dialogue." The word "dialogue" itself came into heavy play in the 1950s and '60s. In its American version, dialogue meant having people of distinctly different political views on newspaper opinion pages and on political talk television shows. Thus the New York Times hired William Safire, a former speechwriter to Vice President Spiro Agnew and later President Nixon, for its otherwise liberal op-ed page. The Wall Street Journal brought on the intractably left-wing Alexander Cockburn, who wrote that the first law of journalism was "to confirm existing prejudice, rather than contradict it," and who, it must be said, lived by that adage.
The idea behind the notion of dialogue was to get opposing political viewpoints together, in the expectation that a greater truth would somehow emerge. Alas, it -- the truth, that is -- rarely did. What resulted instead was bitter argument, minds more firmly entrenched than ever in their old opinions, and business going on as usual. If you want to see dialogue in its full futility, tune in any night to Chris Cuomo's show on CNN or Laura Ingraham's on Fox News.
As for the more recent cliche, "conversation," it is nicely on exhibit in the television interviews of Mark Sanford about why he has chosen to run in the Republican primaries against Donald Trump. He used the word nine times in six minutes on NBC's "Meet the Press" Aug. 18 and 11 times in 10 minutes on "Fox News Sunday" Sept. 8.
"We have got to have a national conversation and a Republican conversation on where we are going on debt and deficit spending," Mr. Sanford told Fox's Chris Wallace. We need "to have a conversation on what it means to be a Republican," he told NBC's Chuck Todd. He informed both men that we need to have a conversation on trade, and Mr. Wallace that we also need "a conversation on humility and one's approach to politics." Mark Sanford, clearly, is a man with a hunger for discussion. If you've a free moment, give him a ring.
The word "conversation" has another use for politicians, one I've seen Kamala Harris avail herself of more than once. It is employed when one is accused of some grave misconduct in one's past or of an unexplained current volte-face. Instead of answering the charge or explaining the matter, the politician remarks that "we need to have a conversation about that" and avoids dealing with it entirely. In this use, needing to have a conversation is a pure diversionary tactic, which really means, "Thanks all the same, but I'd rather not talk about it."
Politicians have never been known for their reticence or for the purity of their language. But their normal verbosity in recent years has come to seem especially cliche-ridden. The reason for this, I assume, is that Congress doesn't do much of national importance anymore. Members have to fill the silence with something, and cliches are what they've got on hand. Maybe we need to have a conversation about this.

Texto completo: Modern conservatives hate regulation, and the Trump administration has channeled that hatred into policy. It has scrapped or emasculated rules designed to limit everything from predatory lending to exploitative for-profit education, and has moved on multiple fronts to undo environmental protection. Yesterday it took perhaps its most dramatic anti-regulation step so far, announcing that it would try to prevent California from setting strict rules on auto emissions.
But what’s behind this hatred of regulation? You might think that it’s all about profits, that corporations want to be free to pollute and rip off their customers because it’s good for the bottom line. In fact, however, the striking thing about many of Donald Trump’s deregulatory moves is that major corporations actually oppose his actions.
Thus, most of the big auto companies, having already based their plans on the expectation that Obama-era emission standards would remain in place, don’t want to see them reversed, and several companies went as far as to agree to adhere to California’s rules even if they were stricter than federal regulations.
A similar story is unfolding with regard to the Trump administration’s rollback of regulations intended to ensure that light bulbs become more efficient. True, light bulb manufacturers welcomed the move. But the Alliance to Save Energy, which condemned Trump’s action, is hardly a bunch of hippie tree-huggers; its membership includes a who’s who of major corporations, from 3M to Microsoft to Dupont.
No, there’s something happening here that goes beyond big money trying to get even bigger. Trump, I’d argue, is tapping into a grassroots phenomenon — let’s call it regulation rage — that is more about psychology than about self-interest. It’s a syndrome that only afflicts a minority of the population, but it’s real, it’s ugly, and it can do a remarkable amount of damage.
What do I mean by regulation rage? It’s the startling anger evoked by government rules intended to protect the public, even when those rules aren’t especially onerous and the public interest case for the rules is overwhelming.
I think I first became aware of regulation rage back in the 1980s, when a local Massachusetts talk radio host led a temporarily successful jihad against the state’s seat belt law. (The state reinstated the law after its repeal led to a surge in traffic fatalities.)
However, the phenomenon really came into focus for me a decade ago, when I read a rant by right-wing commentator Erick Erickson suggesting that government officials should face violent retribution for their actions: “At what point do the people tell the politicians to go to hell? At what point do they get off the couch, march down to their state legislator’s house, pull him outside, and beat him to a bloody pulp for being an idiot?”
What was the policy that set Erickson off? Washington state’s ban on phosphates in detergents. Phosphates are a real environmental menace, which can help cause toxic algae blooms. But never mind; Erickson was enraged because, he claimed, his dishwasher wasn’t working as well as it used to. If threatening violence over your dishwasher sounds crazy, that’s because it is, but undoing dishwasher regulations has, it turns out, become an important conservative cause.
Regulation rage has a couple of distinctive features. One is its disproportionality, in which fairly mild restrictions set off volcanic anger. The other is the sheer pettiness of many of the ragers’ complaints. Trump, by his own account, dislikes modern light bulbs because they make him look orange — which isn’t even true. (He does indeed look orange, but it’s probably because of his addiction to artificial tanning and excessive use of bronzer.)
Oh, and do people remember Trump’s opposition to regulations that protect the ozone layer because, he claimed, his hair spray wasn’t working as well as it used to?
So what’s really driving regulation rage? I’d love to see some serious political science research into the phenomenon. I suspect, though I don’t know for sure, that there are strong correlations between regulation rage and other attitudes, like support for unregulated gun sales and racial hostility.
But as I said, regulation rage seems to be more about psychology than about self-interest. It’s coming from people who, for whatever reason, don’t feel respected, and who see even mild restrictions on their actions as insults perpetrated by elites who consider themselves smarter than other people.
Such people are a distinct minority among Americans in general. For example, polling tells us that an overwhelming majority of Americans, including a majority of self-identified Republicans, want to see pollution regulation strengthened, not weakened.
But regulation ragers have disproportionate influence over Republican politicians. And now we have a regulation rager sitting in the White House, determined to undo public-interest regulation even when big business wants it retained.
And pointing out that regulatory rollbacks are both bad for the economy and likely to sicken or kill many Americans won’t help. After all, anyone saying such things is, by definition, a know-it-all elitist.

Texto completo: La Administración Trump está sopesando la posibilidad de aumentar drásticamente los precios que los migrantes pagan en las cortes para apelar sus casos de deportación o para solicitar la ayuda de un juez que reconsidere sus reclamos en los tribunales.
Los mayores afectados serían los migrantes que se encuentran detenidos por el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE , en inglés) y los que fueron devueltos a México para esperar por la resolución de sus peticiones de asilo en tribunales estadounidenses.
Según documentos obtenidos por la web informativa BuzzFeed News, los oficiales solicitaron que los migrantes paguen $975 dólares por la apelación de un fallo de un juez de inmigración y $875 dólares para solicitar que un caso sea reabierto o reconsiderado por la Junta de Apelaciones de Inmigración.
Actualmente, el precio para ambos procesos está instituido en $110 dólares cada uno. La nueva medida podría influir sustancialmente en la manera en que los inmigrantes apelan la decisión de los jueces en los casos de deportación .
Algunos expertos también consideran que un gran número de migrantes verían reducidas sus opciones para solicitar protección o un estatus legal.
“Están esencialmente privando a las personas del derecho a apelar, eso es mucho dinero. Es un aumento sustancial de las tarifas que está fuera del alcance de las personas “, explicó la ex jueza de inmigración en San Francisco, Rebecca Jamil.
De acuerdo con BuzzFeed News, el Departamento de Justicia no quiso hacer comentarios al respecto, pero varios oficiales señalaron que los costos de los procesos no habían aumentado desde 1986 y que, si lo hacían era, se debía a un abarrotamiento en las cortes del país.
“La administración no ha puesto énfasis en el debido proceso de los inmigrantes: estas tarifas parecen estar a la luz de ese patrón. Creo absolutamente que esto disuadirá a las personas de tomar decisiones atractivas, incluso si son injustas “, señaló Sarah Pierce, analista de políticas del Instituto de Política Migratoria.
Bajo la actual administración de Donald Trump, los casos de apelación se incrementaron hasta 30,000 durante el año fiscal 2018 .
Un artículo de The New York Times reveló que en el mes de las cortes de inmigración tenían más de 800,000 casos pendientes, lo que significaba que se necesitaba un promedio de 700 días para procesar cada uno de ellos.
Si se aprueba, la medida no se haría efectiva de inmediato, puesto que las regulaciones requieren de un periodo de discusión de 60 días.

Having a Conversation, One Cliché at a Time; Without 'going forward,' 'bring to the table' and 'tipping point,' most politicians would go silent.

Texto completo: In "It's Been Said Before," Orin Hargraves's excellent study of clichés, he maintains that "journalism is demonstrably the greatest depository of clichés in English," with talk radio and social media coming up fast on the outside. The reason is not merely that journalists write under pressure but that "consumers of journalism accept conventional and stereotyped ways of expressing ideas, whether consciously or unconsciously, as part of the diet."
Mr. Hargraves is more tolerant of clichés that crop up in speech, since "none of us has much of an opportunity to edit our extemporaneous speech." He even allows that "you would probably sound stilted and peculiar if you trained yourself to speak extemporaneously without the use of clichés." Imagine if you will—I can't—a postgame interview with an athlete who doesn't say that he's going "to take things one day, one game at a time, and try to stay focused."
In the realm of clichés in extemporaneous speech, politicians surely lead the field. Without such clichés as "going forward," "bring to the table," "level playing field," "at the end of the day," "tipping point" and "the American people," most would be reduced to stuttering, if not rendered speechless. The characteristic cliché-studded political sentence might run: "At the end of the day, given a level playing field, we have to bring to the table [blank] to allow the American people to go forward before we reach a tipping point."
The most recent political cliché is the word "conversation"—an illegitimate child of "dialogue." The word "dialogue" itself came into heavy play in the 1950s and '60s. In its American version, dialogue meant having people of distinctly different political views on newspaper opinion pages and on political talk television shows. Thus the New York Times hired William Safire, a former speechwriter to Vice President Spiro Agnew and later President Nixon, for its otherwise liberal op-ed page. The Wall Street Journal brought on the intractably left-wing Alexander Cockburn, who wrote that the first law of journalism was "to confirm existing prejudice, rather than contradict it," and who, it must be said, lived by that adage.
The idea behind the notion of dialogue was to get opposing political viewpoints together, in the expectation that a greater truth would somehow emerge. Alas, it—the truth, that is—rarely did. What resulted instead was bitter argument, minds more firmly entrenched than ever in their old opinions, and business going on as usual. If you want to see dialogue in its full futility, tune in any night to Chris Cuomo's show on CNN or Laura Ingraham's on Fox News.
As for the more recent cliché, "conversation," it is nicely on exhibit in the television interviews of Mark Sanford about why he has chosen to run in the Republican primaries against Donald Trump. He used the word nine times in six minutes on NBC's "Meet the Press" Aug. 18 and 11 times in 10 minutes on "Fox News Sunday" Sept. 8.
"We have got to have a national conversation and a Republican conversation on where we are going on debt and deficit spending," Mr. Sanford told Fox's Chris Wallace. We need "to have a conversation on what it means to be a Republican," he told NBC's Chuck Todd. He informed both men that we need to have a conversation on trade, and Mr. Wallace that we also need "a conversation on humility and one's approach to politics." Mark Sanford, clearly, is a man with a hunger for discussion. If you've a free moment, give him a ring.
The word "conversation" has another use for politicians, one I've seen Kamala Harris avail herself of more than once. It is employed when one is accused of some grave misconduct in one's past or of an unexplained current volte-face. Instead of answering the charge or explaining the matter, the politician remarks that "we need to have a conversation about that" and avoids dealing with it entirely. In this use, needing to have a conversation is a pure diversionary tactic, which really means, "Thanks all the same, but I'd rather not talk about it."
Politicians have never been known for their reticence or for the purity of their language. But their normal verbosity in recent years has come to seem especially cliché-ridden. The reason for this, I assume, is that Congress doesn't do much of national importance anymore. Members have to fill the silence with something, and clichés are what they've got on hand. Maybe we need to have a conversation about this.
Mr. Epstein is author, most recently, of "Charm: The Elusive Enchantment."

Security Rift Exposes Data Of 20 Million In Ecuador

Texto completo: Ecuador has begun an investigation into a sprawling data breach in which the personal data of up to 20 million people, more than the country's population, was made available online.
The inquiry began after vpnMentor, an internet security firm, alerted the authorities to the enormous security failure, which included the exposure of the data of adults and children, both dead and alive. Ecuador has a population of over 16 million people.
A statement from the attorney general on Monday did not indicate whether anyone had gained access to the data while it had been vulnerable.
Ecuadorean officials said in a statement on Tuesday that they had detained a man identified as William Roberto G., whom they described as the legal representative of Novaestrat, a small online data consulting firm in the city of Esmeraldas, and taken him for questioning in the capital, Quito.
The attorney general's office said the company, which was founded by former top telecommunication officials, was suspected of being responsible for the information breach.
"This is a very delicate issue that is a major concern for the government," Ecuador's interior minister, Maria Paula Romo, said in a news conference Tuesday. She declined to provide further details, citing a continuing inquiry.
The New York Times was not immediately able to locate Novaestrat's lawyers or contact the company.
The news has jolted the small South American nation, underlining the risks of rapid digitalization of personal data pursued by its government. This year, Ecuadorean authorities admitted to using Chinese facial recognition technology to reduce crime.
Some expressed indignation that a provincial firm founded two years ago with capital of just $ 3,000 had access to sensitive and extensive government databases. The country's privacy advocates have for years warned of the risks posed by the lack of a data protection law in the country.
"I feel naked and abused because these people have my information without my authorization," said Ivan Muela Flor, a software programmer with IBM in Quito. "The people don't realize just how grave this is."
President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador on Monday promised to fast-track a data protection law.
Names, social security numbers and contact information were among the elements contained in the exposed files, according to a report published on Monday by vpnMentor. One of the most worrying aspects of the episode, the report said, was that the data included information about people's family members.
Other sections of the database contained employment information, including job titles and salaries, and bank details, such as account numbers and current balances.
The data appeared to come from Ecuadorean government registries, an automobile association and a state-owned bank, according to vpnMentor. It was discovered on an unsecured server in Miami. The breach was closed on Sept. 11, the company's report said.
Among the data, vpnMentor said, was an entry, including the national identification number, for Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who lived in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London from 2012 until this year.
This is not the first major data security breach in the country. In 2016, hackers stole $ 12 million from Ecuador's Banco del Austro by breaching its Swift payment system.
Both the scale and source of the current breach recalled the theft in July of the personal information of as many as five million Bulgarians, nearly the country's entire adult population, from the national tax agency. That breach highlighted the vulnerability of data held by national institutions and the danger of hackers' taking advantage of weak security.
A self-proclaimed hacker, who called Bulgaria's cybersecurity "a parody," claimed responsibility. The authorities arrested two workers and the owner of a cybersecurity firm, Tad Group, shortly after reports of the breach came out. The workers were charged with terrorism, while investigations into the owner's possible involvement continued.

Wen, Planned Parenthood resolve dispute

Texto completo: Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore's former health commissioner, has resolved a dispute with Planned Parenthood over her severance and benefits, which she said the organization was withholding to get her to sign a burdensome confidentiality contract after she was fired less than a year into her tenure as president and CEO.
Both Wen and Planned Parenthood issued statements Tuesday welcoming the separation agreement - but neither addressed the confidentiality contract issue.
"I am relieved that the dispute with @PPFA [Planned Parenthood] has been resolved & I will not comment any further on this private employment matter," Wen tweeted. "As a former patient, I will always be thankful for the exceptional care that Planned Parenthood provides to millions of people every year."
Planned Parenthood is "glad that both parties have been able to work together and find a resolution," the women's reproductive health organization said in a statement.
The separation dispute following Wen's firing in July became public in an article the New York Times published Saturday detailing the dispute.
Wen has said her firing came down to a difference of priorities: "I wanted to emphasize total women's health. They wanted to double down on abortion rights."
She has said the confidentiality agreement the organization asked her to sign went beyond what she agreed to when she took the job, and was an attempt to "silence my voice as a public health expert."
"I simply will not sign away my right to speak my mind," she said Saturday. "I won't compromise my integrity."
Wen, who served as Baltimore's top health official for four years before leaving for Planned Parenthood, remains a medical doctor and has taken a public health teaching job with George Washington University.

Texto completo: Leading up to what will likely be a highly divisive presidential election, mired in partisan and increasingly ideological politics, today's anniversary of the Constitution's ratification offers a valuable opportunity to reassess where we are as a country.
Today, the grand nations of old Europe are stifled by over-regulated economies, nationalized industries, and socialized health care, ruled more by bureaucrats in Brussels than by their own elected legislatures. Magnificent cathedrals are now empty testaments to their postmodern faith in secularism. The cultures of Europe are in steep decline, and it is unclear whether they will ever be able to recover.
The primary reason the United States has not gone the way of Europe yet is that our country has long maintained a political culture grounded in moral and constitutional principles, which has kept it moored in the Western tradition of reason and faith, protected from the radicalization and emptiness of modern thought that has devastated Europe. European-style arguments have not fully succeeded here precisely because they are working against the deep currents of American ideas and institutions.
But will this remain the case?
Progressive thinkers at the start of the last century repudiated the Founders’ principles, holding that there are no self-evident truths, as in “all men are created equal,” but only historical claims and the constant search for progress. There are no permanent rights with which man is endowed, but endlessly evolving rights that develop and grow.
But now, with the spread of “identity politics,” our old rights are under renewed attack. The latest example is the New York Times' 1619 Project, which claims slavery in North America “as our true founding” in order to “reframe the country’s history” as one of racism, hatred and white supremacy, rather than life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Another concerning development is that Congress has over time delegated vast legislative powers to a metastasizing, bureaucratic executive branch that modern presidents struggle to control. This shift of power away from the lawmaking institutions of republican government to an oligarchy of unelected bureaucrats who increasingly govern virtually every aspect of our daily lives threatens the rule of law and undermines the core principle of consent of the governed.
If these trends become the undisputed norm, it could well mark the demise of our great experiment in self-government. This is not progress, but the decline of a civilization.
The change we need is a vibrant renewal of the permanent truths about man, politics, and liberty, the foundational principles and constitutional wisdom that are the true roots of our country’s greatness. Instead of the abandonment of republican institutions, we need the restoration of a constitutionally robust Congress, president, and Supreme Court.
This doesn’t mean going back to the 18th century. But we need to relearn our country’s guiding principles and think deeply about how to connect them to circumstances today. Relearning these fundamentals and how to thoughtfully engage in political life is the primary reason Hillsdale College has launched its new Van Andel Graduate School of Government in Washington, D.C., to give future statesmen the knowledge and tools that will guide them in a lifetime of deliberative and prudent service.
The key to making prudential decisions, as well as distinguishing between reasonable compromise and self-defeating reforms, is a deep understanding of and commitment to core principles. It is this sure commitment to principles that can transform prudence from mere timidity into bold and courageous action when the times call for it. And serious, thoughtful leaders cannot doubt that we are living in just such a time, calling for prudence at its very boldest.
The Declaration of Independence, Jefferson later recorded, was “neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing.” Rather, “it was intended to be an expression of the American mind.”
Our aim must be a clear expression and forthright defense of American principles and political institutions in the public square. Despite constant criticism and scorn by academic elites, political leaders, and the popular media, many Americans still believe in the uniqueness of this country, respect the noble ideas put forth by the American Founders, and have not accepted America’s decline as inevitable.
The goal must be to restore the liberating principles of the American founding as the defining public philosophy of our nation. As it has been for most of American history, so it can be again.
Matthew Spalding is Dean of Hillsdale College’s Van Andel Graduate School of Government in Washington, DC.

Auction of Anthony Bourdain’s Personal Collection Will Include His Art and Writing Desk

Texto completo: When author, chef, television host and beloved culinary provocateur Anthony Bourdain committed suicide in 2018, the world’s outpouring of profound mourning was close to unique in terms of collective reactions to untimely celebrity deaths. Bourdain was not simply a lucky guy resting on the laurels of his smash-hit book career, but a dogged world traveler obsessed with shining lights on issues that weren’t receiving sufficient attention. In 2017, Bourdain even took Parts Unknown to Antarctica to check out what kind of cuisine climate scientists were sustaining themselves with. On Monday, the New York Times reported that a collection of some of Bourdain’s accumulated belongings will be auctioned off this fall by professional appraiser Lark E. Mason; a sale that should provide rare insight into Bourdain’s personal collection of meaningful items.
It’s difficult to take stock of Bourdain’s personal collection without feeling intrusive, because the man was so selflessly focused on providing great care and services to everyone except himself, and this comes across in the modesty of his own belongings. Nevertheless, it shows Bourdain had domestic style in droves: he apparently told his personal assistant he wanted his apartment to feel like the notorious Chateau Marmont of West Hollywood. He collected art by John Lurie and Ralph Steadman, and accumulated works of midcentury modern furniture by Peter Lovig Nielsen.
SEE ALSO: How Toshihiko Hosaka Made the Image on ‘Time’ Magazine’s Climate Change Cover Out of Sand
Perhaps the most prized item on the lot is Bourdain’s beloved “steel and meteorite” knife, which was made by Bob Kramer. “He walked right to the bar and he was like, ‘Oh man, I’ve been looking forward to this,'” Kramer told the Time s of his handing off of the knife to Bourdain. “He held it, looked at me, I don’t know, we just connected there for a second. Because he got it and I’d made it for him.” Bourdain’s almost sensual reverence for detail and earthbound solidity was present in everything he did, from his hosting to his writing to his cooking.
The talent evident in his debut piece for The New Yorker is still shocking: “Gastronomy is the science of pain,” Bourdain wrote in 1999. “Professional cooks belong to a secret society whose ancient rituals derive from the principles of stoicism in the face of humiliation, injury, fatigue and the threat of illness.”
If you should wish to buy, for example, Bourdain’s gorgeous Nielsen desk, which will start at around $800 when the auction goes live online in October, it might help to know that 60 percent of the proceeds will go to Bourdain’s daughter and wife, Ottavia Busia (with whom he was separated at the time of his death). The rest, according to the Times , will be funneled into a new scholarship founded in Bourdain’s name at the Culinary Institute of America.

The Bernie Sanders Standard; Welcome to a leading campaign for the Democratic nomination, where no smear against America is out of bounds.

Texto completo: Just days after being hired by the NBC television program "Saturday Night Live," a comedian named Shane Gillis has been fired after the discovery of offensive remarks he made in a podcast. If Mr. Gillis is now unable to find work in comedy, he can always apply to serve as a surrogate for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.
No one seems to be arguing that Mr. Gillis' comments on race and sex weren't offensive, but a number of his colleagues in the entertainment industry are questioning where the bar has been set for people who make their livings peddling shock humor. (Some readers will argue that if one needs to shock audiences then the performance doesn't actually contain much humor. But that's a question for another day.)
Suzy Byrne of Yahoo News notes that former "Saturday Night Live " cast member David Spade addressed the controversy on his own Comedy Central show by interviewing comedians Jim Jefferies and Bill Burr:
Jefferies criticized our "cancel culture," and asked whether past SNL sketches should be thrown out too, pointing to John Belushi's famous Samurai and Mike Meyers as the Japanese game show host. And Burr argued that if you look in anyone's past, you could find some unflattering things. "We're not running for office," Burr argued. "When is this going to... end?" He also blamed "millennials," saying they are "a bunch of rats... None of them care. All they want to do is get people in trouble."
Mr. Gillis got in trouble. But how about someone who really is running for office? Sen. Bernie Sanders is not only running for office—he's running second in polls for the Democratic presidential nomination. But he seems to have set the bar lower than "Saturday Night Live" producer Lorne Michaels.
Last week Mr. Sanders welcomed Linda Sarsour as a surrogate to speak on his behalf to America's voters. In 2017, according to the Washington Post, Ms. Sarsour spoke to a convention of the Islamic Society of North America:
In her speech, Sarsour told a story from Islamic scripture about a man who once asked Muhammad, the founder of Islam, "What is the best form of jihad, or struggle?
"And our beloved prophet … said to him, 'A word of truth in front of a tyrant ruler or leader, that is the best form of jihad,'" Sarsour said.
"I hope that … when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers not only abroad in the Middle East or on the other side of the world, but here in these United States of America, where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House."
In an interview with The Washington Post early Friday, Sarsour said she was advocating solely for peaceful, nonviolent dissent.
Mr. Sanders must surely understand that calling the United States a fascist tyranny deserving of jihad is deeply offensive to many Americans. And nobody has claimed that Ms. Sarsour was performing in a comedy sketch at the convention. She really meant it.
In a related story, this week the Post reports that Ms. Sarsour is among those parting ways with an organization that is perhaps not quite as extreme as the Sanders presidential campaign:
The Women's March is replacing three inaugural board members who have been dogged by accusations of anti-Semitism, infighting and financial mismanagement — controversies some say have slowed the organization's progress and diminished its impact.
Co-Chairs Bob Bland, Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour stepped down from the board July 15, though the organization has been slow to announce their departures. The Women's March website continued to host their photos and titles as co-chairs through this week, when the group announced the board turnover.
A fourth co-chair, Carmen Perez-Jordan, will remain on the board. Farah Stockman of the New York Times reports :
After the 2017 march, the four co-chairs ousted one of the group's earliest organizers, Vanessa Wruble, who is Jewish. Ms. Wruble later helped establish a new organization and made accusations of anti-Semitism. Ms. Mallory's close ties to the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who is respected in the black community, but is widely reviled in the Jewish community for virulently anti-Semitic remarks, had long raised eyebrows in New York.
Last year in the Times Ms. Stockman reported on a dispute occurring shortly after the original march in 2017:
Ms. Mallory and Ms. Perez began berating Ms. Wruble, according to Evvie Harmon, a white woman who helped organize the march, and who attended the meeting at Ms. Mallory's apartment complex.
"They were talking about, 'You people this,' and 'You people that' and the kicker was, 'You people hold all the wealth.' I was like, 'Oh my God, they are talking about her being Jewish,'" said Ms. Harmon, whose account was first published by Tablet. "The greatest regret of my life was not standing up and saying 'This is wrong.'"
Ms. Mallory denied that she disparaged Ms. Wruble's Jewish heritage in that meeting, but acknowledged telling white women there that she did not trust them.
"They are not trustworthy," she said, adding that Ms. Wruble gossiped behind the backs of the other march leaders instead of confronting them when she had an issue. "Every single one of us has heard things that offended us. We still do the work."
Shortly after that meeting, Ms. Mallory, Ms. Perez and Ms. Sarsour decided they did not want to work with Ms. Wruble anymore.
Yet somehow Mr. Sanders has now decided that he wants to work with Ms. Sarsour. It may be shocking, but it's definitely not funny.

Main Street: Pin the Asterisk on Kavanaugh

Texto completo: It's just shy of a year since Brett Kavanaugh took his seat on the Supreme Court. On cue, the New York Times on Sunday published a "previously unreported story" claiming that as a Yale undergraduate at a "drunken dorm party," Mr. Kavanaugh had his pants down while friends pushed his genitals "into the hands of a female student." The accusation is similar to Deborah Ramirez's assertion last year in the New Yorker about another drunken Yale party.
What has happened since is familiar. No sooner is the "bombshell" story dropped than it starts to look like a dud. It emerges, for example, that this new allegation isn't really new -- the Federal Bureau of Investigation and senators knew about it during Mr. Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings -- and the Times never spoke to the man who had made the charge, Max Stier.
On Monday the Times added a humiliating "editors' note" admitting its story omitted a crucial fact: The purported victim declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall such an incident. That hasn't stopped the Democrats' 2020 candidates -- including Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg -- from calling for the justice's impeachment.
In short, the "new" accusation fails for the same reason the earlier ones did: lack of evidence. Any fair-minded reading of "Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court" by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino would lead to the conclusion that the accusations that Mr. Kavanaugh is a sexual predator remain at best unsubstantiated and at worst fabricated. And one way to read Sunday's Times story is as confirmation that, after a year of investigation, the evidence for Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of sexual assault is as thin ever.
The Times story was adapted from a new book on the case by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, both reporters for the paper. But as Ms. Hemingway has written, their book did contain a bombshell: a statement from Ms. Blasey Ford's high-school friend Leland Keyser, who was pressured to corroborate the claim that Mr. Kavanaugh had tried to rape Ms. Blasey Ford. "I don't have any confidence in her story," Ms. Keyser told Ms. Pogrebin and Ms. Kelly.
With no evidence, the prospects for unseating Justice Kavanaugh are nil. So why the continuing assaults? Because if you throw enough mud, it leaves a stain. Ms. Blasey Ford's lawyer, Debra Katz, laid this out in an April speech at the University of Baltimore:
"He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important. It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine."
These remarks -- suggesting that Ms. Katz's client had motivations other than the truth -- surfaced only this month with the release of Ryan Lovelace's "Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign Against Brett Kavanaugh." Mr. Lovelace's scoop cries out for follow-up reporting, but the Times won't touch it.
This is what Democrats do when they believe there could be a fifth vote to overturn Roe, the 1973 decision that upended the laws of all 50 states to legalize abortion. It's why Sen. Ted Kennedy in 1987 slandered Judge Robert Bork as a man working for an America where "women would be forced into back-alley abortions" and "blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters." It's why Judge Clarence Thomas was savaged in 1991, when he faced his own last-minute inquisition over alleged sexual harassment. And it's why the assassination of Justice Kavanaugh's character continues.
A new documentary on Justice Thomas's confirmation, called "High-Tech Lynching" and airing Wednesday on FoxNation, reveals why smears can still be effective even if they have been discredited or have failed to derail a nominee. At the time of the Thomas vote, a Gallup poll showed Americans found Mr. Thomas more credible, by a 2-to-1 margin, than his accuser, Anita Hill. But when allies assured him he had been vindicated, Justice Thomas wasn't buying.
The new justice told his friend Armstrong Williams that he won confirmation because African-Americans remained loyal to him. In 15 to 20 years, he predicted, "I guarantee you the opinion of me will be unfavorable among that community" because "the liberal media special-interest groups will stop at nothing."
As if to underscore his point, the documentary features Sen. Orrin Hatch saying that Joe Biden -- then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- had told him he didn't believe Anita Hill. Now that he's running for president, Mr. Biden has flipped the Thomas narrative, apologizing to the woman he told Mr. Hatch he didn't believe. For good reason: Most Americans didn't believe her, either.
It's good that folks are exposing the flimsiness of the latest allegations against Justice Kavanaugh. But those making and propagating these charges aren't interested in getting to the truth. And they ought to be called out as the smear merchants they are.
Ms. Katz puts it well: It's all about the asterisk.

Texto completo: Prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed eight years of President Trump's tax returns from his longtime accounting firm, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The subpoena seeks documents including Mr. Trump's personal tax returns and those of his longtime business, the Trump Organization, the person said. The probe is examining whether a payment to former adult-film star Stormy Daniels -- and the way the Trump Organization recorded the reimbursement of that payment -- violated a state law that bars falsifying business records, according to the person.
A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which is conducting the investigation, declined to comment.
Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said, "We are evaluating our options, taking a look at the situation, and we'll respond in due course."
A spokeswoman for the accounting firm, Mazars USA, said in a statement that the company would "respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations." She said it is the firm's policy not to comment on work it does for clients.
The subpoena was reported earlier by the New York Times.
An investigation by Manhattan state prosecutors into the president's role in hush-money payments has escalated since the federal investigation into those payments -- which sent former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to prison in May -- concluded this summer. Investigators from the district attorney's office met with Mr. Cohen this summer, the person familiar with the matter said.
A lawyer for Mr. Cohen didn't respond to a request for comment.
In August 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to charges including violating campaign-finance law by arranging hush-money payments during the 2016 election to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr. Trump. He has said he did so at Mr. Trump's behest, an assertion that was confirmed by federal prosecutors in a court filing last year.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing.
Until this summer, federal prosecutors in Manhattan probed the possible involvement of others at the Trump Organization in Mr. Cohen's campaign-finance violations. They haven't disclosed any indictments of any executives at the company.
Federal prosecutors said in a charging document for Mr. Cohen that the Trump Organization accounted for reimbursement checks to him for the payments as "legal expenses," when, in fact, there was no such retainer agreement. The reimbursement Mr. Cohen sought was "not in connection with any legal services he had provided," prosecutors have said.
Justice Department policy bars the indictment of a sitting president.
The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney's office is the latest chapter in a multipronged effort by investigators to obtain the president's financial information.
The House Intelligence and Financial Services committees in April subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for documents and financial records -- including tax returns -- related to Mr. Trump, his children and various business entities they own spanning the past decade. Deutsche Bank told a federal appeals court last month that it has copies of tax returns sought under that subpoena.
In July, the House Ways and Means Committee sued the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service for the president's tax returns. In a separate dispute, the president sued that committee and New York state officials in an attempt to block his state tax returns from being turned over to the panel.
Mr. Trump in 2016 broke with four decades of precedent for presidential candidates in declining to release his tax returns.

Kamala Harris claims crying women and men approached her after Kavanaugh confirmation

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris claimed that women and men alike publicly approached her and cried following the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Speaking with Rachel Maddow on Monday, Harris agreed with the MSNBC host's assessment that Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court "feels incredibly damaging" and that it has impacted women, in particular.
"You’re right," Harris responded. "I mean, listen, after the initial hearings that happened a year ago, the number of women and men who approached me in public places and cried about what this meant to them, because there’s so much about this issue — and I as a prosecutor personally prosecuted sexual assault cases and cases of this general nature — and one of the worst things that happens is that when we are not willing to believe the victim and take them seriously," Harris said.
Harris and many other Democratic presidential candidates have called for Kavanaugh's impeachment after a since-corrected New York Times story published a new sexual misconduct allegation against him.
The claim against Kavanaugh came from Max Stier, a Yale University classmate, who said he saw Kavanaugh expose himself and press his genitalia against a female student during a Yale party. Stier said he informed the FBI, but they did not investigate it.
The Times later issued an editor's note to their story because they "did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."

When Harris was asked about the additional details to the story during an interview with NPR, she said it is not uncommon for people who experience traumatizing events to not remember it.
"Well, I would say that the fact that someone doesn’t remember the details of the incident doesn’t mean there’s lack of evidence if there are other witnesses who can establish that the fact occurred. And so I wouldn’t say there’s no evidence," she said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The House Oversight and Reform Committee is launching an ethics inquiry into whether Elaine Chao is using her role as head of the Transportation Department to benefit her family.
In a letter sent on Monday, the committee asked Ms. Chao to turn over documents related to communication with her family's shipping company, as well as her department's interactions with a construction company in which she owned stock until recently. As President Trump's transportation secretary, Ms. Chao oversees the nation's shipping industry.
"The Committee is examining your misstatements of fact, your actions that may have benefited the company in which you continued to hold shares, and your compliance with ethics and financial disclosure requirements," Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D., Ill.) wrote in the letter.
"Several reports indicate that you have used your official position to benefit Foremost Group, a shipping company owned by your father and sisters that is based in New York and operates a fleet that transports materials to and from China," the letter from the Oversight Committee stated, referencing in footnotes reports in the New York Times and Politico earlier this year. "These reports suggest that you used your official position to elevate Foremost Group's influence and status with the Chinese government, which has extended hundreds of millions of dollars in low-interest loans to the company for the purchase of foreign-flagged ships," the letter said.
A DOT spokesman confirmed the letter was received and said the department looks forward to responding to the committee's request.
"Media attacks targeting the secretary's family are stale and only attempt to undermine her long career of public service," the spokesman said.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Ms. Chao still owned shares in Vulcan Materials Co., the country's largest supplier of crushed stone, sand and gravel used in road-paving and building, despite promising to relinquish the shares.
Ms. Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), sold the stock in June. Vulcan shares rose more than 16% from April 2018, the month in which Ms. Chao had said she would cash out of the stock, through June 3, when she sold the shares , netting Ms. Chao a gain of more than $50,000, market data showed.
In an updated personal financial filing reviewed by The Wall Street Journal in June, Ms. Chao said she had been advised by ethics officials that the holding didn't represent a conflict of interest.
The oversight committee asked Ms. Chao to respond by Sept. 30 with all internal government communications about Foremost Group and Vulcan Materials Company; details about a canceled October 2017 trip to China and an official trip that she took to China in April 2018. The committee also requested her public financial disclosure reports and a description of how she has used a personal email account to communicate with her family or employees of Foremost Group about official DOT travel.

Boeing Board to Weigh Engineer Overhaul --- Reorganization to mark first tangible changes since crashes of 737 MAX airliners

Texto completo: Boeing Co.'s board is expected to consider revamping the aerospace giant's engineering department as among the first tangible internal changes following two deadly crashes of its 737 MAX airliner, a person familiar with the matter said.
The Chicago-based plane maker's board is expected to weigh the changes this week, the person said.
The reorganization would involve changing the organizational chart for top engineers assigned to various airplane-development programs.
Instead of reporting to airplane program managers, top engineers would report to the chief engineer of Boeing's commercial-airplane division, this person said.
The aim is to de-emphasize program-level schedules and budgets in engineers' decisions, this person said.
The board committee's report isn't expected to specifically address the two accidents.
Boeing started developing the MAX in 2011 amid intense competition with rival Airbus SE.
Company officials have said the airplane's development and certification were part of a methodical, six-year process similar to how it created previous airplanes.
Boeing set up the four-person board committee in April to examine its design process on the MAX as well as current and future aircraft programs and the broader certification process.
Key findings of the report to be considered by Boeing's board were reported Sunday by the New York Times.
Boeing's board is also considering launching a companywide safety group that will report to senior executives, as well as creating a committee of its own members to weigh such issues, the person familiar with the matter said.
Re-examining how Boeing designs cockpits is also expected to be considered by board members, this person said.
The goal is to address the crop of future pilots emerging around the world that may have less experience or training amid surging demand for passenger and cargo air travel.
Pilot training and experience have been among the focal points for plane manufacturers, aviation regulators and accident investigators following the two 737 MAX crashes.
Boeing designed a MAX flight-control system known as MCAS to rely on pilots as the backstop should it misfire during flight.
But in both MAX crashes -- a Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October and an Ethiopian Airlines crash in Ethiopia in March -- the pilots failed to recover the planes from fatal nose dives. In all, 346 people died.
Boeing's internal review is among a number of examinations of what precipitated the crashes.
Federal prosecutors, congressional committees and regulators have launched their own probes.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has said the company would incorporate findings from independent reviews into how it works.
"That's part of what makes the aviation industry so safe," he said at an investor conference last week. "We have this continuous improvement culture and anything we learn from these independent reviews, we'll roll into the process."

Texto completo: SOPORE, Kashmir -- Four men carrying pistols and wearing black masks knocked a week ago on the Hamidullah family's gate. Furious that the wealthy apple traders had violated their ban on doing business, the militants announced that there was a price to pay.
They took three men into a sitting room in this Kashmiri town and shot them in the leg, right below their knees.
When 5-year-old Asma Jaan heard her father scream, she ran into the room to see what was wrong. The militants shot her, too. Now, confused and in pain, she lies bandaged up in a hospital bed and may not be able to walk for months.
"This has never happened before, that they hit out at a 5-year-old so mercilessly," said her distraught aunt Nighat.
As the crisis in the Kashmir region drags into its sixth week, a visit by a New York Times journalist showed that the violence is morphing. The tensions, set off by India's swift and unilateral decision last month to wipe out Kashmir's autonomy, are no longer as simple as protesters pelting security officers with rocks and the officers firing shotguns back.
Kashmiri separatists are conducting their own reign of terror, threatening or even attacking civilians in a campaign to destroy any semblance of normality that may be creeping back after more than a month of heavy military crackdowns.
Beleaguered Kashmiris are now getting hit from two sides, caught between the militants and security forces who, residents say, continue to abuse and torture them.
Even as the Indian government begins to lift some of the restrictions that it imposed in Kashmir last month, the militants are enforcing their own restrictions, ordering people not to go to work or even leave their homes. Their intent is to paralyze life in Kashmir and make it ungovernable, raising tensions inside the region and with neighboring Pakistan, which also claims part of Kashmir.
There is no doubt that most Kashmiris are bitter about the recent developments. On Aug. 5, the Indian government unilaterally wiped out the degree of autonomy that Jammu and Kashmir State, which includes the restive Kashmir Valley, had held since India's independence.
Then, in anticipation of widespread outrage, India imposed punishing security measures, including cutting off cellphone and internet service to millions of Kashmiris and jailing more than 2,000 academics, politicians and activists.
While those moves infuriated a vast majority of Kashmiris, they are, at the same time, desperate to get back to the businesses, schooling and relationships that have been disrupted since the lockdown.
On the one side, they don't want to show support or even acceptance of the Indian government's actions. Many people sympathize with the militants, and fear them. They heed the mysterious fliers, posted at roundabouts or slipped quickly under the doors of Kashmiri news stations, warning people of consequences if they go back to work.
But as the clampdown stretches on, it gets harder to maintain resistance. People are running low on money and food. They have little to do, with schools, offices and markets closed and their phones dead. And so they feel trapped, torn between their sympathies and their needs.
As the days pass, more shops are opening and more people are moving about, perhaps explaining why the militants, determined to reinforce their message, resorted to deliberately shooting a child.
"We're in the middle of nowhere," said Aayat Tarik, a high school senior. "From this side, there are militants; from there, stone pelters and here, the military. They don't care what happens to us. I don't think anyone cares what happens to Kashmiris."
Aayat hopes to be a doctor. But she said she had become so unsettled since her school closed on Aug. 5, along with almost all the others, that she can't sleep.
Many of her male friends have been rounded up and beaten, she said. And men -- militants or soldiers, she doesn't know which -- keep appearing in the middle of the night at the mosque next to her house, banging on the gate. Her younger brother can't step outside because the family fears he could be taken by either side.
It has been another descent into hard times for Kashmir, a mountainous territory once fabled for its beauty that for decades has flared as a battlefield between Indian forces and insurgents backed by Pakistan. Since both India and Pakistan have nuclear arms, security experts consider the dispute over Kashmir one of the world's most dangerous.
In recent weeks, India has beefed up its forces, deploying tens of thousands of extra troops. They suppress the small protests that frequently erupt and hunt down the tiny, quixotic militant force -- perhaps 200 to 300 young men from a handful of groups, mostly Kashmiri, a few from Pakistan, local officials say.
The insurgents say they are fighting to split Kashmir off from India and create a separate state, but militarily they are insignificant. The security forces steadily hunt them down and apply enormous pressure on anyone close to them.
One morning last month, according to several witnesses, soldiers summoned Bashir Ahmed Dar, a plumber whose brother had become a militant. At an army camp near the village of Heff Shirmal, the soldiers demanded that Mr. Dar disclose where his brother was hiding.
After Mr. Dar told them he didn't know, he said, the soldiers smashed his body with sticks, kicked him in the ribs and broadcast his sobbing pleas for mercy from loudspeakers on the road, terrorizing his village.
Then, Mr. Dar said, the soldiers ransacked his house and dumped his supply of rice, flour and kerosene into a water tank, contaminating it.
Several news organizations, including the BBC, have recently reported Kashmiri residents' accusations of torture and sadistic behavior by Indian military personnel. Indian officials have called them baseless, and a spokeswoman for India's home ministry declined to comment for this article.
Ajit Doval, India's national security chief, blames Pakistan for Kashmir's problems. If the internet is restored in Kashmir, he says, Pakistan will flood it with misleading information and stir up hatred. If the Indian soldiers relax, Pakistan will exploit the situation and send in more militants.
"They will be very happy if there is bloodshed," Mr. Doval said.
Pakistani officials have denied India's accusations of supporting militants. The country's prime minister, Imran Khan, has harshly criticized India's crackdown and has called for international intervention to keep the countries from stumbling into another war.
Indian officials say the chances of war are close to zero and insist that Kashmir is getting back to normal. Land-line telephone service has been restored in some areas, and many of the military barricades that blocked the roads just a few weeks ago have been removed.
Asif Majeeb Dar, a young man who works behind a cafe counter at the airport in Srinagar, Kashmir's biggest city, said that before India's move on Kashmir, few people supported the militants.
"But that's changing," he said. "The government has forced our hand."
Many Kashmiris feel that Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India betrayed them. They don't like even hearing his name.
"My mom says, 'Stay away from the TV, don't pay any attention to Modi, just get back to your studies,"' said Sofi Maryam Javeed, a fifth-grade student.
The competing pressures that people face put them in untenable positions every day.
One of them, a wholesaler named Ghulam Mohammed Mir, had been warned by militants to close the shop where he sold rice, flour, sugar and other provisions. The separatists fatally shot him on Aug. 29, according to witnesses and security officials.
Other shopkeepers expressed little sympathy. Several said he deserved it because he had been warned.
But a prominent merchant is one thing; a 5-year-old girl another. A new sense of outrage has been stirred up by the militants' shooting of Asma Jaan after wounding three men at her family's home.
As a wealthy apple trader, Hamidullah, the girl's grandfather, had hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and said he needed to move his apples to stay afloat. Apples are a huge business in Kashmir, the source of countless livelihoods, and several Kashmiris said shooting a child crossed a line.
"Those militants committed a heinous crime," said Irshad Ahmed, a waiter at a Srinagar hotel. "Who do you think will side with them now?"

Texto completo: Political sparring over Justice Brett Kavanaugh's October 2018 confirmation to the Supreme Court flared up Sunday following a fresh news report, with some Democratic presidential candidates calling for his removal from the bench and President Trump defending his court pick.
The New York Times on Sunday published an article about Deborah Ramirez, who had accused Justice Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her during a party at Yale University in the early 1980s. The piece, based on a book planned for publication this week, asserts that others including fellow classmates recalled hearing contemporary accounts of the incident and alleges there might have been another similar episode.
The Times later issued an editor's note and updated the story to say that the female student in the second episode declined to be interviewed and said that her friends said she doesn't recall the episode.
The Wall Street Journal hasn't independently confirmed the reporting. Justice Kavanaugh has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.
Justice Kavanaugh declined to comment.
The report reopened a fierce and emotional debate in Washington and on the 2020 campaign trail. During the confirmation process last year, the Ramirez allegation surfaced just ahead of a closely watched Senate hearing featuring a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when they were in high school. That accusation led to a one-week delay in Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation vote while the FBI investigated ; he ultimately was confirmed by the Senate, 50-48.
In tweets Sunday, Mr. Trump called the latest report about Justice Kavanaugh "made up" and said the "lies being told about him are unbelievable." He added: "False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!"
Meanwhile, a number of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates pointed to the new report to argue Justice Kavanaugh should be removed from office.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), a member of the Senate Judiciary panel that questioned Justice Kavanaugh during the hearings, tweeted that he "lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people." She asserted that Justice Kavanaugh "was put on the Court through a sham process," declaring that "he must be impeached."
In her own tweet, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who also backs impeachment of Mr. Trump, said the Kavanaugh nomination "was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him" and called the new report disturbing. "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached," she said.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in a tweet about Justice Kavanaugh that he supports "any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable."
In a statement late Sunday, front-runner Joe Biden said the report raised "profoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process," but the former vice president stopped short of calling for impeachment.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the Democrats had tried to deny Justice Kavanaugh due process and the presumption of innocence. "The far left's willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year's confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate," he tweeted. He added: "I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh."
Removing a justice from the Supreme Court would require impeachment by the Democratic-run House, followed by a conviction, by a supermajority vote, in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell have made judicial nominations a top issue in this administration, seeing the courts as central to conservative priorities such as gun rights and issues such as religious freedom and abortion.

Boeing's Board to Weigh Engineering, Safety Changes Following 737 MAX Crashes; Reorganization marks one of first tangible changes since accidents

Texto completo: Boeing Co.'s board is expected to consider revamping the aerospace giant's engineering department as among the first tangible internal changes following two deadly crashes of its 737 MAX airliner, a person familiar with the matter said.
The Chicago-based plane maker's board is expected to weigh the changes this week, the person said.
The reorganization would involve changing the organizational chart for top engineers assigned to various airplane-development programs.
Instead of reporting to airplane program managers, top engineers would report to the chief engineer of Boeing's commercial-airplane division, this person said.
The aim is to de-emphasize program-level schedules and budgets in engineers' decisions, this person said.

The board committee's report isn't expected to specifically address the two accidents.
Boeing started developing the MAX in 2011 amid intense competition with rival Airbus SE.
Company officials have said the airplane's development and certification were part of a methodical, six-year process similar to how it created previous airplanes.
Boeing set up the four-person board committee in April to examine its design process on the MAX as well as current and future aircraft programs and the broader certification process.
Key findings of the report to be considered by Boeing's board were reported Sunday by the New York Times.
Boeing's board is also considering launching a companywide safety group that will report to senior executives, as well as creating a committee of its own members to weigh such issues, the person familiar with the matter said.
Re-examining how Boeing designs cockpits is also expected to be considered by board members, this person said.
The goal is to address the crop of future pilots emerging around the world that may have less experience or training amid surging demand for passenger and cargo air travel.
Pilot training and experience have been among the focal points for plane manufacturers, aviation regulators and accident investigators following the two 737 MAX crashes.
Boeing designed a MAX flight-control system known as MCAS to rely on pilots as the backstop should it misfire during flight.
But in both MAX crashes—a Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October and an Ethiopian Airlines crash in Ethiopia in March—the pilots failed to recover the planes from fatal nose dives. In all, 346 people died.
Boeing's internal review is among a number of examinations of what precipitated the crashes.
Federal prosecutors, congressional committees and regulators have launched their own probes.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has said the company would incorporate findings from independent reviews into how it works.
"That's part of what makes the aviation industry so safe," he said at an investor conference last week. "We have this continuous improvement culture and anything we learn from these independent reviews, we'll roll into the process."

Boko Haram is back, and with better drones

Texto completo: KONDUGA, Nigeria - Ten-year-old Abdul stood on a dirt road in a village tucked between millet fields and pulled up his shirt. A fresh scar stretched lengthwise down his stomach - the result of a suicide bombing by Boko Haram in June that sent shrapnel tearing through his belly.
A half-dozen other boys crowded around him and pulled up their shirts. All bore similar scars from the attack.
Nigeria's war against the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram was supposed to be over by now. President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler, was reelected earlier this year after boasting about his progress battling Boko Harm. He has repeatedly declared that the group has been "technically defeated." On Tuesday, the president conceded that "its members are still a nuisance."
A full decade into the war, however, Boko Haram militants are still roaming the countryside with impunity. Their fighters now have more sophisticated drones than the military and are well-armed after successful raids on military brigades, according to local politicians and security analysts.
Militants control four of the 10 zones in northern Borno State, near Lake Chad, according to security analysts and a federal official. They are pulling off almost-daily attacks, including opening fire last week on the convoy of the governor of Borno state.
To people in villages like Konduga, Boko Haram's defeat seems distant. The attack on June 17 that wounded Abdul and his friends (his last name is being withheld to protect him from reprisals) also killed 30 people - eight of them children.
By many accounts, the Nigerian military is demoralized and on the defensive. Some soldiers have complained they haven't had a home leave in three years. Their weapons and vehicles have fallen into disrepair. In August, the new commander of Operation Lafiya Dole, which means "Peace by Force," publicly reminded his field officers to give food and water to troops. He is the eighth commander in 10 years.
The military announced in August that it is pulling back its troops from farflung outposts in the countryside and gathering them into fortified settlements it calls "super camps."
The super camps are inside garrison towns where the Nigerian military in recent years settled tens of thousands of civilians - either after Boko Haram chased them away, or soldiers burned their villages and rounded them up, saying it would secure the countryside. The garrison towns are ringed by trenches to slow militant invasions, but the pullback has allowed Boko Haram fighters free rein in the barren countryside.
Inside the super camp in Bama on a recent afternoon, a camouflaged tank lurched down the street, blue smoke pouring from its underside. It was piloted by helmetless soldiers with open shirts and a gunner wearing a crown of leaves, who plowed into a parked minivan partially blocking the road, smashing the vehicle.
Maj. Ak Karma, sitting behind his desk nearby at the Bama super camp headquarters, said that a Boko Haram attack there had been thwarted days earlier, but downplayed the threat.
"We have one or two problem attacks by Boko Haram, but that doesn't mean they have a grand offensive," Kama said. "Bama is a fortress."
The camp was attacked again the following day.
The war with Boko Haram has devastated the population in rural northeast Nigeria, one of the poorest regions on Earth. More than 2 million people have fled their homes, tens of thousands have been killed and many more injured, abducted and conscripted to join the fight. The International Committee of the Red Cross said last week that nearly 22,000 Nigerians have been reported missing during the crisis.

WHEN ART AND ATHLETICS JOIN TOGETHER; ARTISTS ANSWER CALL FOR FORWARD POSTERS

Texto completo: After she was selected to design a poster for Madison's professional soccer team, Toni Pawlowsky said the idea popped into her head fast: a "Jurassic Park," Godzilla-type image of Forward's flamingo mascot.
In her poster, the pink flamingo looks more nurturing than menacing. The bird has an opposing player in its beak and is lifting him off the ground by his jersey. On the field underneath, baby flamingos hatch from soccer balls.
"It was really fun to do," said Pawlowsky, one of 17 local artists selected by Forward Madison FC to create posters given to fans before every Forward home game at Breese Stevens Field.
The poster project idea came from Mark Fraire, Dane Arts director of arts and cultural affairs, who put the word out to artists.
"I am always trying to show how art is in every arena and is an economic driver," said Fraire, who coined the term "spARTs" to refer to the mashup of sports and arts.
All the artists are paid $300, given tickets to the game they've commemorated with their art, and a few of their own posters.
The team has printed 250 posters for each home game since the team debuted in April. They're available at the fan services tent and given away to fans, first-come, first-served.
"The artists are just doing an incredible job," said Kuba Krzyzostaniak, the team's director of fan engagement and digital media. "It's been really fun to see, and the community is just loving them. They fly out of fan services really quick when we put them out."
Krzyzostaniak said posters are usually gone by the 7:06p.m. kickoff.
Fraire approached Forward in January after reading a story in The New York Times about a similar poster project done by the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team.
He wondered how he could replicate the idea in Madison, and after getting turned down by the Madison Mallards baseball team, he contacted the fledgling Forward team. Krzyzostaniak quickly got on board.
"The posters are so popular and they have become a 'must have' for many in attendance," Fraire said. "Players autograph them after games, too."
Both Krzyzostaniak and Fraire say they'd like to frame all the posters and put together an exhibit.
Forward has four games left in its inaugural season, with home games on Tuesday and on Sept. 22. The team is in playoff position, but it's too early to tell if they'll make it in. Average attendance is 4,238.
The team competes in the third division of the US soccer league system, USL League One.
For the poster project, Fraire contacted many of the artists associated with last year's "Bucky on Parade" public art display created by the Madison Area Sports Commission and the Greater Madison Convention and Visitors Bureau.
"It's all original art, all local, all so cool and whimsical showing Forward dominating the opponent or at least the flamingo kickin' some butt," Fraire said.
Pawlowsky's poster was for a July 27 game against the Orlando City Lions. She'd never been to a professional soccer match and she and the friend she took enjoyed it more than they expected. "It's just such a great atmosphere, very positive with lots of things going on."
She liked the excitement of people arriving early to add to their collection of posters. "I just think that's a really cool idea."
Pawlowsky also appreciated the feedback from Forward's Facebook page after her work was posted. "That was really fun to watch and made me feel good because I knew mine was going to be a little out there, so I wasn't sure how it was going to be received."
Graphic designer and illustrator Ben Tolle had the July 13 match against the Chattanooga (Tennessee) Red Wolves, where he said his image, made in Adobe illustrator, of a large-headed flamingo towering over two docile red wolves went over well.
Tolle said he had fun looking around to see how many of his posters he could spot in the crowd.
As soon as he heard about the project, he knew he had to participate. "I thought what a great marriage of Madison community."
Although he's not a big soccer fan, he enjoyed the challenge of depicting the two teams going head-to-head and Forward coming out victorious. "It's a really fun, creative place to start from."
?Kind of abstract'
Dan Gardiner appreciated that the project offered the flexibility to work in any medium, and through collage, he depicted a player with an arm full of tattoos.
It's hard to tell, but Gardiner's poster is made with torn-up paper and magazines used "almost like paint."
The process was "kind of slow, but ended up looking kind of abstract, which I like," he said.
Gardiner said he looked online for images of players, Forward uniforms and the grandstand "and kind of pieced it all together."
In the 1990s, Gardiner said, he lived in Green Bay and did work for the Packers and for companies that put out baseball and football cards. All he did then was sports art and the Forward project gave him the chance to get back into it.
"Those were some of my best years of being an artist," he said. "I was really busy."
Gardiner said he didn't have time to go to the game, but his wife and mother-in-law did and had a blast. "They're big sports fans," he said.
His wife and her mother enjoyed seeing his poster everywhere. "They were excited about that for some reason. I don't know why," Gardiner said.
They got to the game early enough to bring a poster home and Gardiner said he has it hanging in his living room.
?Must have'
Forward's Krzyzostaniak said the posters have become "must have" collector's items for the team's most dedicated fans.
He said he constantly hears from fans around the country asking if there's a way they can get the posters. Krzyzostaniak said he usually sets aside 20 posters for reasons such as that.
"We've had a few fans that have shared with us on social media, pictures of their living rooms or dining rooms in their house," Krzyzostaniak said. "They'll have every single poster from every game so far." CREDIT: SAMARA KALK DERBY skalk@madison.com

Texto completo: Faith Sullivan says it’s like “playing God” to create a fictional place like Harvester, Minn., the setting for her new novel “Ruby & Roland” and five previous novels.
“I have the map of the town in my head,” Sullivan said in a conversation from her Minneapolis home. “I know the place so well. You begin populating it, making connections between characters, and the idea for the next book just comes. It’s magical fun.”
“Ruby & Roland,” for instance, grew out of a brief story a character recalls in Sullivan’s previous novel, “Good Night, Mr. Wodehouse,” about a hired girl and a farm wife who tries to kill herself.
“I was interested in that story and I’d been working on it ever since,” says Sullivan, who will be 86 on Oct. 1 and is perfectly happy about her age.
When she gives readings from “Ruby & Roland,” Sullivan quotes Grace Paley’s poem “Here,” which begins: “Here I am in the garden laughing/an old woman with heavy breasts/and a nicely mapped face/how did this happen/well that’s who I wanted to be…”
LONGING FOR LOVE
“Ruby & Roland,” set at the turn of the 20th century, is a story of love and sacrifice, the unlikely friendship between two women, and sense of community in a small town.
The story is narrated by Ruby Drake, who is 12 years old when her parents are killed in an accident. Penniless and alone in the world, Ruby’s path takes her to Harvester, where she finds work as a hired girl on the Schoonover farm. Soon, farm owners Emma and Henry become her family.
Ruby, who is smart and outspoken, falls in love with her married neighbor, Roland, “the most beautiful man” she’d ever seen. They make love, but Roland cannot leave his spoiled wife, Dora, who is nearly comatose after the death of her first baby.
When Dora tries to kill herself, Ruby becomes her not-so-tender caregiver, insisting the city girl get out of bed and learn cooking, gardening and other work.
Ruby has to choose between loving Roland openly or keeping their affair secret while she tends his wife. When tragedy strikes, her choices are even more complicated.
Running through the story is Sullivan’s evocation of farm life, especially the hard work farm wives such as Emma had to do.
“I love Emma,” says Sullivan, who grew up in Pipestone, Minn. “She’s a combination of all the wonderful town and farm women I knew growing up who worked their buns off and seemed to enjoy it. My own grandmother loved to work.
“One of the things the book is trying to say is that work, whatever it is, is a nobility, especially if you’re doing your best. I tried to show this in the character of Dora. Although she would deny it, she feels worthless until she learns what work means.”
Dora is spoiled and stubborn, but the reader feels sympathy for this woman who’s suffering from what we now call postpartum depression.
“Dora feels a sense of helplessness when there is nobody to help her, and her husband is too busy trying to save the farm,” Sullivan says. “At that time some lonely women with emotional problems turned to drink, or their husbands committed them to an institution.”
As for Ruby, Sullivan describes her as a no-nonsense girl who was “not the ideal norm of womanhood” in those days. She smokes, for instance, something Sullivan says “was very much frowned on for women when I was a girl,” and she loves to read. It wasn’t unusual for such a smart girl to end up on a farm, because there wasn’t much else to do.
“Even if Ruby’s parents had lived, she wouldn’t have had many choices — nurse, secretary, teacher — same old, same old,” Sullivan says. “She had to find her own role and the Schoonovers rescued her by giving her knowledge of everyday farm work.”
And then there is Roland, a decent man who tells Ruby “I live on hope,” meaning he wants to be with her but will not divorce Dora. As Ruby says, “Divorce is a greater scandal than killing yourself.”
EVOKING A FARM
Sullivan admits happily that this book is filled with “sweet recollections of farm life.”

She and her mother, Helen, lived with her maternal grandmother while her father worked on the Alcan highway in Alaska. But her family was connected to farming.
“My grandparents lost their farm after World War I and grandmother never got over it. She yearned toward farming,” Sullivan recalls, adding that she had many friends who were farm kids.
“My sense then was I never wanted to do farming but as I’ve grown older, my feelings changed,” she recalls. “I see the value, the almost mystical magic of the earth, the way you drop a seed in and it grows right up through our boots.”
Maybe that’s why Faith is such an enthusiastic gardener: “I didn’t have much time this summer because of the book, but I finally got out there, damn near killed myself, but whipped it into shape.”
Sullivan lived across the street from her great-grandmother when she was growing up, and she and her second cousins lived among women — great-grandmother, grandmother, aunts, visitors. The little girls would listen to the women gossiping at bridge clubs and sewing circles, conversations that inspired dialogue in Sullivan’s Harvester novels.
A SURPRISE NOVELIST
Sullivan majored in history and education at what was then Mankato State Teachers College. She was teaching at North High in Minneapolis when she started writing scripts and acting for the Brave New Workshop, a fledgling comedy troupe founded by college friend Dudley Riggs.
Faith was 28 when she met her future husband, Dan, who was playing the piano at a rehearsal. Dan Sullivan wrote for the Minneapolis Tribune, and eventually became drama critic for the New York Times and, later, the Los Angeles Times. They stayed in California for 20 years, raising their kids Maggie, Ben and Kate there. When Dan took leave to write a book, they returned to Minnesota and were so happy to be back Dan took early retirement and they stayed.
It was Dan who sort-of forced his wife to become a novelist, something she’d never thought of doing.
While Dan was recovering from surgery, they watched a lot of old movies and TV shows. Faith had an idea for a mystery play that needed to be a book and she suggested her husband write it. He told her to do it herself.
Taking his challenge, Faith wrote “Watchdog” and then “Repent, Lanny Merkel,” inspired by her Pipestone High School reunions.
In 1988, the first of Sullivan’s Harvester books, “The Cape Ann,” was published, and the story of 6-year-old Lark, who lives in Harvester’s railroad depot during the Great Depression, immediately earned her loyal readers.
Part of Lark’s story is that her father is abusive, showing Sullivan’s willingness to write about the dark side of life for women in small communities. She parted company with one publisher after refusing to take a rape scene out of one of her books.
Sullivan was one of the first authors to visit book clubs to talk about her work and she didn’t mind driving miles to do it. She also has a devoted following of former students she taught privately and at the Minneapolis-based Loft Literary Center where she has served on the board.
WHAT COMES NEXT?
Sullivan is hard at work now on her 10th novel, also set in Harvester.
“I’ve reached a point where I have a plot problem that I hope to solve during a retreat at Write On, Door County,” she says. “I need to figure out how to get the protagonist to Harvester. But I’ll work it out.” (Write On, Door County, is a writers retreat in Fish Creek, Wis. Executive director is Jerod Santek, former program director at the Loft in Minneapolis.)
What’s in Sullivan’s future now that “Ruby & Roland” is published?
“At my age, I’m living on borrowed time in writing,” she says with a laugh. “It’s really important to me to finish book number 10. And then I’m home free.”

Rich Lowry: Bernie Sanders and the anti-people crusade

Texto completo: At least Bernie Sanders is an equal opportunity misanthrope. He doesn’t like rich people, and it turns out he doesn’t necessarily like poor people, either.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
At the CNN town hall on climate change, a questioner asked the socialist senator if he’d be “courageous” enough to endorse population control to save the planet. Sanders answered “yes,” and then, after referring to abortion rights, endorsed curtailing population growth, “especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies.”
He’s looking at you, sub-Saharan Africa.
The Sanders riff is the latest instance of a rising anti-natalism on the left, which has gone from arguing that carbon emissions are a problem to arguing that human beings are a problem. They release carbon emissions, don’t they? Q.E.D.
When a proposition has the support of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who questions the morality of having children, and Bill Nye the Science Guy, who has discussed punishing people for having children, it’s on the way to universal assent among a certain segment of soi-disant thoughtful progressives.
A headline in The New York Times even asked, “Would Human Extinction Be a Tragedy?” Thus proving that, whatever our other virtues, we are at times the most ridiculous and self-loathing species.
Undergirding the anti-natalist position is the belief that we are facing a global catastrophe, such that additional babies will tip the planet into uninhabitability for everyone. This goes beyond the best evidence, and discounts the human capacity for adaptation that is one of our chief attributes.
The view that human beings are an unsustainable drain on limited resources goes back to the 18th-century thinker Thomas Malthus and, more recently, the Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich. In his 1968 book “The Population Bomb,” Ehrlich thunderously pronounced, “The battle to feed all of humanity is over.”
In the event, we figured out how to make agriculture more efficient and have been feeding people just fine (when not prevented from doing so by wars and other man-made calamities). Nonetheless, Ehrlich hasn’t stopped predicting the explosion of his population bomb ever since, telling The Guardian recently that the collapse of civilization is “a near certainty.”
In his original work, Ehrlich put an emphasis on overly fertile Third World countries, just as Bernie Sanders did the other night. But if consumption and carbon emissions are the concern, it’s rich people in developed countries who are the bigger problem and should be dealt with accordingly (a task for which Sanders is dismayingly well-suited).
What are we to make of an agenda that seeks to diminish the number of human beings overall and to make those who enjoy material prosperity less wealthy?
Benjamin Zycher of the American Enterprise Institute notes how rising incomes — considered an unalloyed good by anyone who experiences them — invariably increase energy consumption. Insofar as a sweeping anti-development, anti-consumption program like the Green New Deal is “diametrically opposed to the aspirations of nearly all individuals,” he writes, it is “antihuman.”
At a more fundamental level, the anti-natalists have a gross materialistic view of humanity. For them, we are a series of inputs and outputs, and if one particular output is considered undesirable (in this case, carbon emissions), it reduces the value of human beings altogether. No one who isn’t a cracked ideological extremist or perversely blinkered economist actually looks at people this way. It doesn’t account for relationships or for joy, for the wondrous distinctiveness of every person, no matter how poor or humble.
People aren’t a burden; they are a resource and a gift. Any movement that regards them any other way is profoundly misguided and deeply anti-humane. Build windmills if you must, but don’t try to scare people out of having children — or much worse, facilitate abortions — in your zeal to shave some fraction of a degree off the global temperature 80 years from now.

AN APPRECIATION ANNE RIVERS SIDDONS: How author Anne Rivers Siddons saved me: Late Atlanta author shaped and influenced writer's imagination.

Texto completo: When Atlanta writer Anne Rivers Siddons died Wednesday at age 83, she left a legacy of 19 novels, and of countless writers whom she has inspired. Patti Callahan Henry is one of those writers.
There are books you discover at the moment in your life when you need them the most, for nourishment or encouragement, or when it's time to weep or heal. For me, Anne Rivers Siddons' books are those exactly. Her novels shaped and influenced my imagination, cracked me open to understand the power of story.
It wasn't just her stories that softened the edges of my guarded heart. Yes, the novels are beautiful but it was also the way she used words as if they were hers alone and no one else was given permission to manipulate them the way she could, a kind of magic she was granted at birth.
I was a freshman in college, an obsessive, addicted reader, and the world disappeared as soon as I opened a book.That year that I picked up "Fox's Earth" and read it in one sitting.What was this? This kind of story where words came alive like a river or took flight like a mythical creature?Anne Rivers Siddons: I wanted to know everything there was to know about her.
At that time in my life, before Google and social media, authors were unapproachable, ethereal and not quite real. But Anne? She seemed like she might be real. She went to Auburn University, just as I did. She was in a sorority and she wrote and I was also doing both those things. She lived in Atlanta, only a few hours away. Maybe writing was a real thing that women did for a living, or did because they were good at it, No! Because they were great at it.
I started following her like a groupie. She never knew this, but I did. First I went back and read the other books she'd written before "Fox's Earth." Then after I'd graduated from college and was working as a nurse in Atlanta, "Peachtree Road" came out. Then "King's Oak" -- a book that irrevocably altered something inside me that I still can't identify.
I started having these conversations with Anne (oh, they were all in my head). But I imagined telling her my story ideas, telling her good ideas, which she'd want to write and put in a novel. I didn't yet know that I could write my own stories, I only understood that her novels had the essence, character and taste of what I'd want to write if I did write. Instead of dreaming big for myself, I imagined offering her my dreams, offering to her the stories I felt worth telling.
When "Outer Banks" was released in 1991, I saw a sign at the old Oxford Bookstore in Atlanta: Anne would be there for a book signing. I'd never been to a book signing, and I geared myself up for it. I went by myself, not knowing what to expect.The line was at least an hour long, and I was as nervous as if I were going to meet a blind date. I wanted to say the just right thing. I wanted to tell her how much she meant to me. I wanted to let her know that she enriched my life. Then it was my turn: I stepped up to the table and held out my book for her to sign. She sat at a table with her husband next to her. She was so tiny, a little thing with white fluffy Q-tip hair, and a big red lipstick smile.
"Your name?" she asked so quietly I had to lean down to hear her, as if she needed a sweet, quiet voice to weigh out the vibrant, earth-quaking voice she used in her writing. Her pen was poised above the title page and ready to write my name.
"Patti," I said. And then all the compliments and sentiments I wanted to say stuck in my throat like a rock. I mumbled something about "King's Oak," and her husband thanked me for being a fan, and then she was onto the next person.
WAIT! I didn't get to say anything to her. I had so much to say. So much. How her books carried me through lonely nights when I felt left out by friends or didn't believe I'd fall in love with the right man, if ever. I wanted to tell her that her stories made me believe that other people in the world felt as deeply as I did, that life was richer than it appeared, that the unseen supported the seen. I was aching to tell her that her words were used as more than just letters in a row, they'd changed me inside, altered who I had become and was becoming.
I didn't say any of that to her that day at Oxford Books. Thebookstoreisn'teventhere anymore. The years passed, as years do, and I never was able to sit with her to tell her how I feel. Now she is gone and the Southern literary world is less for her absence. We mourn her and we will forever miss her. Now, I tell Anne Rivers Siddons how much she means to me with every book I write. I will continue to reveal how she influenced my life and my words and my destiny. I hope I say the just right things.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Lawyers for the former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe, a frequent target of President Trump's, have asked federal prosecutors whether a secret grand jury refused to indict him, which would be a sign that the government is struggling to make a case against him.
In a letter sent late Thursday, defense lawyers asked whether a grand jury had considered charges against Mr. McCabe, who is being investigated over whether he lied to internal investigators about interactions with the news media. The letter came shortly after the Justice Department told Mr. McCabe's lawyers that it had rejected their pitch to the deputy attorney general to drop the case.
"It is clear that no indictment has been returned," the lawyers wrote, citing coverage of the case by The New York Times and The Washington Post. A grand jury hearing evidence that was recalled on Thursday after months of inactivity left for the day without any sign of an indictment, The Post reported. None had emerged on Friday.
[Read the lawyers' letter.]
The letter was the latest attempt by Mr. McCabe to stave off charges in the highly unusual and politically charged case. His lawyers have denied that he intentionally lied during an internal inquiry and have said that he is being singled out, noting that similar cases were typically handled administratively, not through criminal prosecution.
Spokeswomen for the Justice Department and the United States attorney for the District of Columbia declined to comment.
A grand jury decision to reject charges is nearly unheard-of.
"Grand juries indict 99.9 percent of people," said Julie O'Sullivan, a Georgetown University professor of criminal law and a former federal prosecutor. The process is dominated by prosecutors who present evidence, make statements and tell the jury what the law means without a defense lawyer or judge present.
Prosecutors can keep pursuing a grand jury indictment until they prevail, Ms. O'Sullivan said. No "double jeopardy" rule exists preventing them from trying again, the way they cannot recharge defendants for the same offense after a trial jury has acquitted them.
Mr. McCabe's lawyers argued that prosecutors should set aside the investigation if the grand jury voted against an indictment. The standard for an indictment -- a finding of probable cause that a crime was committed -- is much lower than for a guilty verdict at a trial, and evidence that falls short of the lower bar would fail to produce a guilty verdict, they said.
"It is simply not reasonable to believe that a trial jury would find Mr. McCabe guilty of any charges employing a far more rigorous and exacting standard -- beyond a reasonable doubt," they wrote.
The case against Mr. McCabe centers on an earlier investigation by the Justice Department inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, into several issues, including dealings with the news media. He found that Mr. McCabe lacked candor when asked about information provided to a Wall Street Journal reporter in 2016 about an F.B.I. inquiry into the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Horowitz referred his findings to federal prosecutors in Washington.
With a limited set of facts and witnesses, the case promised to be straightforward, but the investigation has taken about 18 months. One prosecutor recently left the case, which would be unusual if an indictment were in the works, people familiar with the case have said. Another left for a private law firm after expressing doubts about the merits of the case, the people said.
One key witness told the grand jury that Mr. McCabe had no motivation to lie. And another could not recall the details of how the leak to the news media unfolded, according to other people familiar with the case. Both of their accounts were critical elements for a prosecution.
Bringing criminal charges against a former senior F.B.I. official would be rare. Mr. McCabe was fired last year over the inspector general's findings days before he was eligible for retirement benefits -- an outcome that the president cheered.
By the time he was fired, Mr. McCabe, who was among the first in the F.B.I. to question whether the Trump campaign had suspicious ties to Russia, had become a favorite target of Mr. Trump's. Mr. McCabe has said the president attacked him to undermine his standing as a witness the special counsel's investigation.
In August, Mr. McCabe sued the Justice Department and the F.B.I., saying that his firing was retaliatory and motivated by politics. "Were it not for Trump's plan and scheme and the complicity" of other administration officials, Mr. McCabe would have retired as planned, according to the lawsuit.
If prosecutors decide to move forward with an indictment, the United States attorney's office for the District of Columbia will find itself again in the spotlight. The office lost a high-profile case this month against Gregory B. Craig, one of Washington's most prominent Democratic lawyers. He was acquitted of a felony charge of lying to federal authorities about work he did years ago for the Ukrainian government.
The office's chief of the fraud and public corruption unit, J. P. Cooney, an experienced trial lawyer, has been deeply involved in the McCabe case. He was also a member of the Justice Department's team that prosecuted Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, who was charged in a federal corruption case but acquitted last year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Baffert: I didn’t drug Justify in 2018

Texto completo: Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert on Thursday denied giving 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify a banned substance that caused a positive drug test in California before last years Kentucky Derby, and he blamed the result on contaminated food, which the California Horse Racing Board did determine was the cause, its then-chairman said.

Baffert said in a statement that he unequivocally rejects the implication hed give Justify or any other horse scopolamine, for which the colt tested positive in April 2018. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Justify tested positive after winning the Santa Anita Derby and that the California Horse Racing Board did not adequately investigate the matter.

Justify was allowed to run in the Kentucky Derby a month later and went on to become the 13th Triple Crown winner.

Damn shame this great horse, connections and me have to be put through all this, Baffert said in a text message to the Associated Press. It was obvious environmental contamination. Its been a known problem in California.

Scopolamine is commonly found in jimson weed, a wild-growing plant, and veterinarians say it has little to no effect on performance. Justify was not the only horse that tested positive for it at Santa Anita, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday. A total of seven horses in five barns tested positive at the same time.

The cases against Justify and the other horses were dropped after the California board determined that the positive tests were caused by simple feed contamination, Chuck Winner, board chairman at the time, told the Los Angeles Times.

Winner cited overwhelming evidence that all seven horses ingested scopolamine from jimson weed that was in the hay that had been delivered to the barns.

It would have been a complete miscarriage of justice for the (board) to have taken action against Justify or Baffert, knowing full well that the horse was poisoned by an environmental contaminate and not injected with a substance, Winner said.

The California board came under fire for treating this situation differently from precedent, dismissing Justifys case four months later in a closed-door session. But even if the process had moved quickly and the seven horses had been found in violation, Justify would still not have been disqualified as the Santa Anita Derby winner or denied a Kentucky Derby spot because of how scopolamine is classified by the Association of Racing Commissioners International, which sets industry drug standards. Scopolamine violations dont result in disqualifications.

Baffert said Justify passed drug tests in Kentucky, Maryland and New York on the way to the Triple Crown, and called on those states testing agencies to immediately release information related to Justifys test results there. Churchill Downs Racetrack released a statement saying Justify had come up clean in pre- and post-race tests for the 2018 Kentucky Derby, and the Maryland Jockey Club said the same for the Preakness.

Justify did not run another race after winning the Triple Crown and was retired.

Baffert trained the only two Triple Crown winners in the past three decades: Justify in 2018 and American Pharoah in 2015.I am proud to stand by (Justifys) record and my own, he said.

Horse deaths: Three horses died during the first two days of Belmont Parks fall season in Elmont, N.Y.. Two horses died Sept. 6, opening day, according to the New York State Gaming Commissions equine database; one collapsed during training and one was euthanized after being removed from a race. A horse was put down Saturday by a veterinarian after it flipped while jogging and fractured a leg on the training track. This year 25 horses have died at Belmont.

Skyway 10K registration changes

It wont be a race to sign up for next years Skyway 10K.

Spots for this years the run over the Sunshine Skyway bridge sold out in 20 minutes as more than 30,000 people tried to secure 8,000 available slots during registration last year. So organizers are trying a different registration approach for next years race: a lottery to select runners at random.

We are trying to make it easier and give everyone a chance to participate, race director Jonathan Dziuba said.

Entering the lottery is free. Signup begins at 9 a.m. Oct. 3 online at skyway10k.com and runs through Oct. 20. Winners of the 8,000 spots for the March 1 race will be notified Oct. 21 and have one week to claim their place, enter all necessary personal information, pay the $80 registration fee and select their travel bus. Unclaimed spots will go to the next randomly selected lottery winners.

Also new this year, organizers are allowing groups of up to four people to register together. Groups will be treated the same as individuals and will have an equal opportunity to be selected as lottery winners. If the group is selected, all members will be able to register to participate in the race together.

The Skyway 10K donates 100 percent of race registration fees to the Armed Forces Families Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides and cares for military families.

Players on notice after U.S. men head toward worst major-tourney showing

USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo said that when the time comes to start assembling the 2020 Olympics roster, he wont forget those who backed out of commitments to play in the World Cup this summer.

Of the 35 players originally selected for the U.S. pool, only four are in China for the World Cup. The United States lost to France in the quarterfinals, ending a streak of seven major international tournaments  four Olympics and three World Cups  where the Americans captured a medal, the past five of them gold.

I can only say, you cant help but notice and remember who you thought you were going to war with and who didnt show up, Colangelo said.

The United States lost again to Serbia 94-89 on Thursday in Dongguan, China, and will finish no better than seventh, the worst finish ever by an American men in a major tournament. The previous worst was sixth at the 2002 world championships.

Many players cited schedule concerns as a reason to not play this summer. Others are dealing with injuries, and some are acclimating in advance of joining new teams when training camps start in less than three weeks.

More than 50 players were part of the U.S. World Cup plan at one point or another. Of those, 12 went to China, two got cut after the first week of training camp and the other three dozen or so dropped out on their own.

Colangelo also expressed disappointment for U.S. coach Gregg Popovich, who will also lead the Olympic team next summer.

Golf: Robby Shelton shot 8-under 62 to lead by two after the first round of the PGA Tours season-opening Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. Defending champion Kevin Na was in a group of five at 64. Bryson DeChambeau, at No. 10 the fields highest-ranked player, shot 68.

Tennis: Seven years after retiring a second time, Kim Clijsters will attempt another comeback at age 36. The former No. 1 and four-time major champion said she plans to return to the tour next year, though she wasnt ready to say exactly when or where. I dont really feel like I want to prove something, Clijsters said on the WTA Insider Podcast. I think for me its the challenge. Clijsters turned pro in 1997, won the U.S. Open in 2005 and retired in 07 at 23, shortly before marrying American basketball player Brian Lynch. After giving birth to a daughter in 08, she returned and won the 09 U.S. Open, the 10 U.S. Open and the 11 Australian Open. She retired again in 12, gave birth to boys in 13 and 16, and has worked as a TV broadcaster.

Texto completo: Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert on Thursday denied intentionally administering the banned drug scopolamine to Triple Crown-winning horse Justify in 2018, saying a positive test had been a result of "environmental contamination."
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Justify had tested positive to the substance after winning the Santa Anita Derby in California, less than a month before the start of the Triple Crown.
"I unequivocally reject any implication that Scopolamine was ever intentionally administered to Justify, or any of my horses," Baffert wrote on Twitter.
"Test results indicating trace amounts of the drug were undoubtedly the result of environmental contamination caused by the presence of Jimson Weed in feed, a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California.
"In addition, I had no input into, or influence on, the decisions made by the California Horse Racing Board."
Baffert said Justify had passed drug tests at each of the Triple Crown races that the horse had won -- the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes in Maryland and Belmont Stakes in New York.
The Kentucky and Maryland racing bodies confirmed on Thursday that Justify had passed drug tests at their 2018 Triple Crown races.
BASKETBALL
SERBIA DUMPS U.S. IN WORLD CUP » The U.S. came to China looking to again be the best in the world.
It'll go home with the worst tournament showing in program history. Such is the reality for the Americans now, assured of finishing no better than seventh at the World Cup after falling to Serbia 94-89 in a consolation game Thursday night in Dongguan, China. The previous worst finish for a U.S. men's team in 45 tournament appearances was sixth at the 2002 world championships.
The Americans the topranked team in the world will be seventh or eighth in China, depending on the outcome of their consolation finale Saturday. Harrison Barnes scored 22 for the U.S., which got 18 from Kemba Walker and 16 from K h r i s Middleton.
Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 28 for Serbia, which bolted to a 25-point lead and handed the U.S. its second loss in two days. Vladimir Lucic scored 15 for Serbia, which will play for fifth place Saturday.
Serbia won the first quarter 327. The U.S. won the second quarter 33-12. Serbia shot 64% in the first quarter and the U.S. shot 19%; in the second quarter, it was the Americans shooting 72%, Serbia 31%, and it stayed relatively tight the rest of the way.
 USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo said that when the time comes to start assembling the 2020 Tokyo Olympics roster, he won't forget those who backed out of commitments to play in the World Cup this summer.
Of the 35 players originally selected for the U.S. player pool, only four are in China for the World Cup. The U.S. ended a streak of seven major international tournaments four Olympics and three World Cups where the Americans captured a medal, the past five of them being gold.
"I can only say, you can't help but notice and remember who you thought you were going to war with and who didn't show up," Colangelo said. "I'm a firm believer that you
deal with the cards you're dealt. All we could have done, and we did it, is get the commitments from a lot of players. So with that kind of a hand you feel reasonably confident that you're going to be able to put a very good representative team on the court.
"No one would have anticipated the pull-outs that we had."

Baffert: Justify’s test came from contaminated food
NEW YORK (AP) —Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert denied giving 2018 Triple Crown winning horse Justify a banned substance that caused a positive test prior to last year’s Kentucky Derby and blamed the result on contaminated food.
Baffert said Thursday that he “unequivocally” rejects the implication he’d give Justify or any other horse scopolamine, which the colt tested positive for after winning the Santa Anita Derby in April 2018.
The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for the substance and that the California Horse Racing Board did not adequately investigate the matter. Justify was allowed to continue racing and won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes to become the 13th Triple Crown winner in history.
“Damn shame this great horse, connections and me have to be put through all this,” Baffert said in a text message to The Associated Press. “It was obvious environmental contamination. It’s been a known problem in California.”
California Horse Racing Board equine medical director Rick Arthur told the AP that the amount of scopolamine in Justify’s blood was “minuscule” and that he recommended based on his findings that the case not be prosecuted. Scopolamine, also known as hyoscine, can be used to treat motion sickness in humans and in limited equine cases can relieve intestinal spasms, though it can be toxic to horses.
Scopolamine, which has been nationally downgraded from a class 3 to a class 4 level substance in horse racing, can come from jimson weed that grows wild in California. The Association of Racing Commissioners International’s Uniform Classification of Foreign Substances guidelines say class 4 drugs “comprise primarily therapeutic medications routinely used in racehorses (that) may influence performance but generally have a more limited ability to do so.”
Arthur said seven horses from four different trainers at Santa Anita were found to have some level of scopolamine or atropine in their systems during the period when Justify tested positive and he recommended that the two cases that crossed the threshold - Justify and another - be dismissed.
“It was a conclusion certainly of the executive staff that that was the appropriate and correct way to handle the case,” said Arthur, who is equine medical director at the veterinary school at the University of California at Davis, and is assigned to but not paid by the California Horse Racing Board. “I’m the primary adviser on drug testing to the board, and my opinion is it would have no pharmacological effect.”
After Baffert called on racing officials in Kentucky, Maryland and New York to release Justify’s test results, each one said everything came back negative.
“Neither Churchill Downs nor the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission had knowledge of any potential positive tests that may have emanated from California in advance of the 2018 Kentucky Derby,” Churchill Downs Racetrack President Kevin Flanery said. “We do know that all pre- and post-race tests for 2018 Kentucky Derby participants came back clean, including Justify.”
The Maryland Jockey Club said it was “informed that all of those tests came back negative for any illicit substance or for the overages of any prohibited medication” for Justify and the other horses who ran in the 2018 Preakness.
New York State Gaming Commission director of communications Brad Maione told the AP all of Justify’s blood and urine samples tested by the New York Equine Drug Testing and Research Laboratory at the Belmont Stakes came back clear “with no evidence of impermissible medication.” Veterinary records from the 2018 Belmont showed Justify was treated orally for dehydration the day before the race.
Justify did not run another race after winning the Triple Crown and was retired. Baffert trained the only two Triple Crown winners in the past three decades: Justify in 2018 and American Pharoah in 2015.
“Justify is one of the finest horses I’ve had the privilege of training and by any standard is one of the greatest of all time,” Baffert said in a statement. “I am proud to stand by his record and my own.”
Baffert’s attorney, W. Craig Robertson, wrote a letter addressed to the Times defending Baffert and saying the California racing board did the correct thing by not pursuing a lengthy investigation.
While defending his own actions, Baffert said he had no input into or influence on decisions made by the California board, which came under fire for treating this situation differently from past precedent. Upon notification of the positive test result, Robertson told the board to deal with him and not Baffert from that point forward.
“Given all the foregoing facts, I was confident that Mr. Baffert would ultimately prevail if the CHRB pursued the matter,” Robertson wrote. “This left the CHRB with two choices - either pursue a frivolous case that had no merit at great taxpayer expense, or exercise reason and common sense and decide to take no further action.”
In a news release Thursday, Animal Wellness Action executive director Marty Irby called for drug testing to be “conducted and overseen by impartial operators and not by industry players with a vested interest in looking the other way.” The Times reported the chairman of the California board owns an interest in horses trained by Baffert.
The California Horse Racing Board said in a statement emailed to the AP: “We take seriously the integrity of horse racing in California and are committed to implementing the highest standards of safety and accountability for all horses, jockeys and participants.”

Texto completo: Anne Rivers Siddons, best-selling author of "Peachtree Road" and a member of the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame, has died.
Her stepson David Siddons confirmed her death in the Charleston Post and Courier. He said Siddons, 83, succumbed to lung cancer Wednesday at Medical University Hospital in Charleston.
Born Sybil Anne Rivers on Jan. 9, 1936, in Fairburn to Katherine and Marvin Rivers, a school secretary and a lawyer, respectively, Siddons attended Campbell High School, where she was a cheerleader and homecoming queen. After graduation she attended
Auburn University, where she was a member of Delta Delta Del ta sorority and wrote for the student newspaper, The Auburn Plainsm a n, whi c h famously fired her for writing columns in favor of integration. The incident inspired the plot for Siddons'debut novel, "Heartbreak Hotel"(1976),which was made into the feature film "Heart of Dixie," starring Ally Sheedy, Phoebe Cates and Treat Williams, in 1989.
Before she became an author, though, Siddons worked as an advertising copywriter, and as a writer and editor for Atlanta magazine alongside founder Jim Townsend. In 1966, she married Heyward Siddons, a Princeton graduate and a partner in Phoenix Printing, who made her a stepmother to four boys.
Success as an author came easy to Siddons. In 1974, after reading one of her articles in Atlanta magazine, an editor at Doubleday sent Siddons a letter requesting a manuscript for possible publication.
"I literally thought a friend of mind had stolen some Doubleday stationary," Siddons told the AJC in 1986.
She sent him a batch of previously published work, a collection of personal essays about her youth, her career and her hometown, and it was published in 1975 under the title "John Chancellor Always Makes Me Cry."
Two years later she published the first of her 19 novels, many of them set in Atlanta and all of them centered on strong Southern women.
Her most commercially successful novel was "Peachtree Road" (1988), a saga that spans 40 years and follows an ill-fated romance that links two wealthy Buck-head families. "Prince of Tides" author Pat Conroy called it "the Southern novel of our generation."
Siddons and Conroy were close friends, and their ascension among Atlanta's literati coincided during a publishing heyday in the city when their mutual friend, Cliff Graubart, owner of the Old New York Book Shop, had a storefront on Piedmont Road and later Juniper Street, where he hosted legendary book signings and parties in the '70s and '80s. Their social circle also included cookbook authors Nathalie Dupree and Graubart's wife, Cynthia.
"Annie was a magnificent cook, fed us all, lived in a beautiful house, which none of us did then," Conroy said about those days in "My Exaggerated Life" (2018), his posthumously published memoir as told to Katherine Clark. "Annie and Heyward's was this post of civilization that we could always go to, were always invited to.They were an adult couple who were running a household that looked like a household, as opposed to the rest of us who lived in the inside of potato chip bags. If they ever had arguments, I never saw it. If they ever got mad at me, I never knew it. Those two people brought great kindness, great times of happiness into my life."
In 1993, Siddons published "Hill Towns," a novel about a band of friends touring Italy that was inspired by the Graubarts' European honeymoon, on which Conroy, Dupree and the Siddons tagged along.
Also notable among Siddons' novels is "The House Next Door" (1978) about a woman who moves into a home occupied by an evil presence that preys on its inhabitants' weaknesses. Made into a TV movie starring Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Lara Flynn Boyle for Lifetime in 2006, the novel is cited by the master of horror writing, Stephen King, as one of the best horror novels of the 20th century in his nonfiction assessment of the genre, "Danse Macabre" (1981).
Despite her commercial success and her admiring colleagues, Siddons' work did not garner the critical praise she'd hoped. "I would like to be taken a little more seriously in New York, but that's not going to happen," she told the AJC in 1998. "I will never be considered anything but a regional writer by The New York Times."
The criticism she received for her third novel, "Fox's Earth" (1981), was particularly brutal. The manuscript for her follow-up novel was returned by her publisher, who requested a complete rewrite.
"I just couldn't do it," she told the AJC. "So I sent the advance back."
Six years would pass before Siddons published another book, during which time she battled depression. She credited therapy and medication for aiding her recovery and restoring her desire to write, which she did with a vengeance, publishing 11 books over the next 13 years.
Citing traffic, unbr idled development and the destruction of historic buildings, Siddons and her husband left Atlanta for Charleston, S.C., in 1998.
"Atlanta had a very specific feel to it in the '60s," she told the AJC. "It doesn't have that feel any more. It seems too homogenized. In Charleston, there's development, but more historic buildings have been saved here than in any other big city. And here they celebrate the past. They don't pretend it never happened."
An unwavering champion of his wife's work, Heyward Siddons died after a brief illness in 2014.
"The great, unseeable reward I received from watching the marriage of Heyward and Annie Siddons is to be a witness to the greatest love story it has been a privilege to watch," Conroy wrote on his website in a piece titled "A Eulogy for a Southern Gentleman."
Siddons, according to the Post and Courier obituary, is survived by four stepsons: Lee Siddons; Kemble Siddons and his wife, Carol; Rick Siddons and his wife, Julie; David Siddons and his wife, Tracy; and three step-grand-children.
According to Cynthia Graubart, plans for a service are still incomplete.

Google Settles Over Claims It Stifled Workers' Dissent
WASHINGTON -- Google said Thursday it had reached a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board over complaints from multiple employees, including one who had said he was fired for being an outspoken conservative, who said the company had stymied dissent. Google plans to explain to employees the rights they have as workers under federal law, like the ability to discuss workplace conditions, said Jenn Kaiser, a Google spokeswoman. And it will tell employees that Google will not retaliate against them for exercising those rights. "Under that settlement, we have agreed to post a notice to our employees reminding them of their rights under the National Labor Relations Act," Ms. Kaiser said in a statement. "As a part of that notice, we will also remind employees of the changes we made to our workplace policies back in 2016 and 2017 that clarified those policies do not prevent employees from discussing workplace issues." The settlement requires the approval of an official at the N.L.R.B. According to a document obtained by The New York Times, a regional director said this week that she would approve the settlement. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Google had reached a settlement. Accusations of political bias at major tech companies and their services have become a powerful rallying cry among conservatives. A White House gathering of President Trump's social media allies this year was pegged, in part, to those criticisms of Google and other major technology companies. The companies have denied the accusations. DAVID McCABE
MEDIA
Top Official in Virginia Sues CBS for Defamation
In a rare legal broadside by a politician against a major news organization, Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax of Virginia sued CBS on Thursday for defamation, saying the network's news division smeared him by airing interviews with two women who accused the lawmaker of sexual assault. Mr. Fairfax, who remained in his job despite an outcry after the assault accusations, asked CBS to pay him $ 400 million in damages. He said the network ignored evidence that the women's accounts were untruthful, and he argued that the reports damaged his career and reputation. CBS News, in a statement, said: "We stand by our reporting and we will vigorously defend this lawsuit." The suit concerns a pair of interviews that aired in April on "CBS This Morning," conducted by the anchor Gayle King. One woman, Meredith Watson, accused Mr. Fairfax of raping her in 2000 in a fraternity house at Duke University, where they were students. Another woman, Vanessa C. Tyson, a professor of political science, described being sexually assaulted by Mr. Fairfax after they met at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Mr. Fairfax has accused both women of fabricating their accounts. Their allegations came into view this year as Mr. Fairfax was poised to ascend to the governorship of Virginia, after the current governor, Ralph Northam, faced a maelstrom after a photograph of himself in blackface surfaced. Plaintiffs typically face a high threshold in proving that a news organization engaged in malicious defamation. MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

Baffert, CHRB respond to NY Times story on Justify failing drug test before Triple Crown run

Texto completo: This week the New York Times reported that 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify failed a post-race drug test after the Santa Anita Derby that could have kept the colt out of the Kentucky Derby.
Horse racing needs another controversy like Dodgers fans need a third World Series disappointment, yet here we are again. Less than two weeks removed from a historic Del Mar meet in terms of safety that helped restore some sanity in California, the sport is left with yet another black eye.
Why?
Because factions like the California Horse Racing Board, the Stronach Group and others can’t seem to grasp the concept that transparency is the only way to go. Deals and decisions made behind closed doors, whether right or wrong, oftentimes blow up in the decision makers’ faces. This is one of those instances.
Here’s what we know about the Justify saga:
— The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for a drug called scopolamine one day after winning the Santa Anita Derby on April 6. The story alleges the CHRB did not inform trainer Bob Baffert of the positive test until nine days before the Kentucky Derby. A second test on May 1, at the request of Baffert, also came up positive.
— Joe Drape, who wrote the Times article, said the CHRB let the matter drag on until after Justify swept the Triple Crown. He reported the CHRB did not file a public complaint per usual protocol and instead made a series of decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case in its entirety after the Belmont Stakes on June 8. Later, the CHRB amended its rules on scopolamine positives.
— On Thursday, Churchill Downs tweeted that “until media reports surfaced Wednesday night, neither Churchill Downs nor the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission had knowledge of any potential tests that may have emanated from California in advance of the 2018 Kentucky Derby.”
— Churchill Downs maintained “we do know that all pre- and post-race tests for the 2018 Kentucky Derby participants came back clean, including Justify.” The race track also noted, “in advance of our race each year, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission conducts pre-race out-of-competition testing for every Kentucky Derby starter and all starters’ results were clean.” It added that all post-race tests for “a myriad of banned substances” were clean.
— Baffert, in a statement Thursday, claimed he had no influence on any decisions made by the CHRB, saying, “I unequivocally reject any implication that scopolamine was ever intentionally administered to Justify, or any of my horses. Test results indicating trace amounts of the drug were undoubtedly the result of environmental contamination caused by the presence of jimson weed in feed, a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California.” Baffert added: “Justify is one of the finest horses I’ve had the privilege of training and by any standard is one of the greatest of all time. I am proud to stand by his record, and my own.”
— Baffert’s lawyer, Kentucky-based Craig Robertson III, called Drape’s reporting “defamatory.” He also said in a letter addressed to Drape that his article was “long on sensationalism” and “short on facts.” Robertson said: “No trainer would ever intentionally administer scopolamine to a horse. It has a depressant effect and would do anything but enhance the performance of a horse.”
— Chuck Winner, whose five-year reign as chairman of the CHRB expired recently, released this comment Thursday afternoon: “It is most unfortunate that the correct decision by the CHRB to not pursue action due to what was clearly a case of environmental contamination has been badly mischaracterized. All possible tests and procedures and investigations were followed by the CHRB Equine Medical Director and senior staff, which led to the overwhelming evidence that Justify, along with six other horses in four different barns at Santa Anita, ingested scopolamine from jimson weed which was present in the hay that had been delivered to the barns. Furthermore, under ARCI guidelines, scopolamine is a class 4c substance, which would not trigger disqualification or redistribution of a purse.”
Winner went on to say: “The whole premise of the story is false on its face … California law mandates that test results must remain confidential unless and until a complaint is filed, and a complaint can only be filed at the end of an investigative process. It would have been a complete miscarriage of justice for the CHRB to have taken action against Justify or Baffert.”
The CHRB dropped the ball here. It should have informed both Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission about Justify’s positive test. Seeing as though it normally takes 60-90 days for a drug positive to be resolved, it’s highly questionable whether Justify would have been denied a spot in the Kentucky Derby. We’ll never know.
There are so many questions left unanswered in this mess:
— What is the effect of scopolamine on a horse?
Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director of the CHRB, echoed Robertson’s thoughts and scoffed at the suggestion in an interview with the Thoroughbred Daily News that the drug helped Justify during his Triple Crown run.
“Jimson weed is a weed we see in California not infrequently,” he said. “This is not a case of someone drugging a horse. This is a case of a horse poisoning. The source of it is a poisonous plant.”
Arthur also defended his and CHRB executive director Rick Baedeker’s decision to put the case to rest.
“The Board, on my and the executive director’s recommendation, made the correct, appropriate and the gutsy decision to dismiss the case,” he told TDN.
But in Drape’s story, he quotes Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018, as saying “the drug can act as a bronchodilator to clear a horse’s airway and optimize a horse’s heart rate, making the horse more efficient.” Sams added that the 300 nanograms per milliliter was excessive, and he suggested the drug was intended to enhance performance. Said Sams: “I think it has to come from intentional intervention.”
So who’s right here?
Because of horse racing’s non-transparent nature, we’ll never know what Baffert’s intentions were. We’ll never know why the CHRB acted as it did. Would Justify have been as brilliant during his historic run without scopolamine? Because of that non-transparency, Justify’s Triple Crown will forever carry a huge asterisk.
So there you have it, what should stand as one of horse racing’s shining moments now has a huge black stain on it. Telling the truth from the beginning could have avoided this mess. But then, we’re talking about horse racing.
Wonder if any owner will ever name a horse “Transparency.”

Texto completo: Many observers have warned that the Chinese could dominate the field of artificial intelligence. Maybe it will dominate them. The potential impact of technology on the Chinese workforce could be driving Beijing to try again for a U.S. trade deal.
Lingling Wei and Chao Deng report in the Journal:
China is looking to narrow the scope of its negotiations with the U.S. to only trade matters, putting thornier national-security issues on a separate track in a bid to break deadlocked talks with the U.S.
Chinese officials are hoping that such an approach would help both sides resolve some immediate issues and offer a path out of the impasse, according to people familiar with the plan.
The shift comes as President Trump on Wednesday delayed tariffs on some Chinese imports.
Workers and investors have seen their share of head fakes about the direction of trade negotiations from officials in both governments. But the Journal report suggests the Chinese regime is willing to do more than buy soybeans:
In preparation for a new round of talks scheduled to take place in Washington early next month, Chinese negotiators are making plans to boost purchases of U.S. agricultural products, give American companies greater access to China's market and bolster intellectual-property protections, these people said.
Meanwhile U.S. officials seem to have wisely selected their top two priorities:
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday he was cautiously optimistic the two sides could make meaningful progress.
He said the U.S.'s top concerns remain intellectual-property rights and forced joint ventures, as well as currency issues.
A key question has been how long Chinese dictator-for-life Xi Jinping can wait to resolve the trade dispute before many more U.S. companies move manufacturing out of China. He has some room for error in part because rising alternatives like Vietnam can't compete with China's massive workforce. But what if manufacturers decide they don't need a massive workforce?
Just as demands for a higher minimum wage from politicians in the U.S. have encouraged burger joints to add touch screens instead of hiring more cashiers, Washington's trade taxes on top of the cost of Chinese goods create a powerful new incentive to replace Chinese workers with technology.
Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, says that many U.S. companies are now exploring automation as the answer to the trade dispute. He sees executives acknowledging that tariff levels may not return to pre-Trump levels and preparing to invest accordingly. For his part Mr. Hyzy isn't expecting a substantive trade deal, telling Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business this week that the two sides may simply agree not to raise tariff levels even higher from current levels.
The rise of the machines can accelerate in the U.S. and in friendly foreign nations as well. This trend may not directly translate into the new U.S. jobs Mr. Trump wants, but it could result in the angry Chinese workforce Mr. Xi fears.

Biden's Upside
This column asked in May if former Vice President Joe Biden had peaked as a presidential candidate. Since then he's lost eight percentage points of support in the RealClearPolitics average of polls covering the race for the Democratic nomination. This erosion in support has coincided with the candidate's leftward drift on policy. Nevertheless Mr. Biden remains the most popular choice and a recent Morning Consult survey suggests that he still has room to grow his constituency.
Given the difficulty even committed leftists have in telling the policy difference between Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, one might assume that the withdrawal of either one from the race would allow the remaining extremist to quickly attract the departing extremist's voters. But the Morning Consult poll finds surprising Biden strength when such voters are asked about their second favorite candidate for the nomination.
Mr. Biden—not Sen. Warren—is the second choice of voters who favor Sen. Sanders, according to the poll. And among Democratic primary voters who support Elizabeth Warren, it's a close battle for second place between Mr. Sanders at 24% and Mr. Biden at 21%.
If this poll is accurate, it seems that either Mr. Biden's move left has made him more palatable to Sanders and Warren voters, or these voters aren't as fiercely ideological as their favorite candidates.

A Message from Carolina
Speaking of a fiercely ideological Democratic primary season, New York Times columnist David Leonhardt thinks it's one reason "Democrats aren't having a very strong 2019." He writes that the party's presidential candidates have "chosen to support — and in some cases emphasize — a few policies that are deeply unpopular, such as border decriminalization and the elimination of private health insurance."
Are they turning off swing voters? Mr. Leonhardt adds:
Last year, in North Carolina's 9th congressional district, a young Marine Corps veteran and moderate Democrat named Dan McCready lost a House election by just 0.4 percentage points, 49.3 percent to 48.9 percent. It was an especially impressive performance because Donald Trump won the district by almost 12 percentage points in 2016. Ultimately, the victory by McCready's opponent was nullified because of evidence of ballot fraud, and the district scheduled a do-over election, without the Republican whose campaign committed fraud.
That do-over was held [Tuesday], this time with McCready running against a Trump-friendly state senator named Dan Bishop. And although McCready put up another impressive performance, it was weaker than his 2018 showing.
Of particular concern to Democrats is the Republican strength in an especially diverse area of the congressional district. "In Robeson County, registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans 60% to 13%," r eports Jim Morrill in the Charlotte Observer. He notes:
Phillip Stephens, the GOP chair of Robeson County, said conservative values pushed voters toward Bishop. Though criticized in some circles as the author of House Bill 2, the 2016 measure that required transgender people to use the bathrooms of the gender on their birth certificate in government buildings, it worked to his advantage in Robeson, Stephens said.
"When they called him the bathroom bill sponsor they thought they were attacking him," Stephens said. "But in the rural areas that was seen as a compliment."

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – The Columbus Symphony will open its 2019-20 Pops Series with Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" on Oct. 19.
The Nightmare Before Christmas follows the earnest-but-misguided adventures of Jack Skellington, Halloween Town's beloved Pumpkin King, as he attempts to kidnap Santa Claus and take over the Christmas holiday.
The Columbus Symphony presents Disney Concerts: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas at the Ohio Theatre (39 E. State St.) at 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 19. Tickets are $25-$78 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.ColumbusSymphony.com, or by phone at 614-469-0939 or 800 982-2787.
First released in 1993, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas was directed by Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach) and based on a story and characters by Tim Burton. Against the advice of Sally, a lonely rag doll who has feelings for him, Jack enlists three mischievous trick-or-treaters – Lock, Shock, and Barrel – to help him kidnap Santa Claus.
American Festival offers works inspired by moments in US history COLUMBUS – Five guest soloists and the Columbus Symphony Chorus join CSO Music Director Rossen Milanov and the musicians of the Columbus Symphony for The American Festival.
Performing Paul Moravec and Mark Campbell's monumental oratorio Sanctuary Road based on the writings of William Still, a conductor on the Underground Railroad who helped almost 800 slaves escape to freedom the performances will be Oct. 11 & 12. The program also includes a concert version of Gershwin's American classic, Porgy and Bess.
The Columbus Symphony presents The American Festival at the Ohio Theatre (39 E. State St.) at 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, Oct. 11 and 12. Tickets start at $10 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.columbussymphony.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 982-2787. The CAPA Ticket Center will also be open two hours prior to each performance.
Prelude – Patrons are invited to join Maestro Milanov and the creative duo behind Sanctuary Road, composer Paul Moravec and librettist Mark Campbell, for a 30-minute, pre-concert discussion at 7 p.m.
David Sedaris is live at the Palace Theatre Oct. 20 COLUMBUS – CAPA and WCBE present An Evening with David Sedaris, author of the previous bestsellers "Naked," "Me Talk Pretty One Day," "Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim," and regular National Public Radio contributor will appear for one night only at the Palace Theatre on Sunday, Oct. 20, following the release of his newest book and New York Times #1 Best Seller, "Calypso." This is a unique opportunity to see the best-selling humorist in an intimate setting. As always, Sedaris will offer a selection of all-new readings and recollections, as well as a Q&A session and book signing.
CAPA presents An Evening with David Sedaris at the Palace Theatre (34 W. Broad St.) at 3 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 20. Tickets are $53.50-$63.50 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 982-2787.
With sardonic wit and incisive social critiques, Sedaris has become one of America's pre-eminent humor writers. The great skill with which he slices through cultural euphemisms and political correctness proves him a master of satire and one of the most observant writers addressing the human condition today.
Sedaris returns to the road following the release of his most deeply personal and darkly hilarious collection, "Calypso," in which he sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Sedaris' powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy is born of that vertiginous moment when your body betrays you and you realize the story of your life is more past than future.

Texto completo: There's a new version of Monopoly coming, one that celebrates women by paying female players more than men.
The game, Ms. Monopoly, is the first to feature a new character -- an advocate for investing in female entrepreneurs -- on its cover, according to a news release this week from Hasbro, the entertainment giant that owns the game.
Ms. Monopoly celebrates female inventors, but one was conspicuously missing from the announcement: Elizabeth Magie, a progressive and feminist whose role in developing Monopoly itself has long been diminished.
"I think if Hasbro was serious about women's empowerment, they could start by admitting that a woman invented the game," said Mary Pilon, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and the author of "The Monopolists," a 2015 history of the board game.
Monopoly's invention is often credited to Charles Darrow, who sold the game to Parker Brothers in 1935, but Ms. Pilon and others argue that he and Hasbro owe it all to Magie, who is acknowledged, briefly, inside the box of the new Ms. Monopoly.
In 1904, Magie, also known as Lizzie, received a patent for an invention, The Landlord's Game. Like modern Monopoly, players in the game roll dice to advance along a path composed of 40 spaces around a square board, according to the patent. They purchase property along the way and there are utilities, railroads and a bank. A corner square instructs players to "go to jail," and a trip around the board earns each $ 100.
The goal was to amass wealth. The game's purpose, however, was political. Magie's views were shaped by Henry George, a popular progressive who argued for a single land tax to keep the wealthy few from monopolizing resources, according to the book. The game was designed to make the case for reform.
"It is a practical demonstration of the present system of land-grabbing with all its usual outcomes and consequences," Magie wrote in The Single Tax Review, a journal dedicated to the idea.
Magie was something of a feminist and progressive pioneer, according to the book. By the early 1900s, she owned a home of her own in Washington, D.C., worked as a stenographer and acted and wrote in her spare time. In addition to inventing several games, Magie was also an amateur engineer and held a patent on a tool to more easily pass paper through typewriter rollers.
In 1906, she made headlines around the world when she put herself up for sale as a "young woman American slave" in an effort to raise awareness about gender inequality. The stunt landed Magie a meeting with the writer Upton Sinclair and a temporary newspaper job. And as Magie gained fame, so, too, did her game.
"It kind of goes viral in the way things did in 1904, which is to say more slowly and kind of all over, but it becomes a favorite game among left-wing intellectuals," Ms. Pilon said. There is evidence of versions played at Columbia, Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, she said.
Ms. Pilon traced the game's slow path to a Quaker community in Atlantic City, where homemade copies were created with the property names replaced by local landmarks, such as Pennsylvania Avenue, Virginia Avenue, Ventnor Avenue and Boardwalk. Eventually, Darrow was introduced to the game by a man who attended a Quaker school with his wife.
Darrow developed Monopoly, making changes and tweaks, and began to market it locally and pitched it to Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers. Both rejected it at first, but as the game grew in popularity, Parker Brothers had a change of heart and purchased it in 1935.
The company then set out to neutralize any threats to its new game. It secured a patent on Monopoly, and bought up similar board games or sued their makers. George Parker, the company's founder, visited Magie and persuaded her to sell the patent for The Landlord's Game in exchange for $ 500 and a promise to publish it and two other games of her design.
None of the games took off, and when Magie died in 1948, her obituary made no mention of her role in the development of Monopoly, according to the book.
In a statement and in the box of Ms. Monopoly, Hasbro acknowledges Magie, but stops short of giving her credit for the game.
"The Monopoly game as we know it was invented by Charles Darrow, who sold his idea to Parker Brothers in 1935," the company said in the statement. "However, there have been a number of popular property trading games throughout history. In fact, Elizabeth Magie -- a writer, inventor, and feminist -- was one of the pioneers of land-grabbing games."
Since 1935, nearly 1,000 different versions of Monopoly -- including limited editions based on movies like "Star Wars" -- have been created, according to Hasbro, which now owns Parker Brothers. Monopoly and six other franchises, including Magic: The Gathering and Nerf, generated $ 2.45 billion in revenue for Hasbro last year, which was the best on record for Monopoly, the company said in its 2018 annual report.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: HONG KONG
The masked men who recently tossed firebombs at Jimmy Lai's home targeted one of this city's foremost democracy advocates. Lai, a 71-year-old media billionaire , calls this summer's ongoing protest "a martyrdom movement" and "a last-straw movement." It has an intensity and dynamic that bewilders the protesters' opponents in Beijing and in Hong Kong's Beijing-obedient city administration.
Today's mostly young protesters will be middle-aged in 2047, at the expiration of the 50-year agreement that ostensibly accords Hong Kong protected status as an island of freedom. Beijing attempted to whittle away that status with a proposed 2003 law against "subversion." And by devaluing suffrage via the 2014 requirement that candidates for the chief executive receive approval from a Beijing-loyal committee. And by this year's extradition bill that would have facilitated sweeping Hong Kongers into the maw of China's opaque criminal-justice system.
Monday's New York Times carried a full-page ad paid for by "the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China." Which means, effectively, by the Chinese Communist Party. The ad said: "We are resolutely committed to 'One Country, Two Systems' which provides the constitutional guarantee for Hong Kong's continued development and success as a free and open society." The ad pledged "dialogue to talk through differences and look for common ground with no preconditions."
But the "one county, two systems" formulation - agreed to in 1997 , when British authority ended - as a 50-year framework for Hong Kong's relations with the PRC is an inherently menacing precondition. And Beijing's consistently sinister behavior reveals a determination, as implacable as it is predictable, to incrementally nullify "one nation, two systems" by reducing Hong Kong to just another jurisdiction wholly subservient to China's deepening tyranny.
For Leninists such as Xi Jinping wielding a party-state, nothing is more important than the party's unchallenged primacy. Another "Tiananmen Square" - a Hong Kong massacre - would be calamitous for China's Leninists, but less so than weakening the Communist Party's primacy. The party is, Lai says, "detached from reality" and "will always make the wrong decision" as it tries to become "the most absolute dictatorship in human history."
In 1940, Winston Churchill warned against "a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science." That is China's aspiration with "digital Leninism," an application of science through manipulative technologies that neither Churchill nor his contemporary, George Orwell, anticipated. With a steadily refined repression apparatus, aptly called "cyber-totalitarianism ," China's surveillance state is enmeshing everyone in a "social credit" system. Individuals' cumulative commercial and social media transactions give them a score that determines their access to education, housing, clinics, travel and more - even pet ownership. Although China's published statistics are as untrustworthy as the regime itself, there are reasons to believe that in this decade China has spent more on "stability maintenance " than on its military. Hong Kong is watching this.
And Hong Kong is reading Ma Jian's dystopian novel "China Dream," which is banned in mainland China but not here. The protagonist is Ma Daode, director of the fictional (so far) China Dream Bureau , which aspires to "replace all private dreams " with one communal dream. Ma Daode hopes to develop "a neural implant," a device whereby "just one click of a button and government directives will be transferred wirelessly into the brains " of the governed. This is not much more Orwellian than China's evolving reality.
In her 1951 "The Origins of Totalitarianism," Hannah Arendt argued that a tyrannical regime, wielding bureaucracy and mass media, could achieve permanence by conscripting the citizenry's consciousness. This echoed Orwell's foreboding: "Imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever." In 1956, Arendt thought her theory had been refuted by a fact - the Hungarian Revolution, which demonstrated that no state can interrupt "all channels of communication ." Hong Kong sees Beijing using new technologies in the service of an evil permanence.
"To see what is in front of one's nose," wrote Orwell, "needs a constant struggle." Belatedly, the world is seeing. The Economist recently editorialized: "The West's 25-year bet on China has failed." The wager was that "market totalitarianism" is an oxymoron. Embedding China in the global economy supposedly would open it to the softening effects of commerce, which would be solvents of authoritarianism. The West's tardy but welcome disenchantment is, as the Economist says, "the starkest reversal in modern geopolitics." If Hong Kong's heroic refusal to go gentle into Beijing's dark night is accelerating this disenchantment, the summer of dissent has been this decade's grandest and most important development.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump told aides he wanted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to "clarify" a tweet contradicting his claim that Hurricane Dorian likely posed a threat to Alabama, prompting his acting chief of staff to ask the Commerce Secretary to fix the situation, according to people familiar with the matter.
Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's call to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross followed days of complaining by the president, the people said, and resulted in the scientific agency issuing a rare public criticism of its own forecasters.
Five days after Mr. Trump made his original claim about Alabama on Twitter, NOAA released an unsigned statement criticizing National Weather Service forecasters in Birmingham who had disputed and corrected the suggestion that Alabama was in the storm's path.
Mr. Mulvaney's call was first reported by the New York Times, and the president urging his staff to seek a new statement from NOAA was first reported by the Washington Post.
The National Weather Service is a part of NOAA, which is under the jurisdiction of the Commerce Department. A Commerce spokesman said Mr. Ross hadn't threatened to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian, but declined to say whether the secretary had contacted NOAA on the matter.
Mr. Trump on Wednesday denied directing Mr. Mulvaney to disavow the forecasters who had contradicted his assertion about the threat to Alabama. "I never did that," he said, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office.
The president first raised the notion of Hurricane Dorian hitting Alabama in a Sept. 1 tweet, where he said the state, along with three others, would "most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated." Soon afterward, the National Weather Service in Birmingham tweeted that Alabama would "NOT see any impacts" from the storm. In the following days, Mr. Trump continued to aggressively defend his assertion, including displaying a Sharpie-doctored map in the Oval Office that added Alabama to the path of the storm.
On Friday, NOAA released a statement calling the Birmingham forecaster's tweet "inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time."
Two days later, acting NOAA chief scientist Craig McLean said in an email to employees that he was investigating whether the agency's response to Mr. Trump's Alabama tweet constituted a violation of NOAA policies and ethics.
The head of the National Weather Service, Louis Uccellini, on Monday offered a robust defense of the Birmingham forecasters, saying they "did what any office would do."
On Wednesday, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology sent a letter to Mr. Ross requesting information related to NOAA's actions in response to the president's Alabama claim, including a reported directive to staff barring them from publicly contradicting Mr. Trump's tweet and records of his reported threat to fire NOAA officials if they didn't support the White House's messaging.
"We are deeply disturbed by the politicization of NOAA's weather forecast activities for the purpose of supporting incorrect statements by the president," Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D., Texas), the Science Committee chairwoman, and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D., N.J.), chairwoman of an oversight subcommittee, wrote in the letter.
In their letter, the lawmakers also pointed to Mr. Ross's own comments during his confirmation hearing in 2017. There, he was asked whether he supported a NOAA policy under which the agency's scientists aren't required to seek permission to publicly share their scientific expertise.
"I support the dissemination of valid information to the public," he replied. "I don't think that valid information should be concealed."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The White House pushed for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to walk back a tweet that contradicted President Trump's claim that Hurricane Dorian likely posed a threat to Alabama.
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney asked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to fix the situation, a senior administration official said. The official said Mr. Mulvaney didn't make any threats and reached out to Mr. Ross in support of the president, who had been complaining about the issue.
Mr. Mulvaney's efforts—first reported by the New York Times—came as Mr. Trump grew increasingly frustrated with public criticism of his false claim about Alabama. Ultimately, NOAA released an unsigned statement Friday—five days after Trump made his original claim on Twitter —criticizing the National Weather Service forecasters in Birmingham who had disputed and corrected the suggestion that Alabama was in the storm's path.
The National Weather Service is a part of NOAA, which is under the jurisdiction of the Commerce Department.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied news reports that he instructed his administration to rebuke weather forecasters for contradicting his claim that Hurricane Dorian was a threat to Alabama.
"No, I never did that. I never did that," he said in the Oval Office. "That’s a whole hoax by the fake news media, when they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida and when they talk about Alabama. That’s just fake news. … It’s a fake story. "

"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian," the NWS wrote. "We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. "
Last week, Trump insisted he was correct that the storm was projected to affect Alabama.
He kept tweeting about the subject and brought it up during an Oval Office briefing on the storm, during which he held up a map of Dorian’s forecast path to show that Alabama had been in its path when he tweeted out the warning.

News reports said acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney directed Ross last week to have NOAA publicly counter the forecasters by saying Alabama was at risk to bolster the president's claim. Ross threatened to fire officials at the National Weather Service over the issue, according to The New York Times.
Friday, NOAA issued a statement defending the president.
"Information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama," it reads. The National Weather Service tweet "spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time. "

Officials at the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Former top officials with NOAA accused the agency of choosing politics over science.
Bill Read, director of the National Hurricane Center under President George W. Bush, said on Facebook the NOAA statement showed either an embarrassing lack of understanding of forecasting or “a lack of courage on their part by not supporting the people in the field who are actually doing the work. Heartbreaking. "
'Disgusting': Former NOAA officials critical of defense of Trump's Hurricane Dorian claim on Alabama
Members of Congress called for Ross to resign.
"People across this country depend on accurate, factual weather reporting, especially in times of natural disasters like hurricanes," Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill. , said Tuesday. "The only factor in issuing weather predictions should be science, not the political whims of a president and his administration. People gather their loved ones and flee their homes in fear when they hear about these storms, and it is extremely concerning that Secretary Ross would threaten to fire scientists for simply stating the facts.

Texto completo: Conservative reaction to The New York Times’ "1619 Project" — an attempt to tell the story of slavery and its lasting effect on American political, economic and social structures — has been both disappointing and instructive.
I am not referring here to thinkers (the term is employed loosely) who consciously embrace a philosophy of white supremacy. Though resurgent and repellent, they do not constitute the mainstream of conservative thinking on race.
I am thinking instead of conservative writers who argue that the 1619 Project is a prime example of leftist ideological overreach — that its (mainly African American) authors see the country entirely through the prism of its sins and intend to "delegitimize" the American experiment. In making this case, some conservatives have offered excuses — or at least mitigations — for the moral failures of the founders on matters of race.
The institution of slavery, we are assured, was historically ubiquitous. The global slave trade, we are reminded, involved not just Americans but Arabs and black Africans. Other countries, we are told, took more slaves than America, treated them worse and liberated them later. The attempt here is to defend the honor of the American experiment by denying the uniqueness of its hypocrisy on slavery. In one way or another, all these arguments ask us to consider the inadequacies of the founders within the context of their times.
But to deny the uniqueness of American guilt on slavery is also to deny the uniqueness of its aspirations. Americans are required to have ambiguous feelings about many of the country’s founders precisely because of the moral ideals the founders engraved in American life. The height of their ambitions is also the measure of their hypocrisy. It should unsettle us that the author of the Declaration of Independence built a way of life entirely dependent on human bondage.
This leads to an unavoidably complex form of patriotism. We properly venerate not the founders, but the standards they raised and often failed to meet. This is their primary achievement: They put into place an ideological structure that harshly judged their own practice and drove American democracy to achievements beyond the limits of their vision.
In the mid to late 18th century, there was plenty of compelling moral thinking on the issue of slavery.
In 1759, Quaker Anthony Benezet wrote "Observations on the Enslaving, Importing and Purchasing of Negroes," which presented eyewitness accounts of the cruelties of the slave trade. Benezet called slavery "inconsistent with the gospel of Christ, contrary to natural justice and the common feelings of humanity, and productive of infinite calamities to many thousand families, nay to many nations, and consequently offensive to God the father of all mankind."
In 1776, the year independence was declared, Presbyterian pastor Samuel Hopkins wrote "A Dialogue Concerning the Slavery of the Africans," which he dedicated to the Continental Congress. Hopkins urged his readers to "behold the sons of liberty oppressing and tyrannizing over many thousands of poor blacks who have as good a claim to liberty as themselves."
In 1778, another minister, Jacob Green, pointed out the discrediting inconsistency of a country that was dedicated to liberty and yet tolerant of slavery: "What foreign nation can believe that we who so loudly complain of Britain’s attempts to oppress and enslave us, are, at the same time, voluntarily holding multitudes of fellow creatures in abject slavery…?"
America’s founders stand accused by the best, most humane standards of their own time. When Jefferson wrote about natural rights on his mountaintop prison for black people, many of his contemporaries knew he was, on this issue, a total hypocrite.
America’s story is not one of initial purity and eventual decay. It is the story of a radical principle — the principle of human equality — introduced into a deeply unjust society. That principle was carried forward by oppressed people who understood it better than many of the nation’s founders. Denied the blessings of liberty, African Americans became the instruments by which the promise of liberty was broadly achieved. The victims of America’s moral blindness became carriers of the American ideal.
This story is not simple to tell. But it is miraculous in its own way. And it is good reason to be proud of America.

Texto completo: A woman alleges in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday that New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions in 2017 and 2018.
In the complaint, filed in the Southern District of Florida and obtained by USA TODAY Sports Tuesday night, Britney Taylor claims that Brown forcibly kissed her and masturbated near her during separate encounters in 2017 while she was helping train him for an upcoming NFL season. She alleges that Brown raped her on May 20, 2018.
Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement that his client had a "consensual personal relationship" with Taylor but denied raping or sexually assaulting her.
"Mr. Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit," Heitner wrote in the statement. "He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false allegations. "
In a statement the Patriots released late Tuesday night, the team acknowledged that the NFL will be investigating the allegations:
"We are aware of the civil lawsuit that was filed earlier today against Antonio Brown, as well as the response by Antonio's representatives. We take these allegations very seriously. Under no circumstance does this organization condone sexual violence or assault. The league has informed us that they will be investigating. We will have no further comment while that investigation takes place. "
In a statement released through her attorney, David Haas, Taylor said the decision to go public with her allegation was "incredibly difficult. "
“I will cooperate with the NFL and any other agencies," she said in the statement. "However, at this time, I respectfully request that the media please respect my privacy. "
USA TODAY does not typically identify victims of sexual assault unless they decide to come forward publicly, as Taylor has in this case.
Haas did not immediately reply to an email inquiry about whether Taylor reported the accusations to police, either when they occurred or in conjunction with the filing of the lawsuit.
Brown joined the Patriots this week after a tumultuous training camp with the Oakland Raiders. He was traded from Pittsburgh to Oakland in March but never played a game for the Raiders. He wasn’t eligible to play with New England against his former team Sunday, after the Raiders released him Saturday. But Brown is expected to be available for Week 2 in Miami.
While the allegations filed Tuesday stem from incidents in 2017 and 2018, the complaint claims they met long before that.
According to the lawsuit, first reported by The New York Times, Taylor and Brown were athletes at Central Michigan in 2010 and met through the Fellowship for Christian Athletes, where they were paired as Bible study partners. Brown was a junior on the football team at the time, while Taylor was a freshman gymnast.
Taylor claims they reconnected in 2017 when Brown asked her to train him. She flew to meet with him in Pittsburgh and Florida for the sessions, according to the complaint.
In June 2017, the lawsuit says, she was staying at his home for a session and in a bathroom when Brown walked in, exposed. He then "grabbed and kissed her without her consent," the lawsuit says, before she "pushed him away and immediately left the room. "
Another time in 2017, Brown masturbated behind her and ejaculated on her back, the lawsuit claims. Included in the complaint are explicit messages that Brown allegedly sent her about the incident.
The suit says the two cut off contact until 2018, when in April they agreed to restart a working relationship with conditions. Heitner, Brown's attorney, said in the statement that the lapse in communication resulted from Brown refusing to invest $1. 6 million in Taylor’s business project.
The two allegedly reconnected in 2018. The lawsuit claims that Taylor was visiting Brown in the Miami area when, on May 20, he pinned her down and penetrated her even as she shouted "no" and "stop. "
Heitner said "any sexual interaction with Mr. Brown was entirely consensual" and that Taylor traveled to Florida and returned at 2 a. m. to Brown’s residence 10 days after the alleged assault.
Heitner told USA TODAY Sports in an email that Brown and his legal team "are discussing next steps internally. "
“Antonio Brown will leave no stone unturned and will aggressively defend himself, including exercising all of his rights in countersuits,” he later wrote on Twitter.

Texto completo: New England Patriots receiver Antonio Brown, who recently joined the Super Bowl champions after two other teams , has been accused of raping a woman, according to a lawsuit she filed Tuesday.
The civil lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, alleges that Mr. Brown, 31 years old, assaulted the woman, Britney Taylor, on multiple occasions in 2017 and 2018, including one alleged incident in which she says he cornered her, pulled her onto a bed and forced himself on her with "great violence."
Ms. Taylor, who is 28, said in the suit that she met Mr. Brown when they attended Central Michigan University together. She later became his trainer, which is when he began assaulting her, according to the suit.
Mr. Brown denies "each and every allegation" in the lawsuit, according to a statement from his lawyer, Darren Heitner. The statement said Mr. Brown and Ms. Taylor had sex but that "any sexual interaction" between them was consensual, including the night in which she accuses him of raping her. Mr. Brown's lawyer described the lawsuit against his client as a "money grab."
The Patriots, who just days ago agreed to a deal with the star receiver, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
The suit alleges various incidents of misconduct by Mr. Brown over two years. In one alleged incident, in June 2017, Mr. Brown exposed himself and kissed Taylor without her consent, the suit alleges. After the alleged incidents, Ms. Taylor stopped working for Mr. Brown, according to the suit.
But months later, she says, Mr. Brown persuaded her to resume working with him, after which he raped her, the suit alleges. In May 2018, it says, Mr. Brown physically overpowered her and disregarded her pleas for him to stop and forcibly penetrated her.
"As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision," Ms. Taylor said in a statement through her lawyers. It wasn't immediately clear whether any of her accusations against Mr. Brown were reported to police.
Ms. Taylor said she would cooperate with the National Football League.
The accusation, earlier reported by the New York Times, comes after a turbulent off-season for Brown, one of football's most talented players.
When Mr. Brown signed with the Patriots, the deal marked his third team in less than a year. He asked to leave Pittsburgh at the end of last season, and the Steelers traded him to the Oakland Raiders. After a series of disagreements with the Raiders, he demanded his release, which was granted before he ever played a game for the team.
That release potentially cost Mr. Brown a great deal of money, but it didn't take him long to agree to terms with the Patriots on a new deal with the reigning Super Bowl champions. He has yet to suit up for the Patriots, and his first opportunity would have been next weekend, though it is unclear if he will now be permitted to do so.

Virginia sued for making those who wed list their race

Texto completo: Would you identify yourself as a Quadroon or a Moor? How about an Aryan or a Nubian?
Those were among the more than 200 categories that Brandyn Churchill and his fiancee Sophie Rogers were given to choose from as their race when they went to apply for a marriage license in Rockbridge County, Virginia, last week. And that, to them, was a vestige of an ugly history, a time when Virginia and other states used to prohibit people from marrying across racial lines.
"We're looking and we see Aryan, Mulatto, all these terms that are not only outdated, but deeply offensive," Churchill, 27, said about the list that county officials gave them. "How is that on a government document in 2019?"
With their planned wedding only 1� months away, Churchill and Rogers left without getting a marriage license, because they refused to list their races on their application. They are now among the plaintiffs who sued the state of Virginia in federal court last week, seeking to end the requirement.
"I don't think it's within the state's power to force someone to compel themselves to select a category," Churchill said.
Virginia was the state where Mildred Jeter, a Black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, were prosecuted and sentenced to a year in jail for violating a state law against marriage between whites and non-whites. Their appeal eventually went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which, in 1967, struck down all laws barring interracial marriage.
A spokesman for Mark Herring, the attorney general of Virginia, said that it was "not readily apparent why state law requires the collection of this data on the marriage license application," and that the state would examine the lawsuit carefully and determine how to proceed.
In the complaint, Victor M. Glasberg, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, argues that the requirement violates constitutional protections of free speech, due process and privacy.
The Constitution's due-process protections mean that the government cannot restrict a fundamental right like marriage "by forcing somebody to do something or say something that is inconsequential and irrelevant" in order to exercise it, Glasberg said in an interview.
He said there was no valid purpose in demanding to know someone's race before allowing them to marry. "They could just as well ask you for your grandmother's maiden name or your religion or when you were baptized or circumcised," Glasberg said.
The law violates free-speech protections, he said, because "the government cannot compel you to say things you don't want to say unless there's abundant good reason for it."
The lawsuit identifies seven other states where race must be specified on marriage license applications or certificates: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota and New Hampshire.
Glasberg said that for him, the lawsuit was deeply personal. He said he wrote a paper in law school in 1976 about the requirement to reveal one's race on a marriage license application. When he and his wife went to get their license at a court in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1981, they asked if they could list "human" as their race, he said, and when they were told they could not, they wrote "white" in quotation marks.
Churchill said that he and his fiancee would both be considered white. The lawsuit identifies him as of English, Scottish and German heritage, and Rogers' roots as Irish, German and Polish. The filing says they both have "peach-pink skin."
Churchill said that he had no problem with someone wanting to identify their race, and that he realized the importance of continuing to confront difficult issues of race in this day and age. But forcing people to select a race whether they wanted to or not was a step too far, he said.
Churchill and Rogers are scheduled to marry on Oct. 19, and he said they plan to have a wedding ceremony that day in any case. Whether they will officially have a marriage license that day remains an open question, but he said he was hopeful that the state would act before then to change the law.
Though Virginia requires that applicants specify their race when applying for a marriage license, the state leaves it up to individual counties to draw up their own lists of choices.
Churchill and Rogers said they were taken aback by the long list that Rockbridge county officials gave them. Many of the choices were nationalities, like Korean, German or Honduran. And some were obscure, outdated classifications like Quadroon and Octoroon that refer to the fraction of African ancestry in people of mixed race - a common basis for discrimination in previous eras.
"It was born out of a place of deep bigotry," Churchill said of the marriage-license race requirement. "It's apparent why they started it. It's not apparent why we're doing it in 2019."

Texto completo: Holman Jenkins's "The Tragedy of the Times" (Business World, Aug. 24) concentrates on the present day, referring to President Donald Trump and New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet.
I've read the New York Times for over 40 years. In days gone by, the Times kept its opinions on the editorial page. Ted Koppel pointed out that he tried to get a Times reporter on his TV show years ago. Abe Rosenthal, then the executive editor, replied that the reporter could appear but then couldn't return to the Times. Rosenthal didn't want his hard-news reporters answering provocative questions and offering commentary. That was the paper of record.
In 2010 the Times carried a front-page story saying John Boehner took over $300,000 from lobbyists! I was no particular fan of Mr. Boehner's, but the story struck me as a hit piece, and a few minutes of research showed other politicians in both parties took money from lobbyists and other sources which amounted to sums far in excess of that discussed in the article.
I wrote to the Times's public editor pointing out these facts and received a reply saying that he agreed, and that the reporter should have put the issue in context. He didn't say that had the reporter put the issue in context, there would have been no story. Under Rosenthal, a story like that would not have made it into the publication. That was the last issue of the Times received here. The current management has been increasingly happy to act as a newsletter for the true believers. Those can be had online for free.

Robert Woodson and the Legacy of Slavery

Texto completo: Regarding Robert L. Woodson's "'The 1619 Project' Hurts Blacks" (op-ed, Aug. 29) criticizing the 1619 Project for refusing to celebrate African-American success: The New York Times series is about slavery, not the African-American experience as a whole. Nothing good came out of slavery. While many African-Americans did achieve success, they did so despite the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow and racism.
When Mr. Woodson references North Carolina's "Black Wall Street," he neglects to mention that the black business district in Tulsa, Okla., was razed by white rioters in 1921. For most of America's history, any African-American success could be erased in a moment by jealous white people protected by the law.
Mr. Woodson should have explained when the effects of slavery became irrelevant. He cannot, because it haunts us to this day. That is why the 1619 Project on slavery is necessary.

Enough about the 1619 Project. It isn't true. The year 1619 marks the arrival of the first African slaves in America only if you believe American colonial history began with the English. Spanish coastal settlements in the South predated the English Virginia settlements by almost a century. And yes, the Spanish brought slaves. In his book "Marooned," Joseph Kelly mentions a 1526 Spanish settlement of 500 settlers and 100 African slaves along the Pee Dee River in what is now South Carolina.
North America has a Native-American, Viking, Mexican, French, Dutch, Swedish, Irish and African history, among others, along with the Spanish and English versions. A little perspective would be welcome.

Mr. Woodson charges that the New York Times Sunday magazine's 1619 Project scants black self-determination's "empowering spirit." This calls to mind Adam Goodheart's "How Slavery Really Ended in America" in the Times about an especially consequential story of that spirit. U.S. slavery began to end in 1861 where it began in 1619, at Point Comfort, later called Fort Monroe. Historian Edward L. Ayers sees those 1861 events as "the greatest moment in American history." Henry Louis Gates Jr. says that was when enterprising black "heroes of Freedom's Fort" -- Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory and James Townsend -- forced "the beginning of the end of slavery" by escaping enslavement and seeking freedom at Fort Monroe. Effects cascading from those escapees' initiative eventually involved some half-million self-emancipators. James M. McPherson says a "self-emancipation thesis" dominates historians' understanding of how slavery ended.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, the 1619 Project leader, notes that almost all her contributors are "black, a nonnegotiable aspect of the project." I'm glad the Times published Adam Goodheart, who is white, without applying a racial test. Self-emancipators affirmed America's founding ideas with their feet.

Mr. Woodson's last paragraph says it all: "Black America's history of success and achievement -- and its continuing legacy today -- is a vital, inspiring part of our nation's past. It's sadly overlooked in 'The 1619 Project.' That project also promotes the dangerous idea that the black community is exempt from responsibility to lift itself. To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, some prisons have locks that are on the inside."

Many studies show that African-American immigrants from countries which also had slavery have also had higher rates of entrepreneurship and higher educational achievement when they moved here than African-Americans born in America, despite the latter having access to many social and affirmative-action programs. Many immigrants of all colors have experienced hardships in their former countries, which few born in America in the last 60 years ever have. America is still the prime destination, and people of all colors achieve great things here that they would never achieve anywhere else.
The 1619 Project and the narrative that supports it not only dangerously feeds racial resentment, it also discourages the ambition to succeed for those they purport to help.

Texto completo: Today is Monday,
Sept. 9, the 252nd day of 2019. There are 113 days left in the year.
On this date:
In 1776, the second Continental Congress made the term "United States" official, replacing "United Colonies."
In 1942, during World War II, a Japanese plane launched from a submarine off the Oregon coast dropped a pair of incendiary bombs in a failed attempt at igniting a massive forest fire; it was the first aerial bombing of the U.S. mainland by a foreign power.
In 1971, prisoners seized control of the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility near Buffalo, N.Y., beginning a siege that claimed 43 lives.
In 1986, Frank Reed, director of a private school in Lebanon, was taken hostage; he was released 44 months later.
In 1991, boxer Mike Tyson was indicted in Indianapolis on a charge of raping Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant contestant. (Tyson was convicted and ended up serving three years of a six-year prison sentence.)
In 1997, Sinn Fein (shin fayn), the IRA's political ally, formally renounced violence as it took its place in talks on Northern Ireland's future. Actor Burgess Meredith died in Malibu, California, at age 89.
In 2005, Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown, the principal target of harsh criticism of the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina, was relieved of his onsite command.
In 2013, four days of vehicular gridlock began near the George Washington Bridge when two of three approach lanes from Fort Lee, New Jersey, were blocked off; the traffic jam was later blamed on loyalists to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over the refusal of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (SAHK'-oh-lich) to endorse Christie for re-election. (Christie denied any prior knowledge of the lane closures.)
Ten years ago: In a speech to a joint session of Congress, President Barack Obama summoned lawmakers to enact sweeping health care legislation, declaring the "time for bickering is over." (In an extraordinary breach of congressional decorum, Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., shouted "You lie!" when the president said illegal immigrants would not benefit from his proposals; Wilson ended up apologizing.) British commandos in Afghanistan freed New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell from Taliban captors, but one commando and a Times translator were killed.
Five years ago: President Barack Obama met privately with congressional leaders at the White House to discuss his plan for taking action against Islamic State militants. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown glided to an easy win in the Republican primary for Senate in neighboring New Hampshire (he ended up losing in November to incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (jeen shuh-HEEN'). Apple unveiled its long-anticipated smartwatch as well as the next generation of its iPhone.
One year ago: CBS chief Les Moonves (MOON'-vehz) resigned, hours after six more women accused the veteran television executive of sexual misconduct. Miss New York, Nia Imani Franklin, won the Miss America title, becoming the first woman to win the crown without having to put on a swimsuit. On the NFL's opening Sunday, Dolphins teammates Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson were the only two players to kneel during the national anthem. Novak Djokovic (NOH'-vak JOH'-kuh-vich) won his 14th Grand Slam title, beating Juan Martin del Potro 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 in the U.S. Open final.
Today's Birthdays: Actor Topol is 84. Rhythm-and-blues singer Luther Simmons is 77. Singer Inez Foxx is 77. Singer Dee Dee Sharp is 74.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Three House committees said they are investigating whether President Trump and his lawyer sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue probes in an effort to benefit Mr. Trump's re-election bid.
The House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees sent letters to the White House and State Department on Monday seeking records of interactions between the president and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the Ukrainian government. The committees specifically expressed interest in a July call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as in calls and an in-person meeting between Mr. Giuliani and a top aide to the Ukrainian president.
"As the 2020 election draws closer, President Trump and his personal attorney appear to have increased pressure on the Ukrainian government and its justice system in service of President Trump's reelection campaign, and the White House and the State Department may be abetting this scheme," the chairmen of the committees wrote in letters to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. The State Department referred questions to the White House.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Giuliani said he had sought in the spring to meet with Mr. Zelensky—who was at the time Ukraine's president-elect—and planned a trip to Kiev to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue two investigations: one into whether Ukraine, under its previous leader, had sought in 2016 to hurt the Trump campaign and bolster his opponent; and another into diplomatic efforts in the country by Joe Biden, the former vice president and Democratic presidential front-runner.
Mr. Giuliani's criticism of Mr. Biden centers on the then-vice president's efforts to seek the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group, of which Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, was a board member .
Mr. Giuliani has accused Mr. Biden of acting to protect his son, even though Mr. Shokin had already completed his investigation of Burisma Group before he left office. Mr. Biden has said he sought Mr. Shokin's ouster because he was not doing enough to investigate corruption.
Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor general, told Bloomberg News in May he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son.
"This is beneath us as Americans," a Biden campaign spokesman said of Mr. Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the former vice president.
Mr. Giuliani ultimately canceled his trip to Kiev after news of it was reported by the New York Times. "What I was going to tell him was, we owe it to everyone to get these fully investigated," Mr. Giuliani said. Of Mr. Trump, he added: "It was in the interest of my client that these be fully investigated." Mr. Trump was aware of his planned meeting, he said.
Mr. Giuliani disputed that there was any political motivation for his efforts. "It has nothing to do with taking Biden out as a presidential candidate," he said. "I'm outraged by it as an American citizen." He said he would welcome an investigation into his efforts because it would raise the profile of corruption he says he has uncovered. But he said he would decline an invitation to testify before a "ridiculously hit-job Democratic committee" and would instead hold a news conference in Washington.
Mr. Giuliani said he has spoken on several occasions since the canceled trip with Ukrainians including Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani met Mr. Yermak in Madrid in recent weeks and spoke to him as recently as two weeks ago, he said.
Mr. Yermak was "very receptive," Mr. Giuliani said of their conversation. "He wanted to assure me that President Zelensky was not going to be diverted from doing the right thing and get to the bottom of all this."
Mr. Giuliani said his discussions with Mr. Yermak were arranged in conjunction with the State Department and Kurt Volker, the State Department's special representative for Ukraine negotiations. He said the State Department gave his contact information to Mr. Yermak and briefed the State Department on their conversations.
In their letters to the White House and State Department, the congressional committees sought records related to any discussion of Ukrainian investigations, any communications with or referring to Mr. Giuliani and any documents related to the discussion of the possible suspension of security assistance to Ukraine. The administration in recent weeks has reviewed the status of those funds. Ukraine received $250 million in U.S. military aid this year.
If Mr. Trump "is trying to pressure Ukraine into choosing between defending itself from Russian aggression without U.S. assistance or leveraging its judicial system to serve the ends of the Trump campaign, this would represent a staggering abuse of power," the chairmen of the committees wrote.
The committees also sought a transcript of and records related to a July call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump expressed support for the Ukrainian government investigating corruption cases related to the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, according to Mr. Zelensky's office.
The two leaders haven't met in person. Mr. Trump said last month he would invite Mr. Zelensky to the White House. Both leaders plan to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York City later this month.
"I don't think it would be possible for the president to meet him and not talk about it," Mr. Giuliani said of the investigations he wants Ukraine to pursue. "It's on his mind. He certainly would like the answers."

Robert Woodson and the Legacy of Slavery; How accurate about the black experience in America is the 1619 project?

Texto completo: Regarding Robert L. Woodson's "' The 1619 Project' Hurts Blacks " (op-ed, Aug. 29) criticizing the 1619 Project for refusing to celebrate African-American success: The New York Times series is about slavery, not the African-American experience as a whole. Nothing good came out of slavery. While many African-Americans did achieve success, they did so despite the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow and racism.
When Mr. Woodson references North Carolina's "Black Wall Street," he neglects to mention that the black business district in Tulsa, Okla., was razed by white rioters in 1921. For most of America's history, any African-American success could be erased in a moment by jealous white people protected by the law.
Mr. Woodson should have explained when the effects of slavery became irrelevant. He cannot, because it haunts us to this day. That is why the 1619 Project on slavery is necessary.
Ray Rickman
Providence, R.I.
Enough about the 1619 Project. It isn't true. The year 1619 marks the arrival of the first African slaves in America only if you believe American colonial history began with the English. Spanish coastal settlements in the South predated the English Virginia settlements by almost a century. And yes, the Spanish brought slaves. In his book "Marooned," Joseph Kelly mentions a 1526 Spanish settlement of 500 settlers and 100 African slaves along the Pee Dee River in what is now South Carolina.
North America has a Native-American, Viking, Mexican, French, Dutch, Swedish, Irish and African history, among others, along with the Spanish and English versions. A little perspective would be welcome.
Douglas Sacks
Wethersfield, Conn.
Mr. Woodson charges that the New York Times Sunday magazine's 1619 Project scants black self-determination's "empowering spirit." This calls to mind Adam Goodheart's "How Slavery Really Ended in America" in the Times about an especially consequential story of that spirit. U.S. slavery began to end in 1861 where it began in 1619, at Point Comfort, later called Fort Monroe. Historian Edward L. Ayers sees those 1861 events as "the greatest moment in American history." Henry Louis Gates Jr. says that was when enterprising black "heroes of Freedom's Fort"—Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory and James Townsend—forced "the beginning of the end of slavery" by escaping enslavement and seeking freedom at Fort Monroe. Effects cascading from those escapees' initiative eventually involved some half-million self-emancipators. James M. McPherson says a "self-emancipation thesis" dominates historians' understanding of how slavery ended.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, the 1619 Project leader, notes that almost all her contributors are "black, a nonnegotiable aspect of the project." I'm glad the Times published Adam Goodheart, who is white, without applying a racial test. Self-emancipators affirmed America's founding ideas with their feet.
Steven T. Corneliussen
Poquoson, Va.
Mr. Woodson's last paragraph says it all: "Black America's history of success and achievement—and its continuing legacy today—is a vital, inspiring part of our nation's past. It's sadly overlooked in 'The 1619 Project.' That project also promotes the dangerous idea that the black community is exempt from responsibility to lift itself. To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, some prisons have locks that are on the inside."
John Melangton
Stuart, Fla.
Many studies show that African-American immigrants from countries which also had slavery have also had higher rates of entrepreneurship and higher educational achievement when they moved here than African-Americans born in America, despite the latter having access to many social and affirmative-action programs. Many immigrants of all colors have experienced hardships in their former countries, which few born in America in the last 60 years ever have. America is still the prime destination, and people of all colors achieve great things here that they would never achieve anywhere else.
The 1619 Project and the narrative that supports it not only dangerously feeds racial resentment, it also discourages the ambition to succeed for those they purport to help.

Narratives and the Decline of Fair Coverage; I read the New York Times for over 40 years. In days gone by, the Times kept its opinions on the editorial page.

Texto completo: Holman Jenkins's " The Tragedy of the Times " (Business World, Aug. 24) concentrates on the present day, referring to President Donald Trump and New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet.
I've read the New York Times for over 40 years. In days gone by, the Times kept its opinions on the editorial page. Ted Koppel pointed out that he tried to get a Times reporter on his TV show years ago. Abe Rosenthal, then the executive editor, replied that the reporter could appear but then couldn't return to the Times. Rosenthal didn't want his hard-news reporters answering provocative questions and offering commentary. That was the paper of record.
In 2010 the Times carried a front-page story saying John Boehner took over $300,000 from lobbyists! I was no particular fan of Mr. Boehner's, but the story struck me as a hit piece, and a few minutes of research showed other politicians in both parties took money from lobbyists and other sources which amounted to sums far in excess of that discussed in the article.
I wrote to the Times's public editor pointing out these facts and received a reply saying that he agreed, and that the reporter should have put the issue in context. He didn't say that had the reporter put the issue in context, there would have been no story. Under Rosenthal, a story like that would not have made it into the publication. That was the last issue of the Times received here. The current management has been increasingly happy to act as a newsletter for the true believers. Those can be had online for free.

Texto completo: Earnings season hasn't been kind to media stocks.
Meredith Corp., which owns People, Real Simple and Better Homes & Gardens, is trading near its lowest level in more than six years after reporting quarterly results that sent the stock tumbling 23% Thursday.
Analysts have soured on the stock since Meredith acquired Time Inc., then failed to improve print advertising revenue as quickly as it thought it would at various legacy Time publications. Although shares rebounded 1.5% Monday, they haven't recovered from their earnings-fueled rout.
One reason why: Meredith didn't suggest things are on the upswing. Instead, the company forecast its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would fall somewhere in the range of $640 million to $675 million for the fiscal year ending June 2020—well below analysts' estimates of $800 million.
New York Times Co. also hasn't made up ground following its Aug. 7 earnings report. Shares advanced Monday but are still down roughly 14% from their close the day before the report was released.
The common thread between the two stocks? Dim outlooks. The New York Times's earnings report included a warning that digital advertising revenue would likely decrease by a high-single-digit percentage in the third quarter.
But the Times did offer up a defense for that forecast. Part of the reason digital advertising numbers for the second half of the year might look less robust was because they would face a tough comparison with strong gains from 2018, chief executive officer Mark Thompson said in a statement. That might explain why the Times is still up 38% for the year.

Texto completo: Howard Stern will leave his cozy New York environs for a stint on the West Coast to inaugurate the new SiriusXM Hollywood.
The California branch of SiriusXM/Pandora - located in the Hollywood Media District on Sycamore Avenue -- will open Oct. 7. This is the first time Stern has broadcast from a location other than New York in 15 years and his first from Los Angeles in nearly 20 years.
Earlier this year, Stern released "HowardSternComes Again," a compilation of notable interviews from the show that entered the New York Times Best Seller list at No. 1. Earlier this summer, he mentioned on "The Howard Stern Show" that he was thinking about hitting the West Coast to do another round of press for the book in time for the holiday season.
The weeks leading to Stern's official christening of the new building will include special broadcasts of music performances across several SiriusXM channels from the new Hollywood studio complex and from venues around L.A.
On Wednesday, Carrie Underwood will sit with a studio audience for a town hall hosted by SiriusXM's Jenny McCarthy. Underwood will be joined by Maddie & Tae and Runaway June. It will air live on SiriusXM's The Highway (ch.56) at 4 p.m. and will rebroadcast on SiriusXM Stars (ch. 109) on Sept. 14 at 2 p.m.
OnThursday, DaveMatthews will perform an intimate acoustic set for SiriusXM subscribers at The Garage performance space in the new L.A. digs. It will air at 8 p.m. on Dave Matthews Band Radio (ch. 30).
And Sept. 18 will bring Billie Eilish - a few days removed from her set at Music Midtown - to The Troubadour, where she will perform songs from her debut album, "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" The show will air live on SiriusXM's Alt Nation (ch. 36) at 11 p.m.

Texto completo: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — The director of a prestigious research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology resigned Saturday, and the school’s president ordered an independent investigation amid an uproar over the lab’s ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Joi Ito, director of MIT’s Media Lab, resigned from both the lab and from his position as a professor at the Cambridge school, university President L. Rafael Reif said. The resignation was first reported by The New York Times.
Ito’s resignation comes after The New Yorker reported late Friday that Media Lab had a more extensive fundraising relationship with Epstein than it previously acknowledged and tried to conceal the extent of the relationship.
Epstein killed himself in jail Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Federal prosecutors in New York had charged the 66-year-old with sex trafficking and conspiracy, alleging he sexually abused girls over several years in the early 2000s.
In a letter to the MIT community Saturday, Reif called the allegations in The New Yorker “deeply disturbing.”
“Because the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation,” Reif wrote. “This morning, I asked MIT’s General Counsel to engage a prominent law firm to design and conduct this process.”
Reif said last month that the university took about $800,000 from Epstein over 20 years. That announcement followed the resignation of two prominent researchers from Media Lab over revelations the lab and Ito took money from Epstein after he served time a decade ago for sex offenses involving underage girls
The New Yorker reports Epstein arranged at least $7.5 million in donations, including $2 million from Microsoft founder Bill Gates and $5.5 million from investor Leon Black.
Although MIT listed Epstein as “disqualified’ in its donor database, the Media Lab did not stop taking gifts from him and labeled his donations as anonymous, The New Yorker reported, citing emails and other documents it obtained.
Last week, Ito said Epstein gave him $525,000 for the Media Lab and another $1.2 million for his own investment funds.
Epstein’s July 6 arrest drew national attention, particularly focusing on a deal that allowed him to plead guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and avoid more serious federal charges.
Epstein was a wealth manager who hobnobbed with the rich, famous and influential, including presidents and a prince.
He owned a private island in the Caribbean, homes in Palm Beach, Paris and New York City, a New Mexico ranch and a fleet of high-price cars.
Phone and email messages seeking comment were left for Ito and Media Lab representatives Saturday.

Burning Questions About the Amazon Fires; Many of the blazes are occurring on land without clear title or private ownership.

Texto completo: Hurricane season is upon us, so the media hysteria surrounding fires in the Amazon has moved off the front page. The world is still coming to an end in a decade or so, according to some environmentalists. But now it's warming seas rather than jungle infernos that we need to obsess about.
This apocalyptic flavor-of-the-month routine is regrettable, and not only because so many untruths are never corrected. It also wastes an opportunity for learning. In this case, early evidence suggests it's worth exploring the link between private property rights and responsible conservation in the Amazon—quite the opposite of what you might have gleaned from most press reports.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is a polarizing figure, and many in the media don't like him. Fair enough. But Brazil is a democracy, and after some 13 years of Workers' Party socialism and corruption, last year Brazilians asked for a change. Bolsonaro derangement syndrome doesn't hold the president accountable. It only deepens the visceral Brazilian divide.
Mr. Bolsonaro has shown disdain for policies aimed at walling off the Amazon from humans. So perhaps it isn't surprising that much of the data deployed by journalists to tell the story of the fires have been cherry-picked to make him look like an environmental villain. "Satellite data shows Amazon rainforest burning at record rates," United Press International shouted on Aug. 21. But the story seems to have made selective use of data collected daily by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research.
As of Saturday the data show that there have been 69,565 fires in Brazil's "legal Amazon"—which includes savanna—so far this year, up 59% from the like period last year. But the number of fires during the like period in each year from 2002-07 was significantly higher. For 2010, the last year of left-wing President Lula da Silva's eight years in office, the comparable number is 109,940 fires, a jump of 261% from the preceding year. The media never blinked. In fact, on Dec. 1, 2010, despite what had occurred in fire season, the BBC reported "Brazil: Amazon deforestation falls to new low."
The institute counted 97,972 fires in all of Brazil this year—not only the Amazon—up 51% from the preceding year. That sounds dire, but in 2010 there were 158,258 fires during the like period, an increase of 195% from 2009.
Photos of charred trees hype the media spin. Yet an Aug. 24 New York Times report on "scientists studying satellite image data" found that "most of the fires are burning on agricultural land where the forest had already been cleared" and "were likely set by farmers preparing land for the planting season."
NASA's Earth Observatory website says fire in the Amazon "typically increases due to the arrival of the dry season. Many people use fire to maintain farmland and pastures or to clear land for other purposes." There also has been drought in the south of the continent, raising fire hazards there.
Yet it isn't clear that the Amazon is experiencing anything historic, according to NASA's Earth Observatory: "As of August 16, 2019, an analysis of NASA satellite data indicated that total fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been close to the average in comparison to the past 15 years . . . Though activity appears to be above average in the states of Amazonas and Rondônia, it has so far appeared below average in Mato Grosso and Pará, according to estimates from the Global Fire Emissions Database, a research project that compiles and analyzes NASA data." The page was updated Aug. 22. In a separate post the site said the fire activity is the highest since 2010.
In August 2016 Reuters reported on a study by the nonprofit Climate Policy Initiative that linked the absence of land titles in the Amazon to conflict and environmental degradation. "Without clear titles proving land ownership, farmers have less incentive to make new investments, improve productivity or protect the environment, said the CPI, a San Francisco-based group with operations in Rio de Janeiro," Reuters wrote.
No one knows exactly how much of the actual forest destruction has been on land that isn't private property. But it may be a lot.
Brazil's Ministry of the Environment compiles fire data, largely from the states. The ministry told me last week that from these data it estimates that 51% of the fires occurred on property with no title and no owner. Another 14% occurred on land that has been "donated" to the landless peasant movement known by the initials MST, and 13% were in conservation areas or on indigenous lands. Only 22% of the fires occurred on registered property.
This suggests that much of the destruction took place where there was no economic incentive to protect the forest because there is no private ownership. For those who actually care about the Amazon and aren't simply trying to score points against Mr. Bolsonaro, this is a trail worth following.

"The acceptance of the Epstein gifts involved a mistake of judgment," Mr. Reif wrote in his letter. "We are actively assessing how best to improve our policies, processes and procedures to fully reflect MIT's values and prevent such mistakes in the future."

Texto completo: CNN's seven-hour climate town hall with the Democratic presidential candidates was the ratings bomb you expected, and no wonder since there was little debate. If it was unwatchable, though, it wasn't unwatchable enough for some. The Columbia Journalism Review's "public editor for CNN," Emily Tamkin, beforehand insisted that moderators should proceed "on the assumption that the climate is in crisis," and limit themselves to calling for action and faulting inaction.
In other words, make it an exercise in liturgy, not inquiry, as well as a repetition of the most failed experiment in history: trying to bully viewers into accepting predictions of a pending climate disaster.
All this comes as the sixth "assessment report" of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, still two years off, is likely to offer nothing new on the vexed, contentious 40-year-old stalemate over how much warming actually can be expected from a given amount of CO2.
It comes just days after the shocking suicide of Harvard climate economist Martin Weitzman, rightly praised in obituaries for an insight lacking in the CNN town hall: A climate disaster is far from guaranteed. It's the low but not insignificant chance of a "fat tail" worst-case disaster that we should worry about. (Mr. Weitzman put the odds at 3% to 10%.)
It comes as Weitzman's student, collaborator and co-author, Gernot Wagner, tellingly has focused his attention lately on geoengineering rather than the seemingly lost cause of carbon reduction.
Words hardly serve to describe the mediocrity of climate journalism, including CNN's. But at least Elizabeth Warren had an interesting moment when she admonished a network personality for trying to rile up viewers "around your light bulbs, around your straws and around your cheeseburgers."
She might also have mentioned electric cars as another distraction, like all of the above promoted by greens themselves to fill a need for policy "victories" no matter how trivial in relation to an alleged climate problem.
As the New York Times also noted, "For the first time, Ms. Warren explicitly embraced a carbon tax before quickly pivoting away . . ."
What's Ms. Warren afraid of? A carbon tax would hardly be prohibitive. Weitzman advocated $40 a ton -- the equivalent of 36 cents per gallon of gasoline. Such a tax could be implemented without raising the overall tax burden; it could be used to trim taxes on work, saving and investment, improving the economy overall. It could be embraced and copied by other nations out of self-interest rather than self-abnegation (unlike the absurd Green New Deal).
How did such a modest and potentially beneficial adjustment to the tax code become virtually undiscussable?
The blame obviously can't be laid entirely at the feet of climate press. There is much else going on, in which journalists are but lockstep automatons. And here it is: With their decision to resort to a strategy of hysterical exaggerations, vilifications and hackneyed partisanship, the greens have now succeeded in convincing voting publics that any climate strategy must be catastrophic to their lifestyles, transferring trillions from their pockets to green special interests.
Worse, voters are right. Many climate campaigners are more interested in social revolution than in climate science. Some are more interested in expressing their craving for humanity's death and engaging in apocalyptic playacting than in improving the human condition.
So to answer CNN's non-debate and the worries of the late Prof. Weitzman, if the small but not negligible chance of a climate catastrophe is borne out, we already know what the answer is going to be: to throw a bunch of particles into the atmosphere, at a cost of perhaps $2 billion a year, in order to block the estimated 1% of sunlight necessary to keep earth's temperature in check.
And everybody across the scientific spectrum understands this is where we are headed. How this reality could go unmentioned in seven hours on CNN is explicable only by the debate not being a debate.
One more point: When and if the IPCC resolves its manifest struggles over climate sensitivity (i.e., how much warming can be expected), the result will necessarily be to reduce uncertainty regarding the great chemistry experiment in the atmosphere. Therefore it will reduce, or at least reframe, the fat-tail risk that Weitzman's followers worry about today, which is largely a product of unresolved and proliferating uncertainties in today's highly inadequate climate models.

Texto completo: The world according to Jim (aka the ultimate Twitter thread, with everything in 280 characters or less):
• Going into Friday, the Dodgers had slugged an NL-record 250 home runs. The jewelers sponsoring the radio broadcasts give out a free bracelet for each homer. Have they run out of precious metals yet?
• So, when will they install the Dodger Stadium humidor?
• Sad to report that the Giants make their final visit to The Ravine this weekend and Madison Bumgarner isn’t scheduled to pitch. Like him or dislike him, the electricity when he faces the Dodgers is always fun.
• Then again, his favorite foils aren’t there. Max Muncy is hurt and Yasiel Puig is in Cleveland. But trust me: He’d find somebody else to annoy, or more accurately be annoyed by.
• It’s also the final visit to L.A. for Bruce Bochy as Giants manager. He may represent the enemy, Dodger fans, but he deserves your respect as the last of a managerial breed.
• There was angst here in 2017 when the Dodgers lost 11 straight and 16 of 17 and had their division lead shrink from 21 games to 9 in early September. Yet they reached Game 7 of the World Series. Are Dodger fans even more touchy now, fearful of more postseason doom?
• The boos Kenley Jansen hears from the home crowd every time he gives up a hit or walk should be a clue.
• But here’s another reminder: Every fan base in baseball hates its bullpen. (As this week’s Exhibit A, I give you the Mets.)
• Before Dave Roberts opted to skip Hyun-Jin Ryu’s turn next week, I suggested Ryu should come down with another convenient neck inflammation, the Dodgers’ all purpose injured list malady. His fatigue was that evident.
• Come to think of it, isn’t Kenley’s neck a little sore, too? (You know, whiplash from watching the ball fly over the fence.)
• Suggested reading, if you haven’t gotten to it already: “K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,” by New York Times national baseball writer Tyler Kepner (who was, incidentally, a former Angels beat writer for The Press-Enterprise way back in the day).
• And a tip: When reading it, have a baseball nearby so you can fiddle with the grips he describes.
• Last week’s close USC victory over Fresno State shouldn’t have been that much of a surprise. Fresno State under Jeff Tedford is one of those Group of Five teams that deserves more recognition than it gets.
• They are the kind of program, in other words, that I’ve ranked above name schools as an AP Top 25 voter. (Which is part of why I’m no longer an AP Top 25 voter. I got tired of the weekly whining from fans of Power Five conference schools.)
• But this week it’s serious for the Trojans, and against Stanford we will discover a whole lot more about freshman Kedon Slovis. (It may be a little bit fairer fight with the Cardinal’s KJ Costello out, though replacement Davis Mills is a 20-year-old junior.)
• What was worse last week? The USC students with chests painted to spell “Fight On,” only the “G” was missing when the cameras found them? Or ESPN’s Rod Gilmore using the telestrator to illustrate where the “G” was supposed to go and botching it?
• FIHGT ON, indeed.
• UCLA has enough trouble selling football tickets. I’m not sure it helped that Saturday’s opponent at the Rose Bowl, San Diego State, beat Weber State 6-0 last week. Large multitudes may have decided to skip this one.
• Crowd counts aren’t always an accurate reflection, since college football attendance is down almost everywhere (even the SEC). But with UCLA, a continued lag in wins and customers might call the whole Chip Kelly Experiment into question.
• It was apparent all summer that Melvin Gordon had no leverage in his quest for a contract extension with the Chargers. Does he realize yet he’s tangling with the wrong organization when it comes to stubbornness?
• This, from the Rams’ Eric Weddle the other day about the Jared Goff extension: “It sets the standard that if you do things right on and off the field and you play at a high level, they’re gonna reward you.”
• He didn’t specifically reference Dean Spanos. But to anyone who remembers the events leading to Weddle leaving the Chargers after the 2015 season, the linkage was obvious.
• Remember when Southern California had its own wing of the Broadcasting Hall of Fame? Vin Scully, Chick Hearn, Dick Enberg and Bob Miller were quite a Mt. Rushmore, and Ralph Lawler made it a starting five.
• We could have four from the next generation, too: Joe Davis (Dodgers TV), Alex Faust (Kings TV), J.B. Long (Rams radio) and Brian Sieman (Clippers TV). (Sieman, the Clippers’ radio voice since ’07, would be the elder statesman of the group.)
• Davis and Orel Hershiser are really fun to listen to – but when Orel says “we,” “our,” and “us,” This Space cringes. Even on a (limited distribution) team-controlled channel, homer broadcasts just don’t go over well in the nation’s No. 2 market.
• Bottom line: What would Vin do?
• If you missed it, and you probably did, the Sparks clinched the third seed and a first-round playoff bye Thursday night. There are a lot of things with the WNBA that need fixing, but the quality of basketball absolutely is not one of them.

Progressives Keep Calm in the Trump Era

Texto completo: Many presidents provoke personal animus beyond opposition to their policies. Ronald Reagan inspired angry punk songs. George W. Bush drove Democrats to distraction. (I still occasionally contribute to a Bush-era website called Smirking Chimp.) Bill Clinton and Barack Obama each evoked conspiracy theories on the far right.
Trump derangement syndrome is therefore familiar. But it's also different in an important respect: While it's epidemic among centrist Democrats, most progressives are immune.
"Re-electing Donald Trump would take us into a dangerous moral direction from which it will take a wrenching turn to get us back," insists MSNBC's Chris Matthews, who once worked for Speaker Tip O'Neill. "Instead of delivering us from evil, it will deliver us to evil." New York Times columnist Charles Blow issued this histrionic call for impeachment: "Trump has dragged this country into the gutter, and his targets have no choice but to get in the gutter with him and slug it out." If Mr. Blow isn't your idea of a centrist, consider that in 2016 he blithely dismissed Bernie Sanders's challenge to Hillary Clinton: "Sometimes you have to cut deals to reach ideals. That's politics."
Sure, progressives oppose Mr. Trump, but we're calm about it -- enough so that many of us never got caught up in the phony scandal of Russian collusion. "It's Safe to Impeach Donald Trump," the Nation matter-of-factly proclaimed last month.
When moderate Democrats complain about Mr. Trump's "radicalism," progressives stop listening. That's partly because there's a bit of ideological overlap between the leftist antiglobalization movement and the president's economic nationalism and skepticism about military intervention. But for the most part our views are at odds with his: We want single-payer health care, more-powerful unions, higher wages and stronger regulation. Progressives don't think a moderate like Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg would be enough of an improvement.
Besides, from a progressive standpoint other presidents of both parties have been worse than Mr. Trump. George W. Bush and Barack Obama transferred trillions of dollars to Wall Street in 2008-09 while distressed homeowners and the unemployed twisted in the wind. Mr. Obama expanded Mr. Bush's program of political assassinations using unmanned drones. Mr. Bush effectively legalized torture and ginned up the invasion of Iraq. Bill Clinton refused to resign after he got caught having sex in the Oval Office with an intern. None of Mr. Trump's military actions, cronyism or scandals come close.
So why the overwrought reaction to him? What really separates Mr. Trump from predecessors is his style: the campaign-style rallies centered on his freewheeling, trash-talking monologues; his trolling of rivals on Twitter; his gleeful refusal to stop making inflammatory statements.
Moderates mistake tone for content. It goes with their identity-politics obsession, in which words matter more than substance. Mr. Trump's manner is over-the-top, masculine and hyperaggressive. He loves racially coded language. He's not all that conservative, but he sounds like a right-wing demagogue. That's what's freaking centrists out.
It still matters when the president says something, even on Twitter at 3 a.m. But progressives care too much about ideas to take it all that seriously.

Texto completo: Tough Luck
By R.D. Rosen
(Atlantic Monthly, 306 pages, $27)
On a February day in 1936, a Brooklyn, N.Y., jury found Meyer Luckman, a trucking-company owner, guilty of second-degree murder. Luckman had been accused of participating in a particularly grisly crime -- the beating death of his wife's brother, apparently for embezzling from the family company. Sitting in the courtroom that day, just behind Luckman, was his son Sid, a student celebrated on the sports pages in New York for his feats as a high-school tailback.
The New York Times wrote that Sid Luckman, together with his mother and siblings, retained his composure as the verdict was read. The young athlete would go on to shine at Columbia University and help revolutionize professional football as the star quarterback of the Chicago Bears. But, as R.D. Rosen writes in "Tough Luck: Sid Luckman, Murder, Inc., and the Rise of the Modern NFL," "not once, from the late 1930s on, did any reporter, in the sports or any other department, refer to Sid Luckman as the son of a convicted murderer."
One of the pleasures of this biography is its salting with quaint details of American life from not so long ago. Of course, most of these focus on football: the days before stadium phones, when a coach high in the stands would wrap a note around a rock and heave it down to his team; the Bears' offensive end Dick Plasman, still playing, in the early 1940s, without a helmet; some 15,000 fans attending a high-school football game in Ebbets Field, outdrawing the pro teams that played there that same month.
But nothing seems more anomalous -- particularly in this tell-all age -- than the media discretion about Sid Luckman's dad. It's enough to give a modern-day journalist pause: Have we lost something or made progress? We've certainly missed the chance to explore how growing up with a man capable of such violence influenced the young athlete. The author does his best to glean what can be learned, but records and recollections offer little. The father enjoyed football and took great pride in his son, even sitting with the team on the sideline as the younger Luckman's running, passing and punting for Erasmus Hall High School shredded his opponents.
But by the time Sid led Columbia to its improbable victory over Army and made the cover of the Oct. 24, 1938, issue of Life magazine, the elder Luckman was already up the Hudson River at Sing Sing prison. The younger Luckman didn't talk about the conviction, and in a 1949 autobiography he sanitized the brief mentions of his father. Sid Luckman's own son knew little about his criminal grandfather until he learned about him from Mr. Rosen.
The family, originally Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, had settled in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood. The book glancingly refers to the anti-Semitism that Sid Luckman faced in his athletic career -- he was one of the few Jewish players in the NFL -- but in general the role of religion in his life rarely comes up. Yiddish, though, provides one of the book's sweetest anecdotes. Luckman's mother, Ethel, had always abhorred football for its brutality and refused to watch her son's games. On Sid Luckman Day at New York's Polo Grounds in 1943, however, when the Bears played the Giants, Luckman finally convinced his mother to attend. The Bears ran away with the game, silencing the Giants fans, but once, when Luckman dropped back to pass, his protection broke down and several massive Giants linemen chased after him. His mom's shouts carried over the quiet stands: "Sideleh! Sideleh! Gebn zey di pilke, Sideleh! Give them the ball, Sidney! You're going to get hurt!"
Mr. Rosen invests considerable effort to link Luckman's father to one of the most infamous Jewish gangsters of the era, Louis "Lepke" Buchalter, said to be the author of 70 murders and the one-time head of the kill-for-hire operation known as Murder, Inc. Soft-spoken and unassuming, Buchalter applied his ruthless skills to build a labor-racketeering empire and, by Mr. Rosen's account, had an ally in Meyer Luckman. Buchalter and the elder Luckman apparently weren't close associates, however, and Mr. Rosen acknowledges that Luckman was no more than a "reliable cog" in Buchalter's "finely tuned machine."
The murder that sent Luckman away grew out of an entirely different matter. As Mr. Rosen puts it, "stealing from one's own was a capital offense" in Luckman's world. Ethel Luckman never spoke to her husband again after his conviction. When he died of heart failure at Sing Sing in 1944, the story made the New York newspapers, but none made any mention of the famous football player who survived him.
Mr. Rosen suggests that the younger Luckman may have found a father-substitute in the Bears' owner and coach, George Halas, known admiringly in Chicago as "Papa Bear." Halas spotted the young man's talent when Luckman was playing for Columbia, and together they pioneered the T-formation and the forward pass, turning football toward the game we know today. The Bears dominated the NFL in the 1940s -- appearing in five championship games and winning four. The coach and his star would go on to develop a close lifelong bond.
After Luckman's football career ended following the 1950 season -- he is considered by far the best quarterback the Bears have ever fielded -- he went on to successes as a salesman, business executive and investor. He also practiced astonishing generosity, continually lavishing money, gifts and favors on everyone from friends to random acquaintances. Compensation for his father's sins? "Virtuous acts became second nature to Sid," Mr. Rosen writes, "every bighearted gesture perhaps expunging a little more of his family's shame."
Given the link to organized crime that touched his family, Luckman was oddly casual over the years about befriending questionable figures in Chicago, which featured its own rich portfolio of mobsters. But the man who could erase his father's terrible crime apparently assumed that the stains of others would never tarnish him. And, indeed, they didn't. Widely admired in Chicago, he lived a long and seemingly happy life, dying in 1998 at the age of 81. His gravestone in Skokie, Ill., reads, "I had it all. I did it all. I loved it all."

Texto completo: What Prof. Wilfred M. McClay calls "aggressive historical simplification" seems to infect his own perspective when he states that there is a single-minded historical thinking that "rules American college campuses" ("The Weaponization of History," op-ed, Aug. 26). Nothing rules, despite what he thinks.
I agree with his opinion that nothing is gained by whitewashing murals or history. But he might agree that what passed for the history of his Oklahoma in public schools and college campuses in the 1940s and '50s needed some updating. We are a complicated nation that has a great many contradictions in our historical DNA. What's happened in the teaching of history over the past 50 years had to be done. We needed less hagiography, and more facts. No one should sandblast Theodore Roosevelt from Mount Rushmore, as long we understand his bigotry, or eliminate Woodrow Wilson's name from Princeton, even if he honored "The Birth of a Nation" by making it the first motion picture shown at the White House.

Mr. McClay is correct in terming it "patent idiocy" for the San Francisco School Board to paint over a mural depicting the life of George Washington. The intended expenditure for this bureaucratic vandalism is also "patent idiocy." The cost is at least $600,000. That comes to $375 a square foot, at least 50 times the reasonable cost. Apparently half of this money will be spent on an environmental-impact report. The board also expects to incur high legal costs to defend the inevitable lawsuits over the destruction.
In fairness to the school board, it has had second thoughts and is now considering covering the mural with panels at an estimated $825,000, or obscuring it with curtains, at a mere $375,000.

History necessarily requires some interpretation of facts. Accordingly, clarity of purpose provides better history than pretensions of neutrality.
In addressing the New York Times "1619 Project," which argues "that nearly everything that has made America exceptional grew out of slavery," Prof. McClay could have noted how free labor and free enterprise had given the pre-Civil War North an immensely stronger economy than the slaveholding South. This enabled Union armies to defeat the Confederacy. The resulting eradication of slavery -- an age-old institution imported from the Old World -- was an exceptional achievement brought about through an enormous cost in lives. Obviously, this economic, military and political achievement grew not out of slavery but out of an ethic of freedom that found slavery repugnant.

I am a retired community-college history instructor, and a number of years ago I proposed to teach a class on the history of the American presidency. In no uncertain terms, I was informed that such a class had no bearing on current events because the presidents were white and, therefore, not concerned about "social and racial justice." This is an example of the "patent idiocy" referred to by Prof. McClay that characterizes much of the administrative mind-set in many community colleges.

Mr. McClay doesn't realize the great benefit conferred by the San Francisco School Board's action. Let them cover it! For too long students, parents and most of us have been deprived of exposure to the conditions created by the totalitarian mind.
Unknown to most of us are banning and burning dissident publications, re-education camps, government-owned media and entertainment and many other of the comprehensive methods of total government.
Let the board members go to Hong Kong to see the people demonstrating against the increasing influence of the Chinese dragon -- which burns more than books.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE FRONT RUNNER (2018) 5:20 p.m. on Starz. About a year after playing P.T. Barnum in "The Greatest Showman," Hugh Jackman starred in this drama, which effectively posits that the former Senator Gary Hart's 1987 presidential campaign was brought down by a media circus. Directed by Jason Reitman, the movie casts Jackman as Hart. It focuses on a period of weeks that begin with Hart being widely considered the most likely candidate for the Democratic nomination, and ends with the politician suspending his campaign after it is overcome by rumors of extramarital activities. The film "belongs to the accusatory tradition of 'Ace in the Hole,' 'Network' and 'Absence of Malice,' movies that see reporters and editors not as guardians of democracy but as barbarians inside the gates of the republic, subverting its values through cynicism, self-importance and mercenary scandal-mongering," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "Reitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion," he added. "But after a while, once we've met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play."
THE EMOJI MOVIE (2017) 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on FX. If you missed Patrick Stewart's vocal performance as an anthropomorphic, feces-shaped emoji named Poop in this animated family movie, tonight is, for better or worse, a chance to change that. The story here -- about a "meh" emoji named Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller) who is facing deletion from the phone he lives in because of his ability to express himself beyond his assigned emotion -- didn't do anything to prevent the film from becoming a notorious bomb with critics. But you'd be hard pressed to find a more 2010s movie.
What's Streaming
SUPER SIZE ME (2004) Stream on Amazon, Tubi, Vudu and YouTube; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and Vudu. The filmmaker Morgan Spurlock is back in theaters this weekend with "Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!" Fifteen years ago, he got famous by eating burgers in this Oscar-nominated documentary, which begins with a simple question: What would happen to somebody if they ate only McDonald's meals for a month? The way Spurlock answered that hypothetical was to make it a reality for himself. In the process, he made a lasting contribution to conversations about American health and obesity.
THE TERMINATOR (1984) Stream on Tubi and YouTube; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "I was going to be a Shakespearean actress," Linda Hamilton recently told The Times. "With 'Terminator,' it all took a left turn." Those eager to see Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger reunite onscreen this fall in "Terminator: Dark Fate" can stream this first installment for free on multiple platforms. The movie introduced audiences to the titular android played by Schwarzenegger, who travels back in time from 2029 to 1980s Los Angeles, where he sets out to kill Hamilton's Sarah Connor.

Texto completo: Uber founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick was kicked out of his own company in 2017 after a yearlong scandal storm, touching on everything from sexual harassment to workplace discrimination. But life has been good since he walked away with his Uber stock and cash worth billions of dollars.
Last month, Kalanick, who is now a venture capitalist and startup CEO all over again, splurged a whopping $36.5 million on a luxurious penthouse in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood. It was the most expensive home sold in New York in August, according to The New York Times ‘ review of property transaction records.
SEE ALSO: The 7 Biggest Winners of Uber’s Blockbuster IPO
The building housing Kalanick’s new home, 565 Broome SoHo, was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Renzo Piano in 2015. It’s the tallest building in SoHo.
Kalanick’s penthouse spans 6,655 square feet on the 30th floor of the building, featuring four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms, expansive living and dining spaces with ample floor-to-ceiling windows, plus an extra 3,400 square feet of outdoor space, including a rooftop heated pool with a panoramic view of Manhattan, according to the listing with Douglas Elliman Real Estate.
It’s an expensive home to maintain, too. Per Douglas Elliman, the penthouse’s monthly property tax bill and maintenance fee totals at just above $25,000.
Yet, it all seems fitting for Kalanick’s subtle obsession with real estate.
Shortly after leaving Uber in late 2017, Kalanick launched a venture capital firm called 10100, which was reportedly named after his childhood home address in Northridge, California.
Then, in March 2018, he announced that he’d taken another new job as the CEO of City Storage System, a Los Angeles-based real estate startup company that repurposes distressed properties, like abandoned parking lots and strip malls, into new commercial spaces.
Kalanick founded Uber in 2009 and served as the company’s first CEO until 2017. When leaving the company, he cashed out about 30 percent of his Uber equities for $1.4 billion as part of the exit agreement with Uber’s board. The stock sale reduced his total Uber ownership from 10% to 7%, which was estimated to worth more than $9 billion at the time of Uber’s IPO in April.

In no uncertain terms, I was informed that such a class had no bearing on current events because the presidents were white and, therefore, not concerned about "social and racial justice." This is an example of the "patent idiocy" referred to by Prof. McClay that characterizes much of the administrative mind-set in many community colleges.

Mr. McClay doesn't realize the great benefit conferred by the San Francisco School Board's action. Let them cover it! For too long students, parents and most of us have been deprived of exposure to the conditions created by the totalitarian mind.
Unknown to most of us are banning and burning dissident publications, re-education camps, government-owned media and entertainment and many other of the comprehensive methods of total government.
Let the board members go to Hong Kong to see the people demonstrating against the increasing influence of the Chinese dragon—which burns more than books.

Texto completo: This fall a potential silver lining to Washington's polarized politics is that it may prevent lawmakers from getting things done. Specifically, soured relations between the White House and the House leadership could prevent or at least delay the next big Beltway spending splurge.
"As Congress returns for the fall, President Trump and congressional Democrats remain stalemated over moving forward on a large infrastructure package," reports Likhitha Butchireddygari in the Journal.
Ms. Butchireddygari adds:
Current infrastructure funding doesn't run out for another year, so the parties have some time. The Senate may take action this fall on the latest attempt to pass an infrastructure measure, but its fate remains unclear as lawmakers struggle to figure out how to pay for it.
The Senate Environment and Public Works committee in July unanimously approved a bipartisan funding bill for $287 billion for road projects, which the American Society of Civil Engineers says is a 27% increase from current funding levels but not to the level of a large infrastructure package Mr. Trump has promised....
Some bridges and roads are surely in need of repair. But grand federal plans sold to the public in the name of "infrastructure" have an ugly history of misallocated resources. Many of the congressional Democrats who would cut a new deal with President Trump are the same people who worked with then-President Barack Obama ten years ago to create an $840 billion stimulus program. After much talk of "shovel-ready projects," 90% of the money ended up going to things other than infrastructure. Unworthy recipients of federal funds included alternative-energy boondoggles like Solyndra.
Now taxpayers must hold out hope that the bitter unwillingness of House Democrats to accept the results of the 2016 election can help scotch another grand spending bargain. Ms. Butchireddygari adds in the Journal:
On the 2016 campaign trail, Mr. Trump called for a $1 trillion investment in U.S. roads and bridges, but his attempts to deliver that package have hit roadblocks. Mr. Trump's plan for $200 billion in federal funds for infrastructure gained no traction in Congress in 2018. Earlier this year, the president met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and roughed out an agreement for a $2 trillion infrastructure package, though the source of the necessary capital was still up in the air.
A few weeks later, the deal fell apart, when a second meeting with Democratic leaders ended abruptly after the president said he wouldn't work with Democrats while the congressional Russia investigations continue. Those probes continue, and the White House says Mr. Trump is still committed to getting an infrastructure measure turned into law.
Mr. Trump's commitment has to be concerning to taxpayers, who can't be feeling optimistic after last month's bipartisan agreement to break federal budget caps enacted in 2011.
The Congressional Budget Office recently noted that federal spending, already at record levels, will consume a larger share of the economy going forward. "In 2019, CBO estimates, outlays will total $4.4 trillion, or 20.8 percent of GDP." This is already above the average of the last half-century, and CBO figures that federal spending's share of the economy will surge again to 23% by 2029.
Now we have a potential infrastructure deal with the President. This column has never thought much of the anti-Trump "resistance." But this could be their finest hour.

The bootleggers and Baptists strike again

Texto completo: President Trump’s efforts to lighten the load of federal regulation felt by American industry has reached a “strange bedfellows” resistance point. “Bootleggers and Baptists” (interest groups that support the same regulation for entirely different reasons) are beginning to raise a ruckus. In this case, major oil companies and leading environmental groups alike are saying, “Enough, already. We want enforcement of the costly rules that are currently on the books.”
That theory also helps explain why America winds up with expensive, process-oriented regulations — like technology-based rules that strongly favor larger, richer firms — instead of outcome-focused regulations that inspire new and different ways to accomplish a regulatory goal.
As one New York Times writer put it: “The [regulatory] rollback plan is particularly notable because major energy companies have, in fact, spoken out against it—joining automakers, electric utilities and other industrial giants that have opposed other administration initiatives to dismantle climate-change and environmental rules.”
The case in point is the recently announced plan to sharply modify the EPA’s technology-based methane gas rule requiring drillers of gas and oil to capture emissions rather than allow them to escape into the environment.
Methane is a greenhouse gas that may affect global climate change. It is also costly to control, especially for smaller gas producers. Industry members who favor eliminating the rule point out that methane gas is valuable and, accordingly, they have an incentive to capture the gas. Those who favor keeping the rule argue that smaller producers have not kept up technically and that, either way, the risk to climate change is unusually large.
Perhaps eager to raise their smaller rivals’ costs, the major oil companies play the bootlegger role in this story. They have a similar incentive to that of the backyard distiller who wins customers when his county cracks down on legal liquor sales.
Environmental groups, who point to protecting the moral high ground, are the “Baptists” with the more straightforward motivations. In this rendering, the oil companies also have donned Baptist slippers, arguing that they wish to preserve the clean image now enjoyed by their natural gas product.
Whether they succeed together at derailing the Trump administration’s slow-rolling deregulatory locomotive remains to be seen. Finalization of the rule change will require perhaps a yearlong regulatory procedure.
It’s important to recognize that the Bootlegger-Baptist regulation theory also offers an explanation of why particular federal rules have certain features. In the methane case, as well as with other air and water pollution control rules, the regulations often require the installation of costly technologies, equipment that in many cases is already being used by larger and newer industry operators. Thus, the rules sometimes impose no new cost on larger firms, but raise the costs of smaller competitors.
It is noteworthy that the EPA is instructed by Congress to apply technology-based rules and not allowed to use performance standards, which would allow polluters to clean up in any way they desired so long as they achieve an objective environmental goal. Performance standards do not reliably cartelize an industry as technology-based standards do.
So far, the Trump administration has made unusually large strides in slowing the Federal Register's printing press and eliminating multiple existing rules for each new rule added. But the efforts of the administration’s first few years involved grabbing low-hanging fruit, which means rules that are no longer especially valuable to either bootleggers or Baptists. Things get harder when that fruit is gone.
The methane rule change will ultimately become a test case decided by the courts. Meanwhile, the bootleggers are harmonizing with the Baptists.

He is a distinguished adjunct fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and dean emeritus of the Clemson University College of Business & Behavioral Science. He developed the "Bootleggers and Baptists" political model.

Alexander: From Clippers beat to Curt Gowdy Award – it’s Marc Stein’s story, too

Texto completo: Maybe it was the consequence of covering all of those Clippers teams during the bad years, the years of losses, holdouts, coaching changes and the recently fired having to sue Donald Sterling to get their guaranteed contracts paid off. Maybe, if you covered enough of those lean years, you picked up the reporting chops to earn Hall of Fame recognition.
Marc Stein landed on the Clippers beat for the L.A. Daily News in February of 1994, just 10 days before the team traded Danny Manning – the No. 1 overall pick just five seasons before – to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins, then on the downside of his own magnificent career.
“I just thought I was the luckiest person in the world,” he said. “They weren’t anywhere near a marquee attraction, but I got thrown into it. … Bob Weiss was the coach, and they were supposed to be a playoff team because they’d made the playoffs the previous two years (under Larry Brown). But they just imploded. They traded Manning, finished 27-55, traded Mark Jackson. It was a really chaotic season.
“But for me, as a child of the ’80s, when the NBA was not on every channel, obviously I’d see a lot of the Lakers but I also saw a lot of the Hawks because they were on TBS. So for me to be covering Dominique at age 24, and to go to the (Atlanta) Omni and see Dominique lead the Clippers to a win, I couldn’t believe it. I was still star-struck.”
That didn’t last. When you’re doing your job as a journalist, it can’t. And Stein has done his job so well through the years – covering the Clippers and then the Lakers for the Daily News, the Mavericks for the Dallas Morning News and the national basketball beat at Dallas, then for ESPN and now the New York Times – that he will be honored by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on Thursday in Springfield, Mass., right alongside recently retired Clippers play-by-play man Ralph Lawler.
Both men will receive the Curt Gowdy Media Award, given in recognition of distinguished service covering basketball.
It will be a Southern California gathering this weekend, with lots of connected parts. Besides Stein and Lawler, former Lakers coach Del Harris (who Stein covered) will receive the John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award at Thursday’s ceremony, along with Portland Trail Blazers general manager and president Harry Glickman.
At Friday’s main induction ceremony, Bill Fitch (who Stein covered) will go into the Hall, although Fitch’s family announced Tuesday that for health reasons, he won’t be able to attend the ceremony. Additionally, Vlade Divac will be inducted as an international player, and Jerry West will be his presenter.
“Surreal doesn’t even start to cover it,” Stein said.
Stein’s first NBA story was on Divac when he covered the Summer Pro League for the Orange County Register in the summer of 1989. And he covered the Lakers during West’s years as general manager – and drew West’s ire for something he didn’t do in 1996, the summer the Lakers got Shaquille O’Neal.
“I wrote a free agent preview for the Daily News,” he recalled. “It turned out that Long Beach (the Press-Telegram) used mostly my story but weaved some stuff from a New York Daily News story into my piece that suggested the Lakers had already done a deal with Shaq and had broken the rules.
“The next morning Jerry stormed into (publicist) Raymond Ridder’s office and said, ‘Have you seen the clips?’ Raymond said, ‘Yeah, it’s right here’ (pointing to the Daily News story). Jerry said, ‘No, not that one, this one.’ He showed him the Long Beach story with my byline. He made Raymond call me, and then Jerry erupted on me.
“I’m sure anybody who covered the Lakers remembered getting Jerry when he’s in that mode of losing his temper. It’s kind of like a badge of honor. I’m guessing he didn’t remember the next day; he got it out and it was forgotten.”
Stein could be a walking history of sports journalism in Southern California over the past 30 years. He started at the Saddleback Valley News when he was still in high school and got a job at the Register when he started at Cal State Fullerton. He did an internship at the Washington Post the summer of his junior year at Fullerton and then did one at the San Bernardino Sun as a senior, covering the California League and the San Bernardino Spirit – home and road – in 1991.
“My first game was (future major leaguer) Mike Hampton’s no-hitter,” he recalled, adding that it was Hampton’s only victory that season; he was 1-7 with a 5.25 ERA. But fighting deadlines every night, while following the team to Reno, Stockton, Visalia, Bakersfield and the other garden spots of the Cal League was good training.
He remembers the people who helped him move up. Mike Gallups, his high school journalism advisor at El Toro High, was an old high school classmate of the Register’s Earl Bloom, and Bloom helped get him on at the Register. Later, when he graduated from Fullerton at a time when jobs were scarce, Ken Daley – a former co-worker in Orange County and by then Dodgers beat writer at the Daily News – spoke up for him. Stein was hired by the Daily News for the copy desk, but within six months was writing about high school sports and pro tennis before the NBA beat opened in 1994.
“That was my big chance,” he recalled. “Once I got on the Clippers, I wasn’t letting go.”
He hasn’t since.

Dave Chappelle Is Stuck in the '80s; He made a career pushing the envelope, but his material—including the N-word—is no longer edgy.

Texto completo: I had three major takeaways from comic Dave Chappelle's most recent Netflix special. The first was that his comedy has lost something. The flourishes are still there but less frequent. The observations are still amusing but less reliably insightful. Mr. Chappelle has made a career out of pushing the envelope, but his Michael Jackson pedophile bits aren't edgy. They're just icky.
A second takeaway was that black offense at use of the N-word is so much playacting. Mr. Chappelle spends an hour incessantly and gratuitously ramming it into our ears. Which is nothing new among black comics, of course. Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy also performed famously vulgar routines. What's changed is the debate surrounding use of the N-word outside comedy clubs.
The founder of the Papa John's pizza chain resigned as chairman following complaints that he used the word during a media-training session on race relations. A middle-school teacher in Wisconsin quit her job under pressure for citing the word as an example of inappropriate language. Princeton canceled a course on hate speech last year after students complained that a professor used the word during a discussion of offensive terms. Undoubtedly, there are some blacks who cringe at hearing the N-word in any context, but we can be fairly certain that none of them are undergraduates at Princeton.
White people are led to believe that a word that has permeated the most popular forms of comedy and music in the country for decades somehow sends black people into conniptions when they hear it in any other context. But the first time I recall hearing the word as a child, it was spoken by other blacks, and my experience is far from unique. Even today, blacks are far more likely than whites to use the term in public. And the selective outrage over its use has grown tiresome.
My third reaction to Mr. Chappelle's show was how little black comedy seems to have evolved in recent decades. Racial themes still dominate. Harping on the otherworldliness of the black experience in America still wins laughs even as our neighborhoods and schools and workplaces become more diverse and integrated. Before Bill Cosby's monstrous offstage behavior caught up with him, his career offered evidence of a huge appetite for nonracial humor from a black comedian. But Mr. Cosby continues to be the exception. Two decades into the 21st century, much of black stand-up seems stuck in the 1980s. The jokes have been updated, but the nature of the humor hasn't really changed.
Mr. Chappelle and fellow black comedian Chris Rock are still the best at what they do, but Mr. Rock's work strikes me as more subversive. While others obsess over what white people are doing, many of Mr. Rock's most memorable routines zero in on black attitudes toward education, parenting and law enforcement. His sensibilities can be as shocking as his language, especially in a political environment where personal responsibility is passé and calling attention to counterproductive behavior is a no-no. Drug companies are to blame for the opioid crisis. The gun lobby is to blame for mass shootings. Racism is to blame for racial disparities.
Last month the New York Times marked the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first black slaves to America. Slavery was a global evil dating back thousands of years, but it's often discussed only in terms of Africans being enslaved by Europeans in the Western Hemisphere. The "legacy of slavery" is regularly invoked to explain black-white differences today in everything from homeownership to single parenting. But as far back as the late 1960s, U.S. census data show black immigrants from the Caribbean, which also has a legacy of slavery, far out-earning American blacks. And second-generation black West Indians were earning more than the U.S. average for all groups.
In 1907 Booker T. Washington, the educator and former slave, published a book detailing the economic progress of blacks since emancipation. He reported that between 1860 and 1900 black homeownership rates grew from infinitesimal to more than 20%, and that among homeowners a higher percentage of blacks than whites completely owned their residences. "I am unaware that history records such an example of substantial growth in civilization in a time so short," wrote Washington. A hundred years ago, black marriage rates exceeded those of whites, and most black children were raised in two-parent homes. Today, that's no longer true and slavery can't explain the retrogression.
Liberals want to harp on how blacks have been treated, but a focus on how they progressed in earlier eras notwithstanding that treatment would be of far greater use to today's black underclass. The black experience in America is much more than a history of what whites have done to blacks, even if our politicians, commentators and comedians often find it expedient to pretend otherwise.

Texto completo: Sweet Taste of Liberty
By W. Caleb McDaniel
(Oxford, 340 pages, $27.95)
Few topics are as fraught as the demand for reparations to African-Americans for their ancestors' experience of slavery. Even people who believe that repayment is owed differ about what form it ought to take. The form it might have taken early on, in the wake of the Civil War, was the oft-cited promise of "forty acres and a mule" (minus the mule, the phrase comes from William Tecumseh Sherman), but it was never adopted as an official policy and was far from a real promise. It does, however, express the most modest form of reparation that the government might have offered to freed men and women at the time. In the event, as we know, they were abandoned to the Ku Klux Klan and crushing economic repression.
In "Sweet Taste of Liberty," W. Caleb McDaniel, a professor of history at Rice University, describes one former slave's quest for reparation. His superbly written chronicle tells the story of a twice-enslaved woman, Henrietta Wood, who in the 1870s took one of her enslavers to court and miraculously won a settlement.
Wood was born around 1820 and grew up on a plantation in northern Kentucky. She was sold several times before she became the property of a woman who then moved to Cincinnati and freed her in 1848. After working in boarding houses for a few years, Wood found her life suddenly changed. In 1853 the woman who employed her invited her on a carriage ride across the Ohio River into the slave state of Kentucky, ostensibly just to keep her company ("I have some friends to see, and we can get back in time for supper"). Betrayed, Wood was handed over on the spot to a slave-dealing kidnapper.
Since the documents that would prove Wood's freedom were locked away in Cincinnati, there was little she could do. Like thousands before her, she was sold south to Mississippi for agricultural labor. She eventually wound up in Texas, on a plantation so isolated that she didn't know the Civil War had ended until months after Appomattox. During this second enslavement she gave birth to a son, likely the result of rape by one of her enslavers, Mr. McDaniel surmises.
In certain ways, Wood's experience resembles that of Solomon Northup, a free black musician who was kidnapped from Washington, D.C., in the 1840s and sold into slavery in Louisiana. His 1853 autobiography, "Twelve Years a Slave," was the source for the 2013 film by the same name. In contrast to Northup's powerful but plainly told account, Wood's story, as presented by Mr. McDaniel, abounds with contextual detail. He deftly integrates court records with fine-grained background stories of Wood's enslavers and lawyers, all the while presenting a panorama of antebellum and post-Civil War America.
Although Wood left few records in her own voice, it is clear that she was a determined woman whose desire for justice, and sense of her own dignity, remained undiminished even after her slave ordeals and the serpentine, 8-year odyssey of her lawsuit. Her case, Mr. McDaniel writes, was not about a single violent act "but about the long period in which she was 'deprived of her time and the value of her labor.' " The case, in other words, was about slavery itself.
The story itself is rich with vivid personalities and unexpected turns. Wood's kidnapper and the target of her lawsuit, a hustler named Zebulon Ward, proved to be a steadfast Unionist during the Civil War, though never a friend to emancipation. Her best lawyer, Harvey Myers, was a Radical Republican who campaigned for black votes during Reconstruction but was shot dead by an estranged husband in an unrelated case. The judge who ultimately ruled in her favor had once run as a candidate for the Confederate Congress and had owned slaves but viewed her sufferings as "a case of peculiar and complicated oppression." Wood's story reached the public thanks mainly to an article in the Cincinnati Commercial written by the peripatetic half-Greek, half-Irish Lafcadio Hearn, who years later would become famous as the expatriate who helped introduce Japanese culture to the West.
After the war, Wood toiled again at domestic work and struggled to raise her son in the slums of Cincinnati. Meanwhile, Zebulon Ward made a fortune in Arkansas by arranging to lease the state penitentiary and squeezing profit from the inmates' labor. He was praised in the local press as the "new" Southern man, a model of "good spirits and go-aheadativeness." When he died in 1894, he left an estate of $600,000, making him in today's terms a multi-millionaire.
In 1870 Wood sued Ward for $20,000; in the end, she got $2,500. She was one of only a very few former slaves -- the actual number is unknown -- who received any kind of payment for their years of servitude. The money wrested from Ward certainly didn't make Wood rich. But it was enough for her to buy a house and send her son, Arthur, to school. In 1889 Arthur became one of the first black graduates of Union College of Law, later part of Northwestern University. He went on to practice law in Chicago and invest in real estate. His descendants included a Tuskegee airman, a jazz musician and a doctor. Wood's legal victory, Mr. McDaniel notes, was evidence of the difference that even a modest amount of money might have made to the opportunities of a once-enslaved family.
Northern newspapers' coverage of Wood's 1878 settlement showed a kind of complacency, one report suggesting that it was "pleasant to reflect that such days will come again no more to her or any of her race." Ambiguously, the New York Times commented that it "would willingly close this dark chapter in American history," except that Wood had "opened it again," raising questions about the nation's "unsettled account" with the formerly enslaved. Meanwhile, Southern Democrats were busy overthrowing Reconstruction governments and undermining blacks' exercise of freedom. While Mr. McDaniel barely refers to the present-day push for reparations, he amply demonstrates that the generation of men and women who escaped slavery deserved far better from America than they got.

Texto completo: Iran acknowledged for the first time on Monday that an explosion had occurred at a satellite launch site in the country's north after images of the aftermath of the blast circulated last week.
An Iranian government official said the explosion was caused by a technical error during a test launch.
The information came days after President Trump prompted confusion when he posted a message on Twitter referring to the explosion -- accompanied by an image of the site that some suspected was once classified -- noting that "the United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident."
Ali Rabiei, a spokesman for the Iranian government, confirmed on Monday that an explosion had taken place at a launchpad at the Imam Khomeini Space Center, in a statement reported by the Iranian state news outlet IRNA.
"The blast was caused by a technical error, and experts are unanimous in the matter and it is clear how it happened," Mr. Rabiei said.
He added that the explosion had happened on a test site and that a satellite had not been damaged, as it was not attached to the rocket that was launched.
Mr. Rabiei also criticized Mr. Trump's Twitter post.
"We don't understand why the U.S. president tweets and posts satellite pictures with excitement," he said. "This is not understandable."
The image that Mr. Trump shared last week appeared to show devastating damage to the launch site, and the charred remains of a rocket and launchpad after what appeared to be a fire. He ended his message with what seemed to be a taunt: "I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened."
When asked by reporters whether the photo was once classified, which many analysts believe was the case, Mr. Trump defended its release.
"We had a photo and I released it, which I have the absolute right to do," he said.
Iran's space program has experienced many failed launches. Over the past 11 years, 67 percent of Iranian orbital launches have failed, compared with a 5 percent failure rate worldwide for similar launches, according to data from publicly available records.
Two Iranian previous attempts this year to launch satellites, one in January and one in February, also failed. A separate fire at the Khomeini space center in February killed three workers, Iranian state media reported at the time.
In February, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had scaled up a secret American program to sabotage Iran's missiles and rockets. Washington believes Tehran's space program is merely a cover for its attempts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile to launch a nuclear warhead.

8,000-year-old Sculptures Reveal A Puzzling Cultural Mishmash

Texto completo: LEPENSKI VIR, Serbia - The faces are haunting. About 8,000 years ago, over a period of perhaps 200 years, artists who lived in this settlement on the banks of the Danube carved about 100 sandstone boulders with faces and abstract designs. The faces are simple, with wide, round eyes, a stylized nose and downturned open mouths. They do not look happy.
I imagine these stone heads posing an existential question something like the one my son startled us with when we told him that he had to go to play group even if he didn’t want to. He was 3, and as the loss of freedom struck him, he had a tantrum. “How did this happen to me?” he wailed.
Archaeologists say the heads seem to be a mixture of human and fish features, accounting for their strangeness. Some designs look like fish skeletons. The gorges and pools in this part of the Danube were long a home to sturgeon and other large fish that sustained human life. Perhaps a fishing people imagined their souls migrating into fish after death.
And many of these sculptures were kept in strange trapezoidal dwellings, with hard limestone floors. In some cases the dead lay buried under the homes. So the sculptures might have represented ancestors. I take this as consistent with my interpretation. You die and suddenly you’re a sturgeon: What’s your first question?
Lepenski Vir - Vir means whirlpool in Serbian - was first inhabited more than 12,000 years ago and off and on over thousands of years. Archaeologists excavated it from 1965-70, when most of the site was flooded during the building of the first of two dams on the Danube.
The Iron Gates
But I first came upon the museum and reconstruction of the site in Serbia only a few months ago as a tourist. I was stunned by the sculptures and the mystery of the site’s past. It sits across the river from a mountain cliff on the Romanian side of the river, and its trapezoidal homes echo the shape of the cliff. There are other sites of similar age, a few of them with boulder sculptures, on either side of the Danube in this area, now known as the Iron Gates. But only Lepenski Vir has boulders with faces.
I called Dusan Boric, an archaeologist who has studied the site extensively, to find out more. Boric, a fellow at Columbia University’s Italian Academy for Advanced Studies, said Lepenski Vir is more important than ever for research. Studies of ancient DNA that trace patterns of human migration into Europe, chemical analyses of bones and pottery, and continuing archaeological studies of burial practices place the site at the very moment when farmers from the Near East began to migrate into southeastern Europe and met the hunters and gatherers who lived there at the time.
Researchers still debate the precise dating of different settlements at Lepenski Vir and nearby sites but agree on the essential fact that the sites capture a record of the meeting and mixing of two cultures and peoples.
It took a few thousand years for agriculture to spread to all of Europe. Permanent settlements were created, and the population changed with this migration and others that followed. This transition from a hunting and gathering culture to a farming culture marks the change from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic for archaeologists.
Lepenski Vir offers a snapshot of that process at its very beginning. David Reich, a Harvard expert in ancient human DNA and human migration, has drawn DNA from bones at Lepenski Vir. “It is a mother lode of material,” Reich said.
DNA evidence
In a recent paper, he and other scientists reported new findings about the “genomic history of southeastern Europe.” As part of that study they drew DNA from four individuals at Lepenski Vir. Two were identifiable as Near Eastern farmers. And studies of the chemistry of their bones show that they had not grown up at Lepenski Vir but were migrants from elsewhere. Another had a mixed hunter-gatherer/farmer heritage and had eaten a diet of fish. Another had hunter-gatherer heritage.
The dating of the skeletons showed a range. The one with mixed heritage was from 6070 B.C., or about 8,000 years ago. The farmers were dated as 6200-5600 B.C. And the hunter-gatherer probably earlier than the others.
The DNA of this ancient population of hunter-gatherers contributes only a small fraction of European ancestry today, Reich said. Europeans now represent a mixture of genetic contributions from waves of migrants. The site, he said, is a key landmark in the “lost landscape of human variation.”
In some other areas, archaeologists and ancient DNA experts have not always seen eye to eye, but here, Boric said, the new techniques have been a great boon. With ancient DNA analysis, he said, “What we are getting is an incredibly powerful tool for understanding what went on in the past.”
I asked Reich if he experienced the same emotional jolt from DNA findings that I get from the sculptures. “I do,” he said. “It’s a little bit like being a trained musician. You’re able to hear things the untrained person wouldn’t.”
When he sees the results of complicated and statistical DNA analyses pinpointing a moment when different groups of people were beginning to trade cultures and intermarry, he said, it hits him in a visceral way. “These little hints,” he said, “bits of genetic data, mean profound things.”
‘Profound things’
Another indication of the merging of two cultures is a change in burial practices. Throughout Europe, the Mesolithic foragers laid a body down stretched out. The migrant farmers from the Near East brought another way of treating death, setting the body in a crouched or fetal position.
Both practices are found at Lepenski Vir. And when the burial practices are combined with DNA profiles, the picture is richer still. Some of the dead of Near Eastern heritage are buried in the way of the foragers. And others of foraging heritage are buried in the way of the farmers.
The farmers also brought their animals. There are bones from at least one dog, which may someday help illuminate the muddled picture of dog domestication, which now seems to have occurred separately in Asia and Europe.
And then there are the pigs.
Laurent Frantz of Queen Mary University of London, Greger Larson of the University of Oxford and other researchers this month published an exhaustive study of the introduction of Near Eastern pigs, originally domesticated in Anatolia, into Europe. They looked at ancient and modern DNA of wild and domestic pigs, including specimens from the Iron Gates sites.
What they found was that the farmers brought their pigs with them, but that over 3,000 years, those pigs interbred with European wild boar. Today, the DNA of those original pigs is lost. The farmers from the Near East brought the cultural practice of keeping and breeding pigs, which survived, although the original pig genome did not.
Frantz said, “The first 2,000 years of domestication that takes place in Anatolia left almost no trace in the modern genome of domestic pigs.”
Faces from the past
As to the faces, fishing was important on the Danube before farmers came and continued long afterward. Pottery that was used for cooking grains elsewhere in Europe was used for preparation of fish at Lepenski Vir. And the strange faces appear nowhere else. There are about 100 such sculptures at Lepenski Vir. In neighboring settlements, also of fishing people, also where farmers came and met and married foragers, there are some sculptures with designs like those found on the Lepenski Vir stone heads, but none of the nearby sculptures have faces.
The farmers did not bring them with them. The hunter-gatherers did not make them before the farmers came. They did not spread to the rest of Europe.
I have on my desk now replicas of two of the heads that I picked up when I visited the museum at Lepenski Vir. I look at them and I feel a muddled kinship to the artists, the departed souls, the sturgeon. I too would like to know the answer to what I believe is their question.
How did this happen to me?
But I tell them what I told my son. I have absolutely no idea.

Texto completo: The ballot for Tuesday's special election in state House District 71 lists four candidates, but between the lines, you might spot Speaker David Ralston.
The contest to replace state Rep.David Stover of Newnan, one of 10 Republican legislators who had sought Ralston's ouster as House leader, is shaping up as a proxy fight over the same issue.
Ralston has kicked money in the pot supporting the campaign of Republican Marcy Westmoreland Sakrison, as has the chamber's second in command, Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones.
Sakrison has a link to previous GOP leadership in the House.Her father, former U.S. Rep.LynnWestmoreland, had been the top Republican in the chamber before launching his bid for Congress.
She's the top fundraiser in the contest, taking in more than $46,000. But not all the big names are lining up behind her.
Erick Erickson, a conservative host on News 95.5 and AM 750 WSB and the force behind The Resurgent website, is backing Phillip Singleton, as are many hard-line Republicans.
On Facebook, Erickson said he was supporting Singleton because he will vote for Ralston's removal as speaker.
"SpeakerRalstonispouring money into the seat to make sure Singleton does not win because Singleton has said he would push for the Speaker's resignation," Erickson wrote. "Singleton is a strong conservative who will vote for limited government. Support him and we can have a runoff between two Republicans, one of whom backs the Speaker and one who wants to do the right thing."
Ralston has faced pressure to step down following an Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Channel 2 Action News investigation into the speaker's use of legislative leave privileges to delay criminal cases he was handling in his private law practice. It found, among other things, that Ralston had stalled cases for clients accused of such crimes as child abuse, rape, assault, terroristic threats and drunken driving.
The nonpartisan election has opened a divide among the district's Republicans.
That all-Republican runoff that Erickson wrote about isn't a cinch.
When Sakrison declined to participate in a debate put on by the Coweta County GOP, second place in the straw poll went to Jill Prouty, a Democrat.
Also on the ballot is Republican Nina Blackwelder.
A Rosetta Stone Communications poll that was recently leaked to GeorgiaPol.com showed Sakrison leading, at about 30%. Singleton and Prouty were both at about 20%. Blackwelder's support measured at 9%,and roughly 20% were undecided.
He's got the president's ear: President Donald Trump's trade war with China means a steady focus on one of his battlefield commanders, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.
The New York Times recently examined Perdue's efforts to keep farmers in line with Trump as the tariff dispute plays out between the two nations. The piece also noted Perdue's own history with China when he was the governor of Georgia.
"Mr. Perdue is a somewhat unlikely lieutenant in Mr. Trump's trade war," the Times wrote. "As Georgia's governor, he worked to strengthen ties between the state and China, welcoming Chinese companies and making economic development trips to Shanghai and Beijing. At one point he pushed for Atlanta to become a hub for the Free Trade Area of the Americas, a proposed 34-country trade pact that never came to fruition. ...
"But in the Trump administration, Mr. Perdue has been a staunch backer of the president's policies, publicly defending tariffs, working to shrink the federal government and expressing doubts about the science behind climate change."
The Times also quotes Neill Herring, a longtime lobbyist at the Georgia Capitol for the Sierra Club, calling Perdue "the Trump whisperer."
"He can tell Trump exactly what he wants to hear," Herring said.
Youhavetowonderwhether Trump heard this joke: "What do you call two farmers in a basement? A whine cellar."
It didn't go over particularly well when Perdue told it during a meeting last month with Wisconsin farmers.
It's a classic case of not knowing your audience.
In an Associated Press story, the American Farm Bureau Federation reported that from July 2018 to June 2019,Wisconsin farmers filed 45 bankruptcies under Chapter 12. While that was five fewer such bankruptcies than in the previous 12-month period, it was still the highest total in the nation.

As 2020 Race Intensifies, Democrats Step Up Offensive Against Mitch McConnell; The Senate majority leader has embraced the persona of the villain of the left as he draws fire away from President Trump

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE, Ky.—Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders came to this city in August to decry not President Trump, whom he is hoping to unseat, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in the Kentucky Republican's hometown.
"You don't have the right to stop democracy in the United States Senate," Mr. Sanders said, as if addressing Mr. McConnell directly, calling on him to stop killing Democratic legislation in the chamber. Mr. McConnell has done that so often that he dubbed himself the "Grim Reaper" at an event this year.
Mr. Sanders's appearance is part of Democrats' nationwide effort—whether campaigning for president, the Senate or House—to raise funds by painting the majority leader, the longest-serving GOP leader in Senate history, as the reason progressive legislation has stalled.
There is little prospect that the attacks will succeed in ousting Mr. McConnell from the Senate next year, given his record as a tenacious campaigner who plans for races years in advance and the fact that Kentucky is a heavily Republican state. But Democrats are seeking to make him, along with President Trump, a bogeyman for their campaigns nationwide, much as Republicans have sought to do with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.)
"The Democratic message is that the Republican Senate is preventing action on so many problems," said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, whose research often focuses on the Senate. "As soon as you can attach a personality to it, it adds considerable depth."
Mindful of how his standing with conservatives has strengthened as Democrats step up their attacks, Mr. McConnell has frequently embraced his persona as a villain of the left. His office is adorned with cartoons lampooning him, and he boasts about his mastery of Senate procedure.
"The more that they demonize him, the stronger he gets," said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Mr. McConnell who remains close to the majority leader. "It further fortifies him with his own electorate."
Share Your Thoughts
Do you think Democrats are making the best use of their campaign funds by targeting Mitch McConnell, or are there are better uses for it? Join the conversation below.
Republican allies add that the Democratic presidential candidates' strategy could risk backfiring as they may be wasting time and money on him rather than going after their actual opponent in the race, Mr. Trump.
Progressives have been antagonized by what Mr. McConnell considers to be his proudest achievement: Confirming two Supreme Court justices after blocking President Obama's last pick for the court, Merrick Garland. Mr. McConnell's decision to focus on confirming federal judges shored up what had been flagging support for him among far-right Republicans, who two years ago sought unsuccessfully to oust him from his leadership post.
"His value to the [Senate GOP] is immeasurable and that's why Democrats are obsessed with him," said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm.
Mr. McConnell took to the Senate floor in July to complain about being labeled by some Democrats as "a Russian asset" and "Moscow Mitch." His critics had cited his decision to block a vote on legislation to secure voting systems, as well as legislation aimed at deterring Russia from new election interference by threatening sanctions on its banking, energy and defense sectors. Mr. McConnell has objected to election-security bills, which he has called overly partisan, and generally has preferred to focus on confirming judges instead of using limited floor time on legislation.
"The outraged industrial complex needed a new target, and that is where I come in—Mitch McConnell—the hawkish foreign policy conservative who has spent decades pushing back on Russia every way I can think of, was accused of what amounts to treason by multiple media outlets within a couple of hours," the Senate majority leader said.
Mr. McConnell's likely challenger in next year's election—former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath—has raised $7 million since entering the race in July, according to her campaign. The senator, with the advantage of being a six-term incumbent and a national Republican leader in a deep-red state, will be difficult to unseat.
But Ms. McGrath is financially competitive against Mr. McConnell, who had raised $10.6 million by midyear, more than any other Republican defending a Senate seat. In his last election, in 2014, he spent almost all of his $31 million war chest, even though his rival had raised just $19 million.
A fund called Ditch Mitch, started last year after Mr. McConnell succeeded in getting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh confirmed, has raised $3.5 million—roughly on par with the amount raised by the majority leader from individual donors in the first half of this year. Party Majority, a super PAC, is raising money for a new project called MoscowMitch.com, aimed at defeating Mr. McConnell and tying him to the Republicans campaigning for Senate seats. The Senate Democrats' campaign arm said digital fundraising from March to July was better than in any other nonelection year; 90% of the ads mentioned the Senate majority leader.
Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates have cited Mr. McConnell in at least 60 fundraising emails since April, according to a collection maintained by The Wall Street Journal.
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, when he announced his Senate bid in August, wrote in a fundraising pitch that incumbent GOP Sen. Cory Gardner "votes 99% of the time with Donald Trump and goes along with Mitch McConnell's obstruction and partisan political games."
The effectiveness of such a pitch has been borne out in a poll commissioned by End Citizens United—a major Democratic donor since it was founded to undo a 2010 Supreme Court decision allowing unlimited political expenditures. The political-action committee found in 12 battleground states this spring that Democrats got more of a bump from painting Mr. McConnell as an obstructionist than from depicting Mr. Trump as the reason liberal policy goals were stuck.
Progressive activists, with increasing support from Democratic presidential hopefuls, are pushing to curb Mr. McConnell's power if the party retakes the Senate by ending the legislative filibuster, a procedural tool that empowers the minority in the chamber. Most bills need 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, where Republicans currently hold 53 of the chamber's 100 seats. Progressives would eliminate the option in the Senate, whose procedures have traditionally required bipartisan cooperation to pass legislation, and allow bills to pass with a simple majority, as they do in the House.
"In this country, radical changes face a high bar by design," Mr. McConnell responded in an August op-ed in The New York Times. "It is telling that today's left-wing activists would rather lower that bar than produce ideas that can meet it."

Texto completo: Syndicated Columnist
Washington
The assumptions underlying a controversy are often more important than the controversy itself.
Take the case of our blithe acceptance of the Electoral College. There is nothing normal or democratic about choosing our president through a system that makes it ever more likely that the candidate who garners fewer votes will nonetheless assume power. For a country that has long claimed to model democracy to the world, this is both wrong and weird.
And there is also nothing neutral or random about how our system works. The Electoral College tilts outcomes toward white voters, conservative voters and certain regions of the country. People outside these groups and places are supposed to sit back and accept their relative disenfranchisement. There is no reason they should, and at some point, they won’t. This will lead to a meltdown.
Our brewing troubles were underscored last month by the kerfuffle that Nate Cohn, The New York Times’ political numbers guru, set off with a story that ran under the headline: “Trump’s Electoral College Edge Could Grow in 2020, Rewarding Polarizing Campaign.”
For election junkies, Cohn’s analysis ignited quite a stir, especially since it set off a “Nate vs. Nate” Twitter skirmish between Cohn and Nate Silver, another brand-name data maven. (Yes, fate has made Nate a name of choice for people in this line of work.) Silver’s main critique was fair enough: “There’s just not that much we can say about the Electoral College right now beyond a couple of fairly loose priors (e.g. it’s more likely to help than hurt Trump).”
Still, Cohn’s calculations were revelatory. He stressed, for example, that higher turnout in 2020, which is generally seen as helping Democrats, could actually boost Trump in the key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and especially Wisconsin by bringing out more of the Trump base.
As Cohn wrote, “the major Democratic opportunity — to mobilize nonwhite and young voters on the periphery of politics — would disproportionately help Democrats in diverse, often noncompetitive states.” On the other hand, the GOP’s opportunity is “to mobilize less educated white voters, particularly those who voted in 2016 but sat out 2018.” This “would disproportionately help them in white, working-class areas overrepresented in the Northern battleground states.”
Think about it: The Democratic nominee against Trump could beat him by far more votes than Hillary Clinton did in 2016 — and still lose. Clinton led Trump by 2.9 million popular votes, 2.1%. Cohn’s conclusion: “It is even possible that Mr. Trump could win while losing the national vote by as much as five percentage points.”
This means that the country could render a negative verdict on Trump’s time in office by swinging away from him in a big way — and he would still be president for four more years.
Defenders of such a departure from one person-one vote say that if Democrats run up big leads in a few states and regions — especially California but also, say, New York, Illinois and New England — that shouldn’t count. Their strained claim is that a president is somehow more “representative” of the country if he wins by eking out tiny margins in several Midwestern states. This transforms our democracy into a casino. If you narrowly hit the right numbers in some places, you take the pot.
What they are really defending, without explicitly saying so, is the idea that states with a higher percentage of white, non-Hispanic voters should have a disproportionate influence on who becomes president.
As a short-term strategic matter, Cohn is right to stress the importance to the 2020 result of states that were closely divided in 2016. But while I have great affection for the Midwest, I see no just reason for an individual voter in California having far less power than an individual voter in, say, Wisconsin or Michigan.
And the system’s bias toward white voters only encourages Trump’s habit of dividing the country along racial lines. So in addition to being undemocratic, the Electoral College encourages a particularly odious politician with no interest in uniting the country to do all he can to promote minority rule.
At some point, the majority will rise up. If Cohn’s worst-case-for-democracy scenario materializes, 2020 could be that year. Our founders admitted that the Electoral College system they created in the original Constitution was defective by altering it with the 12th Amendment in 1804. It’s time we followed their lead in showing the same willingness to scrap a system that is sending us headlong into a national crisis.

Texto completo: Have South Bend, Indiana residents finally had enough of one-party rule? As Mayor Pete Buttigieg wraps up his second term, voters in this small and increasingly violent city will decide in November whether to elect their first Republican mayor in nearly half a century.
In the New York Times, Trip Gabriel and Richard Oppel describe the tragedy of South Bend:
Reports of violent crime increased nearly 18 percent during the first seven months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The number of people being shot has also risen markedly this year, after dropping last year. The city's violent crime rate is double the average for American cities its size.
Even before South Bend's most recent crime surge, the city was suffering through a particularly bloody era in its recent history. The Times reports:
Since Mr. Buttigieg took office in January 2012, there were 100 homicides through the end of 2018 — an increase of about 30 percent from the seven years before he became mayor. That does not include 10 homicides in the first seven months of this year, a number that has already topped last year's total...
Are the citizens of South Bend ready to try a new approach after living for decades with the results of liberal governance? According to a report this week from Jeff Parrott of the South Bend Tribune, GOP candidate Sean Haas, a 37-year-old history teacher and military veteran, understands that he faces an uphill climb. Mr. Parrott writes:
But with a perception some have that crime is worsening, troubled city schools and neighborhoods that feel they haven't enjoyed the economic revitalization that Buttigieg brought to the downtown, Haas said he does feel there is an opportunity for a Republican to win.
"It's just a matter of, are people ready to take a chance on somebody, on a new political party?" he said. "Change is difficult for everybody. No matter what it is, it's uncomfortable."
Voters have more than a "perception" of worsening crime. And as uncomfortable as it may be for some of them to consider charting a new political course, they must also reckon with the discomfort of watching the decline of a city.
While Mr. Buttigieg has spoken at length about improvements made to South Bend's downtown, the city's economy has consistently trailed those of nearby Indiana communities. If a recent slump in the RV industry continues to hit Elkhart, then perhaps South Bend could end up looking good by comparison. But Mr. Buttigieg's jurisdiction continues to have a higher unemployment rate than neighboring Mishawaka and according to preliminary data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally adjusted), South Bend had fewer jobs in July than in January.
Crime and the economy won't be the only issues up for debate this fall. Running against an opponent Mr. Parrott describes as "the hand-picked choice of Pete Buttigieg," Republican mayoral candidate Mr. Haas is promising better governance compared to the South Bend "Democratic machine."
This year the opportunity to clean house across city government could have particular appeal for South Bend voters. Last month Neil Vigdor reported in the New York Times:
F.B.I. agents raided the offices of the Housing Authority of South Bend, Ind., on Wednesday...
The agency, which runs nine low-income housing facilities in South Bend and is financed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been beleaguered by complaints of financial mismanagement for much of the decade.
Such concerns prompted Mr. Buttigieg to replace all six commissioners on the housing authority's board in 2015.
Just as in other urban areas of the country that have struggled under the dominance of one political party, competitive elections in South Bend could finally bring reform and renewal.

The Right Stuff
The passing this week of American aviation hero Al Haynes, who somehow managed to save 185 of the 296 people aboard a United Airlines flight in 1989 despite a series of catastrophes, has us reviewing a 2009 account of the crash and its aftermath. The 2009 story appeared in New York magazine, where Haynes told his story to Jacob Gershman. Fortunately for Wall Street Journal readers Mr. Gershman is now a reporter at this newspaper. Haynes for his part remains an inspiration to people everywhere.
Here's Haynes describing the events of that July day:
Our No. 2 engine failed us at 37,000 feet... We started to shut down the engine using the standard checklist. But within a few seconds, First Officer Bill Records said, "I can't control the aircraft." I turned around and saw that he had the controls all the way to the left and back in his lap, even though the aircraft was in a descending right turn. This was impossible, but he was doing it anyway. We couldn't figure out why.
I took control, not that I knew what to do. As I was reducing the left throttle, Second Officer Dudley Dvorak advised me that we were losing hydraulics in the other two systems, too. The only way to steer an airplane is with hydraulics, and now we had none at all.
I thought to myself, How are we going to keep this thing in the sky? You don't train or drill for something like this, because it's just not supposed to happen. After a little while, we determined that by manipulating the throttles, we could keep the airplane from rolling over, and by alternating the thrust we could try to control the altitude...
We assumed we'd land flat, hit hard, then bounce. Bill said he'd go on the brakes with me, but of course there were no brakes. Then he said that he'd use the spoilers to slow us down, but there were no spoilers, either...
I was knocked out after we hit, and I came to in the crash site. I had no idea what had happened. I didn't realize that the cockpit had broken off from the rest of the fuselage, or that the caught wing had sent the plane cartwheeling down the runway. I do remember talking to Dudley just before they put me on the ambulance. I asked him if everybody had made it, and he said no.
It was very hard to get past the guilt of surviving...
Rest in peace, Captain Haynes.

Texto completo: Joe Biden said that President Donald Trump has failed to condemn racist leaders like David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, and white nationalist Richard Spencer.
"David Duke, head of the Ku Klux Klan, former head of the Klan. When that group came out of the woods, the fields, carrying those torches he said, ‘That’s why we voted for Donald Trump.’ He said he would take the country back. The white nationalist, Richard Spencer, he hailed Trump. He said, ‘This is the white nationalism we have been looking for.’ Did you hear him condemn either one of those people? Ever utter a word of condemnation?"
Biden didn’t answer his own question, but he was clearly stating Trump hasn’t condemned either racist leader. Biden accurately quoted Duke’s comments about Trump, and Spencer did hail Trump. But Biden exaggerates when he says Trump hasn’t condemned Duke at all.
What Trump said about David Duke
In 2016, we fact-checked a claim that "Trump refuses to denounce the KKK." We rated the statement Mostly False.
The ad distorted Trump’s record by cherry picking one interview in which CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Trump about Duke in February 2016. Tapper asked Trump if he would condemn Duke and say that he didn’t want the vote of white supremacists.
"Well, I have to look at the group," Trump said. "You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about...If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong."
Trump later blamed a bad ear piece, saying he could barely hear the questions. In the days that followed, Trump rejected Duke’s support in interviews on Good Morning America and Morning Joe, calling him a "bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years."
We found Trump denounced Duke years before his interview with Tapper.
In 1991, CNN’s Larry King asked Trump what Duke’s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented.
Trump replied: "I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States."
During his 2016 bid, Trump disavowed Duke, but it was not as strongly worded as some of his earlier rebukes.
In 2015, when asked about a quasi-endorsement by Duke, Trump replied that he wouldn’t want his endorsement. Asked if he would repudiate Duke, he replied: "Sure, I would do that, if it made you feel better...Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. Actually I don’t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all of the candidates."
In 2016, when asked about Duke’s endorsement of him, Trump said he wasn’t aware of it, and sometimes sounded exasperated by the question.
"I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan," he said in a debate. "I totally disavow David Duke. I’ve been doing it now for two weeks...you’re probably about the 18th person that’s asked me the question."
What Trump said about events led by Spencer
We didn’t find any instance when Trump was asked to denounce Spencer by name. But Trump has criticized events where Spencer, the head of a white-identity think tank, played a key role.
In November 2016, a New York Times journalist asked Trump about a recent conference in Washington D.C. of people who pledged allegiance to Nazism. Trump said, "Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn."
Spencer was one of the leaders behind the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017 where a white supremacist rammed a car into a counter protester, killing her.
Trump’s statement on Aug. 12, 2017, cast blame on "many sides", detracting from his overall message condemning bigotry.
"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides," he said. "It's been going on for a long time in our country."
Our ruling
Biden said Trump hasn’t condemned Duke and Spencer. That’s an exaggeration.
We rate this statement Mostly False.

Texto completo: The media are poised to deliver another election victory to President Donald Trump, because their constant bashing of the president turns off many Americans who are middle-of-the-road voters.
The problem with beating Trump relentlessly is that the excess involved makes even the most serious and legitimate criticism of the president and his policies seem like sport — something to indulge in for the mere enjoyment of it, but without any power to bring perspicacity and persuasion to the debate.
Consider the president's visit to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso following the mass shootings that happened in those cities.
I was pleased to see the New York Times carry the headline that read "Trump urges unity vs racism."
I thought that it was decent of the newspaper to put politics aside and focus instead on the unifying aspects of the presidential visit.
My approbation, however, was short-lived. Possibly owing to the intense backlash it received for the headline, the newspaper saw fit to change it to "Assailing hate but not guns."
This, I thought to myself, is not reflective of responsible journalism. Tergiversation is the art form of politicians, not newspapers.
A newspaper shouldn't change a headline because it comes under pressure. Instead, it should explicate the reasons for the headline.
In many instances, the idea of fake news itself is fake, but try telling that to the people who are nonbelievers in the media's honesty.
If Hillary Clinton ever had the chance of winning the presidency, the media spoiled it for her by being less than tough with her on issues and shielding her from proper criticism.
It is good for a candidate to get a thorough cleansing, to have all the issues aired out so that the defining ones become fully framed and do not suffer from distraction and devolution.
I watched the two recent Democratic debates with a fair degree of dismay.
For the most part, the candidates sailed through it without bruising, but that is not what independent voters want.
Immigration, border security, law enforcement, health care, violence in society, and trade cannot be wrapped in gratuitous, sentimental sound bites. However, that is precisely what the candidates seemed to bring to the debate.
I do not bend my feelings toward candidates because they speak of grand schemes like "free tuition for all" and "Medicare for all."
I want to know what mechanism will pay for these programs, and what class of citizens will form the axle and wheels of that mechanism.
I am not interested in any dialog that skirts the real issues and feeds instead on fancies and utopias.
It is the job of debate moderators to pull the candidates away from their comfort zones and talking points with tough and incisive questioning.
Except for two or three sharp exchanges, the debates were boring because the candidates were allowed to walk their political positions with insouciance, and without challenge or contradiction.
A man must have all his weaknesses exposed before he can recognize his strengths. To stand in the soft light of perfection is not to acknowledge the harsh light that falls naturally on all aspects of life and the world.
The man who stumbles and then regains his composure is more attractive politically than another who carefully avoids pitfalls with an unnatural and choreographed walk.
In politics, as in life, the facade of invincibility and flawlessness is easily penetrated by incipient truth and then quickly shattered by it.
Therefore, truth with blemish is a far better accoutrement of politics than disguise and dissimulation.

'The 1619 Project' Hurts Blacks

Texto completo: The New York Times recently released a special 100-page edition of its Sunday magazine arguing that slavery has left an indelible mark on the soul of our nation and that its legacy remains the principle cause of inequities between races. Titled "The 1619 Project" (referencing the arrival of the first black slaves, 400 years ago), the initiative is designed to show that whites have always been and continue to be the beneficiaries of both slavery and its attendant institutional racism -- and blacks the perpetual victims.
This thesis is the consensus of the nearly 20 black scholars, poets and artists who contributed to this issue of the Times magazine, and it will be the mantra of subsequent media coverage as well as various speeches by left-leaning politicians. Most dangerous of all, the Pulitzer Center has packaged the Times project as a curriculum for students of all ages that will be disseminated throughout the country.
Those who cherish the founding vision and values of our nation have critiqued the central premise of the 1619 Project. But criticism should also be voiced by leaders within the black community, whom the project purports to represent. The most devastating aspect of the project's narrative is its insinuation that blacks are born inherently damaged by an all-prevailing racism and that their future prospects are determined by the whims of whites.
Though slavery and discrimination are undeniably a tragic part of our nation's history, America has made strides in its long and tortuous journey to realize its promise and abide by its founding principles. The best way to continue that advancement is to teach people the inspiring stories of those who have achieved in spite of prejudice and bettered the nation. Barraging minorities with constant reminders of the injuries their ancestors suffered only discourages them from working to surmount the obstacles in their way.
In truth, even during the worst periods of oppression, there were blacks who were in slavery but not of slavery. They maintained a strong moral code and a belief in self-determination and mutual support that allowed them to rise despite their enslavement. There were men and women who were born slaves yet died millionaires.
Even in the era of legislated segregation and discrimination before the civil-rights movement, blacks tapped an entrepreneurial legacy to launch thriving enterprises, including hotels, banks, hospitals, dental schools, insurance companies and even a dry dock and railroad company. In fact, the black business district of Durham, N.C., was widely known as "Black Wall Street." This spectrum of achievement is a powerful refutation of the claim that the destiny of black Americans is determined by what whites do -- or what they did in the past.
This empowering spirit is alive today. While the race-grievance purveyors declare that institutional racism destines blacks to lives of poverty and impotence, black people have risen to establish oases of excellence and accomplishment in their communities. My organization, the Woodson Center, was created to draw attention and support their efforts. For nearly 40 years, it has provided resources and technical assistance to thousands of community leaders of all races who have rejuvenated their neighborhoods and empowered the people they serve to improve their lives.
Black America's history of success and achievement -- and its continuing legacy today -- is a vital, inspiring part of our nation's past. It's sadly overlooked in "The 1619 Project." That project also promotes the dangerous idea that the black community is exempt from responsibility to lift itself. To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, some prisons have locks that are on the inside.

Poll: Public backs criticism of journalists, Trump’s attacks ‘appropriate’

Texto completo: In the latest sign that major American media outlets are losing the public’s support, a majority believe it is appropriate for politicians to criticize reporters and hold them to the same scrutiny as those they cover.
A new Rasmussen Reports survey also said most voters believe the average journalist is liberal, and few are conservative.
The survey is an indictment of the media at a time when liberal outlets such as CNN and the New York Times are stepping up their attack on President Trump and congressional Republicans.
Tweet
The outlets are also complaining about Trump’s criticism of them and called out Trump surrogates who are using social media to point out the bias of journalists.
But, said Rasmussen, voters believe that reporters are fair game for criticism.
The survey analysis said 61% of likely U.S. voters think reporters at major news organizations like CNN, Fox News, and the New York Times are public figures who deserve scrutiny. Some 19% disagree.
Tweet
Significantly, 51% said “it is appropriate for elected officials to criticize specific reporters and news organizations,” Rasmussen reported in the survey shared with Secrets before its release. Another 39% view the criticism as a threat to freedom of the press.
That is slightly higher than the 48% who said criticism from politicians was OK back in February 2017 when Trump began singling out news organizations that were attacking him.
And the public continues to view journalists as liberal. The survey said 47% believe the typical reporter is more liberal than they are. Just 19% of voters believe reporters are more conservative than they are.

Texto completo: Prosecutors grilled Greg Craig for more than three hours Wednesday, trying to paint the former Obama White House counsel as deceptive, greedy, and a pawn of Ukraine and Paul Manafort.

Craig, 74, is charged with misleading Justice Department investigators about his role promoting a report written at the behest of the Kremlin-linked government in Ukraine about the country’s controversial prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was tried under President Viktor Yanukovych, a close ally of Manafort. Manafort, a lobbyist and Republican operative, was the chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.
Craig’s case spun off from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia inquiry.
Craig took the stand all day, testifying he did not lie to investigators and that his only involvement in media outreach was to stop the whitewashing of his report's conclusions by Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice or by people working for Manafort, such as right-hand man Rick Gates and publicist Jonathan Hawker. Craig claimed he wanted his report to be portrayed accurately in the media.

But prosecutors say Craig was deceptive about his interactions with David Sanger of the New York Times, pointing out Craig offered Sanger the report ahead of its release, emailed it to him, and hand-delivered a copy to his home. Craig did an interview with Sanger and other reporters.
Craig allegedly schemed to get around the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which mandates anyone working on behalf of a foreign government register with the federal government.

Prosecutors asked about interviews Craig gave in Mueller’s investigation in 2017, attempting to show discrepancies between the answers he gave in 2013 to FBI agents and to the investigators who oversee foreign agent registration and in court. Although the FBI interview notes were not entered into evidence, the prosecutor had parts read aloud in court amid objections from defense attorneys.
Though Craig had also done interviews with Sanger and other journalists about the report put together by law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, & Flom, the prosecutor pointed to interview notes where he told the FBI he only delivered the report to Sanger. Craig replied he told the special counsel he delivered the report but said he had not been deceptive.
The prosecutor also pointed to FBI interviews where Craig claimed he couldn’t remember what was discussed at key events, such as a meeting between himself, Manafort, Hawker, and others at the Harvard Club in 2012, a meeting he described in great detail today.
Craig told the special counsel’s office in another interview he didn’t have any idea why Ukraine would have pressured him on the report, the prosecutor said, despite describing at great length the pressure he felt from Ukraine at the time to go along with the effort to whitewash his report.
But Craig disputed the accuracy of the FBI agent’s official memo.
“I don’t recall saying that,” Craig said.
The prosecution did get Craig to agree Manafort often called the shots, pointing out many decisions were made by Manafort. The prosecutor also said Manafort was “pulling the purse strings.”
“I think that’s right,” Craig replied. “The payment schedule was established by Mr. Manafort.”
Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch, paid more than $4 million for the project, despite Ukraine initially claiming Skadden was hired for $12,000. An email from Craig showed he threatened to walk away from the project unless Skadden received $2 million up front. The money was funneled from Ukraine to Skadden through an account belonging to Manafort located in Cyprus.
“It was Pinchuk’s money but it was transferred through Manafort,” Craig testified.
Craig also admitted he met Manafort associate Konstantin Kilimnik, suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence, in 2011 or 2010 while “pursuing another engagement in Ukraine.” Prosecutors showed an email where Craig described him to Manafort as “wonderful."
In an effort to show Craig's financial motivations, prosecutors pointed to a 2012 draft retainer agreement demanding $150,000 just for Craig to make an initial trip to Ukraine. Prosecutors also showed Craig carefully crafted a letter sent to Ukraine asking for an additional $1.25 million dollars for responsibilities that Skadden was being asked to shoulder, even though the prosecutor got Craig to admit the firm hadn’t taken on new work.
Craig will continue being cross-examined Thursday.

Biden Takes His Turn in the Barrel; He's still on top, notwithstanding a media frenzy over an outlier poll.

Texto completo: In every presidential campaign, each major candidate takes his turn in the barrel. Right now, it's former Vice President Joe Biden's turn to suffer bad press and ultracritical punditry.
His frequent gaffes, routine misremembering and occasional weird observations are partly to blame. When he mistakes New Hampshire for Vermont, recalls Parkland shooting survivors visiting him while he was vice president (the shooting was in 2018) or opines on how bad it would have been if Barack Obama had been assassinated after he became the presumptive Democratic nominee in 2008, many Americans say to themselves: What the heck is up with him?
Yet 298 other people also helped put Mr. Biden into the barrel. That's the number of Democrats surveyed in an Aug. 20 Monmouth University Poll that gave Mr. Biden only 19% support nationwide, compared with 20% for both Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. (Mr. Biden was at 32% in Monmouth's June poll.)
In response, Politico's headline shrieked, "Poll: Bernie, Warren surge to tie Biden" while CBS News and the New York Times declared a "three-way tie" and CNN called it a "three-way lead." These were followed by positive coverage of Ms. Warren's large crowds and deft signaling to her party's establishment that she'll be a team player.
Those swooning over the Monmouth results overlooked that its small sample carried a big margin of error—almost 6 points up or down for each candidate. They also ignored five other surveys conducted within a week of the Monmouth Poll. In those Mr. Biden drew an average of 29% support, Mr. Sanders 19% and Ms. Warren 15%.

Join Paul Gigot in Los Angeles on Wednesday, October 1 for a discussion with Opinion columnists and political experts on the current state of the 2020 election field. Register with WSJ+ .
Maybe those five polls were wrong and Monmouth right. Or maybe political junkies were looking for excuses to escort Mr. Biden to the barrel and Ms. Warren to the spotlight. After all, the Massachusetts Democrat has risen in the RealClearPolitics average from 9% on June 1 to 16.1% on Wednesday, while Mr. Sanders grew from 16.5% to 17.8%, and Mr. Biden slipped from the 35% he enjoyed June 1 to 28.5% today.
Let's be clear, however, about presidential primary polling. First, it is very early. Lots will change. Second, national polls at this point are not definitive—except if you're still polling at zero, in which case you're likely going nowhere. That's why the Democratic contest probably consists of three candidates with a realistic shot, perhaps four and at most five.
Third, national polls matter a lot less than polls in states with early contests. Largely based on name identification at this point, national polls can move quickly when voters really start paying attention right before their local primary. But even then, there will be big fluctuations in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Fourth, it's better to look at the pattern in several recent reliable polls than fixate on one.
Polls are easy to report on. What's much harder to gauge is the quality of each candidate's campaign organization. This matters in the early states, especially Iowa, whose Feb. 3 caucuses kick things off. A top-quality organization in an early state can help a candidate take advantage of any breakthrough moment late this year—think Mr. Obama's speech at the November 2007 Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines—that in turn allows the candidate to beat expectations and gain momentum in what will be a front-loaded contest.
Iowa is where Ms. Warren is pressing Mr. Biden. He has plenty of big-name endorsements there, but she purportedly has built a stronger Hawkeye State ground game. Team Biden is countering by bulking up his staff—now the state's largest—and engaging with every Biden supporter they can find.
The politirati also appear to be souring on Mr. Biden's argument that he is the most electable Democratic candidate. His electability is still widely accepted among older Democrats, even as it's likely to be rejected by younger ones. But guess who votes?
More important, Mr. Biden's campaign implicitly argues that he is the leading traditional Democrat in the race, not a wacky radical with a plan for free everything, bent on transforming America into a progressive paradise. His principal competitors help him appear normal with what they say.
This is not to suggest Mr. Biden has the contest locked up. Voters may react to his ragged performance by deserting him. His two main opponents are ideologically in tune with each other, and collectively they have more support that he does, while Mr. Biden has shown little ability to freshen up his message to keep voters engaged.
Though it feels like this election has been going for an eternity, it's just getting started. Not everyone can run an endurance race. Whoever can may end up with the Democratic nomination.

I Used to Design For Victoria's Secret. Now They're Knocking Me Off. Jennifer Zuccarini led design at Victoria's Secret until founding a lingerie line of her own. Now she says her ex-employer is pilfering her ideas

Texto completo: Designer Jennifer Zuccarini's label Fleur du Mal sells pretty, intricately detailed lingerie. Her wares—mostly undergarments and swimwear—skew traditionally feminine with a high-fashion edge: a silky floral bra in bright pink, a see-through camisole embroidered with glittery butterflies, a high-waist bikini bottom with two lace-up details tying up the front.
One of the line's most popular offerings is its Lily collection, which debuted in 2017, using a silk embroidery pattern created by the mill where Fleur du Mal sources its fabrics, that Zuccarini kept on her inspiration board for a few seasons before incorporating it into various sets.
Zuccarini, 44, says that on July 1, a customer used the live chat function on Fleur du Mal's website to share a link to a Victoria's Secret page offering products that closely resembled the Lily designs. After that, Fleur du Mal continued receiving similar chats, emails and direct messages on social media alerting them to look-alike designs, and before long, others started noticing the collection in the store windows of Victoria's Secret and in its print and television campaigns. The added blow? Zuccarini worked for Victoria's Secret as its design director from 2008 to 2011.
"We were aware that, about six months ago, [Victoria's Secret was] purchasing a lot from our site, all different people, all different places," Zuccarini says during an August 9 interview at her home in downtown Manhattan. "It was very hard to track because it wasn't getting shipped to the Victoria's Secret headquarters." Months passed before the customer messages started coming in. "Everyone [at the office] was freaking out," she says, and with her blessing, several employees decided to send the news to Diet Prada (@diet_prada), an Instagram account that's considered a social media watchdog within the fashion industry.
The account published a slideshow featuring two side-by-side images comparing the Fleur du Mal Lily sets with the Victoria's Secret look-alikes, plus receipts from a $12,656 order of Fleur du Mal products sent to the home address of a Victoria's Secret associate buyer in Columbus, Ohio, plus a screenshot of her LinkedIn profile, her identifying information blocked out. Looking closely at the two very similar sets becomes a game of spot the difference between the silky-looking black bras and matching underwear. The Lily bras in the post retail for $148 and $138, both pairs of underwear for $58. The Victoria's Secret designs, from a collection that debuted this summer, are priced from $40 to $75. (Victoria's Secret declined to comment for this story and has not previously commented on the matter.)
Zuccarini, who hasn't commented on the matter until now, says she fears legal action won't be effective. "It's such a costly path to go down, and we could invest $50,000 in a case that might not go anywhere," she says. "So it was really a dilemma with our team, like what are we supposed to do? The answer couldn't be, do nothing. That's why we wanted to talk about it."
"Jennifer definitely has grounds to sue the panties off of them, if you will," says Susan Scafidi, the founder and director at the Fordham Law School's Fashion Law Institute. Until a couple years ago, Scafidi says, Zuccarini's claim would have probably focused primarily on the lace pattern, but in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled in Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands that two-dimensional patterns were copyrightable. "In the case of the bra, we have a longline bra with triangles, flowers and blocks of semisolid color on the mesh sides—so overall, we have a two-dimensional copyrightable pattern," she says. "The same is true on the panties." Whether or not Zuccarini has registered her copyrights, she has a case. (Copyrights can take a number of months to be granted, she says, and cost $75.)
Victoria's Secret's ongoing battles have been well-chronicled, by The Wall Street Journal and others . The company has posted four straight quarters of year-over-year declines in sales, as women have increasingly flocked to competitors featuring more inclusive body imagery in their campaigns, from American Eagle's Aerie to Rihanna's Savage x Fenty. "Looking to the second half of the year, our No. 1 priority continues to be improving performance at Victoria's Secret," its parent company L brands said in a prepared statement after its stock continued to fall due to the lingerie company's 7 percent decline in sales during the quarter ending June 30. In 2018, former L Brands CMO Edward Razek, who stepped down from his role this month, provoked a social media backlash when he said he didn't think the Victoria's Secret fashion show should include transgender models since it's supposed to present a fantasy. Razek apologized on social media the next day, calling his comments insensitive. The Victoria's Secret fashion show, which has been broadcast on CBS and ABC for almost two decades and has been repeatedly accused of cultural appropriation , is leaving network TV this year due to declining viewership and criticism of the brand for being out of touch. (In an internal memo about the show going off air obtained by CNBC, L Brands CEO Leslie Wexner said , "Fashion is a business of change. We must evolve and change to grow.")
Zuccarini says copying wasn't a part of the company's culture when she was there. "It was a completely different design team. Janie Schaffer, who was our chief creative officer at that time, her mandate was that we're a design-led company," she says. "It's part of the reason they brought people like me on." (Schaffer concurs, via email: "I was very excited to have a great talent like Jennifer. During the six years I was there, we were completely design-led. I never felt the pressure to take [other] designers' work (nor would I have).") Zuccarini was a founder of the small lingerie brand Kiki de Montparnasse in 2005 before leaving in 2008 and joining Victoria's Secret.
Zuccarini isn't the first to accuse the company of copying designs. In 2015, swimsuit designer Ipek Irgit filed a lawsuit accusing the company of copyright infringement over a popular crocheted bikini design, which eventually led to a confidential settlement. (Irgit herself is the defendant in a similar, ongoing lawsuit, accused by Brazilian street artist Maria Solange Ferrarini of stealing her original design, as reported by the New York Times . She declined to comment for this story.) In 2016, Debra MacKinnon, a New Jersey designer who says Victoria's Secret stole the designs for a patent-pending push-up insert she sold them sued the company for a second time after both parties agreed Victoria's Secret was in breach of contract—she alleged the company continued to sell her invention under their name. In 2017, Diet Prada published a post showing the resemblance between the sequin-filled packaging of makeup artist Pat McGrath and the similar packaging Victoria's Secret used for its holiday fragrance offerings. On August 19, the account published yet another post knocking the company, showing how similar new designs were to those of another boutique brand, Agent Provocateur. (MacKinnon and McGrath did not respond to requests for comment. In 2016, MacKinnon told ABC News , "I have put a lot of time, work, energy and investment into my designs and unique inventions and I just want to protect my intellectual property." In 2017, McGrath commented on Diet Prada's post , saying "I LOVE UOOOO @diet_prada" with an effusive series of emojis. Agent Provocateur declined to comment for this story.)
Wexner's mentality, according to Zuccarini, has long been one of, "Let's be second, not first." "Les would talk about, 'Let someone else go and do all the work and we'll take it and make it better,'" she says. "When you think about the brand image and the marketing and Angels, it all came from a department run by people who have been there forever," she adds. "Even if you had this amazing design team and women-led part of the company, all those decisions were still being made by that side. That was still a very male-centric point of view." (Wexner didn't return a request for comment.)
Zuccarini has seen the Victoria's Secret set in real life and says the company "did a pretty good job knocking it off"—but that the quality of the fabrics is different. "We trim ours with silk; theirs is polyester," she says. "In your hands you can tell." Additionally, she says the flowers on the Victoria's Secret set are smaller and shaped slightly differently.
She's started talking to the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) about an initiative to protect smaller designers from being ripped off by bigger brands. "Jennifer reached out and obviously is incredibly frustrated," says Steven Kolb, the CFDA's CEO and president. "I probably get calls similar to that maybe once a month. The success that I've seen in this particular area is what's happening already with her: [media] stories about it and obviously Diet Prada, which didn't exist 10 years ago."

Texto completo: Just when families and communities need naloxone the most, federal authorities are warning that not enough of the overdose-reversing drug is being dispensed.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alarming report recently that the drug is hard to find, particularly in rural communities, which are often hardest hit by the opioid-addiction crisis.
While medical experts recommend that naloxone be dispensed with every painkiller prescription, fewer than 70% of people who get a painkiller prescription also get the naloxone that can save their lives if they overdose, the CDC found.
Naloxone, which is often sold under the brand name Narcan, is useful in reviving overdose victims, especially when they are discovered by family or first responders or even strangers. In many cases, it can reverse an overdose and save victims' lives before an ambulance or other medical help can arrive to help them.
The CDC report says that naloxone is not readily available because physicians are not prescribing it along with painkillers, as they should. Also, the agency report says, the drug can be too expensive or difficult for pharmacies to keep on hand.
We know that better access to naloxone saves lives. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, dramatic and surprising drops in the number of overdose deaths last year are in part credited to wide distribution and use of naloxone.
The same agency now sounding the alarm about a slowdown in naloxone dispersal - the CDC - released the overdose-death statistics earlier this summer. That data showed that in Pennsylvania and Ohio, 2018 overdose deaths had declined by as much as 20% from 2017. That change reverses a terrifying trend of several years when the overdose-death rates had risen by that much or more annually. And it means about 1,000 fewer people in each statedied from an accidental overdose in 2018 than in 2017.
The opioid epidemic has taken a terrible toll across the country, but Pennsylvania has routinely been among the hardest-hit states. Solving the crisis will require much more than improving access to the drug that can reverse overdoses: more drug abuse prevention and education, better access to detox and drug treatment, better alternatives to the opioid painkillers that have ensnared many in the grip of addiction.
Even with the slight drop in deaths last year, the overdose-death rate in the United States is about seven times higher than it was a generation ago.
The CDC report called for doctors and pharmacies to be sure prescription painkillers are always accompanied by naloxone. Insurance companies can help by making sure the drug is not prohibitively expensive.
But many overdose victims are not falling victim to drugs they were recently prescribed. For many, an opioid addiction continues long after the prescription is gone but their addiction has taken hold. These victims may overdose on illicit prescription painkillers, or heroin, or even synthetic fentanyl, bought on the street.
Making naloxone readily available, over the counter or through community distribution programs, is also essential.

Texto completo: Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook who recently called for the social-media behemoth to be broken up, is listing his downtown New York townhouse for $26 million.
Mr. Hughes and his husband, political activist Sean Eldridge, are selling to move into a new home with their expanding family, said their agent, Maria Pashby of the Corcoran Group, who is listing the property with her daughter Joanna Pashby.
Messrs. Hughes and Eldridge bought the property for $22.3 million in 2015, property records show. They declined to comment.
Located in Greenwich Village, the 1840s-era Greek Revival townhouse is about 6,000 square feet and has four bedrooms, Maria Pashby said. It has front and rear living room areas on the parlor floor, each with wood-burning fireplaces, making for a large entertaining space. The master suite spans a full floor, with a large dressing room, a fireplace, two bathrooms and a terrace. The basement level includes a gym, a screening room and a wine cellar.
There are outdoor spaces on almost every floor, including a garden on the roof, Maria Pashby said. At the rear of the property there is a small carriage house with a finished roof garden that is connected to the main house via an underground walkway.
The property had been renovated and restored by the previous owner, but the couple installed new smart home systems to make the home more efficient. They also reduced the number of bedrooms in favor of more living spaces.
Mr. Hughes, 35, made headlines this spring when he called publicly for Facebook to be broken up. Mr. Eldridge, 33, ran unsuccessfully for Congress in New York in 2014, and is widely know for his advocacy for same-sex marriage.

New poll has Sanders, Warren, and Biden in dead heat

Texto completo: A new national poll suggests the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination may be tightening, with a virtual three-way tie between former vice president Joe Biden and two more progressive rivals, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
Despite the dead heat — Sanders and Warren each with 20 percent support among Democratic voters and Biden with 19 percent — the Monmouth University Poll released Monday may hint at a concerning trend for the candidacy of Biden, the poll's previous front-runner, whose support declined from 32 percent when the poll was taken in June.
Sanders of Vermont and Warren of Massachusetts both picked up several percentage points of support since June. Voters were asked whom they would support among 23 Democratic candidates.
Patrick Murray, who runs the polling institute at Monmouth, in West Long Branch, N.J., said the poll suggested the race for the Democratic nomination was tightening.
“The main takeaway from this poll is that the Democratic race has become volatile," Murray said. “Liberal voters are starting to cast about for a candidate they can identify with. Moderate voters, who have been paying less attention, seem to be expressing doubts about Biden."
Murray cautioned that the results were just “one snapshot from one poll." The poll of 800 voters included 298 people considered registered Democrats or Democratic-leaning and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points within that group. The national poll was conducted by telephone from Aug. 16 to 20.
New York Times
White House states Melania Trump has never met Kim
President Trump on Monday claimed that first lady Melania Trump has "gotten to know" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, prompting the White House to clarify that the two have never met.
Trump made the comment at a news conference at the Group of 7 summit in Biarritz, France. While answering a question about Iran, he took a detour to discuss the country's real estate potential, then pivoted to North Korea.
"I also say that, by the way, with respect to North Korea, Kim Jong Un — who I've gotten to know extremely well; the first lady had gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she'd agree with me — he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential," Trump said.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement soon after noting the first lady has never met Kim.
"President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim — and while the First Lady hasn't met him, the President feels like she's gotten to know him too," she said.

Prosecutors near decision on whether to indict McCabe
Federal prosecutors in Washington appear to be in the final stages of deciding whether to indict Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director and a frequent target of President Trump, on charges of lying to federal agents, according to interviews with people familiar with recent developments in the investigation.
In two meetings last week, McCabe's lawyers met with the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen, who is expected to be involved in the decision about whether to prosecute, and for more than an hour with the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jessie K. Liu, according to a person familiar with the meetings. The person would not detail the discussions, but defense lawyers typically meet with top law enforcement officials to try to persuade them not to indict their client if they failed to get prosecutors to drop the case.
An indictment of a former top FBI official is extremely rare and would be the latest chapter in the saga of McCabe, who was fired last year over the issue now under criminal investigation — whether he failed to be forthcoming with internal investigators examining the FBI's dealings with the media.
McCabe, a 21-year FBI veteran, was fired in March 2018 after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions rejected an appeal that would have let him retire within days with a full pension. McCabe has said his dismissal was politically motivated and meant to undermine the special counsel's Russia investigation by trying to discredit him.
New York Times
Sarah Sanders has website, eyes possible bid for office
Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Monday unveiled a campaign-style website highlighting her close ties to President Trump, a moved that stoked speculation that she will make a 2022 bid for governor of Arkansas.
The site, which Sanders announced in a tweet, describes her as a "trusted confidante" of Trump and quotes him calling her "irreplaceable," a "warrior," and a "very special person with extraordinary talents."
Visitors are invited to sign up for e-mail updates on Sanders's activities.
Trump has encouraged Sanders to make a Republican gubernatorial bid in her home state, saying she would be "fantastic." Last month, Sanders's father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, confirmed her interest during a radio interview in which the Republican said she would start exploring a possible run following some down time.
Sanders served as Trump's press secretary from July 2017 until late June, when she resigned. Fox News announced last week that it had hired Sanders as a contributor.
Washington Post
House panel subpoenas former White House aide
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House aide Rob Porter on Monday, the panel's latest attempt to try to move public opinion in favor of impeaching President Trump.
Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, said in a statement that the panel had issued the summons to Porter, seeking his testimony on Sept. 17.
The committee's summons to Porter comes as it plans to continue laying out a case that Trump obstructed justice. The Judiciary Committee, which has impeachment jurisdiction, is considering whether to draft articles of impeachment against the president in the fall as 133 House Democrats have called for starting proceedings to oust the president.
Porter, the former White House staff secretary who left amid allegations of domestic violence in previous relationships, was a central witness in former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. He saw Trump lash out at former White House counsel Donald McGahn for not firing Mueller, according to Mueller's report.

Texto completo: Labor Day weekend promises plenty of fun and entertainment in and around Atlanta. But bookworms know that there is but one place to be: the AJC Decatur Book Festival.
More than 250 authors will appear on 13 stages during the 14th annual AJC Decatur Book Festival Aug. 30-Sept. 1.
Festivalgoers who gravitate toward food will undoubtedly follow the smells to the culinary stage, where a talented lineup of cookbook authors, chefs and drink writers will chat about their craft and entertain the crowd with cooking demonstrations. Located again on the MARTA plaza, the stage will see action from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, and from noon to 6 p.m. Sunday.
Kicking things off on Saturday will be Peter Reinhart, author of the new "Perfect Pan Pizza." The bread authority has penned a dozen books about baking, including the James Beard Award-winning "The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread," as well as "American Pie: My Search for the Perfect Pizza." The North Carolina-based culinarian will share his knowledge about mastering pizza dough while demonstrating how to cook it on a Big Green Egg.
Chef Bruce Moffett, a native New Englander now firmly fixed in Charlotte, will discuss how he weaves together northern and southern culinary traditions, the focus of his new cookbook "Bruce Moffett Cooks: A New England Chef in a New South Kitchen."
Among familiar hometown faces taking the stage this year are big name restaurateurs Pano Karatassos and Ford Fry, both of whom have added cookbook author to their impressive résumés.
Karatassos, executive chef of Kyma and corporate chef for Buckhead Life Restaurant Group, will share stories and recipes featured in his "Modern Greek Cooking: 100 Recipes for Meze, Entrées and Desserts." Many of those dishes which are influenced from his childhood as well as tutelage under esteemed chefs Thomas Keller, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Eric Ripert and have become crowd favorites at Karatassos's upscale Greek restaurant in Buckhead.
Since opening JCT Kitchen in 2007, Fry has gone on to build a formidable restaurant empire. His Rocket Farm Restaurants group now operates a dozen concepts across three states -- Georgia, Texas and North Carolina - with Tennessee next on the radar.
Fry's casual restaurants Superica, El Felix and, the newest addition, Little Rey, are all inspired and informed by his Texas roots, ones that the Houston native shares in his recently published "Tex-Mex" cookbook. "It's Tex-Mex that makes me feel most at home," he writes.
Whereas Atlanta is Fry's adopted hometown, the festival will be a sort of homecoming for New Orleans-based chef Tenney Flynn. The Stone Mountain native will return to his old stomping grounds to discuss his new book, "The Deep End of Flavor," written with former AJC food editor Susan Puckett. Flynn is a highly regarded seafood authority and co-owner of GW Fins seafood restaurant. He'll discuss his tips and tricks for turning the freshest catch into a delicious dish while demoing how to break down a whole fish.
From barbecue to peaches to pie, there will be plenty of other talk to pique the interest of Southern food lovers. Barbecue legend Sam Jones of Skylight Inn in Ayden, North Carolina will preach the gospel of Carolina barbecue, the topic of his new cookbook, "Whole Hog BBQ," as the smoke from chicken wings wafts through the tent during his demo.
Lovers of barbecue culture will get an entertaining mouthful of stories from author and veteran journalist Jim Auchmutey. The former longtime AJC reporter and editor and consulting curator for the "Barbecue Nation" exhibit at the Atlanta History Center will discuss his new book, "Smokelore: A Short History of Barbecue in America." Apart from sharing his own family's connection to barbecue and spelling out what defines Georgia barbecue, expect Auchmutey to weave together barbecue's complex connection to race, gender, immigration, commercialization and more.
Meanwhile, chef and food writer Belinda Smith-Sullivan will stick to peaches, the topic of her new book, "Just Peachy." A granddaughter of Mississippi sharecroppers, she currently lives in Trenton, South Carolina, in the heart of South Carolina's peach region. Fill up on peach history and learn creative ways to add peaches to everything from breads to beverages - and of course, pie.
You might not expect a duo of doctors to be blue-ribbon bakers, but you'll believe it when you meet Paul Arguin and Chris Taylor. With their bold, unorthodox baking style, the Atlanta-based pair has won hundreds of awards, including the 2017 National Pie Championships title. They share their recipe for success in their mouthwatering "The New Pie: Modern techniques for the classic American dessert."
Also talking desserts will be Elizabeth Karmel. Actually, she'll be talking cake and steak, the decadent pairing that gives headline to her new special occasions "Steak and Cake" cookbook.
Although not held on the culinary stage, two other discussions during the weekend will focus on food writing. Author Erin Byers Murray will chat about "Grits: A Cultural and Culinary Journey Through the South," while Ryan Jacobs will speak about "The Truffle Underground: A Tale of Mystery, Mayhem, and Manipulation in the Shadowy Market of the World's Most Expensive Fungus."
"It's a diverse representation in terms of cuisine," said the festival's programming director Joy Pope about this year's lineup. "If you're looking for food, it's terrific."
If you're looking for a good drink, you won't be disappointed either, especially with Alex Day in the house. Day is the co-owner of the highly regarded Death & Co, with locations in New York and Denver, as well as the Los Angeles-based hospitality group behind such concepts as Nitecap, Walker Inn and Honeycut. He recently penned "The Cocktail Codex: Fundamentals, Formulas, Evolutions" with business partner David Kaplan and writer Nick Fauchald, offering a scientific approach to mixing drinks that earned this bar manual the James Beard Foundation 2019 Book of the Year.
In full disclosure, I'll be moderating the culinary stage on Saturday. New York Times correspondent Kim Severson will serve as emcee on Sunday.

Beheading journalists, the N-word, and racist Obama voters: Joe Walsh's long history of incendiary bigotry

Texto completo: Joe Walsh, who announced a primary run against President Trump on Sunday, has a long history of anti-Muslim comments, racist remarks, conspiracy theories, violent rhetoric, and more.
And the apologies Walsh has offered about his past and the claims about when he decided he could no longer support Trump appear less than forthcoming.
Walsh, 57, a former one-term Illinois congressman elected as a Republican in the Tea Party wave of 2010, underwent a political evolution over the years, from failed pro-choice congressional and statehouse runs in the 1990s to running as a pro-lifer with no exceptions when losing his seat in 2012. Now, he has completed the journey from exclaiming he would be "grabbing my musket” if Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump in 2016 to challenging the president in 2020.
Tweet
The longtime Chicago radio shock jock teased his presidential run earlier this month in a New York Times op-ed before making it official in a media spree weekend. He is being encouraged by Never Trump leaders such as Bill Kristol, despite Walsh claiming last year that Kristol’s Twitter feed was “like a continuous documentation of the impact Trump Derangement Syndrome has on a person.”

Now Walsh is facing questions about his own fitness, too.
Walsh joined ABC's This Week on Sunday and was asked about racial comments he’d made targeting former President Barack Obama, with George Stephanopoulos bringing up a 2017 tweet where Walsh said the former president “was held to a lower standard cuz he was black.” Walsh made that argument many times over the years. Stephanopoulos called this “textbook racism,” and Walsh responded by saying Trump had “made me reflect on some of the things I’ve said in the past.”

Walsh’s comments about Obama’s race also include a June 2016 claim that “the single greatest act of racism in American history was the election of Barack Obama.” Walsh also tweeted in December 2015 that the only problem with a Washington Post cartoon depicting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s children as monkeys was that they wouldn’t do the same for Obama’s daughters.
Tweet
Stephanopoulos brought up Walsh’s claims that Obama was a secret Muslim and asked if he really believed that.
“God no,” Walsh said. “And I’ve apologized for that.”
Walsh admits that for years he falsely promoted the “Obama is a Muslim” conspiracy theory to his hundreds of thousands of followers, propounding it as recently as February 2018.
Tweet
Walsh also repeatedly insisted Obama was a “traitor."
“If I called Barack Obama a traitor, yes I apologize,” Walsh tweeted this weekend. Walsh called Obama a traitor on Twitter at least seven times, as recently as November 2016.

Walsh also promoted Birtherism, the conspiracy theory, also pushed by Trump before he ran for president, that Obama was not born in America multiple times.
Walsh repeatedly pushed the baseless Seth Rich conspiracy theory in 2017. He now claims Trump questioning the U.S. intelligence assessment about Russian interference while in Helsinki in July 2018 is when Trump “lost me for good.” But Walsh was still sharing pro-Trump content on Facebook months after Helsinki, including an October 2018 meme that proclaimed “it’s so great that Hillary Clinton isn’t President!”
Tweet
Walsh also has a long history of anti-Muslim tweets. Walsh apologized earlier this month and claimed he’d “always meant to say Islamists are the problem” and “not all Muslims,” but a review of his social media accounts indicates this is not the case. He made his animosity toward the religion known through hundreds of tweets and social posts. One Facebook post shared on his page in September 2016 listed “Muslims” as one of the four reasons he supported Trump.
Tweet
Walsh also repeatedly questioned the existence of any “moderate Muslims” for years on Twitter, as recently as 2017.

After a terrorist attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in 2015, Walsh hoped for violence against U.S. media outlets.
Tweet
Walsh also has a lengthy record of racist commentary directed toward black people.

In the wake of shootings that killed five Dallas police officers in 2016, Walsh tweeted, then deleted a call for "war."

"Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks," Walsh said. "Real America is coming after you.”

Walsh tweeted in 2018 that “Haiti is a shithole and it's run by blacks” and “the violence in Chicago is all black on black.”
Tweet
Walsh also deflected from stories about possible police misconduct by pointing to black-on-black crime instead. One tweet from Walsh in 2016 even denied the existence of any police shootings against black people.

Walsh has also referred to a “war on whites,” said Democrats have turned blacks into “uneducated government slaves,” suggested he wants “quotas for whites in BET Awards,” claimed “millions of white people died so blacks could be free,” said “once again blacks in America try to burn their own neighborhood down,” and tweeted “I have a right to say blacks are lazy and the Irish are drunks.”

“I would have been run out of DC if I tried to launch the Congressional White Caucus,” Walsh complained in 2016. “That's not right.”

Walsh also repeatedly expressed his frustration at not being allowed to use the N-word.
Tweet
Similarly, Walsh was repeatedly upset that calling someone a “fag” had consequences.

Walsh’s longtime association with white nationalist Paul Nehlen, who was twice supported by Walsh in doomed primary attempts against former congressman Paul Ryan, will also give the presidential hopeful headaches. Just a couple days after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Walsh had the anti-Semite on his radio show. Nehlen was a known "pizzagate" conspiracy promoter and had spent the weekend retweeting alt-right celebrations of Charlottesville. Walsh called Nehlen “my friend” and told his listeners to visit Nehlen’s campaign website.

Walsh’s own personal behavior will be scrutinized, too, including the $117,000 in child support he allegedly owed his ex-wife until 2012.

The former congressman reacted angrily to his own constituents during a town hall in 2011.

Texto completo: The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House staff secretary Rob Porter as part of its investigation into whether President Trump obstructed justice.
The subpoena seeking Mr. Porter's appearance before the panel is Democrats' latest bid to compel a Trump associate to publicly detail allegations that the president sought to interfere in former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The committee's chairman, Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), has said his probe could lead the panel to recommend that the House vote to impeach the president.
Share your Thoughts
If Rob Porter were to testify, do you think he would provide information that would move House Democrats closer to impeaching President Trump? Join the conversation below.
The subpoena calls for Mr. Porter to appear on Sept. 17. Mr. Porter's lawyer didn't respond to a request for comment, and the White House declined to comment.
"Any other American would have been prosecuted based on the evidence Special Counsel Mueller uncovered in his report," Mr. Nadler said in a statement. "Rob Porter was prominently featured in the Special Counsel's description of President Trump's efforts to obstruct justice by directing then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire the Special Counsel, and then ordering him to lie about it."
Until his resignation in February 2018, Mr. Porter was an influential figure in the White House and as staff secretary had regular access to the president. He witnessed or was briefed on several alleged episodes that play a central role in Mr. Mueller's report , released in April.
The report stated that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and sought to help Mr. Trump win the White House, and the report outlined efforts by the president to curtail or shut down the investigation. The special counsel didn't pursue charges of obstruction of justice and didn't establish a criminal conspiracy between Russians and the Trump campaign. In congressional testimony last month, Mr. Mueller repeatedly directed lawmakers to the report.
Russia denies meddling in U.S. elections, and the president has called the special counsel probe a "witch hunt."

Mr. Porter, who took contemporaneous notes about his experiences in the White House, sat for interviews with Mr. Mueller's investigators for two days, and his recollections and notes are cited dozens of times in the report.
In one interview with the special counsel office, Mr. Porter recounted that Mr. Trump had asked him in 2017 whether then-Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand was "on the team" and interested in becoming attorney general and overseeing the Mueller probe, according to the report. Mr. Trump had become frustrated with then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his recusal from the investigation.
Though Mr. Trump had pressed him on the matter several times, Mr. Porter didn't reach out to Ms. Brand, the report cited him as saying. But Mr. Porter "understood the President to want to find someone to end the Russia investigation or fire the Special Counsel, although the President never said so explicitly," according to the report.
Mr. Porter also told investigators, according to the report, that the president directed him to tell then-White House counsel Don McGahn to create a record to counter a 2018 New York Times article. According to that report, Mr. Trump had instructed Mr. McGahn to tell the Justice Department to remove the special counsel. Mr. McGahn refused to carry out his order and subsequently declined to refute the Times article, saying that its central claim—Mr. Trump's desire to oust the special counsel—was accurate, according to the Mueller report.
In some cases, Mr. Porter was either the only person or one of a handful of aides who were present when Mr. Trump made comments that are cited in the report. For example, Mr. Porter was present at a December 2017 Oval Office meeting in which the president allegedly suggested that Mr. Sessions "unrecuse" himself from the Mueller probe. In January 2018, Mr. Porter recalled to investigators that Mr. Trump told him he was considering replacing Mr. Sessions and wanted to "clean house" at the Justice Department.
Mr. Porter, who resigned amid domestic abuse allegations, is the latest Trump associate to receive a subpoena from the committee. It has also subpoenaed Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign manager, and Rick Dearborn, his former deputy White House chief of staff, this month. Messrs. Lewandowski and Dearborn were also subpoenaed to testify on Sept. 17.
The White House has sought to limit former administration officials' testimony to Congress, in some cases instructing them not to answer questions about their time working for the president.
Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's former communications director, appeared before the panel in June in a closed session but refused to answer many of the panel's questions .
Mr. McGahn is facing a lawsuit aimed at forcing him to testify before the committee after the White House in May directed him to rebuff the panel's subpoena.

How to balance your back-to-school budget

Texto completo: I remember as I was growing up, I always thought school was free. I mean, I understood that private school costs money, but I went to public school, and I didn't think a whole lot about the expenses associated with it.
Now that I'm older, I realize how much parents actually spend on their kids when they go back to school. In fact, the National Retail Federation reports parents plan to spend $696 on back-to-school supplies this year. Isn't that crazy?
There are the obvious school supplies like notebooks, markers (my favorite!), and backpacks. And as a kid, I always needed new clothes and shoes. But there's not-so-obvious ones that nickel-and-dime you to death.
One of my coworkers told me that he had to buy football gear for his son that totaled $260. Understandably, it gave him a bit of sticker shock. There's nothing wrong with paying for this kind of thing if you have the money, but you still need to have a plan for how you're going to pay for it.
As the school year is gearing back up, it's important to make a list of things you need to budget for. So, think about these categories and come up with a dollar amount you plan to spend in each one:
School supplies
Uniforms
Sports equipment
Fall clothes and shoes
Meal plans
Fees for clubs, sports, band, and other extracurricular activities
I'd like to point out that this is a great time of year to teach your kids that money isn't in infinite supply. Teach them the value of working within a budget! They don't need the trendy name-brand shoes, or the flashy notebook that costs more. You're setting your kids up to win when they understand money can – and often does – run out.
Now, if you've already busted your back-to-school budget, here's what you can do:
Get your budget back on track. Where can you cut back this month to make up for the overspending? Is there anything lying around the house you can sell? Can you pick up some extra hours at work?
Plan for future school expenses. Once school is back in session, there will be other costs that come up. School pictures, yearbooks, field trips and more extracurricular activities are just around the corner. And now you know how to get ahead of them.
I know paying for all these school expenses can feel overwhelming, but if you plan ahead and pay with cash, you'll feel a lot better when September rolls around.

U.S. News: Trump Faces New Opponent In Primary

Texto completo: Former Rep. Joe Walsh launched a long-shot Republican presidential campaign on Sunday, casting the current occupant of the White House as a failed leader.
"Donald Trump doesn't represent us -- he represents the worst of us," Mr. Walsh said in a statement on his website. "He hasn't delivered on his promises, he thinks he's above the law, and he's tweeting us into a recession, as we speak."
Mr. Walsh, 57 years old, entered Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010 when Republicans took over the House. He served just one term representing Illinois, losing in 2012 to Democrat Tammy Duckworth.
He then became a radio host and Trump supporter before turning against the president.
He has long history of controversial comments, including suggesting wrongly that President Obama is Muslim. Mr. Walsh expressed regret for those remarks in a New York Times opinion piece this month.
In that piece he positioned himself to the right of Mr. Trump, raising concerns about growing budget deficits.
William Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, is also running against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination, but he has gotten little attention. Other figures are considering potential runs, including former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran for the GOP nomination in 2016.
Mr. Trump's campaign brushed off Mr. Walsh's announcement. "Whatever," said campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.

Life &amp; Arts: After MeToo, Films Face Test --- New movies from scrutinized directors show in theaters overseas, but maybe not in the U.S.

Texto completo: Woody Allen's latest film screened in Poland and Lithuania, but may never come to U.S. theaters. Roman Polanski's new movie, his 13th since fleeing the U.S. in 1978, will compete at the Venice Film Festival but has yet to find a stateside distributor.
Nate Parker, a one-time Sundance Film Festival darling whose career derailed when his alleged involvement in an earlier rape case gained new attention, is hoping American distributors will pick up his new feature about a man who feels wronged by the justice system.
The #MeToo movement intensified scrutiny on the personal lives of many in Hollywood. Now, these three directors are trying to steer the focus back toward their work -- but they're doing it overseas for now. In the next several weeks, new films by the three directors will screen in international markets, but their fate in the U.S. remains uncertain.
If Mr. Allen's film "A Rainy Day in New York" fails to find U.S. distribution, it would be the first in his 53-year directing career not to screen here.
The uncertain destiny reflects the still-forming response to filmmakers amid the #MeToo movement, which began in late 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct against producer Harvey Weinstein.
The allegations put the brakes on a slew of movies, from the Gore Vidal biopic starring Kevin Spacey that Netflix Inc. shelved indefinitely after the actor was accused of sexually harassing young men, to "The Current War," a drama produced by Mr. Weinstein that will hit U.S. theaters in October, nearly two years after its originally scheduled debut. Mr. Spacey, who denies or says he doesn't remember the alleged incidents, saw charges in one case dropped in July.
Besides showing in Poland and Lithuania, Mr. Allen's "Rainy Day" film is scheduled for release in a handful of other European countries.
"Rainy Day" lost its U.S. release in 2018 when Amazon Studios canceled distribution of the film as earlier accusations of sexual misconduct became a topic of renewed public debate amid the #MeToo movement. Earlier this year, Mr. Allen sued the studio for $68 million, claiming breach of contract over the termination of his four-picture deal. An Amazon Studios spokesperson said the company will not comment on ongoing litigation.
Mr. Allen's adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, in recent years has spoken openly about her claims that Mr. Allen sexually molested her in the early 1990s. Ms. Farrow criticized people who have worked with the director in a New York Times piece in 2014 before discussing the matter further in a 2018 television interview.
Mr. Allen, 83 years old, has repeatedly denied the accusations he sexually abused Ms. Farrow. The Connecticut State Attorney investigated allegations against Mr. Allen but didn't charge him.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Allen declined to respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Parker's and Mr. Polanski's films are using debuts at this year's Venice Film Festival, which starts Wednesday, to try to sell distribution rights.
Both men were accused of rape in the U.S. Mr. Polanski fled to France while awaiting sentencing in 1978. Mr. Parker was acquitted at trial in 2001. Both directors' new films explore miscarriages of justice.
Mr. Polanski's "An Officer and a Spy" examines the real-life Dreyfus affair, an infamous episode of antisemitism in which a turn-of-the-century French military officer was falsely accused of espionage on scant evidence. In some markets, it will go by a different title: "J'accuse."
Since fleeing to Europe, Mr. Polanski has had an erratic career. He won the Oscar for best director for his 2002 Holocaust drama "The Pianist," but many of his recent films have failed to gain traction in the U.S.
The #MeToo movement put the spotlight back on Mr. Polanski and allegations that in the 1970s he raped a teenage girl. Mr. Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse, but has maintained that the girl had consented. Before his sentencing, Mr. Polanski fled the U.S., fearing a longer term than what his lawyers believed they had worked out previously.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Polanski didn't respond to request for comment.
"American Skin" stars Mr. Parker, 39 years old, as a Marine veteran who confronts a police officer who was acquitted after shooting the veteran's son.
"It becomes '12 Angry Men,' set in a police station," said producer Mark Burg, who co-financed the film's $5 million budget with Tarak Ben Ammar, a producer and distributor who as a Weinstein Co. board member fired Mr. Weinstein following news of his misconduct allegations. Mr. Weinstein has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex.
Before backing the project, Mr. Ben Ammar says he read more than 600 pages of transcripts from Mr. Parker's trial in 2001. "I like the underdog," he said. "But I need to have the opinion that the underdog is a good guy."
Back in 2016, Mr. Parker appeared headed to the Oscars, thanks to his movie "The Birth of a Nation," about slave rebellion leader Nat Turner.
Following a rapturous Sundance premiere, he sold the movie to Fox Searchlight for $17.5 million -- a record for the festival.
But that enthusiasm faded overnight when the earlier rape allegation gained new attention in Hollywood and on social media. "Birth of a Nation" ended up collecting $15.8 million at the domestic box office -- almost $2 million less than Fox paid for it.
Mr. Parker declined to comment.

Texto completo: History is the most humbling and humanizing of subjects. It opens reality to us in all its gorgeous variety, from the earthbound lives of ordinary peasants and servants to the rarefied universe of the mighty and wealthy, and the astonishing range of human experience in between. It seeks to provide a balanced and honest record of humanity's achievements and enormities alike, generous enough to acknowledge the mixture of motives that every one of us flawed humans bring to life's tasks.
That, at any rate, is how it ought to be. But instead of expanding our minds and hearts, history is increasingly used to narrow them. Instead of helping us to deepen ourselves and take a mature and complex view of the past, history is increasingly employed as a simple bludgeon, which picks its targets mechanically -- often based on little more than a popular cliche -- and strikes.
The best example may be the evergreen argumentum ad Hitlerum, in which every evil from bigotry and militarism to vegetarianism and appreciation of Wagner's operas is referred to the transcendentally evil standard of Nazism. The detention centers on America's southern border should be called "concentration camps," according to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When questioned, the young, irrepressible Democrat advised Americans: "This is an opportunity for us to talk about how we learn from our history." But that history isn't ours. By invoking such an emotionally laden term, she was playing on a potent theme, but in a way that underscored the limited range of her historical reference, as well as the public's.
A more disturbing example is the pell-mell rush to pass judgment against heroes of the past and tear down or rename the monuments to them -- including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson. Are we really so faint of heart that we can no longer bear to allow the honoring of great men of the past who fail in some respects to meet our current specifications?
It's true that all three men held either slaves or racist beliefs. Does that exhaust everything we need to know about them? Ought it to outweigh the value of everything else they did? For those who say yes, the transformation of history into a weapon depends upon a brutal simplification of the historical record. Such is the approach of the New York Times's audacious "1619 Project," which argues "that nearly everything that has made America exceptional grew out of slavery."
A genuinely historical approach would acknowledge, even insist on recognizing, that Washington owned slaves. It would go on to consider that fact from the larger perspective of a long, important and consequential life. It would weigh Washington's beliefs and actions carefully in the context of their time, and would take into account his decision to free his slaves at the time of his death.
That kind of respectful detail and complexity seems to be leaving with yesterday's fashions. Instead, we get patent idiocy. The San Francisco School Board voted in June to spend up to $600,000 to paint over a high school's mural depicting the life of Washington. Two weeks ago it voted to cover up the artwork instead -- a compromise. The 1,600-square-foot mural was painted in 1935 by a communist who sought to include Washington's ownership of slaves as part of a complex portrait of him. But the school board decided that complexity was too disturbing to teenagers, and that the mural was racist and degrading in its depiction of black and Native American people. Better to have plain white walls -- or morality tales depicting "the heroism of people of color in America," as is the new plan -- than to tell a complicated story about an American hero.
The weaponizing of history corresponds invariably with a remarkable hostility to history. Its practitioners are content to slice a single fact out of a web of details, then repeat that fact with the stubbornness of protesters who have memorized a chant.
This aggressive historical simplification is at the core of the cult of intersectionality, which now rules American college campuses. The language of unchallengeable collective grievance relies on history for its authority. Notice how concepts such as "historically underrepresented" and "historically marginalized" are used to certify groups that deserve to be favored automatically in the present.
The condition of any particular person doesn't have a reliable relationship to that aggregate group victimization. But the key move is to draw on the authority of history to construct unanswerable arguments in every dispute, and always refer individual cases to the invincible aggregate norm.
Why study the past? Today, the point is too often to gain ever better weapons to use in present battles, ever more unanswerable supports for our grievances. This argument from history is potent precisely because it relies on conclusions drawn from data that are no longer ready at hand. It all comes out of a black box called History.
But that cannot last forever. Once history becomes a club, it quickly loses its credibility as history. The grossly exaggerated claims of the Times's "1619 Project" are likely to bring on just such discredit.
Done right, history rescues precious memories from the darkness into which they would otherwise disappear, forging a sense of continuity with the past. If we care about history, we now must rescue it from its crudest instrumentalizers and insist upon its richness and complexity. Our task is to recover the humane insight of Herbert Butterfield, who taught that the historian should be a "recording angel" rather than a "hanging judge" -- let alone a summary executioner.

Texto completo: Seattle • On gritty streets where heroin, fentanyl and meth stride like Death Eaters, where for decades both drugs and the war on drugs have wrecked lives, the city of Seattle is pioneering a bold approach to narcotics that should be a model for America.
Anyone caught here with a small amount of drugs — even heroin — isn’t typically prosecuted. Instead, that person is steered toward social services to get help.
This model is becoming the consensus preference among public health experts in the U.S. and abroad. Still, it shocks many Americans to see no criminal penalty for using drugs illegally, so it takes courage and vision to adopt this approach: a partial retreat in the war on drugs coupled with a stepped-up campaign against addiction.
The war on drugs has been one of America’s most grievous mistakes, resulting in as many citizens with arrest records as with college diplomas. At last count, an American was arrested for drug possession every 25 seconds, yet the mass incarceration this leads to has not turned the tide on narcotics.
The number of opioid users has surged, and more Americans now die each year from overdoses than perished in the Vietnam, Afghan and Iraq wars combined. And that doesn’t account for the way drug addiction has ripped apart families and stunted children’s futures. More than 2 million children in America live with a parent suffering from an illicit-drug dependency.
So Seattle is undertaking what feels like the beginning of a historic course correction, with other cities discussing how to follow. This could be far more consequential than the legalization of pot: By some estimates, nearly half of Americans have a family member or close friend enmeshed in addiction, and if the experiment in Seattle succeeds, we’ll have a chance to rescue America from our own failed policies.
In effect, Seattle is decriminalizing the use of hard drugs. It is relying less on the criminal justice toolbox to deal with hard drugs and more on the public health toolbox.
Decriminalization is unfolding here in part because of Dan Satterberg, the prosecuting attorney for King County, which includes Seattle. It’s also arguably underway because of what happened to his little sister, Shelley Kay Satterberg.
At the age of 14, Shelley ran away from home because her parents wouldn’t let her go to a concert on a school night. It was a rebellion that proved devastating. She was away for several months, was gang-raped by two men, was introduced to hard drugs and began to self-medicate with those drugs to deal with the trauma of rape.
As Dan Satterberg rose through the ranks of prosecutors, Shelley Satterberg wrestled with addiction. She was never arrested or jailed (middle-class drug users often avoid police attention, which focuses on marginalized people who use or sell in public).
Dan told me that he was angry at Shelley — angry that she had made terrible choices, angry that she had hurt their parents. But over time he also concluded that his own approach of prosecuting drug users accomplished little, except that it isolated them from the family and friends who offered the best support system to escape addiction.
In 2015, Dan took Shelley to Navos, a nonprofit that provides mental health and addiction services, and she was able to stop using street drugs and gradually put her life back in order. Dan saw that treatment made a huge difference in Shelley’s life and became a believer.
Yet it wasn’t enough. Shelley died of a urinary tract infection last year at age 51, a consequence of previous drug and alcohol abuse.
“It gave me some insight about what works better than jail,” Dan Satterberg told me. “What Shelley needed was not a jail cell and not a judge wagging a finger at her, but she needed some support.”
Seattle’s first crucial step came in 2011 when Satterberg and others started a program called LEAD, short for Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion. The idea is that instead of simply arresting drug users for narcotics or prostitution, police officers watch for those who are nonviolent and want help, and divert them to social service programs and intensive case management.
Almost immediately, this was a huge success. A 2017 peer-reviewed study found that drug users assigned to LEAD were 58% less likely to be rearrested, compared with a control group. Participants were also almost twice as likely to have housing as they had been before entering LEAD, and 46% more likely to be employed or getting job training.
LEAD isn’t cheap — it costs about $350 per month per participant to provide case managers. But it is cheaper than jail, courts and costs associated with homelessness. As a result, this approach has spread rapidly around the country, with 59 localities now offering LEAD initiatives or rolling them out.
Chian Jennings, 45, who had struggled with drugs for years, living in the streets and financing her habit by selling sex and by stealing, was smoking crack when a policeman stopped her.
“It was probably the best thing that happened to me,” Jennings told me. “It saved my life.” Instead of locking her up, the police officer handed her over to social workers at LEAD.
Through LEAD, Jennings got medical care, clothing and housing. She also gained confidence in herself, people who cared for her and the idea that life could get better. “They’re some of the most caring people I’ve ever met,” she said of the counselors. “Whether you come in high or not, they always treat you with respect.” Now, she said, “I work to make them proud of me.”
Jennings remains a work in progress. She says she still sometimes uses cocaine, but less over time, and she adds that she’s no longer stealing. If she had been held in jail, she said, “it would have pissed me off, and I would have gotten high when I got out. I’d still be homeless, stealing for food and drug money.”
Prison, she says, just makes people more miserable and more dependent on drugs when they are released. “This bit about ‘I learned my lesson’ — no, it doesn’t work that way,” she said. “People are hurting inside. That’s why they’re using in the first place.”
The war on drugs began in 1971 out of a legitimate alarm about narcotics both in the United States and among U.S. troops in Vietnam. But the “war” approach locked up enormous numbers of people and devastated the family structure. Drug laws discriminated against African Americans (possession of crack cocaine, disproportionately used by blacks, drew far harsher sentences than possession of the same quantity of powdered cocaine, more likely to be used by whites).
Yet locking up endless waves of users has had little deterrent effect, and overdose deaths have surged. The White House has estimated that the economic cost of the opioid crisis in the United States exceeds $500 billion a year, equivalent to about $4,000 per household. And that doesn’t even include cocaine, meth and other drug use.
While the U.S. doubled down on the criminal justice approach to drugs, Portugal took the opposite avenue, decriminalizing possession of all drugs in 2001. It was a gamble, but it succeeded. As I’ve reported, Portugal’s overdose deaths plunged. The upshot is that drug mortality rates in the United States are now about 50 times higher than in Portugal.
Increasingly there is global recognition that drugs are better addressed as a health challenge than as a law enforcement issue. “To criminalize people who use drugs is ineffective and harmful,” argues the Global Commission on Drug Policy, a panel of former presidents and other prominent figures from around the world who have explored these issues.
It would be difficult to think of a policy that has failed more definitively than America’s war on drugs, sending even small-time users to prison for years. This policy has cost the economy trillions, ruined tens of millions of lives, ruptured the family structure, exacerbated racial inequities — yet we still have a fatal overdose every seven minutes in the United States.
“Legislative and law enforcement solutions to drug problems in the U.S. have consistently caused more harm than they have solved,” noted Alex Kral, an epidemiologist with RTI International, a think tank. Countless studies have shown, he said, that public health approaches work better.
That’s the context in which Seattle took another crucial step last September: Satterberg announced then that he would no longer prosecute cases involving possession of less than 1 gram of drugs, even cocaine and heroin (one gram is more than a simple user would normally have at any one time). In practice, that means that dealers still get arrested, but not ordinary users.
“Seattle is leading on this,” said Daliah Heller of Vital Strategies, a New York group that examines how to reduce overdose deaths. “It’s extremely significant.”
But don’t expect miracles. Overcoming addiction is a slog, and no approach has eradicated drug abuse. Maybe that shouldn’t surprise us. We’ve been wrestling with alcoholism for thousands of years, and we still haven’t solved that, either. Even now, more Americans die each year from alcohol (88,000) than from drug overdoses (68,000).
It’s too early to have reliable data from the decriminalization experiment, but outside the courthouse in downtown Seattle where Satterberg has his offices, drug users continue to be homeless and feed their habits. At the same time, some police officers feel undermined and robbed of authority.
“You’ve got a guy shooting heroin on the street, and the cop is supposed to say, ‘You OK?’” grumbled one law enforcement officer in Seattle. (In fact, an officer would typically confiscate the heroin, admonish the user and move on.) Some residents worry that when the city ignores its own laws on the books and tolerates people openly abusing narcotics, it takes a step toward incivility that will eventually result in chaos and crime. There’s also a legitimate argument that the threat of prison is sometimes necessary to motivate users to participate in treatment programs.
Businesses are resentful of homeless drug users discarding needles on sidewalks and using bushes as toilets. A television documentary released this spring, “Seattle Is Dying,” captured the frustration of residents; some would prefer to see the police cart drug users off to jail to get them out of the way.
“It isn’t as easy as I thought to create a sensible drug policy,” Satterberg admitted to me. But he remains confident that his path, if not easy, will work better than simply throwing people in jail.
As I see it, the problem is that while Seattle has done an outstanding job halting the war on drugs, it hasn’t done well in financing the war on addiction. It closed the law enforcement toolbox without fully opening the public health toolbox.
Local officials found that in a world of competing budget silos, money saved from jails can’t easily be reallocated to treatment. This is so even though researchers repeatedly find that drug treatment pays for itself by saving huge amounts of taxpayer money, not to mention lives. One study found that substance abuse treatment in California paid for itself seven times over in reduced crime and other savings.
We need a greater focus on services — mental health, housing, counseling, medication-assisted treatment and more. It should be a scandal that less than 20% of Americans with substance abuse disorders get treatment.
We should also try other evidence-based public health interventions to reduce the drug epidemic. Let’s have safe injection sites, so that an overdose won’t turn fatal, as well as testing for fentanyl, so that users can understand what’s in the drugs they buy. Let’s distribute naloxone widely, as Baltimore has done, to counteract opioid overdoses.
We might also experiment (as Canada has) with providing safe heroin to longtime users who can’t break their addictions, for use under medical supervision. It’s impossible to help people defeat addictions if they’re dead.
Local jurisdictions like Seattle are leading partly because the federal government isn’t. President Donald Trump has boasted that his administration is making “tremendous progress” against opioids, but after more than two years, he still hasn’t even gotten around to appointing an administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
As a country, we also must tackle root causes, which means ensuring that every kid graduates from high school and that job training and apprenticeships usher disadvantaged young people into decent jobs. The most important kind of drug policy is preventive: It’s about providing a future that isn’t so depressing that people numb themselves with opioids or meth.
Perhaps I sound too bleak. Nothing is easy, but Johnny Bousquet is a living example of how a patient public health approach can save lives and leave everyone better off.
Bousquet, 42, was born with drugs in his system into a dysfunctional household. His mom, who had been raped by her father and her brother, self-medicated with heroin, and Johnny himself began selling crack at 13 to buy money for food. At 19 he found his mom dead of a heroin overdose. Soon afterward, his stepbrother who was also his best friend was murdered while trying to rescue his sister from being pimped by a gang; then the sister died of an overdose.
In short, Bousquet experienced more trauma by young adulthood than an entire suburb of more privileged children. Yet he’s a talented musician and made a good living for a time producing records and corporate jingles, while marrying and having two children. Then life took a rough turn, his wife left him and took the children, he self-medicated, and he ended up homeless on the streets and stealing and selling drugs to get by.
In 2014 he sold $40 worth of crack to an undercover police officer and was referred to LEAD and a young counselor, Mikel Kowalcyk, who herself had a long history of abusing drugs. Kowalcyk had overcome her addiction and gone to college, and she and Bousquet quickly formed a symbiotic relationship.
“Part of what keeps me clean is Johnny, and people like Johnny,” Kowalcyk told me. “Because they let me give back.”
Bousquet repeatedly relapsed, but Kowalcyk never gave up on him, and he gradually stayed sober for longer periods. Now he has been drug-free since Feb. 14, 2018, and he has a home and a job. If it hadn’t been for LEAD, he figures he would be dead of an overdose, would have killed himself or might have killed someone else.
Now, he says, he goes to a 7-Eleven that he used to shoplift from — and he buys from the cashier. “I’m nothing special,” he told me, “but it’s a big deal compared to being homeless last year and sleeping outside with needles in my arm.”
Day by day, Bousquet is making progress, a reminder that treating drug users as humans with an illness is a more effective strategy than the almost 50-year policy of imprisoning them as “junkies.”
“I just paid my rent again yesterday,” he said, beaming. “I’m not in your car stealing your stereo. I’m paying damn taxes now.”

Texto completo: Woody Allen's latest film screened in Poland and Lithuania, but may never come to U.S. theaters. Roman Polanski's new movie, his 13th since fleeing the U.S. in 1978, will compete at the Venice Film Festival but has yet to find a stateside distributor.
Nate Parker, a one-time Sundance Film Festival darling whose career derailed when his alleged involvement in an earlier rape case gained new attention, is hoping American distributors will pick up his new feature about a man who feels wronged by the justice system.
The #MeToo movement intensified scrutiny on the personal lives of many in Hollywood. Now, these three directors are trying to steer the focus back toward their work—but they're doing it overseas for now. In the next several weeks, new films by the three directors will screen in international markets, but their fate in the U.S. remains uncertain.
If Mr. Allen's film "A Rainy Day in New York" fails to find U.S. distribution, it would be the first in his 53-year directing career not to screen here.
The uncertain destiny reflects the still-forming response to filmmakers amid the #MeToo movement, which began in late 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct against producer Harvey Weinstein.
The allegations put the brakes on a slew of movies, from the Gore Vidal biopic starring Kevin Spacey that Netflix Inc. shelved indefinitely after the actor was accused of sexually harassing young men, to "The Current War," a drama produced by Mr. Weinstein that will hit U.S. theaters in October, nearly two years after its originally scheduled debut. Mr. Spacey, who denies or says he doesn't remember the alleged incidents, saw charges in one case dropped in July.
Besides showing in Poland and Lithuania, Mr. Allen's "Rainy Day" film is scheduled for release in a handful of other European countries.
"Rainy Day" lost its U.S. release in 2018 when Amazon Studios canceled distribution of the film as earlier accusations of sexual misconduct became a topic of renewed public debate amid the #MeToo movement. Earlier this year, Mr. Allen sued the studio for $68 million, claiming breach of contract over the termination of his four-picture deal. An Amazon Studios spokesperson said the company will not comment on ongoing litigation.
Mr. Allen's adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, in recent years has spoken openly about her claims that Mr. Allen sexually molested her in the early 1990s. Ms. Farrow criticized people who have worked with the director in a New York Times piece in 2014 before discussing the matter further in a 2018 television interview.
Mr. Allen, 83 years old, has repeatedly denied the accusations he sexually abused Ms. Farrow. The Connecticut State Attorney investigated allegations against Mr. Allen but didn't charge him.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Allen declined to respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Parker's and Mr. Polanski's films are using debuts at this year's Venice Film Festival, which starts Wednesday, to try to sell distribution rights.
Both men were accused of rape in the U.S. Mr. Polanski fled to France while awaiting sentencing in 1978 . Mr. Parker was acquitted at trial in 2001. Both directors' new films explore miscarriages of justice.
Mr. Polanski's "An Officer and a Spy" examines the real-life Dreyfus affair, an infamous episode of antisemitism in which a turn-of-the-century French military officer was falsely accused of espionage on scant evidence. In some markets, it will go by a different title: "J'accuse."
Since fleeing to Europe, Mr. Polanski has had an erratic career. He won the Oscar for best director for his 2002 Holocaust drama "The Pianist," but many of his recent films have failed to gain traction in the U.S.
The #MeToo movement put the spotlight back on Mr. Polanski and allegations that in the 1970s he raped a teenage girl. Mr. Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse, but has maintained that the girl had consented. Before his sentencing, Mr. Polanski fled the U.S., fearing a longer term than what his lawyers believed they had worked out previously.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Polanski didn't respond to request for comment.
"American Skin" stars Mr. Parker, 39 years old, as a Marine veteran who confronts a police officer who was acquitted after shooting the veteran's son.
"It becomes '12 Angry Men,' set in a police station," said producer Mark Burg, who co-financed the film's $5 million budget with Tarak Ben Ammar, a producer and distributor who as a Weinstein Co. board member fired Mr. Weinstein following news of his misconduct allegations. Mr. Weinstein has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex.
Before backing the project, Mr. Ben Ammar says he read more than 600 pages of transcripts from Mr. Parker's trial in 2001. "I like the underdog," he said. "But I need to have the opinion that the underdog is a good guy."
Back in 2016, Mr. Parker appeared headed to the Oscars, thanks to his movie "The Birth of a Nation," about slave rebellion leader Nat Turner.
Following a rapturous Sundance premiere, he sold the movie to Fox Searchlight for $17.5 million—a record for the festival.
But that enthusiasm deflated overnight when the earlier rape allegation gained new attention in Hollywood and on social media. "Birth of a Nation" ended up collecting $15.8 million at the domestic box office—almost $2 million less than Fox paid for it.
Mr. Parker declined to comment.

Texto completo: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and best-selling historical novelist Philippa Gregory are among the more than 250 authors appearing on 13 stages during the 14th annual AJC Decatur Book Festival over Labor Day weekend.
Sotomayor will present her forthcoming children's book "Just Ask!" about making friends with people with different physical capabilities at Presser Hall on the Agnes Scott campus in a free but ticketed event Sunday afternoon.
Best-selling author Gregory will present her new, 17th-century novel "Tidelands" at First Baptist Decatur Sunday evening. Gregory's appearance marks the festival's first-ever pay event. Tickets are $30 and include a copy of the book.
"We struggle to maintain ourselves financially," said Joy Pope, the festival's new programming director, who replaced Julie Wilson, now festival director. "In order to get somebody that's kind of a big name like that, I have to promise a certain number of books have to be sold, so I promised 250. We've already sold about 150, so I think were' in good shape for that."
Gregory's event isn't the festival's only pay event, though. "Improv Gets Lit" at Dad's Garage on Friday night features "The New Pie" authors Paul Arguin and Chris Taylor and "Unladylike" authors Caroline Ervin and Christen Conger reading excerpts from their books, which improv artists will riff off of. Tickets are $15.50-$20.50.
Pope's goal this year was to create more partnerships with other businesses and organizations to help fund some of the festival's events. She's particularly pleased to be collaborating with free-speech nonprofit PEN America on this year's keynote event on immigration at the Emory Schwartz Center Friday night, featuring poets Richard Blanco and Rigoberto González, and Gabriela Baeza Ventura, executive editor of Arte Publico Press.
The partnership also led to a weekend-long track of programming on immigration.
"It feels like if you could start at 10 o'clock Saturday morning and follow this thread until 5 o'clock on Sunday, you could become a better person, you will be more empathetic," said Pope.
Special events aside, the heart and soul of the festival is its plethora of panels and presentations by authors of all stripes taking place throughout Saturday and Sunday during the Street Fair. Highlights include:
Sarah M. Brown. The AJC, the L.A. Times and the New York Times can't all be wrong. All three publications gave Broom's debut "The Yellow House" glowing reviews for her memoir about growing up in New Orleans before and after Hurricane Katrina. She joins "Ladysitting" author Loreen Cary on a panel called Bearing Witness to Generations. 5:30 p.m. Saturday, DeKalb Historic Courthouse
Casey Cep. Cep talks with AJC editor and author Shannon McCaffrey about her debut "Furious Hours," her critically acclaimed, nonfiction account of Harper Lee's final, abandoned book project about an alleged serial killer. 12:30 p.m. Saturday, Marriott Conference Center
Madeline Ffitch. An unconventional family living off the grid in Appalachia is confronted by outside influences in Ffitch's highly original debut novel, "Stay and Fight." She's paired with Tupelo Hassman, author of "Gods with a Little G" about a high school teen living in a community so remote, her only source for knowledge about the outside world is a call-in radio show from a nearby town. 1:45 p.m. Saturday, Marriott Conference Center
James Verini. Authors George Packer and Jonathan Franzen have heaped high praise on Verini's forthcoming book, "They Will Have to Die Now," calling it "bleakly funny and unbearably sad" and "a thing of terrible beauty." Reported from the front lines of the Battle of Mosul between the Islamic State, the Iraqi government and members of the Kurdish militia, the book is also about "the effects of America's idea of itself on the world, and on history, and vice versa," says Verini. He'll be interviewed by Evan Ratliff, cofounder of Atavist magazine. 5:30 p.m. Saturday, Decatur Presbyterian Sanctuary.
Ocean Vuong. Whiting Award and T.S. Eliot Prize winning poet Vuong, presents his debut novel "On This EarthWe'reBrieflyGorgeous" that explores a Vietnamese family's history and issues of race, class and masculinity in the form a letter from a son to his single mother who can't read. Vuong and "Patsy" author Nicole Dennis-Benn talk about characters who make sacrifices for love. Noon Sunday, Marriott Conference Center.

Billionaire backed arts, conservative causes

Texto completo: David H. Koch, the billionaire libertarian and part-time Palm Beach resident who devoted his riches to philanthropy and building a political movement, has died. He was 79.
During his lifetime, Koch built a business empire that made him one of the wealthiest men on the planet. He built an equally influential political network — nationally and in Florida — that reinvigorated conservative politics, but also made him a reviled figure among liberals.
His family released a statement Friday.
“While we mourn the loss of our hero, we remember his iconic laughter, insatiable curiosity, and gentle heart. His stories of childhood adventures enlivened our family dinners; his endless knowledge rendered him our ‘walking Google.’ His sensitive heart had him shed a tear at the beauty of his daughter’s ballet, and beam with pride when his son beat him at chess. We will miss the fifth link in our family,” according to the statement.
Born May 3, 1940, in Wichita, Kansas, to Mary Clementine (Robinson) Koch and Fred Chase Koch, he was the third of four sons, beating his younger twin William into the world by a matter of minutes.
Koch was a 1959 graduate of the elite Deerfield Academy and earned both bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
Tall and athletic, Koch
played basketball for three years at M.I.T., where he held the single-game scoring record (41 points) for more than 45 years .
In 1970, Koch joined the family business, Koch Industries, second only to Cargill among the largest privately held companies in the U.S, according to Forbes. He assumed the presidency of Koch Engineering in 1979 and, in 1982, with his older brother Charles, became co-owner of Koch Industries.
He was worth $42.4 billion at the time of his death and ranked 18th richest person in the world, tied with his brother Charles, according to Forbes magazine rankings.
While Koch donated more than $1.3 billion of his fortune to charity, he was better known for using his wealth to reshape the conservative political landscape in America.
Koch embraced and generously funded largely Republican candidates and organizations that support libertarian ideals — a traditional belief in freedom from what they believe are government intrusions, such as taxes, trade restrictions, business regulation, welfare programs and bans on same-sex marriages.
“For a lot of successful businessmen, politics has been a spectator sport,” said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who worked with Koch over the years.
“They buy a ticket with a contribution and they sit on the sidelines. Not David Koch. He played the game.”
In 1980, Libertarian Party candidate Ed Clark chose Koch as his vice presidential running mate in a presidential election won by Republican Ronald Reagan in a landslide.
The same year, a failed boardroom coup led by Koch’s twin brother, William, failed, igniting an epic family battle that dragged on for years and pitted the four Koch brothers — Charles, David, Frederick and William — against each other.
In a series of high-profile lawsuits peppered with nasty accusations, William and Frederick claimed that Charles and David had cheated them out of $2 billion. On the witness stand, David sobbed as he testified about the bitter family feud and how private investigators had been hired to filch trash and janitors were bribed to dig up dirt.
In a statement released late Friday afternoon, William recalled the clash. Amid the conflict, William said he called his brother to serve as an observer at the final race of the prestigious America’s Cup yacht race in 1992.
“He politely declined,” wrote William, who ended up winning the race that year.
Later, William learned that his “number one competitor who had won three America’s Cups asked David to be chairman of his program. David declined,” William recalled.
“David and I happily reconciled our past business differences 20 years ago,” William wrote. “He was best man at my wedding. Our spouses and children have become good friends. ... He was an outstanding human and he was my best friend.”
David Koch was also passionate about politics.
With his older brother Charles, the Koch’s became a formidable force in conservative politics over the last four decades, building a network of like-minded wealthy donors and helping found Americans for Prosperity, a powerful libertarian advocacy group with influence that rivals that of the Republican Party.
In Florida politics, the state chapter of the AFP backed a campaign against three Supreme Court Justice seeking merit retention on the 2012 ballot. The justices, they claimed, represented a left-leaning agenda that turned Florida’s highest court into one of the most activist judiciaries.
The Kochs’ political machine became the target of harsh criticism by liberals and progressives who claimed they used their fortune to buy influence, manipulate elections and government policies — primarily to benefit their own companies. The brothers soon became Public Enemy Number One of the left.
That portrayal bothered David, Castellanos said.
“It came as a shock to them that after all the good they had done with the fruits of their own labor, people would tar them with an ugly political brush they did not deserve,” Castellanos said. “I think it hurt when he was thrown in a box with people who had darker intentions.”
In 2016, the Koch brothers did not back Donald Trump, and David Koch was not expected to back the president’s re-election bid next year. In July of last year, Trump ripped the Koch brothers in a tweet saying, “The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don’t need their money or bad ideas.”
Outside of politics, Koch has been a major donor to cultural institutions and hospitals for many years. According to the New York Times, Koch donated $100 million in 2008 to New York City Ballet’s Lincoln Center theater and $65 million in 2014 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the refurbishment of its fountains plaza. He has donated more than $680 million to research and medical facilities in the United States since he was found to have prostate cancer.
Until recently, Koch funded the annual Coconuts New Year’s Eve fireworks display that brought thousands of spectators to the West Palm Beach waterfront.
He attributed his philanthropy to a plane crash he survived in 1991, when an airplane he was in collided with another at Los Angeles International Airport. Koch escaped the smoke-filled plan, while more than 30 others were killed in the collision.
“I was amazed that I survived this accident,” Koch told Barbara Walters in a 2014 interview. “Thinking back on it later, I felt that the good Lord was sitting on my shoulder and that he helped save my life because he wanted me to do good works and become a good citizen.”
In Palm Beach, David Koch lived with his wife, Julia, at a 1920s-era oceanfront estate known as El Sarmiento at 150 S. Ocean Blvd. In 2008, the estate was awarded the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach's Ballinger Award, which recognized a historically sensitive renovation and restoration project that incorporated a second historic house on the 2-acre estate.

Last year, the Atlantic put on hold its plans to launch a paywall at the behest of its new owner, Laurene Powell Jobs, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Powell Jobs, who had paid more than $100 million for a majority stake, wanted the magazine to first hire new staffers and improve its platform, betting that those changes would help expand offerings and draw more readers.
That strategy now faces a test as the publication gears up to introduce a paywall sometime after Labor Day—more than 18 months later than initially planned. While the Atlantic has beefed up its staff and expanded its coverage beyond analysis toward more breaking news and scoops, many of its rivals have raced to set up their own paywalls.
The delay puts the magazine at greater risk of falling behind at a critical moment in the industry, when news organizations are trying to reduce their reliance on advertising, and as readers are growing weary of the mushrooming number of publications charging for online access.
The Atlantic declined to divulge details on how the paywall would be structured. Ms. Powell Jobs, who owns 70% of the magazine through Emerson Collective, her philanthropically minded investment firm, declined to be interviewed for this article. She has made it clear that her investment in the Atlantic needs to be financially viable and isn't to be considered charity, according to people familiar with the situation.
The 162-year-old magazine, based in Washington, D.C., recently went from making an annual profit of about $10 million to losing money, people familiar with the matter said, as a result of the early 2018 decision to hire about 100 new people—a roughly 30% staff expansion.
Ms. Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, is one of several deep-pocketed tech-world investors who have bought legacy media outlets. In 2013, Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com Inc., acquired the Washington Post . Last year, Salesforce.com Inc. co-founder Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne Benioff, purchased Time Magazine .
Atlantic President Bob Cohn said that when Ms. Powell Jobs explained the details of her investment plan to the magazine's managers, they felt delaying the paywall launch made sense. "We were about to make dozens of hires that would ultimately lead to the creation of an even better paywall," said Mr. Cohn, who is leaving in early September for a fellowship at Harvard.
People at the Atlantic said Ms. Powell Jobs has taken a mostly hands-off approach to day-to-day matters, but weighs in on key decisions.
Ms. Powell Jobs has discussed revamping the Atlantic's events business, people familiar with the matter said. She has suggested reducing the number of events the Atlantic holds every year to as few as 10 from about 100, but increasing their scale in the model of TED Talks. A spokeswoman for the company said no immediate changes were planned.
The Atlantic has found itself at the center of controversy several times since Ms. Powell Jobs took over. In early 2018, the magazine cut ties with conservative columnist Kevin Williamson less than a month after hiring him following a furious reader backlash over his antiabortion views. Conservatives criticized the move as being anti-free speech.
Several prominent female reporters have recently left. The publication just completed a yearlong study into the gender dynamics of its newsroom and has made efforts to address pay disparities, a person familiar with the matter said. In 2018, 75% of its hires were women, and 17 of its 23 senior editors are now women, the company said.
As the Atlantic expands its focus to compete more directly with outlets like Politico, Axios and even the Washington Post and the New York Times, some staffers say it has proven difficult to re-engineer the newsroom.
"It felt like the place was becoming a hot-take factory," said one recently departed writer. "That can be profitable, of course, because hot takes don't cost much."
Adrienne LaFrance, the Atlantic's executive editor, said the magazine's broader focus hasn't detracted from its strengths in analysis and context.
Share Your Thoughts
What do you like and what would you improve about the Atlantic? Join the conversation below.
"We have to be a real-time magazine to stay competitive, but our play isn't more volume, it's higher quality," she said. "We have absolutely doubled down on where we excel, which is sharply reported analysis and deep historical context."
The Atlantic spokeswoman added: "If you need empirical data, our story volume this year is down 7.5%, even as we have added journalists and even as our audience has grown significantly."
Monthly U.S. visitor numbers in the first half of 2019 are up 35% from a year earlier, Comscore data show. Revenue grew 13% last year, and digital advertising revenue rose 10%.
Print sales fell 16% to an average of 447,000 a month in the second half of 2018, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.
The Atlantic emerged as a modestly profitable venture under the stewardship of David Bradley, who bought the magazine in 1999 and withstood nearly a decade of losing as much as $10 million a year. Mr. Bradley, who is in his mid-60s and whose children have expressed little interest in running the business, had a list of people he thought would make good stewards for the Atlantic.
Ms. Powell Jobs agreed to a deal after only a few hours' conversation with Mr. Bradley in the spring of 2017, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Bradley agreed to retain a 30% stake for between three and five years, after which Ms. Powell Jobs would have the option to buy him out completely or bring in a minority investor.

Texto completo: Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh isn't ruling out the possibility of running for Senate — but only if a seat were to become open, the New York Times reported Friday.
But as Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III publicly mulls whether he'll challenge Senator Edward J. Markey, Walsh suggested he would only look at the seat if the incumbent steps aside.
“I'm not going to run against Ed Markey," he told the paper.
And, for his part, Markey has insisted he is running for re-election.
“This is the most energized that I have ever been in my life," he told the Globe earlier this week, citing what he called “the threat that Donald Trump poses to everything that Massachusetts stands for."
Walsh told reporters this week that he was backing Markey. Walsh has also been floated as a possible candidate for governor, and a June Suffolk/Globe poll found him in a statistical tie with Attorney General Maura Healey in a hypothetical Democratic primary race for governor.
Kennedy's potential challenge has thrown the Massachusetts political landscape into flux as Democratic officials across the state are pressed to take sides, and candidates line up to express interest in Kennedy's Fourth District should it become open.
Reached for comment, Walsh's office verified the accuracy of the mayor's remarks to the New York Times.

Growing highway and city-street bottlenecks turn out to be the price of the booming U.S. economy. Strong consumer demand and near-full employment are clogging American roads, with congestion up 26% since 2009 , a report from Texas A&M Transportation Institute finds. The WSJ's David Harrison writes traffic problems are the worst in big metropolitan areas, where commuters are jockeying for space with the growing number of trucks and delivery vehicles ferrying e-commerce orders to homes and businesses. Congestion costs $166 billion a year in wasted time and fuel, problems that weigh heavily on trucking companies that carry a big part of the economy. Truckers move more than 70% of the country's freight and diesel fuel accounts for as much as a fifth of carriers' operating costs. Congestion pricing programs like one planned in New York City could raise those costs and increase delivery fees for transportation customers.
SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES
Eco-conscious labeling is coming to energy supply chains. Shale drillers seeking to showcase efforts to limit the environmental impact of fracking are marketing cleaner fossil fuel akin to fair-trade coffee, the WSJ's Rebecca Elliott reports, as customers seek more information about how natural gas is sourced. The greener gas development comes as utilities are rolling out cleaner energy options that tack on a premium for renewable products such as methane produced by landfills and farms, which account for less than 1% of the nation's daily gas output. BP PLC has invested in technology to limit methane leaks and is testing blockchain technology to track its gas through the supply chain so customers can tell when they are buying BP-fracked fuel. Criteria for responsibly produced gas include leak rates and water contamination levels, though environmental groups say regulation would be more effective in ensuring sustainable practices.
The auto industry is facing a fork in the road on emissions standards. A regulatory clash between the Trump administration and California over fuel-economy rules could force car makers to meet two different requirements, sowing division and uncertainty around production planning . The WSJ's Ben Foldy and Mike Colias report the White House wants to roll back Obama-era standards that car makers have argued are too strict. California, the nation's biggest auto market, has struck a deal with Ford Motor Co. and others that have agreed to meet more stringent limits. That pact hinged on car companies' betting they would still be stuck with higher production costs to meet California's rules. But General Motors Co., which is investing heavily in electric vehicles, thinks the plan didn't give enough credit for those cars and is pushing for rules requiring auto makers to sell battery-powered models nationwide.

Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton to End Presidential Campaign

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton is ending his presidential campaign after failing to meet the criteria for participation in any of the Democratic primary debates.
Mr. Moulton, a moderate who highlighted his military service in his campaign, issued a statement Friday morning announcing he was dropping out the race and will instead run for re-election in the House. He is expected to discuss his decision in a speech at the Democratic National Committee meeting in California.

"I think it's evident that this is now a three-way race between [former Vice President Joe] Biden, [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren and [Sen. Bernie] Sanders, and really it's a debate about how far left the party should go," Mr. Moulton said in an interview with the New York Times, in which he first announced his departure.
Mr. Moulton is the fourth candidate to leave the race, but 21 candidates remain. Only 10 of those candidates have so far qualified for the September debate. Mr. Moulton, an outspoken critic of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is expected to face Democratic primary challengers in his House re-election bid.
According to his prepared remarks, Mr. Moulton will warn his party against alienating certain voters and against getting "distracted by the latest outrage on Twitter or the reality show politics of the day."
"We need to stay grounded in what it's going to take to win over voters—all kinds of Democrats, Independents like the Obama-Trump voters, and even disaffected Republicans—and bring the country together around beating Donald Trump," he will say.
Mr. Moulton's campaign said Friday he also would be relaunching his Serve America political-action committee to help elect Democrats down the ballot.
"Although it might not have been Seth's year, he leaves the race with an enhanced national profile, having proved himself to be a next-generation foreign policy leader in the Democratic Party who has broad appeal," the campaign said in a memo.

Texto completo: According to presidential aspirant Elizabeth Warren and her supporters, the Massachusetts Democrat "has a plan" for everything. Student-loan forgiveness, immigration reform, criminal-justice overhaul -- check, check, check. The senator even has strategies for paving dirt roads in Indian country and for providing "fresh, affordable, local food."
It is the presence of so many plans that make notable the one policy area for which Ms. Warren doesn't have a clear strategy: health care. That missing agenda item speaks volumes about the shrewdness -- or deception -- of her campaign.
To be sure, Ms. Warren suggests she has a health-care plan. In the first Democratic debate, she stated she was "with" Bernie Sanders on Medicare for All. She appeared to double down on this commitment in the second debate, joining Mr. Sanders to rough up his detractors, and promising to "fight for" single payer.
In reality, she's been far less clear about what she will do and when. Wade through Ms. Warren's detailed website, and you'll find no health-care section. She avoids specifics on the campaign trail, avoids the whole topic when she can. She has refused to answer yes-or-no candidate questions on health topics. Read the second debate transcript closely, and you'll notice she spends most of her time arguing that insurance companies bring in too much and pay out too little.
When the New York Times asked this spring about her health-care plan, she listed her top priorities: protecting ObamaCare, reducing drug costs, and getting "a consumers' bill of rights for private insurance so that people don't get ripped off." Beyond that, she said she'd "keep moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost." She has repeatedly noted that there are many different (incremental) "paths" to Medicare for All -- such as lowering the age of eligibility, or letting employers buy into the program.
This isn't a plan; it's a hedge. It's notable because it comes as most of the Democratic field has quietly acknowledged that killing private insurance is a surefire political loser. Five of the seven U.S. senators running for the presidency are officially sponsors of Mr. Sanders's Medicare for All bill. Yet in recent weeks, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand have all backed away from the provision that would prohibit private insurance. Most now instead support giving Americans a public "option" alongside private insurance -- joining the likes of Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke.
Ms. Warren's vagueness exposes the limits of her liberal "populism." She calls herself a progressive, but her campaign has focused on capturing "forgotten" voters by uniting them against "corrupt" Washington, "corrupt" Wall Street, "corrupt" "Big Ag." Her playbook is relentlessly monotone: Highlight an unpleasant necessity of life (student debt, child-care bills), blame it on the rich and powerful, propose government as the solution.
Her pickle with health care is that more than 100 million Americans still prefer their private insurance to a government replacement. That's the "popular" will. Medicare for All would also require Ms. Warren to go beyond her wealth tax on millionaires and billionaires, the revenue from which she has earmarked for other programs -- free tuition, student-debt forgiveness, child-care subsidies. Medicare for All, as Mr. Sanders has acknowledged, would require her to tax the middle class -- which also isn't very populist.
Ms. Warren faces Democratic primary concerns that she is unelectable -- too extreme to win nationwide in November. Her campaign understands that a clear, committed plan for Medicare for All would add to that liability.
She initially seemed set to get around all this by constraining herself to more insurance regulation. But Mr. Sanders and his voters are turning Medicare for All into a progressive litmus test. The Vermont independent is increasingly highlighting his rivals' failure to embrace his plan as evidence of their phoniness. Ms. Warren wants and needs those voters, especially should Mr. Sanders leave the race. A more modest health-care plan would alienate them.
How to straddle this? She can't. Which is why the woman who has a detailed plan for everything, has no official plan for an issue that Gallup reports 80% of voters said was "extremely" or "very" important to their 2018 vote. So far, it's worked for her. Progressive activists read from her second debate performance that she is fully committed to Medicare for All. Middle-of-the-road Democrats read from her other comments, and her omissions, that she may settle on an insurance-regulation plan, accompanied by a proposal to expand Medicare incrementally, or over time.
The question is how long she gets away with it. If this election is as mind-bendingly consequential as Democrats claim, surely the public deserves to know Ms. Warren's plan for the U.S. health-care system. Maybe some intrepid debate moderator might even ask in September: "Ms. Warren, why don't you have a plan for that?"

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is charged with helping elect and re-elect Republicans in the House, is fundraising with shirts that promote President Donald Trump’s desire to buy Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.
The limited-edition T-shirt features a map of the United States, showing Greenland as of part of the U. S. , patterned with the American flag.
The caption supporting the promotion reads, "Support President Trump and his efforts to help America grow!”
As of Thursday evening, the NRCC was providing the shirts to anyone who donated $25 or more.
In initial media reports, it was not clear how serious Trump was in his desire to acquire the strategically important island. However, in recent days, the president has drawn the United States into an international controversy over Greenland.

A day after those initial reports, Greenland’s foreign ministry asserted that the island is “open for business, not for sale. ”
Trump canceled an upcoming trip to Denmark after its prime minister called his interest in a purchase “absurd. " The president also responded by calling the Danish leader's comments “nasty. ”
"I thought that the prime minister's statement — that it was 'absurd,' that it was an 'absurd' idea — it was nasty. I thought it was an inappropriate statement. All she had to do is say, 'No, we wouldn't be interested,'" Trump said. "You don't talk to the United States that way, at least under me. . . I thought it was not a nice statement — the way she blew me off — because she is blowing off the United States. And we've done a lot for Denmark. We've done a lot. I know Denmark well. I have many friends from Denmark. I have many people from Denmark that live in the United States. "

Additionally, the New York Times has reported that a former White House official overheard the president joking about trading Puerto Rico for Greenland. Trump has had a turbulent relationship with the American territory and has frequently sparred with Puerto Rican politicians.
Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark. took credit this week for apparently giving Trump the idea to consider acquiring Greenland.
Talk Business & Politics, an Arkansas business news website, reports Cotton had proposed the idea to Trump and met with the Danish ambassador about the possibility of a sale.
"You’re joking, but I can reveal to you that several months ago, I met with the Danish ambassador and I proposed that they sell Greenland to us," the outlet reported Cotton said in response to a question from the moderator.
The NRCC isn’t the only GOP group to launch Greenland T-shirts.
The Nevada Republican Party also reportedly ran Facebook ads with more shirts people could wear to show their “support for making Greeland the 51st state”
One T-shirt featured “Greenland!” on the front with “This land is your land, this land is our land!” underneath it. The back of the shirt shows cartoonish images of America and Greenland high-fiving.

COLLEONI'S EVOLVES, HOLDS TIGHT TO ITS ROMAN ROOTS

Texto completo: This summer, on a sun-drenched terrace facing the palace of Lucrezia Borgia in a small town outside of Rome, Barbara Storci debated with her sister whether to serve the duck with vegetables or risotto.
Storci owns Colleoni's Eatery and Bakery in Fort Myers, while her sister owns Colleoni Osteria Con Cantina in Nepi, Italy. The pair grew up in Rome watching their father helm one of the city's most celebrated restaurants, and today they turn to each other for inspiration as they bring authentic Italian dishes to their customers.
The Fort Myers Colleoni's sits at the corner of McGregor Boulevard and College Parkway, in the spot long occupied by Rene's. Storci opened her restaurant in April 2016. She initially focused on lunch and baked items. Over time, though, she listened to her customers and gradually switched over to dinner service. Now, the restaurant is dinner-only, though she takes special orders for her baked goods.
And those floury treats haven't disappeared from the menu. Storci makes all the restaurants breads fresh each day, including focaccia with rosemary, and Italian-style baguettes. She bakes a ricotta cheesecake with limoncello-infused mascarpone, a chocolate cake with Grand Marnier, and a chocolate and almond cake. Plus she crafts classic favorites including tiramisu and cannoli. Her pastas are also hand-made using flour imported from Italy.
"I make everything from scratch," Storci said.
"I make my own bread, and for the cake I don't use a mix. I start with butter, eggs, sugar. If you read the ingredients of my cake, you'd only see a few."
Storci's grandparents originally hailed from Bologna, a city in Italy famous for its Parmesan, mortadella, prosciutto, noodles and meat sauce. That is, a city where cooking and eating are raised to an art form. After the second World War, Storci's grandfather traveled to England to learn the ways of upscale service, and then he and his wife moved to Rome to open their own restaurant.
"The restaurant of my grandfather was very famous," Storci said. "He served all the aristocracy of Rome."
The restaurant was where Storci's father learned to cook, and where Storci and her sister watched their grandmother make pasta.
"I still remember my grandmother with this fresh pasta in her hands, making these little tortellini," Storci said.
"She didn't use the mixer. She made everything by hand. I'd sit and watch her chopping this meat so thin with the knife. She was so quick. It was amazing."
Their grandmother was also the one who taught the sisters to bake their first cakes. She showed them, too, how to craft the fruit jams for the fillings. Storci still uses her grandmother's techniques when she's in the kitchen.
"My love for food came from there," she said.
Now that Colleoni's offers just dinner, Storci is able to take time with her customers and hear their thoughts on her menu. Some of their favorites: the marinated steak with grilled vegetables, arugula and Parmesan shavings; gnocchi with arugula, fresh tomato and burrata; and her misto mare with fish, shrimp, scallops and calamari.
In response to their requests, she's planning to add more seafood options, especially fish.
"We are by the sea, and my customers want to have fish," she said.
And the duck she discussed with her sister on that sunny terrace outside of Rome? Storci has also added it to her menu, served with risotto. Her sister went with the vegetables.

Texto completo: Facebook Inc. will start giving users more control over what data is shared with the social-media giant from their other online activities, a step toward a pledge of enhanced privacy options Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg made more than 15 months ago.
The initiative was one of several announced by Facebook on Tuesday, including others designed to improve how news gets presented on the platform as well as how it guards against political bias.
Regarding data, the company said it is rolling out a feature called "Off-Facebook Activity" to let users see information that apps and websites gather on them and send to Facebook, such as shopping activity, logins using Facebook credentials and site visits that trigger tracking signals. People will be able to use the tool to prevent that data from being associated with their Facebook accounts.
The new tool has limits. Users can't delete the outside data that apps and websites send Facebook. It still will collect that information anonymously -- unlinked to users' accounts if they choose -- to provide analytics and advertising conversion metrics. And it won't give users the ability to limit or even see the full list of data that Facebook gathers from their direct interaction with the company's products.
"They're trying to do everything they can to fly under the banner of privacy and still maintain their business practices," said Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission technologist who focuses on privacy issues. "Providing users with the ability to delete their information when the infrastructure is built to maintain it all is very difficult."
The feature will be available first only to account holders in South Korea, Ireland and Spain, but will roll out to all users in the coming months, Facebook said.
The move is Facebook's latest response to an uproar over its handling of user information -- including that collected on other platforms. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that some apps were sending Facebook deeply personal information without those users' knowledge, such as users' weight-loss goals or even the timing of their menstrual cycles. As part of its new tool, Facebook will both screen apps for potentially inappropriate data and allow users to report any that slip through.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook continued revamping how it presents news stories. Facebook told the New York Times that it would hire a small team of journalists to help it curate "News Tab," a new section of the Facebook mobile app that will present recent stories to readers. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Facebook was planning to pay news outlets for the use of their content in such a feature.
Facebook also announced the conclusion of its conservative free-speech audit, which was launched in response to complaints that the platform at times suppressed conservative viewpoints.
Led by former Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, the eight-page report came to no firm conclusions about bias on the platform. Instead, it cataloged potential areas of concern, including that Facebook's prohibition against hate speech might disproportionately apply to conservatives and that its ban on shocking content in advertisements limited the ability of antiabortion organizations to buy ads featuring photos of premature babies. The report stated that "there is still significant work to be done to satisfy the concerns we heard from conservatives."

Texto completo: From the Ivy League to Hollywood and the mainstream media, Americans with traditional morals or conservative politics have often felt excluded from the country's elite, culture-creating institutions. Facebook offered an alternative: a place to express views and share news that you couldn't find in the New York Times.
Over time, however, many conservatives lost trust in Facebook, believing it discriminated against them. The increasing scale and complexity of Facebook's content-moderation practices made matters worse. In 2016 Facebook employees were accused of suppressing conservative articles in the news feed's now-discontinued "trending" section. In April 2018 Congress grilled Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg about anticonservative bias, from blocked content to suspended accounts.
In response to mounting criticism, Facebook asked me to conduct a survey to hear from conservatives directly. Following substantial public interest in the project and in light of policy changes Facebook has recently made, we have decided to share our findings at this time.
Facebook placed no restrictions on how I could conduct the work. My team at the law firm Covington & Burling LLP began conducting interviews in May 2018. We cast a wide net to include as many aspects of conservatism as possible -- from organizations focused on Christian values or protecting free expression to those focused on tax policy and small government. We identified individuals, groups and lawmakers who either use, study or could potentially regulate Facebook, and interviewed 133 of them. To encourage them to speak freely, we told interviewees we wouldn't publish their identities. We presented our preliminary findings to Facebook in early August 2018 and have been discussing them with the company ever since.
We found conservatives' concerns generally fall within the following six buckets:
-- Content distribution and algorithms. Conservatives have expressed concern that bias against their viewpoints may be "baked in" to Facebook's algorithms. In addition, interviewees argued that Facebook shouldn't be in the business of separating fact from fiction in the news.
-- Content policies. Facebook's community standards prohibit hate speech, graphic violence, adult nudity, sexual activity and cruel and insensitive content. Several interviewees pointed to the highly subjective, ever-evolving nature of some of these standards, in particular the term "hate speech."
-- Content enforcement. Interviewees were concerned that the biases of Facebook employees who enforce the rules may result in disproportionate censoring of conservatives. Some midsize and grass-roots organizations also believe their appeals are not taken as seriously as those of larger organizations.
-- Ad policies. In the wake of strong evidence from the U.S. intelligence community that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election with fake social-media accounts and inflammatory content, Facebook required advertisers to register as "political" organizations in order to post ads with a political or policy focus. Some conservative interviewees said this new rule jeopardized their status as nonprofits under Section 501(c)(3) of the tax code.
-- Ad enforcement. As a result of Facebook's new, more stringent ad policies, interviewees said the ad-approval process has slowed significantly. Some fear that the new process may be designed to disadvantage conservative ads in the wake of the Trump campaign's successful use of social media in 2016.
-- Workforce viewpoint diversity. Several interviewees noted the overall lack of viewpoint diversity throughout Facebook's workforce and senior management.
Facebook has made several changes that are responsive to our findings, and we understand more are being considered. For now, changes include:
-- Oversight board. Facebook announced plans last month for an oversight board to hear appeals of some more-difficult content-removal decisions. If structured to reflect accurately the diverse ideological and religious views of Facebook's user base, the board may help ensure content decisions are made thoughtfully and free from inappropriate bias.
-- Explanations of news-feed rankings. To foster user trust in the algorithms that influence content placement, Facebook has launched transparency tools that explain to users why they see certain content on their news feeds.
-- Page transparency. Facebook has enabled page managers to see when their content has been removed for violating community standards, or when distribution of a post has been reduced because a fact-checker gave it a "false" rating.
-- Staffing. Facebook has hired four additional people devoted exclusively to working with smaller organizations to resolve questions and complaints about content decisions.
-- Ad labeling requirements. To avoid incorrectly branding ads as "political," Facebook renamed its ads library and now refers instead to ads "about social issues, elections or politics."
-- Ad policies. Facebook has changed its ad policies that prohibit images of patients with medical tubes as "shocking and sensational content." This will make it easier to promote certain pro-life ads.
We believe these and other measures described in our interim report are steps in the right direction. Yet these are complicated issues, some of which involve conflicting opinions even among conservatives. For that reason, restoring trust fully may remain an elusive goal. Conservatives no doubt will, and should, continue to press Facebook to address the concerns that arose in our survey.
As Facebook considers additional changes, we will continue to help it understand conservative perspectives. To live up to its vision as a platform for all ideas, I believe Facebook understands it must do all it can to regain the trust of conservative users.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump said he was considering naming Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan as the next U.S. ambassador to Russia, a role that has become increasingly fraught under the Trump administration amid deteriorating relations with Moscow.
Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Sullivan was very respected and "could very well be" the nominee for the post, but didn't offer further details.
One administration official said the president was expected to name Mr. Sullivan to the ambassador post, which the New York Times reported earlier. Another aide said the White House hadn't finalized its nominee for the post.
If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Sullivan would succeed Jon Huntsman Jr., the current ambassador who said earlier this month that he would step down from the post in early October.
Mr. Sullivan had little diplomatic experience dealing with Moscow before 2017. A former partner at the Washington law firm Mayer Brown, where he was co-chair of the national-security practice, Mr. Sullivan has served as deputy secretary of state since May 2017 and briefly headed the State Department in an acting capacity last spring.

As deputy, he has led discussions between the U.S. and Russia on counterterrorism and arms control and has played a leading role on sanctions, terror designations and other matters related to Russia, according to a State Department official.
Also on Tuesday, the president reiterated his call for Russia to rejoin the Group of Seven world leaders, days before the group is set to convene in France. Last year, Mr. Trump made a similar call shortly before the G-7 summit. Russia was expelled from the G-7 in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
"I think it's much more appropriate to have Russia in," he said Tuesday.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly drawn criticism for his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose government interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections on Mr. Trump's behalf, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.
Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Sullivan to serve as deputy secretary of state in April 2017. He was confirmed by the Senate the next month by a margin of 94-6. When the president ousted former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last March, Mr. Sullivan served as acting secretary for about a month until he was succeeded by Mike Pompeo, the current secretary .
Mr. Sullivan previously served as general counsel and deputy secretary in the Commerce Department under former President George W. Bush. He would need to be confirmed again by the Senate to serve as ambassador to Russia.
Last month, Mr. Sullivan led a delegation of U.S. officials to Switzerland to participate in a discussion on arms control and other issues with Russian officials.
The president has previously considered Mr. Sullivan for other top roles in his administration, including as attorney general last fall ahead of Jeff Sessions' departure from the post.
The next U.S. ambassador to Russia will take on a job that is particularly rife with tension under Mr. Trump, who despite his praise of Mr. Putin has overseen a worsening in relations with Moscow after U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that the Kremlin attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Russia has denied any interference, and Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about the intelligence conclusion.
Under the Trump administration, the U.S., along with its Western partners, has imposed various rounds of sanctions on Russia, including over alleged election interference. The two countries have also engaged in a tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats , and last month Mr. Huntsman said Russia had denied visas for teachers at a Moscow school run by the U.S., British and Canadian embassies.
Mr. Huntsman has also overseen a shrinking of the embassy staff because of the diplomatic expulsions, including after the 2018 poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the U.K. Earlier this month, the Trump administration levied new sanctions on Russia over the poisoning of Mr. Skripal.
Mr. Trump has been heavily scrutinized in recent years over his ties to Russia. Former special counsel Robert Mueller released a report this spring upon the conclusion of his investigation into Russia's election interference in which he said he couldn't establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the report documented a sweeping effort by Russia to interfere in the election, as well as repeated contacts between Russians and members of the president's orbit—including Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son.
Congressional investigators are continuing to probe business ties between the president and Russia. Major Wall Street banks have given congressional committees investigating the president thousands of pages of documents related to Russians who may have had dealings with Mr. Trump, his family or his business, people familiar with the congressional probes said.

Trump-Miller, la mancuerna del mal

Texto completo: Durante el fin de semana, dos de los principales diarios de Estados Unidos, The New York Times y The Washington Post, dedicaron artículos de primera plana a la polémica figura del asesor presidencial, Stephen Miller, el principal arquitecto de la política antiinmigrante del gobierno de Donald Trump.
Nada de lo descrito sorprende a quienes abogamos por los derechos de los inmigrantes, pues el siniestro Miller ya había dejado su marca cuando trabajó para legisladores republicanos en el Congreso, particularmente para el exsenador de Alabama y venido a menos exsecretario de Justicia, Jeff Sessions, otra de las figuras más antiinmigrantes del Partido Republicano.
Miller es uno de los funcionarios que ha sobrevivido en el gobierno de Trump, cuando otros no han corrido la misma suerte. Y es muy probable que se deba a que comparte con el presidente el mismo desdén contra las minorías étnicas, particularmente los hispanos aunque sean ciudadanos, contra los inmigrantes, con o sin documentos, y una particular aversión hacia los refugiados.
Porque queda claro que la retórica antiinmigrante de Trump, la política pública resultante y los proyectos impulsados están dirigidos a minorías, inmigrantes y refugiados de color. Nunca hemos oído a Trump o a Miller despotricar contra indocumentados blancos.
Sus intenciones de “blanquear” una nación que ellos ven amenazada por los cambios demográficos, que nos llevan aceleradamente a ser un país donde las minorías serán mayorías, se sustentan en el racismo y en la falsa idea de que esas minorías suponen una amenaza para su existencia y supervivencia.
Y digo falsa, porque en todos los indicadores los anglosajones siguen gozando de una situación privilegiada; sin ignorar, claro está, que, como en todos los grupos étnicos, hay sectores blancos golpeados por el desempleo, los bajos salarios, la falta de seguro médico y problemas sociales. De todos modos, ser blancos les sigue suponiendo una ventaja, ante los obstáculos que enfrentan las minorías menos privilegiadas.
Pero en lugar de tener un debate sincero sobre las causas de las desigualdades —provocadas incluso por las mismas políticas que impulsa Trump, por ejemplo, una reducción tributaria que en realidad solo beneficia a ricos, y ofensivas contra el Obamacare que dejaría sin seguro médico a millones—, lo más sencillo es buscar un chivo expiatorio. Y esos son los inmigrantes y las minorías de color.
Pero es más truculento porque la agenda que impulsan Trump y Miller es la misma de los supremacistas blancos que ven en la inmigración y en el crecimiento de las minorías una amenaza a su supervivencia.
Los mecanismos no importan, así sea separar familias, enjaular niños y bebés, privarlos de sus padres, no proveerle a esos menores los productos más básicos como jabón, pasta de dientes o una cobija para dormir. O extraviar a esos menores en la madeja burocrática. O como se reportó este pasado fin de semana, explorar la idea de negar la educación a niños indocumentados, lo cual iría en contra de un fallo de 1982 de la Corte Suprema que garantiza el acceso de indocumentados al sistema de educación pública.
Miller es también el artífice de la regla sobre “carga pública” y de todas las políticas antiinmigrantes de Trump, comenzando con el veto musulmán.
Es sabido que el Partido Republicano es cómplice de Trump y de Miller por su silencio. Trump no enfrenta ninguna resistencia interna, porque mientras los republicanos coloquen a los jueces conservadores que quieren y mientras la economía los favorezca, poco importa lo que diga o haga el presidente.
La pregunta es si la estrategia antiinmigrante y racista funcionará en la elección general de 2020. No fue el caso de los comicios intermedios de 2018, cuando los demócratas ganaron la mayoría en la Cámara Baja y varias gubernaturas en distritos y estados que en 2016 favorecieron a Trump. Diversos sondeos señalan que la retórica y las políticas prejuiciosas de Trump no gozan del apoyo de la mayoría de los estadounidenses.
Pero los demócratas todavía no cuentan con un abanderado o abanderada, y eso también definirá el curso de las elecciones presidenciales.
Lo que sí es evidente es que el Partido Republicano que conocíamos ya no existe. El último presidente republicano en impulsar una reforma migratoria y en tratar de hacer más incluyente a esa colectividad fue George W. Bush, quien ocupó la Casa Blanca hasta el 20 de enero de 2009, cuando Barack Obama juramentó su primer mandato.
Los sectores republicanos más antiinimigrantes se consideraban marginales en esa época, pero en solo una década se han colocado a la cabeza del partido, al grado que es comandado por Trump, la figura republicana más divisiva y racista en la historia reciente, y su copiloto Miller. Peor aún, Trump tiene el apoyo de 90% del Partido Republicano.
No sé si los conservadores más moderados buscarán refugio temporal con los demócratas o los independientes; si fundarán otra colectividad ahora que la suya ha sido secuestrada por los antiinmigrantes; o si ya el Partido Republicano rebasó el punto donde no hay retorno.
Lo que sí queda claro es que Trump y Miller, la mancuerna del mal, todavía tienen año y medio para seguir haciendo daño, con la posibilidad de cuatro años más, si Trump es reelecto.

Reports: Ty Lue joining Clippers' coaching staff as Doc Rivers' top assistant

Resumen: Tyronn Lue, former head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, will be re-joining Doc Rivers on the Los Angeles Clippers' coach staff, per reports.

Texto completo: The Los Angeles Clippers are bringing in another big name this offseason.
Tyronn Lue, who won the 2016 NBA title and guided the Cleveland Cavaliers to two other Finals appearances, is joining Doc Rivers' coaching staff as lead assistant, according to multiple reports. The Athletic's Shams Charania was the first to report the agreement.
The New York Times' Marc Stein reported last week the Clippers were "closing in" on the former head coach, and an agreement was seemingly reached Tuesday.
Lue previously served as an assistant for Rivers from 2011-2014 with both the Boston Celtics and Clippers. Lue also played for Rivers in part of one season, in 2003-04 with the Orlando Magic.
Besides being a title winner in his own right, the Clippers adding Lue is interesting for what happened earlier this year: his failure to reach an agreement with the in-arena rival Los Angeles Lakers – with whom Lue won two championships as a player – to become head coach after once being at the "forefront" of their search. The Lakers eventually hired former Magic and Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel; Jason Kidd, former NBA All-Star and coach of the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks, will be one of Vogel's assistants.

SURVEY: Rookies say Reddish will be better than Zion long-term
In parts of four seasons with the Cavs, Lue went 128-83 and – behind LeBron James – the team went to the NBA Finals from 2016-2018, winning that first appearance in their stunning 3-1 comeback against the Golden State Warriors. Despite his status as the first coach to lead the Cavaliers to a championship, and despite James leaving for the Lakers in the offseason, Lue was fired after an 0-6 start in 2018-19.
The addition of Lue is just the latest storyline in what is shaping up to be an eventful season for the two Los Angeles teams. The Clippers added California natives Kawhi Leonard (in free agency fresh off a second Finals MVP) and Paul George (via a stunning trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder), while the Lakers added another star alongside James by acquiring Anthony Davis in a big swap with the New Orleans Pelicans.
All eyes will be on Staples Center in 2019-20.

Resumen: The curious timing of Jeffrey Epstein’s will and the launch of U.S. Space Command: Tuesday's news

Texto completo: The Space Force is getting closer to launch, and a colleague of mine tried 'shroom coffee in the office.
It's Ashley. Here’s the news you need to know from Tuesday.
But first, it's too quiet: If you think it's been an unusually quiet hurricane season, you're right. Could this be the calm before the storm? History says yes.
Space Force, asseeemble!
The newest branch of the military – officially called, and I'm not joking, SPACE FORCE – is getting closer to launch. Though it’s not actually written in all caps, I feel like it should be. Tuesday at a National Space Council meeting (yes, this, too, is a thing), Vice President Mike Pence and Pentagon officials announced that the U. S. Space Command (not to be confused with Buzz Lightyear's Star Command) that will launch the Space Force will be established next week. For years, Pentagon officials have scoffed at the Space Force idea, but the concept gradually won converts over the years – including President Donald Trump who signed a directive in February creating the Space Force. Potential threats from China and Russia are part of the reasoning behind creating the force, Trump said, though officially establishing said Space Force requires congressional approval, a step Pence said would happen soon.
Epstein signed a will, then died two days later
Accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein signed a will two days before he died by suicide in a New York jail, court records show, leaving behind an estate valued at more than $577 million, including more than $56 million in cash. Epstein signed the 21-page document Aug. 8. The will lists no details of beneficiaries, according to the New York Post. Epstein put all of his holdings in a trust, called the 1953 Trust. Why? A law expert told The New York Times it may have been an attempt to keep his financial dealings from public scrutiny. Less than two days after signing the will, Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. He was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges tied to underage girls.
Planned Parenthood exits Title X over abortion rule
Planned Parenthood announced this week that it's withdrawing from a federal family planning program, known as Title X, that will ban those receiving funds through it from referring women to abortion providers. The decision marks a major turning point in Planned Parenthood's fight for reproductive rights as Republican lawmakers push to ban abortion. The organization says it plans to continue operating its health centers and find ways to make up for the loss of federal funding. Here's what this means for women who want an abortion.
What everyone’s talking about
Mushroom coffee is trending, and my colleague Carly Mallenbaum tried to get me to drink it at work.
A beach, sans sand: A French couple could face six years in jail after police say they stole sand from an Italian beach.
Important cat video: This angry cat with "horns" is just a lovable ball of fluff.
Are you a parent? Having kids does make you happier, according to a new study. But only after they leave the nest.
People are hot and bothered by Heidi Klum's latest steamy Instagram photos.
Sharks have multiplied off the Massachusetts coast, and they're putting swimmers on edge.
Thousands live on the streets in LA, and it's getting costly
Los Angeles is trying to cope with thousands of people living on its streets without permanent shelter. The city is doing so by building a small section of apartments, which cost nearly $700,000 per unit. The city says it’s doing what it can to keep costs low, but advocates for the homeless say the city’s approach is extravagant – and not reaching as many of those at risk as it could. Is $700,000 in tax dollars for an apartment worth it to try to solve a homeless crisis? "Obviously, the city would very much like to see projects produced at a lower price point," one city official said.
Real quick
A possible "armed intruder" was reported at Louisiana State University, and the school tweeted a warning to "run, hide or fight. "
A beloved California teacher was shot to death in front of her 5-year-old son.
Tennessee State quarterback Demry Croft was charged with rape and sexual battery.
Trump is looking at a temporary reduction in payroll taxes and other proposals to lift the economy.
Not all heroes wear capes: He was feeding the hungry. Then he rescued a woman from a burning building.
Trump and Hillary, at it again
After Trump claimed Google "manipulated from 2. 6 million to 16 million votes" for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, the former Democratic presidential nominee responded that the study Trump referred to had been "debunked. " Clinton said on Twitter Monday that the study was actually "based on 21 undecided voters. " She wrote, "For context that’s about half the number of people associated with your campaign who have been indicted. " Trump said on Twitter that "Google must be sued" and that his electoral victory should have been larger. PolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact-checking website, rated Trump's claim as "false. "

Texto completo: From "The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits" by Milton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, Sept. 13, 1970:
In a free-enterprise, private-property system, a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his employers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to their basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom. . . .
Whether blameworthy or not, the use of the cloak of social responsibility, and the nonsense spoken in its name by influential and prestigious businessmen, does clearly harm the foundations of a free society. I have been impressed time and again by the schizophrenic character of many businessmen. They are capable of being extremely far-sighted and clear-headed in matters that are internal to their businesses. They are incredibly short-sighted and muddle-headed in matters that are outside their businesses but affect the possible survival of business in general. This short-sightedness is strikingly exemplified in the calls from many businessmen for wage and price guidelines or controls or income policies. There is nothing that could do more in a brief period to destroy a market system and replace it by a centrally controlled system than effective governmental control of prices and wages.
The short-sightedness is also exemplified in speeches by businessmen on social responsibility. This may gain them kudos in the short run. But it helps to strengthen the already too prevalent view that the pursuit of profits is wicked and immoral and must be curbed and controlled by external forces. Once this view is adopted, the external forces that curb the market will not be the social consciences, however highly developed, of the pontificating executives; it will be the iron fist of Government bureaucrats. Here, as with price and wage controls, businessmen seem to me to reveal a suicidal impulse.

Trump Mulls Tapping Pompeo's Deputy as New Russian Envoy; John Sullivan, No. 2 at State Department and potential nominee, has limited diplomatic experience dealing with Kremlin

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump said he was considering naming Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan as the next U.S. ambassador to Russia, a role that has become increasingly fraught under the Trump administration amid deteriorating relations with Moscow.
Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Sullivan was very respected and "could very well be" the nominee for the post, but didn't offer further details.
One administration official said the president was expected to name Mr. Sullivan to the ambassador post, which the New York Times reported earlier. Another aide said the White House hadn't finalized its nominee for the post.
If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Sullivan would succeed Jon Huntsman Jr., the current ambassador who said earlier this month that he would step down from the post in early October.
Mr. Sullivan has little diplomatic experience dealing with Moscow. A former partner at the Washington law firm Mayer Brown, where he was co-chair of the national-security practice, Mr. Sullivan has served as deputy secretary of state since May 2017 and briefly headed the State Department in an acting capacity last spring.
The State Department declined to comment.
Also on Tuesday, the president reiterated his call for Russia to rejoin the Group of Seven world leaders, days before the group is set to convene in France. Last year, Mr. Trump made a similar call shortly before the G-7 summit. Russia was expelled from the G-7 in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
"I think it's much more appropriate to have Russia in," he said Tuesday.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly drawn criticism for his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose government interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections on Mr. Trump's behalf, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.
Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Sullivan to serve as deputy secretary of state in April 2017. He was confirmed by the Senate the next month by a margin of 94-6. When the president ousted former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last March, Mr. Sullivan served as acting secretary for about a month until he was succeeded by Mike Pompeo, the current secretary .
Mr. Sullivan previously served as general counsel and deputy secretary in the Commerce Department under former President George W. Bush. He would need to be confirmed again by the Senate to serve as ambassador to Russia.
Last month, Mr. Sullivan led a delegation of U.S. officials to Switzerland to participate in a discussion on arms control and other issues with Russian officials.
The president has previously considered Mr. Sullivan for other top roles in his administration, including as attorney general last fall ahead of Jeff Sessions's departure from the post.
The next U.S. ambassador to Russia will take on a job that is particularly rife with tension under Mr. Trump, who despite his praise of Mr. Putin has overseen a worsening in relations with Moscow after U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that the Kremlin attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Russia has denied any interference, and Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about the intelligence conclusion.
Under the Trump administration, the U.S., along with its Western partners, has imposed various rounds of sanctions on Russia, including over alleged election interference. The two countries have also engaged in a tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats , and last month Mr. Huntsman said Russia had denied visas for teachers at a Moscow school run by the U.S., British and Canadian embassies.
Mr. Huntsman has also overseen a shrinking of the embassy staff because of the diplomatic expulsions, including after the 2018 poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the U.K. Earlier this month, the Trump administration levied new sanctions on Russia over the poisoning of Mr. Skripal.
Mr. Trump has been heavily scrutinized in recent years over his ties to Russia. Former special counsel Robert Mueller released a report this spring upon the conclusion of his investigation into Russia's election interference in which he said he couldn't establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the report documented a sweeping effort by Russia to interfere in the election, as well as repeated contacts between Russians and members of the president's orbit—including Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son.
Congressional investigators are continuing to probe business ties between the president and Russia. Major Wall Street banks have given congressional committees investigating the president thousands of pages of documents related to Russians who may have had dealings with Mr. Trump, his family or his business, people familiar with the congressional probes said.

Why Conservatives Don't Trust Facebook; My independent team of investigators looked into the complaints, and the company has taken action.

Texto completo: From the Ivy League to Hollywood and the mainstream media, Americans with traditional morals or conservative politics have often felt excluded from the country's elite, culture-creating institutions. Facebook offered an alternative: a place to express views and share news that you couldn't find in the New York Times.
Over time, however, many conservatives lost trust in Facebook, believing it discriminated against them. The increasing scale and complexity of Facebook's content-moderation practices made matters worse. In 2016 Facebook employees were accused of suppressing conservative articles in the news feed's now-discontinued "trending" section. In April 2018 Congress grilled Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg about anticonservative bias, from blocked content to suspended accounts.
In response to mounting criticism, Facebook asked me to conduct a survey to hear from conservatives directly. Following substantial public interest in the project and in light of policy changes Facebook has recently made, we have decided to share our findings at this time.
More Opinion on Social Media
* Gallant: Facebook Censors at Random
* Zuckerberg: The Facts About Facebook
* Cox: Hawley's Bad Idea to Protect Speech
* Weinstein: I Compete With Facebook, and It's No Monopoly
* Prager: Don't Let Google Get Away With Censorship
Facebook placed no restrictions on how I could conduct the work. My team at the law firm Covington & Burling LLP began conducting interviews in May 2018. We cast a wide net to include as many aspects of conservatism as possible—from organizations focused on Christian values or protecting free expression to those focused on tax policy and small government. We identified individuals, groups and lawmakers who either use, study or could potentially regulate Facebook, and interviewed 133 of them. To encourage them to speak freely, we told interviewees we wouldn't publish their identities. We presented our preliminary findings to Facebook in early August 2018 and have been discussing them with the company ever since.
We found conservatives' concerns generally fall within the following six buckets:
• Content distribution and algorithms. Conservatives have expressed concern that bias against their viewpoints may be "baked in" to Facebook's algorithms. In addition, interviewees argued that Facebook shouldn't be in the business of separating fact from fiction in the news.
• Content policies. Facebook's community standards prohibit hate speech, graphic violence, adult nudity, sexual activity and cruel and insensitive content. Several interviewees pointed to the highly subjective, ever-evolving nature of some of these standards, in particular the term "hate speech."
• Content enforcement. Interviewees were concerned that the biases of Facebook employees who enforce the rules may result in disproportionate censoring of conservatives. Some midsize and grass-roots organizations also believe their appeals are not taken as seriously as those of larger organizations.
• Ad policies. In the wake of strong evidence from the U.S. intelligence community that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 presidential election with fake social-media accounts and inflammatory content, Facebook required advertisers to register as "political" organizations in order to post ads with a political or policy focus. Some conservative interviewees said this new rule jeopardized their status as nonprofits under Section 501(c)(3) of the tax code.
• Ad enforcement. As a result of Facebook's new, more stringent ad policies, interviewees said the ad-approval process has slowed significantly. Some fear that the new process may be designed to disadvantage conservative ads in the wake of the Trump campaign's successful use of social media in 2016.
• Workforce viewpoint diversity. Several interviewees noted the overall lack of viewpoint diversity throughout Facebook's workforce and senior management.
Facebook has made several changes that are responsive to our findings, and we understand more are being considered. For now, changes include:
• Oversight board. Facebook announced plans last month for an oversight board to hear appeals of some more-difficult content-removal decisions. If structured to reflect accurately the diverse ideological and religious views of Facebook's user base, the board may help ensure content decisions are made thoughtfully and free from inappropriate bias.
• Explanations of news-feed rankings. To foster user trust in the algorithms that influence content placement, Facebook has launched transparency tools that explain to users why they see certain content on their news feeds.
• Page transparency. Facebook has enabled page managers to see when their content has been removed for violating community standards, or when distribution of a post has been reduced because a fact-checker gave it a "false" rating.
• Staffing. Facebook has hired four additional people devoted exclusively to working with smaller organizations to resolve questions and complaints about content decisions.
• Ad labeling requirements. To avoid incorrectly branding ads as "political," Facebook renamed its ads library and now refers instead to ads "about social issues, elections or politics."
• Ad policies. Facebook has changed its ad policies that prohibit images of patients with medical tubes as "shocking and sensational content." This will make it easier to promote certain pro-life ads.
We believe these and other measures described in our interim report are steps in the right direction. Yet these are complicated issues, some of which involve conflicting opinions even among conservatives. For that reason, restoring trust fully may remain an elusive goal. Conservatives no doubt will, and should, continue to press Facebook to address the concerns that arose in our survey.
As Facebook considers additional changes, we will continue to help it understand conservative perspectives. To live up to its vision as a platform for all ideas, I believe Facebook understands it must do all it can to regain the trust of conservative users.

Texto completo: Current methods using indicator bacteria for testing recreation waters for microbial safety are antiquated and replete with false positives and false negatives. We have the technology but not the will to adopt new science-based water safety testing.
The recent commentary by state Health Department Director Bruce Anderson makes some assurances the monitoring of recreation water bacteria is all good (“Ocean-water quality monitoring improves,” Island Voices, Aug. 7).
Unfortunately, all is not good. The methods used are grossly obsolete, and there is ample scientific evidence to the fact. The mandate for these 1970s methods is the U.S. Beach Act (2000).
To qualify for federal funds, the state must use the method and guidelines. Once again, politics usurps science.
The indicator bacteria measured is the genus Enterococci. In recreation waters where there is no discharge of wastewater, the test is less than 50/50 for predicting disease risk. The microbes of concern are not bacteria, but human virus.
In the genus Enterococci, there are 10-plus species detected by the official test. Only two species are common in feces of most animals, and humans. What makes this test very imprecise is the fact that these two species of Enterococci, as well as many others, grow readily in the environment. Just about any place there is moisture and organic debris, these microbes can be found.
The health director implied that this soil growth issue is unique to tropical Hawaii. But these indicator species are common in the environment with human activities, even in cold places like Alaska and the lakes of Michigan.
In coastal waters, the major source of Enterococci is the beach sand itself. Entero persists there very well. Waves and tides that stir the sand, resuspend the bacteria into the water. If beach water is tested soon after such an event, high indicator numbers can be found. The health risk is negligible in most cases.
To be clear, we cannot project the disease risk from any bacterial indicator measurement. There are far too many false positives and false negatives. If a medical blood test was correct only half the time, it would be a useless diagnostic. Environmental Protection Agency scientists would like to solve this problem, but there is no political will at the top.
Amid all this uncertainty, some may fear recreating in our ocean. There is reassurance. The sun is the greatest disinfector ever known. The UV light penetrates deeply in clear water and will reduce bacterial and viral counts in a matter of a few hours of midday sun. We need to assure the waters remain clear, but we are not doing well in this regard.
The human waste nutrients flowing into the sea cause marine phytoplankton to grow and waters become turbid. As this happens, the UV of the sun penetrates less. Disease risk increases with turbidity. We must begin to limit the massive flow of human waste nutrients into the sea.
Science-based techniques for measuring fecal contamination are coming. Phylochip is an exact tool that can monitor the entire fecal microbiome and identify its source. Once the technology is commercialized for public health labs, the costs become competitive.
Another indicator of human waste is Sucralose, known as Splenda, the artificial sweetener. Tests in Florida waters show fecal Sucralose in wastewater is detectable in fresh and marine waters. The test method is straightforward and can be commercialized.
What’s needed now is the initiative and funding from private and public partnerships to implement technology to help protect Hawaii’s most precious resource, the sea.

Texto completo: Growing up in rural South Carolina, Sharmaine Brown was used to seeing firearms in her family's farmhouse.
Her father kept a shotgun primarily to fend off predators that tried to prey on the calves, hogs, goats and chickens he raised. But the gun also gave her father and the family a sense of security. As an African American man who'd grown up in the segregated South, where racial violence was a reality, he felt he needed the protection a firearm could offer, Brown said.
"That'showIgrewup.Itwascommon to have a gun in the house," said Brown, an Atlanta resident.
But her views on guns changed whenher23-year-oldson, Jared, was killed in 2015. He was hit by a stray bullet while attending a cookout with friends in southwest Atlanta.
On Thursday, Brown, Douglas Jefferson of the National African American Gun Association and New York Times bestselling author Kiese Laymon will headline the "Guns and Black Southern Life" forum at the Auburn Avenue Research Library in Atlanta at 7 p.m. The forum, sponsored by WABE radio, in partnership with WAMU radio in Washington, D.C., is part of the "Guns in America" reporting project, which examines the role firearms play in contemporary American life.
WABE reporter Lisa Hagen, who is convening the panel, has been studying gun culture, particularly how it's expressed in Southern, African-American communities. The rural experience, such as what Brown lived through in South Carolina, is common, Hagen wrote in an email interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
"There are also a lot of significant gun regulations in this country that have been about regulating black gun ownership, from Reconstruction through to the Black Panthers," Hagen wrote. "In so many ways, the American history of guns and gun policy is basically inseparable from race and racism."
Giventherecentmassshootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, the forum comes at a time when the nation is talking about gun control and the Second Amendment.How African-American gun owners figure into that debate is often overlooked by media and some policymakers.
"With all the turmoil and instability over at the National Rifle Association, it also feels like an especially important moment to highlight a contemporary black gun culture that I think may hold different sets of meanings than what we typically associate with 'the gun lobby,'" Hagen wrote.
Jefferson, with the National African American Gun Association, said many people don't realize the tradition of black people bearing arms stretches back to the nation's founding.
"The Second Amendment --and its embrace by the African American community, particularly in the South -- has been integral to this community gaining, asserting and practicing many other civil rights that we have today, including the right to vote," Jefferson said.
Where Jefferson does not support a ban onassault weapons, Brown does. Hagen is hopeful the forum will spotlight the diversity within the African-American community around policies and proposals roiling the nation.

Texto completo: The first, startling epigraph in Nicci Gerrard's new book, "The Last Ocean," comes from Emily Dickinson: "Abyss has no Biographer." Gerrard sets out to tell the story of dementia, a disease that can appear to consume those it afflicts. After her father, John, died in 2014, the author -- who writes best-selling thrillers with her husband under the name Nicci French -- embarked on learning more about the disease as both a journalist and an activist. The result is a tender, inquisitive tour of a subject that can be raw and painful. Below, Gerrard talks about loss, art that punches you in the solar plexus and the experience of writing a book that doesn't answer questions.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
I first had the idea when my father, who'd been living with dementia for over 10 years, went into hospital in February 2014. After four weeks without anyone to see him -- we were allowed in for very limited times and then not at all, because of a norovirus outbreak -- I barely recognized him. I will, for the rest of my life, feel terribly that I didn't get him out earlier. Then he lived at home for nine months. He had become skeletal, immobile, inarticulate, and in a way he felt utterly lost, like a ghost in our lives and in his own life. He would lay downstairs in a hospital bed, looking outside at the garden he used to love.
There was this clear sense that he'd already lost everything he had, everything he was, all his capacity, there was nothing left -- and yet somehow that he didn't lose himself. In the book I say that if I were religious, I would call that self he retained his soul. Something very indelible remained.
And witnessing that, I knew there was a book I could write about how mysterious it is to be human, really. But I absolutely didn't think there was a book I would write. I didn't want to write a memoir; my father was a very private man, and my family's quite private, and there are lots of wonderful memoirs. So instead of writing what I'd been through, I launched this campaign for better care for those who go into hospital. For three or four years, I spent my working days talking to doctors, nurses, carers and, above all, people living with the illness. I knew I had to find a way of making that into a book full of lots of different voices and stories. I didn't want to write a book that was certain and had answers. I wanted to write a book that was full of questions and feelings.
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
It changed the way I thought about so many different things -- about being alive, actually. If I had to think of one thing that knocked me back: I became more optimistic and less scared about getting old, becoming frail, than I had been before I started. There was nothing redemptive about Dad's last months; it was just cruel and awful. I went to see an autopsy of someone who had had dementia, and the person conducting it pointed to these myriad bits of the brain where dementia can occur. There are hundreds of different kinds of dementia. Some people have impaired brains, but they show no sign of dementia; it's only at death that you see they had the condition. And others with dementia seem, at death, to have a healthy brain. So it's a very mysterious disease, which is why it's hard to find the cure. You probably have to find hundreds of cures.
But I've seen people with it who live with a sense of spiritual adventure, who refuse to be ashamed, who manage to hold on to themselves and live with endurance and lack of self-pity and go bravely into the night. And I've seen so many carers bearing the unbearable and holding onto love. I thought writing the book would be painful, and it was, but it made me realize just how extraordinary people can be.
In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?
I didn't know what book I was setting out to write. I knew it would follow the stages of self-loss, and be full of other people's voices and stories as well as my own, and be a book of uncertainty and doubt. I knew I wanted it to be very emotional and intimate but also dispassionate and philosophical. But when writing is going well, it leads you to places you didn't know you were going to go.
I set out partly to make a confession to my father, but I didn't know what that confession would be. I knew the journey in a big way, like when you look at a map and see the road, but then when you set out there are forests and ditches and floods.
Since it was published, it's changed again. It's changed radically for me. I've been going around the country doing talks and interviews, and in the end, I haven't experienced anything like it as a novelist. People get up and instead of asking a question, they start crying. And they start saying things out loud that they've never said to anyone, in front of a roomful of people.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
Käthe Kollwitz. She was a German artist and a socialist and pacifist and grandmother. She lived through both world wars. She lost her son in the first and her grandson in the second. She made the most extraordinary prints and sculptures about the deprivations of war, and about female suffering. The first time I saw her work, I'd never heard her name. I walked into this art gallery in Berlin and thought I'd been punched in the solar plexus.
Her works are often in black and white, and they're very strong portrayals of women grieving. There are lots of self-portraits that look right into and through you. They're scary. And tender. She's my hero. Men often act and speak, and women are the ones who mourn and bear witness. She did both.
Persuade someone to read "The Last Ocean" in 50 words or less.
Dementia is everywhere: if not you, then someone you know. This is a book about being vulnerable, frail, at the mercy of others. It's also full of stories of courage, love, hope, even joy. It's about what it is to be human, what it is to say goodbye.

Texto completo: As a freshman in college, after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, I wrote a poem titled "Please Mr. President" that was published in The New York Times and then the Daily Herald.
I clung to an idealism meant for storybooks, addressing an envelope with my poem to the White House, half-believing that our president would read and share my words.
He didn’t. I’m still not sure why I was surprised.
I’d directed my hope and plea for change at our president. Two years later, I’ve come to realize that my hopes and pleas mean nothing to the people in power.
When I was 14 years old, standing in my kitchen, my parents told me about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. We reached the absolute worst — a massacre of children — in 2012, and then because the leaders of our country placed priority on other matters, we watched Las Vegas happen.
We watched Parkland happen. And then Sante Fe. And then Pittsburgh. And then Virginia Beach.
Most recently, we learned that 22 people were gunned down in El Paso, Texas, and another nine in Dayton, Ohio.
I have friends in Dayton and in Texas. I was scared for them.
I was scared for all of us.
Each time a tragic event occurs, we follow a script that begins with well-meaning words from people in power and ends without action. During a vigil in Dayton, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s words were overshadowed by people shouting, "Do something."
This discussion has been under way for a long time, but it’s difficult to move forward when progress is stalled by one excuse or another. It’s difficult to prioritize empathy, integrity and a sense of moral responsibility in a dialogue where money seems to supersede everything else.
Lately, politicians and civilians alike have resorted to blaming particular groups of people, hoping to pinpoint the problem and shift blame. We don’t have time for that. We have allowed the analysis, blaming and media coverage of mass shootings to become a partisan issue.
Yet it always has been, and will remain, a moral issue in which politics has no place. Set aside the right and left for a moment and realize that our own people are dying because of these divisions.
America, we must bind together and demand that this violence ends. We are blessed to look at that flag of red, white and blue fluttering in the breeze and remember the strength and power it represents.
America, we have so much potential for good, but we each have to want it.
A little over a week ago at Wrigley Field, I rose for the national anthem, feeling hopeful and hopeless at the same time. I watched our American flag fly at half-staff in light of the Ohio and Texas shootings.
In a moment void of partisan politics, I listened to acoustic guitar notes and patriotic lyrics waft over the baseball diamond. I watched 40,000 baseball fans rise together, bound by a pride and love for our nation.
It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.
It was during those few moments that I realized we each owe it to ourselves and our country to start demanding changes immediately.
The time for politicians’ well-meaning words is over. People are tired of well-meaning words because well-meaning words represent a fear to do something more.
America, I don’t want to appeal to the emotions of Congress or the president. I want to appeal to you. To your emotions and your hearts.
To the parents who send their kids on buses to school, trusting each day that their children’s education will not be compromised because of gun violence. To the families taking their kids to the movies, to concerts, to shopping malls, praying that their city won’t be in the headlines the next day because of gun violence.
I don’t think it wise for any of us to wait for Congress to change its predictable pattern. It has been given ample chances to step forward and make concrete changes to prevent gun violence. It won’t bring changes to the table on its own.
And if it won’t, then America, we must.
The movement for change starts from the ground up, and it starts with the people. And not just the people or towns affected by gun violence but every person in every city. So let’s start with the small steps.
We can fill the inboxes of congressmen and women with requests for new laws. We can write letters to senators asking for sessions on gun regulation. We can speak peacefully and directly to our governors about taking action to solve this problem instead of talking about it, just as a group of people did during Gov. DeWine’s speech.
Countless gun reform groups are already advocating for change. Everytown for Gun Safety, started in 2006, has nearly 6 million supporters. America, we can join them.
For the safety and protection of our citizens, we each must step forward and speak until the people in power cannot ignore us.

Texto completo: Long before the El Paso massacre, President Trump's political opponents accused him of sowing "division" with his "racist language." Mr. Trump "exploits race," "uses race for his gain," is engaged in a "racially divisive reprise" of his 2016 campaign, stokes "racial resentments," and puts "race at the fore," the New York Times has reported over the past several months.
Yet Mr. Trump rarely uses racial categories in his speech or his tweets. It is the media and Democratic leaders who routinely characterize individuals and groups by race and issue race-based denunciations of large parts of the American polity.
Some examples: "As race dominates the political conversation, 10 white Democratic candidates will take the stage" (the Washington Post); Mr. Trump's rally audiences are "overwhelmingly white" (multiple sources); your son's "whiteness is what protects him from not [sic] being shot" by the police (Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand); white candidates need to be conscious of "white privilege" (South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg); "white supremacy manifests itself" in the criminal-justice, immigration and health-care systems (Sen. Cory Booker); "Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri" (Sen. Elizabeth Warren); whiteness is "the very core" of Mr. Trump's power, whereas his "predecessors made their way to high office through the passive power of whiteness" (Ta-Nehisi Coates in the Atlantic).
Liberal opinion deems such rhetoric fair comment, even obvious truth, not "racially divisive." America's universities deserve credit for this double standard. Identity politics dominate higher education: Administrators, students and faculty obsessively categorize themselves and each other by race. "White privilege," often coupled with "toxic masculinity," is the focus of freshmen orientations and an ever-growing array of courses. Any institutional action that affects a "person of color" is "about race." If a black professor doesn't get tenure, he's a victim of discrimination; a white professor is presumed to be unqualified.
That interpretive framework explains asymmetries in how the political and media elites analyze the Trump phenomenon. Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, recently denounced Mr. Trump's "almost daily attacks on black and brown people." But "almost" and "black and brown" are superfluous. Mr. Trump's attacks on his fellow 2016 candidates -- and on more-recent adversaries as homogeneous as Robert Mueller, Rep. Adam Schiff, Joe Biden and Ms. Warren -- were as nasty as anything he's directed at Rep. Elijah Cummings or Rep. Ilhan Omar.
But according to the academic template, to criticize a "person of color" is inevitably "about race." Mr. Buttigieg ran afoul of this rule after firing South Bend's black police chief for secretly taping officers' phone calls. The idea that the mayor fired the chief because he was black is absurd, yet Mr. Buttigieg inevitably faced charges of racial insensitivity. Likewise, advocates and the media deemed Mr. Trump's nonracial denunciation of Baltimore's leadership racist. Never mind that the victims of the city's almost daily drive-by shootings are black. Race shields minority politicians from criticism.
Ms. Warren recently provided an unwitting summary of academic identity politics. Mr. Trump's "central message" to the American people, she declared, is: "If there's anything wrong in your life, blame them -- and 'them' means people who aren't the same color as you." She has in mind a white "you," but change the race and you encapsulate the reigning assumption on college campuses -- that white people are the source of nonwhite people's problems, and any behavioral or cultural explanations for economic disparities are taboo.
The academy's reflexive labeling of nonconforming views as "hate speech" has also infiltrated popular rhetoric against Mr. Trump. The president's views on border control and national sovereignty are at odds with the apparent belief among Democratic elites that people living outside the country are entitled to enter at will and without consequences for illegal entry. To the academic and democratic left, however, a commitment to border enforcement can only arise from "hate." Such a pre-emptive interpretation is a means of foreclosing debate and stigmatizing dissent from liberal orthodoxy.
Identity politics, now a driving force in the Democratic Party, celebrates the racial and ethnic identities of designated victim groups while consigning whites -- especially heterosexual white men -- to scapegoat status. But its advocates should be careful what they wish for. If "whiteness" is a legitimate topic of academic and political discourse, some individuals are going to embrace "white identity" proudly.
To note the inevitability of white identity politics in no way condones the grotesque violence of men like the El Paso killer. But the dominant culture is creating a group of social pariahs, a very small percentage of whom -- already unmoored from traditional sources of meaning and stability, such as family -- are taking their revenge through stomach-churning mayhem. Overcoming racial divisiveness will be difficult. But the primary responsibility rests with its main propagators: the academic left and its imitators in politics and mass media.

Recession? Unlikely, at least this year

Texto completo: After a couple of wild weeks, with financial markets and the economy sending mixed signals, the question of the moment is: Are we on the verge of a recession?
Looking at the rest of this year, almost all forecasters say no. While the US economy is slowing, the output of goods and services should continue at a respectable clip of about 2 percent. The unemployment rate is expected to remain near a 50-year low (it was 3.7 percent in July), and a spike in inflation is on no one's radar.
But the picture is far less certain if we peer farther down the road.
In a survey released Monday by the National Association of Business Economists, 38 percent of respondents said they expected a downturn in 2020. The good news: That's a dip from 42 percent in the group's survey in February, before the Federal Reserve made clear it would ease interest rates as needed to extend the economic expansion.
The caveat: Most respondents to the survey, which was taken July 14 through Aug. 1, replied before the trade fight with China escalated. On Aug. 1, President Trump ordered tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing responded by letting the value of its currency slide against the US dollar, which was seen as a retaliatory move.
Since then, US stocks have taken a bumpy ride lower, and bond investors are acting like they consider a recession inevitable.
Still, given all the concern recently about corporate America growing cautious, it is interesting, even heartening, to see some business economists pushing back their recession forecast to 2021. Thirty-four percent of those surveyed by the NABE don't see the economy contracting until 2021, up from 25 percent in February.
“Survey respondents indicate that the expansion will be extended by the shift in monetary policy," Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG and president of the NABE, said in a statement.
In other words, the Fed's willingness to keep credit flowing — confirmed with its quarter-point rate cut on July 31 — probably keeps the economy moving forward through next year.
That would be good news for workers, management, and investors. It would also benefit Trump as he runs for reelection next year. A recession before November 2020 would seriously hurt the president's bid for a second term.
Recent economic data show manufacturing declined for two consecutive quarters, and business invesment softening.
But consumers remain confident and are continuing to spend, which is essential, since our purchases account for more than two-thirds of economic activity. In July, retail­ sales rose a faster-than-expected 0.7 percent.
“I think they're mainly feeling what's going on in the labor market — people are getting jobs and real wage growth is a little higher than it has been," said Megan Greene, the NABE's survey chair and a senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center of Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School. “We see the same phenomenon in Germany right now. The economy is circling the drain, but if you speak to regular Germans about it they haven't noticed because unemployment is low and their standard of living hasn't suffered."
So what could trigger a recession before 2021?
The list of threats has become familiar: tariffs and the trade war; recessions in key economies such as China and the aforementioned Germany; a decision by Britain to exit the European Union without a divorce agreement. (The NABE survey found 60 percent of respondents anticipate a no-deal Brexit or a “hard Brexit," which could entail some kind of transition agreement.) And we can't rule out a shock from a military confrontation with Iran or North Korea.
“Often, a recession results when some widely held belief about the world turns out to be false," Neil Irwin of The New York Times wrote over the weekend. “In 2001, it was that a technology boom would fuel the economy and the stock market indefinitely; in 2007, it was that the housing market would never melt down across all regions at once."
These days, Irwin said, events are undercutting our belief in progress — “that the world will only become more stable and interconnected over time, and that trade, currency and diplomatic relationships can be counted upon."
That's a scary proposition. Unfortunately, it's an entirely reasonable one, too.

Texto completo: A book festival and fundraiser will be Saturday in Hampton. Authors at the Hampton Roads Indie Author Book Festival include Doreen Allen, Tiffany Brown, Juanita Harrison, Kendra Robinson, Owen Watson and a couple dozen others. Food, kids' entertainment, story time and more. Though admission is free, organizer Florenza Denise Lee of Words to Ponder Publishing says proceeds will go to the nonprofit REACH, Reading Enriches All Children. 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Family Life Center (part of Warwick Assembly Church), 1 Redheart Drive. More: Facebook, Eventbrite.
Also: "Will This Be on the Test?: What Your Professors Really Want You to Know About Succeeding in College" author Dana Johnson signs the freshman-prep book, written with Jennifer Price, at 10 a.m. Friday. At 2 p.m., Ann Eichenmuller signs "The Lies Beneath," the third in her "Lies" series (here, the body of a former CIA agent washes up in Virginia Beach, disrupting Sandi Beck's new life). William & Mary Bookstore, Merchants Square, 345 Duke of Gloucester St., Williamsburg. 757-221-1651.
J.D. Salinger detested the internet and publicity, and yearned for privacy. His son Matt has steadfastly guarded his late father's wishes, but now, in an effort to put Salinger's work before new audiences, has compromised. Coming up: digital editions of Salinger's four books, and in the fall, the first public exhibition from his personal archives; later, the release of "decades' worth" of his unpublished writings. The man "was leery of many things, but he had a profound love for his readers," his son said. "He wouldn't want people to not be able to read his stuff." (NYT)
Toni Morrison in 2012 gave a talk about how authors explore good and evil in their works (and how evil tends to fascinate more). This lecture, "Goodness: Altruism and the Literary Imagination," was published for the first time shortly after she died, in The New York Times. It'll be published in a book - with an interview in which she elaborated on her talk, and with responses by scholars of religion - by the University of Virginia Press: "Goodness and the Literary Imagination," October.
Culture wars: A bookshop in Tulsa was targeted by a white nationalist group that put stickers with hate messages on the door, the owner said, the second such event in three months. The store has pride flags and sells inclusive literature. Also, a religious activist in Iowa was convicted of criminal mischief for burning four LGBTQ library books. (Publishers Lunch, NBC)
"Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators" is due in October. It's by Ronan Farrow, who won a Pulitzer for exposing, in The New Yorker, sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. (CNN)
You Saw It Coming Dept.: A biography of Melania Trump, by CNN's East Wing reporter, Kate Bennett. "The seemingly most reluctant First Lady is, in many ways, the most modern and groundbreaking First Lady ever," the publisher says. Due Dec. 3 from Macmillan.
Obituaries: Lee Bennett Hopkins, a poet, anthologist and ambassador of the power of poetry for kids, was 81. Here's part of one he wrote (via NYT):
It's poem o'clock.
Time for a rhyme -
... Come.
Unlock a minute
for
poetry time.

New and recent
Kwame Alexander, author and national advocate of kids' reading, has "How to Read a Book." It's for kids who already enjoy reading - and it gives joyful advice in poetic snippets about how to get the most pleasure possible from their books. (Start by planting yourself under a tree.) Alexander, of course, grew up in Chesapeake. (Harper, 32 pp.)

Texto completo: From " Why Elizabeth Warren Is Trump's Weakest Opponent " by Josh Kraushaar, National Journal, Aug. 18:
Often the vulnerability of a politician is reflected by the desperate caliber of their spin. When a campaign can't even put together a convincing case with cherry-picked evidence, it's easy to conclude that their argument doesn't pass the smell test.
Elizabeth Warren, trying to deflect widespread worries that she'd be the Democratic Party's riskiest best to take on President Trump, is the latest example of a candidate without a plan to address her biggest problem.
In a New York Times story on the subject, Warren's campaign offered two arguments as to why she'd be a formidable challenger against Trump. Her team has pointed to her hotly contested victory against Sen. Scott Brown in 2012, which quieted skeptics who were wary of her candidacy at the time. . . .
If a candidate's strongest case for electability is that she won a Senate seat in the most Democratic state in the country—in a banner year for the Democratic Party—then she's got an electability problem.
The fact that Warren is still hanging onto her victory over Brown is revealing. It would be the equivalent of Republicans reveling over defeating Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama in next year's election—a result that many GOP officials expect, given the conservative nature of the state.

I'd Rather Read With My Ears; The 'Iliad' was an audiobook before it was a printed one.

Texto completo: I don't read books, I devour them. A friend recently asked how I read so many books so quickly. When I told him I listen to each one as an audiobook, he guffawed: "That doesn't count!"
He isn't alone in that view, but that doesn't mean he's right. Humans, after all, weren't always so beholden to the written word. From ancient Greek philosophers and Elizabethan thespians to revivalist preachers and barnstorming politicians, the world has long been captivated by the spoken word. Before the Sermon on the Mount became a series of Bible chapters, it was . . . a sermon.
Yet despite the rich oral origins of literature, in some book clubs there's an almost palpable tension between those who read and those who prefer to listen. What's more, as I've read book reviews and commentary online, I've frequently found evidence of people thumbing their noses at audiobooks.
Like it or not, our media landscape is continually changing. While print and e-book sales have either declined or remained stagnant, audiobook sales have doubled every year for a decade.
Maybe it's worth understanding why people like me prefer audiobooks in the first place. One obvious reason is convenience. Jessica Hamzelou explains in the New Scientist that when our minds wander, they switch "into autopilot mode," which enables us to "carry on doing tasks quickly, accurately, and without conscious thought." The region of our brains that does this is called the default mode network, or DMN, and it becomes active only when performing rote tasks.
That's great news for multitaskers. Driving, mundane work assignments, chores, exercising and grocery shopping can all be repetitive activities. Such tasks are likely to activate your brain's DMN. If you're going to perform the same rote activities anyway, why not immerse yourself in a good book at the same time?
Especially because listening as opposed to reading actually improves comprehension. In a recent New York Times op-ed, Daniel Willingham, a psychologist at the University of Virginia, explained the literary technique known as prosody: "the pitch, tempo and stress of spoken words. 'What a great party' can be a sincere compliment or sarcastic put-down, but they look identical on the page." Thus the written word can be ambiguous: "Inferences can go wrong, and hearing the audio version—and therefore the correct prosody—can aid comprehension."
There's also a kind of innate enjoyment that comes with hearing a great story read by a great narrator. Homer didn't write the "Iliad" or the "Odyssey" to be read on a page, and Shakespeare's plays were meant to be heard and seen on a stage. As the theater and film bring words to life, so too narration enhances the overall experience.
Instead of looking down on the medium, bibliophiles should celebrate the way audiobooks make the written word more inviting and accessible. Without them I'd likely never know the wonderful contents of so many books at all.
Read, yes. But as the most famous of all books puts it: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

Texto completo: Meredith Vieira is the rare TV personality who can do whatever she wants. Her 40-year career has included network news ("60 Minutes" and "West 57th" on CBS, ABC's "Turning Point" and NBC's "Today"), daytime talk ("The View," "The Meredith Vieira Show") and a dozen years as a quizmaster ("Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"). Along the way, Vieira, 65, became an icon for working mothers, balancing career decisions with her commitment to family life.
Having a few laughs is also a priority, which is why she returns to TV on Sept. 16 as the host of "25 Words Or Less," a new daytime show based on the popular board game with teams of celebrity and civilian contestants competing for cash. The show from Lisa Kudrow's Is Or Isn't Entertainment will air on Fox-owned TV stations across the country including KTTV in Los Angeles.

Q: You've always been a game show fan.
A: I have. When I was offered "Millionaire" ... I had friends who said, "Why are you doing that?" And I said, "Because I like it. I'm not ashamed of it. I think it's cool. I'm giving people money, and it's not mine." What's better than that?

Q: There aren't a lot of serious TV journalists able to pull that off.
A: I thought what made me an effective host was the fact that I was a journalist - I knew how to draw contestants out. I knew how to relax them. I knew how to ask them questions. I knew how to listen. And all those things are important even in a show like that. People walk in so nervous to a game. There's a lot on the line for them. And you just have to remind them "It's a safe place, it's good - tell me about you." And then they relax and then they play the best game they can.

Q: Game shows can get very physical. People get excited and hug each other. Now, we're in the age where you have to ask permission. Do they need intimacy coordinators on a game show set?
A: I have no idea about that. I'm a hugger; that's just who I am. So it hasn't come up in front of me. I think you know where the line is. But if George Clooney won on our show, all bets would be off.

Q: Have you asked him to come on the show?
A: No. Now he'll never come on.

Q: You were the original moderator of ABC's "The View." Are you surprised about the place the show has taken in the country's political discourse?
A: Cut to The New York Times article, yeah.

Q: They called it the most important political TV show in America. Is that true?
A: I don't know. For somebody who's getting back into television I don't watch a lot of TV. I'll see the clips, like a lot of people do. I'm thrilled that "The View" continues to be relevant and reinvent itself. And quite frankly those political candidates would not come on that show unless they felt there was a real need to be on that show. So they've touched a chord with people in this country, for sure, and it's become sort of a must-do for those candidates.

Q: Why is there so much more yelling on the show than there was when you were there?
A: Well, I'm not a yeller. I think discourse in general on television has become that way - a lot of fire, a lot of heat. When I was hosting, it was all about no cross-talk. Let somebody have their say and then the next person.

Q: Do you think about getting back into TV news in any significant way?
A: No. I never say "never," but I'm not looking for it. Right now, I don't want to be part of that. I find the times right now very difficult and depressing.
Q: What do friends of yours in the business say about it?
A: They find it very frustrating, because this lack of trust in the media that's been brewing and fermented by certain folks. It has made it very hard to do your job, because your integrity is constantly being questioned. And there are so many journalists who are people of integrity. And to have them painted with this broad brush is extremely difficult for folks.

Q: You had a close workplace friendship with Matt Lauer. What was it like for you to see him taken down by the #MeToo movement and fired by NBC for inappropriate sexual behavior?
A: It was very difficult, because - and I think I speak for so many people - I never would've expected it. And it was heartbreaking.

Q: And you were surprised by it?
A: Yes, I was. This was a guy I thought I knew. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that goes on in television. There are people who have affairs. This was a different level; this wasn't that.

Q: Have you remained friends with him? Have you talked with him at all?
A: I haven't.

Q: Do you think he'll ever come back to TV?
A: I would bet not. I don't think television drove him; I really don't. I don't think he felt, "If I'm not on TV, then my life is useless." He had a restaurant that he invested in, and he had the horses. And I think he probably loved a lot of the stories that he told, but I never felt it just totally defined him.

Q: You also worked at "60 Minutes" during its years as a boys' club.
A: Yes, I did. Do I bring this stuff on?
Q: But your issues there were very public at the time. You were the youngest correspondent ever hired by the program in 1989, and you walked away two years later to have your second child when then-executive producer Don Hewitt would not let you work part time. It was a big statement. Do women remember this?
A: I just had a young woman say, "Thank you for the message you sent to working mothers." I would not have expected it - this was a young woman who knows the story. And I don't sit around talking about it, but, yeah, I hope that it somehow had gotten into the DNA.

Q: Can you imagine someone today saying the kind of things about you that Don Hewitt said back then?
A: I don't think you could get away with it today. And also that was Don Hewitt. I mean, he was the king. "60 Minutes" was the crown jewel in the network. And so he could probably do no wrong. He was a very, very powerful man. And I made my peace with Don.

Q: So Gayle King has a big job at "CBS This Morning." Jane Pauley is the host of "CBS Sunday Morning." You keep getting shows. It doesn't seem like women in their 60s were getting these kind of opportunities 10 years ago.
A: We didn't. And I still think there is a certain element of, you know, women of a certain age - I can't stand that expression - being shelved. I remember when I was 30-something, or 40-something, a friend of mine said - "Oh, there was a news director the other day saying, 'We want Meredith Vieira, only younger.' "
She thought it was funny. It's a very visual medium obviously. If you're experienced and you're good at what you do, why not? The men have been doing it forever.

Texto completo: Margie Reckard, de 63 años, que fue asesinada cuando un hombre armado abrió fuego en un Walmart de El Paso este mes, dejó pocos familiares y ninguno vive en El Paso. Su esposo, Antonio Basco, no tenía otra familia e invitó a la comunidad a acompañarlo durante el servicio fúnebre.
Cientos de personas hicieron fila afuera y se apiñaron en La Paz Faith Memorial and Spiritual Center en El Paso para asistir a los servicios funerarios de Reckard el viernes por la noche. En un momento durante el funeral del viernes, se dijo que 700 personas esperaban afuera a pesar del calor de casi 100 grados, según los organizadores del funeral.
El lugar para los servicios del viernes puede albergar hasta 400 personas.
"If you've ever started to lose your faith in humanity, this will bring it back," says @GaryTuchmanCNN, reporting from a service for an El Paso shooting victim after her widower, with no family left, invited anyone and everyone to attend. More than 850 have arrived, so far. pic.twitter.com/wzL836R0A5

“Haremos lo mejor que podamos para acomodar a la multitud que tenemos”, dijo a CNN Elizabeth Cordova de Perches Funeral Home.
In the end Antonio Basco was not alone to mourn his wife Margie Reckard, killed in #ElPasoShooting. So far more than 1000 people showed up. Strangers that became his family in #elpaso. ⁦@dallasnews⁩ pic.twitter.com/cuQNNfKQUN

Perches Funeral Home escribió por primera vez en una publicación de Facebook esta semana que Antonio Basco esperaba que tanta gente como fuera posible asistiera al funeral, señalando que la pareja no tenía familiares vivos.
“El Sr. Antonio Basco estuvo casado durante 22 años con su esposa Margie Reckard. No tenía otra familia. Le da la bienvenida a cualquiera que asista a los servicios de su esposa”, escribió la funeraria.
Los residentes de El Paso, Víctor y Mary Perales, le dijeron al New York Times que vinieron a apoyar a Basco en parte porque estaban relacionados con su dolor debido a la pérdida de su hijo mayor hace dos años.
“Sabemos lo difícil que fue para nosotros y estábamos rodeados de familia. No puedo imaginar cómo se sentiría pasar por esto solo “, dijo Victor Perales. “Dije que íbamos a este funeral para darle un abrazo y hacerle saber que podemos ser su familia”.
This is incredible… just some of the hundreds of flowers for El Paso’s Margie Reckard. Margie was her husbands only family and he feared no one would come to her funeral. Tonight, thousands are expected to attend. #ElPasoStrong @NBCNightlyNews @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/QPbklOVHvZ

Medical examiner: Epstein hanged himself

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Jeffrey Epstein's prison death has been confirmed a suicide by hanging, the medical examiner's office said Friday.

Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on Aug. 10, touching off outrage and disbelief over how such a high-profile prisoner, known for socializing with powerful people including presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, could have gone unwatched.

The Bureau of Prisons said Epstein had apparently killed himself, but that didn't squelch conspiracy theories about his death.

Messages seeking comment were left for Epstein's lawyers. An office telephone number for Dr. Michael Baden, the pathologist hired by Epstein's representatives to observe the autopsy, rang unanswered.

Epstein, who was charged with sexually abusing numerous underage girls over several years, had been placed on suicide watch last month after he was found on his cell floor on July 23 with bruising on his neck.

But multiple people familiar with operations at the jail say he was taken off the watch after about a week and put back in a high-security housing unit where he was less closely

monitored, but still supposed to be checked on every 30 minutes.

Attorney General William Barr says officials have uncovered "serious irregularities" at the jail. The FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are both investigating Epstein's death.

Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein's death are suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, according to several people familiar with the matter.

A guard in Epstein's unit was working a fifth straight day of overtime and another guard was working mandatory overtime, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the lacked authorization to publicly discuss the investigation.

U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who is in charge of the criminal case against Epstein, asked the jail's warden this week for answers about the earlier episode, writing in a letter Monday that it had "never been definitively explained."

The warden replied that an internal investigation was completed but that he couldn't provide information because the findings were being incorporated into investigations into Epstein's death.

The Associated Press often does not report details of suicide methods, but has made an exception because Epstein's cause of death is pertinent to the ongoing investigations.

The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the autopsy revealed that several bones in Epstein's neck had been broken, leading to speculation his death was a homicide.

Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson issued a statement Thursday in response to those articles, saying: "In all forensic investigations, all information must be synthesized to determine the cause and manner of death. Everything must be consistent; no single finding can be evaluated in a vacuum."

Epstein, 66, was a hedge fund manager who hobnobbed with the rich, famous and influential, including presidents and a prince.

He owned a private island in the Caribbean, homes in Paris and New York City, a New Mexico ranch, and a fleet of high-price cars. His friends had once included Britain's Prince Andrew, Clinton and Trump. Clinton and Trump both said they hadn't seen Epstein in years and knew nothing of his alleged misconduct when new charges were brought against him last month.

The medical examiner's ruling came a day after two more women sued Jeffrey Epstein's estate, saying he sexually abused them.

The suit, filed Thursday in a federal court in New York, claims the women were working as hostesses at a popular Manhattan restaurant in 2004 when they were recruited to give Epstein massages.

One was 18 at the time. The other was 20.

The lawsuit says an unidentified female recruiter offered the hostesses hundreds of dollars to provide massages to Epstein, saying he "liked young, pretty girls to massage him," and wouldn't engage in any unwanted touching. The women say Epstein groped them anyway.

One plaintiff now lives in Japan, the other in Baltimore. They seek $100 million in damages, citing depression, anxiety, anger and flashbacks.

Other lawsuits, filed over many years by other women, accused him of hiring girls as young as 14 or 15 to give him massages, then subjecting them to sex acts.

Latinos pen 'letter of solidarity' CELEBRITIES Tribune news services

Texto completo: Actresses America Ferrera and Eva Longoria are leading a group of more than 150 writers, artists and leaders who have written a public "letter of solidarity" to U.S. Latinos after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, and an immigration raid in Mississippi.
The letter, published Friday in The New York Times and in a handful of Spanish-language newspapers, says the signers stand with U.S. Latinos who may feel "terrified, heartbroken and defeated by the barrage of attacks."
"We have been smeared by political rhetoric and murdered in violent hate crimes. We have been separated from our families and have watched our children caged," the letter said. "But, we will not be broken. We will not be silenced."
Signing the letter were some of the most important Latino figures in entertainment, art, literature and activism, including novelist Sandra Cisneros, Academy Award-winning actress Rita Moreno, civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, singer-actress Jennifer Lopez and Tony Award-winning composer Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Longoria said she and Ferrera got the idea for the letter after they talked and found out they were both depressed and sad after the El Paso shooting.
"Once we started talking to other people, we found out others were feeling the same way," Longoria said.
Ferrera said Latinos have been subjected to a number of racist attacks recently, but the El Paso shooting and the Mississippi raid were "just soul-crushing" for some.
"We wanted to do something to let people know we aren't going to lie down and take it," she said. "We are going to stand up and fight."
Hard pass: CBS funnyman Stephen Colbert, who had candidate Donald Trump on his show in 2015, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that for the sake of the nation, he'd take a pass on the surefire ratings bonanza of having him back as a guest. "It would be hard for me to be properly respectful of the office because I think that he is disrespectful to the office," he said, adding that Trump lives in a "fantasy world" that he's trying to draw the public into, and that's not deserving of reverence.
Funny fashionista: Aidy Bryant has rolled out the start of a new plus-size fashion line named for her great aunt Pauline. In a video on the site, the "Saturday Night Live" star explains, "I've been a fat lady my whole damn life" and was always looking for clothes.
Paule Marshall, whose novels "Daughters" and "Brown Girl, Brownstones" drew upon classic and vernacular literature and her mother's kitchen conversations to narrate the divides between blacks and whites, men and women and modern and traditional cultures, has died at age 90. First published in the 1950s, Marshall was for years virtually the only major black woman fiction writer in the U.S., a bridge between Zora Neale Hurston and Toni Morrison, Alice Walker and others who emerged in the 1960s and '70s.

Trump’s policy on China: incoherent, value-free

Autor: Dionne, E J, Jr. 

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 16 Aug 2019.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/trump-s-policy-on-china-incoherent-value-free/docview/2273774764/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: [...]it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time.

Texto completo: A concern for human rights and democracy has often been seen as an add-on to our country’s foreign policy, an attractive veneer over the usual realpolitik. But President Donald Trump is demonstrating that a supposedly "America First" policy focused entirely on trade and divorced from a commitment to our values is incoherent.
Trump is embarrassing our country — and weakening it, too — by refusing to stand with the people of Hong Kong as they struggle against China’s dictatorship.
We have long wondered when the thoughtless chaos of Trump’s presidency would finally catch up with him and endanger our country. How long could an administration that replaces policy with impulse and thinking with tweeting stay out of crisis? The disarray around Trump’s China policy and the economic turmoil it has unleashed tell us that moment is now.
Somehow, Trump seemed to think that he could be tough on China and still express his admiration for President Xi Jinping’s brutally authoritarian rule.
"He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great," Trump told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in early 2018. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day."
So it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time."
"Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that," Trump added. "But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China." Translation: Do what you have to do, China.
Trump underscored his indifference to democracy Tuesday on Twitter. Responding to Chinese troops gathering at the Hong Kong border, he said only: "Everyone should be calm and safe!"
This reaction is scandalous from the leader of a nation whose Constitution begins with the words: "We the People."
When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
We count on presidents to consider "just in case" issues before they act. With Trump, it’s all a thoughtless, strategy-less blur. Say anything, see how it goes, then say something else.
He charmingly expressed concern about the effect of the tariffs on "the Christmas shopping season," thus effectively contradicting his own false claims that Chinese, not Americans, would pay the tariffs.
But Trump’s correction-on-the-fly may not be able to undo the damage he (and Xi) have done to the world economy. The stock market’s dive on Wednesday reflected recession fears gripping investors. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s about-face seemed motivated not by any grand strategy but by a purely selfish concern for his own re-election. "Nobody wants to run for president, on either party, in the middle of a recession," Tom Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO, told CNBC.
What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights. But rather than going about the patient work of building support for what should be a broad and united front against China’s abuses, Trump’s erratic approach is making it easier for China to cast the U.S. as the heavy. This does not put the interests of America first.
And Trump’s affection for dictatorships is squandering the high ground our country has historically been able to occupy, even in the face of our imperfections and inconsistencies. Championing democracy is not simply the right thing to do. It is a strategic asset. It is also in our national interest at a time when democracy is under challenge from both China and Russia and faces nationalist threats in countries whose free institutions once seemed secure.
Our president has already done grave damage to our nation’s domestic fabric by dividing us against each other, provoking both racism and nativism, and seeking to delegitimize all who stand against him. Now, his nihilism is wreaking havoc on our economy and around the world. This is the place where a slapdash, value-free approach to governing was bound to lead us.

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Donald Trump told a packed crowd here Thursday night that supporters and critics alike must vote for him in 2020 because otherwise they’d see their personal finances depleted.
"The bottom line is, I know you like me, this is a love fest, but you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k)’s down the tubes. Everything is going to be down the tubes," Trump said. "So whether you love me or hate me, you’ve got to vote for me."
This reelection pitch mirrors what many of his campaign advisers say: Trump can win suburban voters and others who are skeptical of his personal style as long as the economy stays strong.
Trump’s defense of his economic record comes amid signs in recent days of a possible downturn, which would complicate Trump’s message over the next 15 months.
An unusual development in the bond market called an "inverted yield curve" created concern that another economic recession may follow. The U.S. Treasury is paying investors more to take out short-term bonds, rather than longer-term ones, which suggests investors are losing faith in the long-term prospects for the economy.
Trump seemed particularly attuned to concerns about his handling of the economy, including his decision to impose tariffs on China. He falsely said that action has resulted in billions of dollars coming in from China and that American farmers are the "biggest beneficiaries."
"I never said China was going to be easy," he said, contradicting his 2018 assertion that "trade wars are good and easy to win."
The stemwinder included a jeremiad against windmills, praise for campaign manager Brad Parscale for being so tall and a long riff on Hillary Clinton’s email practices, resulting in a brief "lock her up" chant.
He told the crowd that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg loved him, discussed personnel issues in the Washington bureau of the New York Times and mocked a protester’s weight.
He also lavished praise on his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who is considering a run for Senate against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., but did not endorse or call Lewandowski on stage as some thought he might. "I think he’d be tough to beat. I’ll tell you he’d go to Washington and have you in mind," Trump said.
Trump did not mention Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to ban Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., from visiting the country — which dominated headlines throughout the day — though he spoke briefly about his administration’s support for Israel. He mentioned Omar by name twice but quickly moved on to other subjects without drawing any reaction beyond a few boos.
Trump’s biggest applause line of the night came when he echoed the National Rifle Association’s argument that "it’s not the gun that pulls the trigger, it’s the person holding the gun," less than two weeks after back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio.
Trump’s would-be Democratic challengers have been campaigning in the state for months.

Texto completo: The College of DuPage Fine Arts program, in collaboration with the Cleve Carney Museum of Art, welcomes six artists to campus for lectures and workshops as part of the 2019-2020 Visiting Artist Series.
All lectures are free and open to the public and take place in either the Playhouse Theatre or Belushi Performance Hall of the McAninch Arts Center, located on the Glen Ellyn campus, 425 Fawell Blvd.
In its fifth year, the Visiting Artist Series provides opportunities for the community to engage with leaders in the fields of contemporary art, design and culture.
This year’s series highlights artists who are committed to engaging with materiality through diverse mediums and practices.
The Visiting Artists Series begins at 1 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 18, with a lecture by messenger, artist and educator Nick Cave in Belushi Performance Hall.
Cave, described as a Renaissance artist, works between the visual and performing arts through a wide range of mediums, including sculpture, installation, video, sound and performance. His solo exhibitions have expanded globally from the United States through France, Africa, Denmark, Asia, South America and the Caribbean.
Cave is most famous for creating "Soundsuits," sculptural costumes enveloping the wearer’s body in everyday objects. "Soundsuits" camouflage the body, masking and creating a second skin that conceals race, gender and class, forcing the viewer to look without judgment.
Cave also works as a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Multidisciplinary artist Mie Kongo discusses how her work is driven by a sense of curiosity, discovery, realization and learning through everyday life at 11 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 22, in Belushi Performance Hall.
Kongo creates multidisciplinary work with diverse materials, including ceramic sculptures, installations and porcelain designed objects. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally, including recent exhibitions at the Arts and Literature Laboratory in Madison, Wis., 4th Ward Project Space in Chicago, Grunwald Gallery of Art at Indiana University Bloomington and the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago.
Her residencies include Shigaraki Ceramics Cultural Center in Japan, the European Ceramic Work Centre in the Netherlands and Intonation Deidesheim in Germany. She is an adjunct associate professor in the ceramics department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
Artist Aden Kumler shares her extensive knowledge of medieval art history at 11 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 20, in Belushi Performance Hall. Kumler is an associate professor in the departments of Art History and Romance Languages and Literatures at the University of Chicago and an affiliated faculty member of the University of Chicago’s Medieval Studies program, Center for the Study of Gender & Sexuality and Divinity School. She is the co-editor of the International Center of Medieval Art’s "Viewpoints" book series, a new forum for experimental books on medieval art history, co-published by the International Center of Medieval Art and Penn State University Press.
Installation artist Paola Cabal discusses the intersection between physics and perception at 11 a.m. Thursday, Feb. 20, in the Playhouse Theatre. Cabal is best known for her rigorous observational studies of daylight over time—movements the artist photographs on-site, then paints directly into spaces trompe l’oeil-style using spray paint. As an artist and educator, Cabal co-teaches a course called "Articulating Time and Space" alongside astrophysicist Kathryn Schaffer at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Cabal has received a fellowship from the Illinois Arts Council, an Individual Artist award from the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation, a joint commission for the Chicago Transit Authority and the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, and a residency at the Chicago Cultural Center.
Visual artist Mary Mattingly discusses her work that explores issues of sustainability, climate change and displacement at 1 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, in Belushi Performance Hall. Based in New York, Mattingly creates photographs, sculptures and large-scale public art projects addressing climate change by drawing connections between the social and economic forces that make up the current political ecology impacting our environment. In 2016, she launched a floating food forest on a barge called "Swale," a social sculpture where people are invited to pick food from an edible landscape in order to circumvent public land laws in New York City that disallow public foraging. Mattingly recently transplanted a group of edible palm trees to upstate New York to show that the introduced vegetation accounts for predictions in climatological shifts. Mattingly’s artwork has been featured in The New York Times, Le Monde, New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal as well as on CBS, BBC, NBC and PBS’s Art21.
Chicago-based architect, Vladimir Radutny closes out the series with a discussion about his architecture studio’s belief that architecture is an art form at 11 a.m. Wednesday, April 8, in the Playhouse Theatre. In 2008, Radutny founded his Chicago-based architecture and design studio. Radutny’s multi-disciplinary architecture practice focuses on innovative design solutions that challenge the conventional interpretations of space, function and material use. His studio’s approach is ideas-driven, relying on imagination and experience to identify the creative nuances within each project. He believes in architecture as an art form with capacity to not just alter space, but to change perceptions, feelings and habits, transcending the workplace, home or in-between. His practice has been recognized with numerous AIA design awards and, in 2017, Radutny was awarded the Dubin Family Young Architect Award. In addition, he teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology College of Architecture.

Texto completo: MSNBC evening host Rachel Maddow is coming to the Fox Theatre in Atlanta Oct. 13 to talk about her upcoming book about the oil and gas industry called "Blowout."
The show is on a Sunday and starts at an unusually early time: 5:30 p.m. Tickets range from$41-$81 before fees and includes a copy of the book.
It's part of an eight-city tour in mostly liberal enclaves such as Seattle, New York and San Francisco. But she includes Tulsa, Oklahome, given how important the oil and gas business is there.
Her book comes out Oct. 1 with a subtitle "Corrupted Democracy, Rogue State Russia and the Richest, Most Destructive Industry on Earth." The thesis, in other words, is unflattering: "The oil and gas industry has weakened democracies in developed and developing countries, fouled oceans and rivers, and propped up authoritarian thieves and killers."
Maddow, who has been hosting her own show on MSNBC since 2008 and rivals Fox News' evening shows in the ratings, came to Atlanta in 2013 to discuss her first book, the No. 1 New York Times bestseller "Drift."That book was about how American presidential administrations changed the rules of war in a way that made it easier to stay in perpetual "war."

Privatize the Postal Service... [Derived Headline]

Texto completo: Privatize the Postal Service
The U.S. Constitution authorizes the federal government to operate a postal service, but does not require it. Let's take advantage and get government out of the postal business.
The 630,000 U.S. postal employees are the world's highest-paid semi-skilled workers. Privatization would save a bundle.
The price of a 1-ounce, first-class letter is 55 cents whether it's sent across the street or 7,894 miles from Concord to Guam. This is nuts! Prices should be set according to costs.
With privatization, I'm guessing that a letter from New York City to Washington, D.C., would cost a dime. From a little town in New Hampshire to a little town in Montana, more like two dollars.
The four senators from New Hampshire and Montana would say, “That discriminates against the residents of our towns!”
Nonsense! Prices everywhere should be set according to costs.
You, Senators, are the discriminators. You force postal costs unnaturally high, probably to receive campaign money from the postal-service union. If your time in office were limited to a single six-year term, you wouldn't need to grovel for campaign contributions while in office. The job would be more fun. We want you to be happy in your work. But after six years, go home.
Technology is rendering postal services obsolescent. Never mind 55-cent stamps; we can send emails for free. Postal deficits are growing. Covering them with taxes or piling them onto the federal deficit is outrageous.
The U.S. postal service should be privatized.

Sununu's extreme  right-wing agenda
Gov. Chris Sununu likes to label Democrats in the Legislature “extreme.” His vetoes in recent weeks suggest he's the one out of touch with New Hampshire residents. Here are 10 of Sununu's 50-plus vetoes:
House Bills 1 and 2, the state budget, that offers nearly $200 million in additional education funding and property tax relief; HB 706, establishing a nonpartisan districting commission to eliminate partisan gerrymandering; SB 10, raising the minimum wage to $10 in 2020 and $12 in 2022 (current minimum wage is $7.25); HB 109, establishing comprehensive background checks for firearms purchases; SB 2, expanding job training programs; HB 564, banning firearms from schools except for police and other authorized people; SB 1, establishing paid family/medical leave in New Hampshire; HB 365, expanding solar energy net metering in New Hampshire; HB 364, allowing medical cannabis patients to grow cannabis at home; SB 5, raising Medicaid rates for mental health, substance abuse treatment services.
There are 40 other bills, most of which passed with bipartisan support, dealing with voting rights, campaign finance reform and many other issues that the governor has blocked.
Legislators will vote next month to try to overcome these vetoes. In the meantime, it's up to residents across New Hampshire to let their representatives in both parties know how important these measures truly are.

Bernie the agenda setter
Bernie Sanders has set the agenda on issues that the public cares most about: climate change, health care and political corruption.
His ability to speak about these issues is reflected in his donor base that is spread all over the country. A recent New York Times map depicting comparative donor support showed Bernie with more than 760,000 individual donors nationwide – almost double his nearest competitor.
In the most recent Democratic debate, Bernie clearly showed that he wants to be president. He has also stated that as president he is determined to travel the country to advocate for his policies. In fact, that is the only way that the multi-billion-dollar lobbying stranglehold on our democracy can be overcome so the public's voice can be heard and their concerns addressed legislatively.
Bernie has clearly communicated his vision for our great nation. As president, he will set clear goals and listen to the American people. He is an experienced legislator who understands the federal government and what is needed to accomplish his goals.
Finally, poll after poll shows Bernie beating Donald Trump in a head-to-head competition in the critical battleground states that he also won in the 2016 Democratic primaries.
We live in unprecedented times with unprecedented challenges. The clock is ticking on the climate, and we have a president who has said climate change is a hoax. We need bold leadership to change the dangerous course our nation is on. Bernie is that candidate, and this is his time.

Come together, Dems
Would the 25 or so Democratic candidates for the office of president of the United States like to show their true skills at leadership, compromise and legislation by getting together and formulating one plan for our medical system? After they come up with that one plan, can they come up with a single plan to eliminate gun violence from this culture? Can we all agree that such an effort would highlight the skills and abilities of these “leaders” to legislate?

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When Dr. Lisa Sanders saw an early version of the forthcoming Netflix documentary series about her efforts to help diagnose the mysterious ailments of eight patients, she delivered what she now readily admits was "badly designed feedback."
"Stop! Stop! This is awful!" Dr. Sanders recalls saying. "Oh, my God, this is terrible! You can't do it like that! You can't say things like that!"
Granted, the producers were trying to create an innovative show, for the first time asking the global audience of the popular column Dr. Sanders has written for The New York Times Magazine since 2002 to help diagnose seemingly impossible medical cases.
But Dr. Sanders, an internist, felt that subtle and important things were off in the way that early cut portrayed the stakes of a diagnosis, the overwhelming doubt patients can feel, doctors' talks with patients and, in short, her life's work.
The final cut of the show "Diagnosis," which Netflix will release on Aug. 16, fixed all that, capturing her beliefs about diagnosis and the lessons she's learned over her career -- like when, years ago, she used a then-common phrase of hers with a patient.
"You know, diagnosis is just a word," Dr. Sanders said.
"No!" the patient sharply corrected. "It's everything."
In the show, a diagnosis means parents don't have to let doctors cleave their music-loving daughter's brain, possibly making her mute. It means a nearly bankrupt young woman can stop paying for stumped doctors and know she can have a child without fear of passing on crippling muscle pain.
In one of her earliest pieces for The Times, Dr. Sanders wrote about her own grief-filled efforts to diagnose her alcoholic sister's cause of death, to get an answer.
"It's not 'just a word.' It's actually a word that carries a lot of meaning -- social meaning and medical meaning," she now says.
Dr. Sanders, who'd grown up in South Carolina loving Arthur Conan Doyle's works and the satisfying "clunk" of the once disconnected pieces of a mystery story coming together, started her professional life as a journalist. She won an Emmy Award for her 1989 CBS News coverage of Hurricane Hugo's impact on Charleston.
But she decided to switch careers after an assignment about white-water rafting in North Carolina, during which a fellow reporter, who was also a doctor, leapt into a fast-moving river to pull out a woman who had been floating face down.
"I watched him change from a journalist who watches things to a doctor who does things," Dr. Sanders told The Times in a 1992 article about people's unusual paths to medical school. "It made me realize I'm not a person who wants to just sit around and watch."
She still vividly remembers the reporter doing chest compressions on the woman, who then turned her head and coughed up "a ton of water" and vomited.
At Yale University, where Dr. Sanders got her medical degree and did her residency, she was quickly captivated by the Sherlock Holmesian nature of diagnostic work.
Shortly afterward, a longtime friend who had just started as an editor at The Times Magazine called her and asked, "What can doctors write?" Dr. Sanders thought about the reports she did for all new patients.
"I write little mysteries every single day," she said.
For the column that sprang from that conversation, Dr. Sanders pulled from unusual and already solved cases that had brought up unexpected questions for the doctors who told her about them around the proverbial water cooler. She also began to look out for unique cases among her own patients at Yale New Haven Hospital.
"This column helps me remember that most people have what other people have had, but not everybody," she says. "It opens me up to the possibility of 'weird."'
In 2010, she introduced the idea of crowdsourcing in her column by sharing the case of a feverish academic who had let the readers of a popular medical website help diagnose his illness.
Then, the following year, she let her own readers get in on the detective work with a Well column, Think Like a Doctor, that invited them to speculate about symptoms of an ailment she would reveal the following day.
"Because I saw how good they were with these solved cases, I knew for sure that they would be good with unsolved cases," Dr. Sanders recalls.
She didn't build on that idea until the Academy Award-winning producer Scott Rudin approached The Times about making a documentary series with the production company Lightbox.
Last April, the magazine published the first in a series of unsolved cases that Dr. Sanders and producers had spent months collecting. For the first time, they invited readers to share their best guesses about what the patients were suffering from.
Thousands of readers from around the globe responded. Many were members of the medical community.
But others were just people who recognized their own suffering in someone else a world away and wanted to help, like a California mother who saw one young "Diagnosis" patient's behavior as a symptom of the same untreatable genetic condition her son has.
"I feel like it's a diagnosis," she said through tears. "But it's a diagnosis to nowhere. I think that our kids are going to help future kids, and future parents, not go through what we went through."
This is what Dr. Sanders hoped to capture. Where many medical dramas use odd cases to show a doctor's deductive brilliance in the third act, she wanted to show something else.
"It's so much more than that," she counters. "The patients are not the backdrop. They are the show."

Texto completo: What's on TV
BLAZE (2018) 8 p.m. on Showtime. Ethan Hawke directed and co-wrote this biopic about the Texas singer-songwriter known as Blaze Foley. Before his death in 1989, Foley (whose real name was Michael Fuller) made a name for himself singing country songs and picking an acoustic guitar. He's played here by the actor and musician Ben Dickey, who stars opposite Alia Shawkat. Shawkat plays Sybil Rosen, an actress and theater artist with whom Foley runs off to the woods, in search of romance and creative freedom outside the constraints of the music business. The guitarist Charlie Sexton also features in the cast, portraying the singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt, who was a friend of Foley's. Hawke "is clearly motivated by nothing but affection for Blaze, Townes, Sybil and the state of Texas," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "He doesn't so much scramble biopic conventions as allow himself and the audience to be distracted from them."
GETAWAY (2013) 6 p.m. on HBO. For a look at Ethan Hawke involved in a movie that's very different from -- and much louder than -- "Blaze," see this straightforward action movie. Hawke plays a former professional racecar driver who speeds through the streets of Sofia, Bulgaria, in a souped-up Ford Shelby GT500 after his wife (Rebecca Budig) is kidnapped.
What's Streaming
JIM GAFFIGAN: QUALITY TIME Stream on Amazon. In the space of about a minute early on in this special, the comedian Jim Gaffigan compares his own appearance -- blond, stocky -- to both the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman and a "giant land salmon." The new 75-minute set, which represents Amazon's first original stand-up special as it moves to compete with Netflix, also sees Gaffigan discussing issues like dogs, travel and family. "He delivers his punch lines at the end of patiently established premises, and then doubles down on them using a second voice, higher-pitched and quicker in cadence," Jason Zinoman observed in a recent article in The Times. "This device has become fairly common in stand-up, turning a solo art into a double act," Zinoman added. "But no one does it better than Gaffigan."
DIAGNOSIS Stream on Netflix. This new series, produced in association with The Times, translates Dr. Lisa Sanders's "Diagnosis" column from The New York Times Magazine into the format of a documentary series. The show follows a collection of medical patients with mysterious illnesses as they search for a diagnosis -- and, ultimately, a cure.
DOGMAN (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The Italian actor Marcello Fonte won the Award for Best Actor at Cannes in 2018 for his role as a dog groomer who sells cocaine in this crime drama, which is the most recent feature from the director Matteo Garrone ("Gomorrah"). Set in a coastal Italian town, the plot follows the dog groomer (whose name, like the actor who plays him, is Marcello) as he's forced into a partnership of shorts with the local bully, a cocaine-snorting former boxer named Simone (Edoardo Pesce).

Texto completo: What's the worst part of starting a new job?
Your new, puny salary? Your new, miserable boss?
Not even close!
What's worse are your new co-workers lining up to ask you personal questions -- questions you would rather not answer, like "What is your name?" or "Are you pregnant or just fat?" or "Didn't I see you on 'Dr. Pimple Popper'?"
If you're asking who you can ask about the questions you'll get asked, the answer is Allie Volpe, whose recent article in The New York Times is titled "How to Answer Tricky Personal Questions at a New Job."
"Starting a new job can make us feel like the new kid on the first day of school," Volpe writes, "nervous, yet eager to fit in and make a good first impression."
This is especially true in your case as it is with everyone who, despite all the candles on their birthday cake, has as mental age of 12.
Of course, no one says you have to answer questions. You could be like Pee-wee Herman, cloaking yourself in a mantle of mystery by answering every question with "I know you are, but what am I?" While this is a good short-term solution, it may not be the right approach in the long term.
According to workplace psychologist Michael Woodward, aka Dr. Woody, "Social support has been widely demonstrated as one of the greatest drivers of happiness and success."
In other words, you need to connect on a personal level, and that could require revealing your deepest, darkest secrets.
Or does it? The trick is to satisfy the curiosity of the losers with whom you will be working, while keeping your most important secrets to yourself. (Of course, you have no important secrets, but if you can think of yourself as an undercover agent operating in a shadow world of workplace intrigue and danger, you'll be a lot happier.)
So, let's turn our attention to the tricky questions you are likely to be asked and the even trickier answers you will now be able to provide.
"How do you feel about so-and-so?" is a standard question from "colleagues who are known for being negative and wasting productive time."
Since these are exactly the kind of people with whom you will feel the most at home, follow your instinct and immediately respond with your list of the 25 most hateful employees. (Any more than 25 may make you seem unfriendly, so keep the names of the other 50 to yourself.)
No matter how many you name, career and executive coach Maggie Mistal reminds you to be professional and honest. "If you sugarcoat too much or evade," she warns, "people are going to read that, too."
I agree. That's why I recommend you give a kind but truthful reply to any questions about good, old so-and-so.
"I don't know them," you say, "but I hate them."
Be careful how you answer the question: "Do you want to join us for happy hour?"
Answer no and your co-workers will think you're a snob. Answer yes and by the time the cherry drops in your fourth Manhattan, you will have stripped off your clothes and started to dance on the bar.
Either way, you won't be invited again, which is, of course, the general idea.
If you don't drink alcohol, the experts suggest you "let your new co-workers know that you'd rather get to know them over coffee." If you don't drink coffee, explain you'd rather get to know them over kombucha.
If you don't drink alcohol or coffee or kombucha, just answer the question honestly. Say, "I certainly could go, but I really don't want to get to know you."
It's not friendly, but it is the truth.
"Are you seeing anyone?" is a seemly innocent question, but it could lead to a torturous inquisition. Possible follow-ups include but are hardly limited to, "'Are you planning on getting married? Having children?' Is your partner as big a flake as everyone says? Can I give your digits to my weird cousin, who is probably as desperate as you, so it might work out?"
Or you could button it. "You don't need to defend your choices," says Sherry Sims, founder of the Black Career Women's Network. Simply say that "you prefer not to talk about personal issues in the workplace."
People will still wonder why you wear a swim mask and flippers to work, but you won't have to talk about it.

'Shooting,' 'Bomb,' 'Trump': Advertisers Blacklist News Stories Online; Companies are increasingly insisting their ads do not appear near articles or videos that contain any of a long list of words

Like many advertisers, Fidelity Investments wants to avoid advertising online near controversial content. The Boston-based financial-services company has a lengthy blacklist of words it considers off-limits.
If one of those words is in an article's headline, Fidelity won't place an ad there. Its list earlier this year, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, contained more than 400 words, including "bomb," "immigration" and "racism." Also off-limits: "Trump."
Some news organizations have had difficulty placing Fidelity's ads on their sites, ad-sales executives said, because the list is so exhaustive and the terms appear in many news articles.
Big advertisers have been burned several times in recent years when their digital ads appeared next to offensive content , including fabricated news articles, hateful or racist videos on YouTube and pornographic material.
Such miscues happen, in part, because of the complexities of online ad-buying , where brands generally target certain kinds of audiences rather than specific sites or types of content. It has become clear to advertisers that one way to protect themselves is to stipulate the websites or types of web content they want to avoid, and ensure their partners—digital ad brokers and publishers—honor those wishes.
"Political stories are, regardless of party affiliation, not relevant to our brand," a Fidelity spokesman said in a written statement. The company also avoids several other topics that it says don't align with published content about business and finance.
Marketers have used blacklists for years to sidestep controversy. Airlines avoided articles dealing with airline crashes, for instance. Now those blacklists are becoming more sophisticated, specific and extensive, ad executives said.
Online news publishers are feeling the impact, from smaller outlets to large players such as CNN.com, USA Today-owner Gannett Co., the Washington Post and the Journal, according to news and ad executives.
The ad-blacklisting threatens to hit publications' revenue and is creating incentives to produce more lifestyle-oriented coverage that is less controversial than hard news. Some news organizations are investing in technologies meant to gauge the way news stories make readers feel in the hopes of persuading advertisers that there are options for ad placement other than blacklisting.
Consumer-products company Colgate-Palmolive Co., sandwich chain Subway and fast-food giant McDonald's Corp. are among the many companies blocking digital ad placements in hard news to various degrees, according to people familiar with those companies' strategies.
Some companies are creating keyword blacklists so detailed as to make almost all political or hard-news stories off-limits for their ads. "It is de facto news blocking," said Megan Pagliuca, chief data officer at Hearts & Science, an ad-buying firm owned by Omnicom Group Inc.
The use of lengthy keyword lists "is going to force publishers to do lifestyle content and focus on that at the expense of investigative journalism or serious journalism," said Nick Hewat, commercial director for the Guardian, a U.K. publisher. "That is a long-term consequence of this sort of buying behavior." The Guardian has had some advertisers block words such as "Brexit," he said.
During the second quarter of this year, 177 advertisers that worked with ad measurement firm DoubleVerify Inc. blocked their ads from appearing on news or political content online, up 33% from the year-earlier period and more than double the 2017 total, the company said.
Integral Ad Science Inc., a firm that ensures ads run in content deemed safe for advertisers, said that of the 2,637 advertisers running campaigns with it in June, 1,085 brands blocked the word "shooting," 314 blocked "ISIS" and 207 blocked "Russia." Almost 560 advertisers blocked "Trump," while 83 blocked "Obama."
The average number of keywords the company's advertisers were blocking in the first quarter was 261. One advertiser blocked 1,553 words, it said.
The polarized political environment in the U.S. has put brands on heightened alert. Marketers are mindful of the backlash they can face on social media when customers feel they advertised in offensive content. One Twitter account, Sleeping Giants, called out hundreds of brands that appeared on the right-wing news site Breitbart News Network following the 2016 presidential election, prompting widespread blacklisting of the site.
Share Your Thoughts
How much does adjacent news coverage affect your impression of a brand?
Colgate-Palmolive is blocking online ad placements in news stories, according to people with knowledge of its ad strategy. "In general, our media buying goals are to advertise where people are most likely to be receptive to what we have to say," a Colgate spokeswoman said in an email. The company said it looks for "opportunities more likely to fit with the brand's positive, optimistic message."
Subway said it has blacklisted 70,000 websites, including most hard-news outlets. The company wants to align with "positivity and the moments when our guests will be most likely to consider getting Subway," said Melissa Sutton, Subway's director of media services.
Used-car retailer CarMax Inc. blocks online ads it purchases through automated systems from appearing next to news content in categories such as "disasters," "extreme violence" and "inflammatory politics" to ensure the integrity of its brand, the company said.
McDonald's currently is blocking hard news from its automated ad purchases in the U.S., according to a person familiar with its ad buying. "The first time your brand is damaged, it's not easily fixed," said Bob Rupczynski, senior vice president of marketing technology at McDonald's, during a recent ad conference in Cannes, France.
Hotel company Marriott International Inc. avoids buying digital ads near opinion or commentary news, according to a person familiar with its approach.
Alphabet Inc.'s Google has a long keyword blacklist that contains more than 500 words and phrases, including "privacy," "federal investigation," "antitrust," "racism," "FBI," "taxes," "anti-Semitic," "gun control" and "drought," according to a copy reviewed by the Journal. The list has made it difficult for at least one news publisher to place Google ads on its site, a person familiar with the matter said.
Blacklisting is cutting into the revenue of some online news publishers, even though they sometimes can replace blocked ads with content from other advertisers.
The audiences of many online publishers grew after President Trump launched his campaign—the "Trump bump." At the same time, "they are losing revenue because some clients are using extensive keyword exclusion lists," said John Montgomery, executive vice president of global brand safety at GroupM, one of the world's largest ad-buying firms.
It is a worrisome trend for the news business, a sector already taking a hit as advertising spending shifts to online ad giants Facebook Inc. and Google. Spending on newspaper print ads in the U.S. has plummeted 32% over the past five years, according to estimates from Zenith, an ad-buying company owned by Publicis Groupe SA.
CNN.com, which is owned by AT&T Inc., said it deals with some advertisers whose blacklists exceed 1,000 words. Among the words advertisers most often wanted to avoid on CNN.com during the first half of the year were "shooting," "Mueller," "Michael Cohen" and "crash." The most-blocked term during the time period was "Trump," which was blocked 636,636 times, CNN said.
Some digital publishers said the push for brand safety amounts to indirect censorship. Vice Media told advertisers at a presentation in May that it will no longer allow brands to block 25 words, including "bisexual," "gay," "HIV," "lesbian," "Latino," "Middle Eastern," "Jewish" and "Islamic."
"Bias should not be the collateral damage of our much-needed brand-safety efforts," said Cavel Khan, senior vice president of client partnerships for North America at the Brooklyn-based media company.
Marketers became more aggressive about protecting their brands online after a 2017 article by the Times of London that carried the headline: " Big brands fund terror through online adverts ." The article reported that ads from well-known brands were appearing on YouTube channels promoting hate speech or terrorism.
In the ensuing months, similar ad-placement problems plagued YouTube and other advertising platforms such as Facebook. Advertisers began taking a more cautious approach to digital advertising , enlisting the help of firms specializing in "brand safety," ad buyers said.
"What turned out to be a reaction to protect a brand from unsafe things that are mostly user generated content," on sites such as YouTube, ended up hurting media companies focused on producing real journalism, said Christine Cook, senior vice president and chief revenue officer of CNN's digital operations.
In automated ad buying, brands aim their ads not at specific websites, but at audiences with certain characteristics—people with certain shopping or web browsing histories, for example. Their ads are matched in real time to available inventory in online ad marketplaces that can come from thousands of websites. That is why brands sometimes are surprised to find their ads on websites they find controversial.
Ad-tech firms specializing in brand safety offer advertisers multiple ways to control their ad placements. Advertisers can block entire categories, such as "politics" or "violence," using classifications brand-safety firms have set up after crawling the web. They can avoid certain keywords that appear in an article or headline. And they can establish a blacklist of sites to avoid or a white-list of sites they deem safe.
Brand safety has become a big business on Madison Avenue. Some agencies have hired teams of people to monitor digital ad placements, and some marketers have hired brand-safety officers.
Ad-technology firm OpenSlate said so many companies have asked for help avoiding news and political content on YouTube that it developed an algorithm last year to identify channels focusing those areas. Mike Henry, OpenSlate's chief executive officer, said about one-third of its top 100 clients are currently avoiding news and politics on YouTube.
Some ad-sales executives said the technology used for brand safety is too blunt because it doesn't take into account the full context of how specific words are used in a news story or video. CNN.com and Gannett are creating technology intended to give advertisers a better way to gauge if a news story is controversial.
CNN.com said it is testing a new product dubbed SAM, for Sentiment Analysis Moderator, that uses machine learning to score its site's content for whether it will make readers feel "mostly negative," "somewhat negative," "neutral," "somewhat positive" or "mostly positive."
CNN tested the system by having it score 70,000 pieces of content, then having human editors review the content to see whether the technology worked. The company is testing the system with some advertisers who want to buy ads based on sentiment.
The New York Times and USA Today also have been using sentiment analysis to help brands advertise in news articles that may have a positive or optimistic sentiment.
Allison Murphy, senior vice president for ad innovation at New York Times Co., said the company now offers several different ad-targeting options. "We can satisfy a brand that is fine with politics but doesn't want to be around President Trump," she said.
In May, representatives of several companies, including CNN.com, USA Today and the Journal met to discuss how they could work with ad agencies and measurement companies to devise a way to move the sector beyond keyword blacklists, according to people familiar with the meetings.
The "overreliance on long keyword blacklists has a real cost" to both publishers and brands, said Josh Stinchcomb, global chief revenue officer of the Journal and Barron's, both owned by News Corp. "To that end, we are building proprietary tools that ensure brand safety."
The Washington Post also is using new technologies that help advertisers gauge the context of stories.
Ms. Cook at CNN.com said news organizations must change advertisers' perception of news. "One of the things I have been evangelizing is all the dimensions of other content types" the company creates, she said.
Some news publishers, including CNN.com and USA Today, are producing and promoting more ad-friendly lifestyle, technology, business and sports content.
"If a client says to us, 'We are just really not comfortable with news,' unlike some of our competitors, we don't have to say, 'Let me talk to you about why you should run in news,' " said Michael Kuntz, chief operating officer of national sales at USA Today Network, which includes USA Today and more than 100 local news outlets.
Still, he said, "the future of the digital news space is heavily reliant on us continuing to change the perception around why news does not need to be a polarizing category."

Texto completo: Tim Alberta's new book opens with President Donald Trump taking credit for saving the Republican Party.
"I brought the party back. The Republican Party is strong. The Republican Party is strong," he said, according to the book.
"They've got to remain faithful, he added. "And loyal."
Which Alberta, Politico's chief political correspondent and a Brighton native, read as a "very ominous threat."
"That's kind of what the book is about," he said.
Alberta will be in the city this week to talk about his book "American Carnage: On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War and the Rise of President Trump," which chronicles the advent of the modern Republican Party and how it came to accept Trump and the elements that brought Trump to the White House.
Published by Harper-Collins, it debuted last month at No. 2 on the New York Times best selling list in the combined print and e-book nonfiction category.
It features exclusive interviews with Trump, former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and many other prominent figures in U.S. politics.
Alberta, who grew up in Brighton, tries to bring a diversity of perspectives to questions he asks of people in power.
"If you don't understand other peoples' experiences, you're not going to get very far in terms of having a constructive dialogue in politics or culture," Alberta said.
Alberta wrote for the Wall Street Journal and the conservative National Review before moving to Politico in 2017. He worked on the book for approximately a year.
It isn't just about the history of the Republican Party, he said.
"The book is meant to hold up a mirror, not just to Donald Trump, but to all of us and examining the role we've all played in bringing the country to this point," Alberta said.
A review by the New York Times called the book "a fascinating look at a Republican Party that initially scoffed at the incursion of a philandering reality-TV star with zero political experience and now readily accommodates him.
The book was called "indispensable" by Washington Post reporter and nonfiction author Carlos Lozada.
"'American Carnage' is not a conventional Trump-era book," Lozada said. "It is less about the daily mayhem in the White House than about the unprecedented capitulation of a political party. This book will endure for helping us understand not what is happening but why it happened."
Alberta will hold a book signing at 2 p.m. Saturday at Barnes and Noble at 9605 Village Place Boulevard in Brighton.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
WHY WOMEN KILL Stream on CBS All Access. Three women are driven away from matrimonial delight and toward murder in this new series, a brainchild of the "Desperate Housewives" creator Marc Cherry. The show casts Lucy Liu, Ginnifer Goodwin and Kirby Howell-Baptiste as women who each live in a different decade -- the '60s, the '80s and present day -- and with three different unfaithful husbands (played by Jack Davenport, Sam Jaeger and Reid Scott) who are various shades of slob.
BOYHOOD (2014) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The director Richard Linklater is back in theaters this weekend with "Where'd You Go, Bernadette," a blend of drama, comedy and mystery starring Cate Blanchett. His 2014 feature, "Boyhood," also resists easy characterization. The "coming-of-age drama" label could be used, but it wouldn't quite communicate the scope of the movie. Shot over 12 years, the story centers on Mason (Ellar Coltrane), a Texas boy who is 6 when the movie starts and 18 by the time it finishes. Mason deals with the various struggles of youth while his mother, Olivia (Patricia Arquette), pushes against more adult problems (work and men). Sometimes, his muscle-car-driving absentee father, Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke), scoops up Mason and his sister (Lorelei Linklater) for a day out. Mostly, the movie just rumbles along at a speed that approximates the pace of life. "Radical in its conceit, familiar in its everyday details, 'Boyhood' exists at the juncture of classical cinema and the modern art film without being slavishly indebted to either tradition," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "It's a model of cinematic realism, and its pleasures are obvious yet mysterious."
What's on TV
JUSTICE LEAGUE (2017) 5:55 p.m. on HBO2. Ben Affleck's Batman, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill's Superman and more muscular DC Comics heroes punch and pow in this extravagant super-adventure. The script involves Atlantis and resurrection. The resulting movie "shows a series that's still finding its footing as well as characters who, though perhaps not yet as ostensibly multidimensional as Marvel's, may be more enduring (and golden)," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "It has justice, and it has banter. And while it could have used more hanging out, more breeziness, it is a start."
DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012) 8 p.m. on Paramount Network. Batman may have battled Superman in "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" (to highly questionable effectiveness), but it'll be Batman vs. Batman Thursday night as Ben Affleck's Batman in "Justice League" precedes Christian Bale's portrayal of the same hero in "Dark Knight Rises." The third and final entry in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy pits the wealthy caped crusader against the anarchist villain Bane (Tom Hardy). They're joined by Anne Hathaway (as Selina Kyle, or Catwoman) and the swells of a Hans Zimmer score.

A Table for One, and Hold the Selfies

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Tejal Rao, the California restaurant critic based in Los Angeles, discussed the tech she's using.
What are your most important tech tools for doing your work as our first California restaurant critic?
My phone is such a big part of my daily reporting. I use it to make reservations, to take a quick note during dinner, to document menus and dishes and to record a snippet of audio here and there.
I also need to totally disconnect from my phone when I'm writing or I don't get anything done. I use an app called Forest to help me manage the precious hours I spend sitting at my desk and typing. Forest plants a little tree on a timer, and then for the amount of time you've picked, it reminds you not to check Twitter or whatever tends to distract you. It doesn't lock you out; it just reminds you very gently to go away, put your phone down and let the tree grow. It shouldn't work so well, but I love my dumb digital trees. Forest, combined with the white noise of Rainy Mood on my headphones, is the only way I get any writing done.
What are some of your favorite tech uses by restaurants? And what are your least favorite?
I think tech works best in restaurants when, as a diner, you're mostly unaware of its presence and it's not an obstacle in between you and the servers or the kitchen.
Obvious tech uses, like an iPad menu, generally end up feeling cold, and a little goofy, as if the restaurant is really stretching itself to feel modern. Apps that track data from diners can be really amazing for personalizing an experience, but work only if the staff knows how to use the data and kind of interpret it in a meaningful and professional way.
When restaurants get it wrong, being overly personal, it can be creepy.
Two words: Yelp reviews. How do you feel about them?
I know restaurant critics are supposed to trivialize Yelp, but I do refer to Yelp as a resource sometimes. It's a great way to see older editions of the menu that people photographed, and the space, or to see poorly lit photos of dishes that might not be around anymore. I'd never use the reviews to inform my opinion -- there are too many posted by representatives and friends of the restaurants, and by people who haven't eaten there -- but I'd be lying if I said I didn't scroll through.
You have to keep your identity disguised so that restaurants don't treat you favorably. That seems impossible in the digital age. How do you do it?
It is impossible. But I keep trying because when I've been recognized, I've had a different experience from when I haven't been recognized.
Yes, there are things a restaurant can't adapt at the last second if they recognize a critic, but the sad truth is that so many restaurants are truly great only if you're a V.I.P., and it's a completely different experience for regular folks. And if restaurant is great only for its V.I.P.s, is it really great? (No, it's not.)
So I don't post selfies on social media. I make reservations in other names or have other people make them for me, then show up as their guest. I sometimes use a burner app to switch out phone numbers. If The Times gave me a makeup and wig budget, I probably wouldn't join the Ruth Reichl school of costumes, but I completely understand why she went to such extremes sometimes.
Outside of work, what tech product are you obsessed with?
A friend in Los Angeles recently introduce me to iNaturalist, which is a really cool app for keeping track of all the flowers and trees that I don't yet recognize. I walk a lot in Los Angeles, and around other parts of California, both for work and for fun. I'm obsessed with not just recording what I see but learning how to identify it.
I'm also living for TikTok cooking videos and memes -- cooking in rivers, walking in intricately cut banana peels, all of it.
What do you do when you're taking a break from going to restaurants? Do you open a delivery app?
I sometimes treat myself to delivery from one of my favorite places in the city and time it so that it gets to my place right as I'm getting home from the gym.
But I'm a former restaurant cook, and in addition to filing reviews, I write a monthly recipe column for The New York Times Magazine, so that means if I have any free time outside of restaurants, I'm in my kitchen at home, cooking for friends. I read a lot of cookbooks and bookmark pages of things to try, and sometimes I develop a recipe out of a dish I liked at a restaurant.
What tools do you love using in the kitchen?
I believe in the metric system, and I love a digital scale. I do have a multipurpose electric pressure cooker, an off-brand Instant Pot, but unfortunately it has become a single-use tool for lentils and dried beans.
I also love my kitchen's most low-tech tools: a big stone mortar and pestle for quickly peeling garlic and crushing spices and curry pastes, as well as my narrow, plastic Benriner mandoline for slicing anything evenly, in bulk.
In Tech We're Using, Times journalists give us a peek into the technology they love and use for work and life.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Headnote Commentary
(BlackPressUSA) - A Saturday morning shooting rampage in El Paso, Texas on August 3 took the lives of 22 people, and seriously injured more than two dozen others. Reportedly, the alleged shooter wanted to kill as many Mexicans as he could. Armed with safety glasses, ear coverings and an assault-style rifle, the shooter entered a Walmart store during a back-to-school sale.
"Saturday's attack on El Paso was an attack on the Mexican heritage of millions of Americans - and also part of a history of white supremacist and nativist acts in Texas across three centuries," wrote Hector Tobar, in a recent New York Times op-ed. Tobar, an associate professor at the University of California at Irvine is also a published author.
Later that day during evening hours and nearly 1,600 miles away in Dayton, Ohio, another gunman's attack left 9 people dead and 27 injured in that city's Oregon district. Like the Texas shooter, Ohio's shooter was heavily armed but was shot by police before he could enter a nightclub where he could have killed far more. The victims of this shooting reflected the city's diversity and included Blacks, Latinos, and whites.
How in a span of only 24-hours, could two cities in different states and regions suffer mass shootings - one in a city only a few miles from the nation's southern border, and the other, a former Midwestern manufacturing hub?
Despite the shock of two unprovoked attacks, family and community members in both cities must somehow cope through their grief while preparing funeral arrangements. These two communities are also challenging governmental officials at both the state and federal levels to take actions to prevent further fatalities.
Nationally, a profusion of prayers and condolences from the nation together signaled that a tragic moment may yet be transformed into a groundswell movement that reckons with the American conscience. The profusion of assault weapons combined with easy access is a gripping issue that confronts us all.
In response to these and other tragedies, a rainbow coalition of leaders held a noon rally on Aug. 6 in the nation's capital. In a joint statement, the Leadership Conference for Civil and Human Rights was joined by key partners including but not limited to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Voto Latino, the Center for Community Self-Help and the Center for Responsible Lending.
"None of this is acceptable," said the leaders in a written statement. "None of this is normal. Our organizations are united in saying that Members of Congress can no longer look away as communities of color are murdered with impunity. We must all unite and demand accountability."
The NAACP is additionally calling for the passage of the bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. Passed on a bipartisan House vote of 240-190 on Febr. 27, the bill has yet to be taken up by the Senate. The bill would address both background check requirements for firearms, and firearm transfers between private individuals.
Beyond congressional actions, however, other spheres of influence can also take an active role in curbing violence. For example, corporate leaders could publicly condemn efforts to demonize immigrants, minorities or other groups targeted for hate crimes and violence. In pulpits across the country, pastors should preach about the moral dilemma the nation faces and call upon congregants to live their faith every day. Community-based organizations can call upon state and local officials to also speak out against senseless acts of violence and white supremacists.
Now is also a time to remember that regardless of race or ethnicity, our history chronicles the range of hate crimes that have taken the lives of Latinos as well as Native Americans, Blacks, Jews, and the LGBTQ community. The terror now facing America's Latinos resurrects these horrors, particularly how Blacks encountered racial hatred for more than a century during Jim Crow era and later during the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s.
Too many times in recent years, our unique Black American experience we remain at risk as a people. In 1998 the body of James Byrd, a Black, 49-year old Jasper, Texas man was ripped to pieces as it was drug over a mile and a half by whites driving a pick-up truck. Other and more recent heinous hate crimes remind us of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice - just to name a few.
According to Rutgers University, Black men today are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be victims of violence. From 2013 to 2017, 11,456 fatal encounters with police and members of the public were reported.
At the same time, the emergence of hate groups has been on the rise, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).
"The total number of hate groups rose to 1,020 in 2018, up about 7 percent from 2017," wrote Heidi Beirich, who leads SPLC's Intelligence Project and its award-winning publication, The Intelligence Report.
Its report released this February found that white nationalist groups grew from 100 in 2017 to 148 the following year, 2018 - a 50 percent growth. Other hate groups - anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-Muslim - also grew during these same years from 233 to 264. While the Ku Klux Klan dominated hate groups in the Jim Crow and civil rights eras, its presence across the country now appears to have been eclipsed by the growth of neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and skin head organizations.
SPLC's Hate Map by State shows that the largest number of statewide hate groups are located in California (83), Florida (75), and Texas (73). At the local level, additional hate organizations currently operate in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Tallahassee. Beyond these three states, hate groups can also be found in 45 other states and in more metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Sacramento, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
Just as the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. prompted the enactment of major civil rights legislation, now is another time for our nation to stand up to the many forms of domestic terrorism that plague the nation. People of conscience and principle have a duty to stand up, speak out for the fullness of our "inalienable rights."

Texto completo: The opera star Plácido Domingo was placed under investigation on Tuesday by the Los Angeles Opera, which he helped found and has led since 2003, after The Associated Press reported that multiple women had accused him of sexual harassment over the years.
The allegations shook the opera world -- where Mr. Domingo remains, at 78, an enormous force. The Philadelphia Orchestra withdrew its invitation for Mr. Domingo to sing at its opening night gala next month, and the San Francisco Opera canceled a concert with him in October. The Metropolitan Opera, where Mr. Domingo is scheduled to star in Verdi's "Macbeth" next month opposite the soprano Anna Netrebko, said it would await the results of the Los Angeles Opera's investigation "before making any final decisions about Mr. Domingo's ultimate future at the Met."
The Associated Press reported the allegations of multiple women who said that Mr. Domingo had pressured them into sexual relationships in a series of encounters beginning in the late 1980s -- including seven women who said that they felt their careers had been harmed after they rebuffed him. Mr. Domingo said in a statement that he believed "all of my interactions and relationships were always welcomed and consensual."
Mr. Domingo, who has been married for more than 50 years, said in the statement that "the allegations from these unnamed individuals dating back as many as 30 years are deeply troubling, and as presented, inaccurate," but added that "it is painful to hear that I may have upset anyone or made them feel uncomfortable -- no matter how long ago and despite my best intentions."
He said that "the rules and standards by which we are -- and should be -- measured against today are very different than they were in the past" and pledged to hold himself "to the highest standards."
Mr. Domingo occupies a unique position in the opera world. After shooting to fame as a star tenor -- then reaching a far broader global audience as one of the Three Tenors, alongside Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras -- he also became a conductor; founded the prestigious young artist competition Operalia; and began adding managerial positions, becoming the general director of Washington National Opera and then the Los Angeles Opera, a position he still holds. He also continues to have a prolific singing career in baritone roles.
These activities have made him one of the most influential figures in opera.
The Los Angeles Opera said in a statement that it would engage an outside counsel to investigate what it called "the concerning allegations" against Mr. Domingo.
"Plácido Domingo has been a dynamic creative force in the life of L.A. Opera and the artistic culture of Los Angeles for more than three decades," the opera company said in a statement. "Nevertheless, we are committed to doing everything we can to foster a professional and collaborative environment where all our employees and artists feel equally comfortable, valued and respected."
The A.P. spoke with eight singers and one dancer -- all but one of whom were quoted anonymously -- who said that Mr. Domingo had used his power to pursue them sexually. They described him as calling them repeatedly and making dates, often under the guise of offering professional advice. One accuser told the news agency that Mr. Domingo had stuck his hand down her skirt, and three others said that he had forced wet kisses on their lips, in a dressing room, a hotel room and at a lunch meeting.
One singer told the news agency that Mr. Domingo had repeatedly propositioned her at the Los Angeles Opera in 1998, the year the company announced that he would become its artistic director, eventually taking her to his apartment for what she described as "heavy petting" and "groping."
"I was totally intimidated and felt like saying no to him would be saying no to God," she was quoted as saying. "How do you say no to God?"
She told the news agency she eventually told him to stop calling her, adding that she was never hired again in Los Angeles after Mr. Domingo got power over casting.
Patricia Wulf, the only accuser named in the A.P. article, told The New York Times in a telephone interview that her experiences with Mr. Domingo also dated to 1998, when she appeared with Washington National Opera, where he was then general director, in "The Magic Flute."
When Ms. Wulf left the stage during one rehearsal, she said, Mr. Domingo was waiting for her in the wings. He came up to her, she recalled, and said, "Patricia, do you have to go home tonight?"
Ms. Wulf said she laughed, thinking it was a joke, but later the situation repeated itself. "I remember thinking, 'That is not acceptable,"' she said.
Mr. Domingo did not inappropriately touch her, Ms. Wulf said, but he made her so uncomfortable that she hid in her dressing room and asked a colleague to walk her to her car so she did not have to risk encountering him. She said she did not report Mr. Domingo's behavior because she felt that doing so would damage her career.
She said she kept saying no to Mr. Domingo until he stopped, about two and a half years later.
In his statement, which was initially made to The A.P. and later sent to The Times, Mr. Domingo said, "People who know me or who have worked with me know that I am not someone who would intentionally harm, offend, or embarrass anyone."
At the Salzburg Festival in Austria, where Mr. Domingo is scheduled to sing in concert performances of Verdi's "Luisa Miller" this month, Helga Rabl-Stadler, the festival's president, said that he would perform as planned.
"I have known Plácido Domingo for more than 25 years," Ms. Rabl-Stadler said in a statement. "In addition to his artistic competence, I was impressed from the very beginning by his appreciative treatment of all festival employees. He knows every name, from the concierge to the secretary; he never fails to thank anyone performing even the smallest service for him. Had the accusations against him been voiced inside the Festspielhaus in Salzburg, I am sure I would have heard of it."
Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met from 1990 to 2006, also said that he had never heard any allegations against Mr. Domingo. "I've known Plácido since he made his debut at the Met in 1968, and there was never, ever a complaint made against him about sexual harassment," Mr. Volpe said in a telephone interview. "He's such a gentleman, and so caring about people."
The Met, which fired its former music director, James Levine, in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct -- and which just last week quietly settled a rancorous lawsuit he had filed against the company -- said in a statement that it takes "accusations of sexual harassment and abuse of power with extreme seriousness." The statement noted that Mr. Domingo, as a guest artist, had never been in a position to influence casting decisions there.
Washington National Opera merged with the Kennedy Center in 2011, the year Mr. Domingo departed. The company's current general director, Timothy O'Leary, and Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the Kennedy Center, said in a joint statement that the allegations against Mr. Domingo had all predated the center's takeover of the company.
"The Kennedy Center did not receive any documented complaints about Mr. Domingo's behavior prior to W.N.O.'s affiliation with the Kennedy Center, and we have not received any since then," the statement said.
A spokesman for the Royal Opera House in London did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Domingo would perform there next year, as scheduled. The spokesman said in a statement that the company "has not been made aware of any accusations pertaining to Plácido Domingo's time as a visiting artist or conductor. However, we have a zero-tolerance policy toward harassment of any kind."
The San Francisco Opera said in a statement that it "places a great priority on creating a safe and secure environment where everyone can focus on their work and art, and in which colleagues are treated with respect, dignity and collegiality."
The company said that ticket holders would be able to exchange their tickets to the canceled Domingo concert for other performances this season, or request refunds.

Cut the risks of a hurricane-season trip

Texto completo: Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean - and that includes the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and destinations in the Bahamas and Florida - runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Hurricanes can strike at any time, but peak season runs August through October, when the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration says 96% of major hurricanes have struck.
That period, and extending through November, is also when resorts in the Caribbean, especially, offer rock-bottom rates, enticing budget travelers to risk a storm. For example, Calabash Cove Resort and Spa in St. Lucia currently has an all-inclusive deal for two people for five nights at $1,572 through Dec. 23 versus $3,485 in high season. Atlantis, Paradise Island in the Bahamas has rates from $189, or 30% off high-season prices this fall, including a $100 resort credit. The all-inclusive Hilton Rose Hall Resort & Spa in Jamaica is offering rooms in September from $213, a 45% discount.
Betting on good weather is always a risk. But what does it cost to cover the risk of your investment in the event of a hurricane?
It's hard to put an exact figure on it, given the many variables of travel, but the cost of hurricane disruption can run from nothing - assuming the airline waives change fees and the hotel accommodates penalty-free rebooking - and start at roughly $50 a person to insure it. Below are some questions to ask before you commit to your trip.
Does your hotel have a hurricane-protection policy?
Many resorts offer their own protection policies in case a hurricane strikes, providing some assurance to travelers. For example, Club Med, which operates six resorts in the Caribbean, offers a Hurricane Protection Program that issues a future travel certificate equal to the value of the guest's vacation for the number of nights affected by a Category 1 or higher-level hurricane, allowing guests to rebook for a future date without penalty.
The key is to ask about policies before you book, as terms vary. For example, once the U.S. National Hurricane Weather Center has issued an official hurricane warning, the Sonesta hotels on St. Maarten, including the Sonesta Ocean Point and Sonesta Maho Beach Resort Casino & Spa, will allow those unable to arrive to rebook at their original rates within the same calendar year.
If a hurricane watch or warning is issued within 14 days of arrival at the Atlantis, Paradise Island in the Bahamas, the resort's hurricane guarantee allows guests to change their reservations without penalties, as long as they rebook within 60 days and are willing to pay whatever the prevailing rates are. (The rebooked trip must also be completed within a year of your original reservation.)
On St. Lucia, a dozen hotels offer a Holiday Guarantee permitting guests to cancel their stay without penalty in the case of a hurricane and apply deposits to future bookings.
Does your airline allow penalty-free flight changes?
Anticipating storms, most airlines have adoptsd proactive programs to encourage travelers to avoid them by offering options to change flights voluntarily without penalties a few days before or after a storm is expected to strike. This would apply to airports visited en route - for example, you are flying to Jamaica via Charlotte, North Carolina, and a storm is threatening the Carolinas, necessitating a new transit airport - or your final destination, in this case Jamaica. If your flight is canceled by the airline, you may rebook without penalty or receive a refund.
Other than flying within the storm-related window prescribed by the airline, which is usually within the week, changing your flight plans to an entirely new date - for example, you decide to try Jamaica in January instead - normally incurs a change fee and any fare difference between the original ticket and the one rebooked for January. For example, American Airlines charges $200 for a change to a domestic ticket and up to $750 for international travel; JetBlue change fees range $75 to $200.
Among major carriers, only Southwest Airlines does not charge a change fee. The carrier flies to several coastal and island destinations, including Belize, Cancun, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Grand Cayman, Puerto Rico, Nassau and the Turks and Caicos.
Have you looked into travel insurance?
You can insure both the airline ticket and lodging costs as well as any nonrefundable tours booked by buying travel insurance. But the key is to buy it before a storm hits; travel insurance is only available before a storm is identified.
Travelers buying insurance can expect to spend between 4 and 10% of the cost of the trip, said Stan Sandberg, the co-founder of Travelinsurance.com, a website that compares policies.
Prices vary based on what they cover and how generous they are with payouts. Some cover 100% of trip interruption, and others 150%. Remuneration for lost bags can run $500 to $1,000. Medical evacuation may be covered at $50,000 or $150,000.
Consumers should compare benefits before buying and, in the case of hurricane coverage, check applicable terms. Most will cover policyholders when a destination is deemed uninhabitable, as was Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, or evacuation is mandatory.
It's also worth noting that buying travel insurance is a consideration that goes beyond weather. For example, cruises usually reroute during storms, rather than cancel, but Bob Levinstein, the chief executive officer of CruiseCompete.com, a cruise-comparison website, generally encourages clients to buy it for other reasons, such as a medical emergency, routine travel delays or job interference.
To evaluate policies financially, add up the cost of nonrefundable expenses in a worst-case scenario, such as airline costs, lodging deposits, the lodging balance you would be responsible for in the case of last-minute cancellation, and the price of any tour or cruise booked.
Running a few scenarios through the website Travelinsurance.com showed that a solo traveler from New York state seeking to cover an $800 trip could find policies between $22 and $74, with the average at $46, or 5.7% of the total trip. A couple from Illinois, both age 33, spending $1,500 on a trip would spend on average $120 on joint travel insurance, or 8% of the trip. A family of four from Massachusetts - parents, age 42, and children ages 10 and 8 - would spend close to $200 for all four to be insured for a $2,500 trip, also 8% of the trip's cost.

Texto completo: A list of things you might want to avoid: the site of a recent Russian nuclear explosion, "forever chemicals" and not-safe-for-work rants inspired by a character from "The Godfather. "
It's Ashley. Leave the news, take the cannoli.
But first, leg room: When was the last time you got an entire row to yourself on a flight? How about an entire plane? This guy did.
A rocket explosion: What exactly happened in Russia?
A mysterious explosion at a Russian offshore military site involved a missile's nuclear power source and is fueling international speculation. Few details have trickled in, but here’s what we know:
Five scientists were killed in the explosion Thursday during a test of "a nuclear isotope power source" for a rocket, a Russian nuclear energy company said.
Residents were temporarily evacuated in Nyonoksa, according to reports from Russian newswire Interfax, The Washington Post and CNN, citing Russian news outlets. Russian officials canceled the evacuation order hours later.
A radiation increase four to 16 times above normal background levels occurred in the nearby town of Severodvinsk after the incident, according to news agency TASS, which cited Russian weather service Rosgidromet.
Nuclear experts say the accident occurred during a test of a missile that Russian President Vladamir Putin has touted in the past year, The New York Times and Reuters reported.
Damage appears much smaller than that from the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, the Times reported, though the extent was not immediately clear.
A CNN host's NSWF rant: 'I should be better'
A profanity-laced video showing CNN anchor Chris Cuomo confronting a heckler who called him "Fredo" prompted nationwide debate over the term, which he described as a slur toward Italian Americans. In the clip, Cuomo says he's been taunted as "Fredo" before, likening it to slurs hurled at other racial and ethnic groups. (The term stems from the 1972 film "The Godfather. ") As the altercation gained national attention Monday, President Donald Trump tweeted the term as an insult to Cuomo. The CNN anchor later tweeted that such harassment "happens all the time" these days. “No need to add to the ugliness,” Cuomo tweeted. “I should be better than what I oppose. "
What everyone’s talking about
Many animals need protection now more than ever. Consider the critically endangered vaquita: There are less than 20 left in the world.
49ers assistant Katie Sowers said one NFL team told her it wasn't ready for a female coach.
Beer, wine or liquor? America's favorite booze varies by gender and education level.
A tragic day for pet parents: A couple's three dogs died after coming in contact with water full of toxic blue-green algae.
Has the food in your fridge expired? This guide to food dates can help.
Trump saves Christmas? Tariffs on some Chinese goods are delayed until December.
'Cancer-linked' chemicals in Chipotle packaging?
Everything about your burrito bowl from Chipotle or your salad from Sweetgreen seems earthy and health-conscious, right down to the packaging. But harmful chemicals may lurk in those eco-friendly containers. A story published last week by the New Food Economy reported the "cancer-linked" presence of PFAS, also called "forever chemicals," in the fiber bowls the companies use. The chemicals are being investigated amid concerns over links to cancer, obesity and other health problems. The methodology used in the report has been questioned by the Foodservice Packaging Institute, a group that claims the report's chemical indicators may not always prove accurate. In a statement to USA TODAY, Chipotle said that it only partners "with suppliers who make fluorochemical sciences and food safety a top priority. "

False alarms for mass shootings have a 'hidden cost'
Minutes after a 911 call reporting a man with a weapon at the USA TODAY headquarters in Virginia, 89 police officers and other authorities arrived to secure the area. It was thankfully a false alarm. After a string of mass shootings shook Americans, multiple false reports and hoaxes of active shooters have spread around the country, highlighting an acute fear many Americans feel in the wake of the incidents. All that police manpower has a cost even if threats don't materialize: Police officers incur stress and trauma responding to what they believe are life-and-death situations, and a psychological effect unfolds within a community.

Texto completo: Our series “How I became a …” digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From becoming fascinated with the art of tidying at the age of 5 to starting her own organizing business as a university student in Japan, Marie Kondo and her approach to tidying has sparked joy in people all across the globe. Her New York Times bestseller “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up” helped Kondo share her lessons with the world, and her Netflix original “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo” is up for two Emmy Awards.
USA TODAY caught up with Kondo to talk about everything from the happiness she gets from organizing items into tiny little boxes to producing her own television show for Netflix.
Question: How did you get your start?
Marie Kondo: When it comes to tidying, I was interested in tidying ever since I was 5 years old, and by the time I entered middle school, I dove into researching tidying. I was 19 years old when I became a professional organizing consultant. One of my hobbies when I was in college was to go tidy my friends’ homes, and the word-of-mouth quickly spread that when Marie comes to visit your home, your home becomes incredibly tidy.
When I began my organizing consulting business, the wait list became half a year long, so I received a request from one of my clients that they wanted to read my lessons in book form, (and) that was how the book came to be.
Q: How has your career changed since?
Kondo: What I do to impart what I know about tidying hasn’t changed at all. But I’ve always mainly worked in Japan before – now, I have a lot of TV appearances, and the scale of my lectures and presentations I give certainly have changed. I also work predominantly in the U. S. now, so it’s changed quite a bit.
Q: What does a typical workday look like for you?
Kondo: For today, for instance, I’m writing a new book, so sometimes I do that. I also create videos related to my tidying lessons, and for Japan I have a Japan exclusive online service, so I have to write content for that. Very full days.
Q: What is your favorite thing about your job?
Kondo: I love creating storage. I like working with tiny little boxes, and it’s almost like a puzzle when it fits exactly into that space – my client’s space – that we’re working with. It feels so great.
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Kondo: I think I credit that to my home is tidy, but my decision-making skills are very tidy. I always feel like I’m attuned to what I need to be doing at that particular moment.
Q: How do you balance work, life and such a busy schedule?
Kondo: I wonder (laughs). In terms of balance, I always try to carve out a time that sparks joy for me, whether that is a time for reflection or relaxing and playing with my children. I make sure that I save that time so that I can always maintain myself to be at 100%, and then I try to think how to conduct my schedule in a most effective way.
Q: What have been some of your career highlights?
Kondo: I think that would have to be producing my own TV show for Netflix – it’s been amazing.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Kondo: To put it succinctly, I would to say to trust in what sparks joy for you. Trust in your own sense of what sparks joy for you.
Quick hits
What’s your tea order? I like pearl barley tea.

Texto completo: Seventy-five years ago, "Double Indemnity" opened in theaters across America. It was an instant hit, and remains to this day a staple offering of revival houses and on cable TV and streaming video. Yet little journalistic notice has been taken of the birthday of Billy Wilder's first great screen drama, a homicidal thriller that nonetheless had -- and has -- something truly unsettling to say about the dark crosscurrents of middle-class American life.
Directed by Wilder and co-written by him and Raymond Chandler, the celebrated mystery novelist, "Double Indemnity" is the story of a restless insurance salesman who helps a sexy, frustrated housewife murder her husband for profit. Though neither Wilder nor Chandler realized it at the time, it would later be acknowledged by critics and scholars as the first fully developed example of film noir, in which a flawed but basically innocent protagonist is presented with a moral choice, makes the wrong call, and is plunged into a violent after-hours world of passion and crime. From "Out of the Past" to Quentin Tarantino, every subsequent noir and neo-noir film has been haunted by the ghosts of Walter Neff, the wisecracking salesman who secretly longs to "crook the house" by any means necessary, and Phyllis Dietrichson, the shopworn babe who takes Walter for all he's got -- until he finally gets wise.
It's hard to understand what possessed Wilder to take on such a project. He was best known in 1944, after all, for having collaborated with Charles Brackett, a Harvard-educated WASP, on the screenplays for such romantic comedies as "Ninotchka" and "Ball of Fire." But then he swerved far off course and decided to make a movie out of a 1936 crime novella by James M. Cain, who was also the author of "The Postman Always Rings Twice," another hard-boiled tale of sex and bloodshed. Moreover, Wilder was determined to direct "Double Indemnity" himself, having concluded that most Hollywood directors treated scripts like "toilet paper that they either used or they didn't." The patrician Brackett had no interest in adapting so sordid a tale for the screen, so Wilder found himself another collaborator in Chandler. The two men soon grew to loathe one another, but the fruit of their uneasy labors landed seven Oscar nominations and turned Wilder into the hottest of properties.
Small wonder: Every aspect of "Double Indemnity" is distinguished, so much so that you could write a column about any single element. The script is a dazzling amalgam of precisely tooled plot points and sharp-cornered repartee. (Phyllis: "We're both rotten." Walter: "Only you're a little more rotten.") Miklos Rozsa's background score skillfully heightens all the on-screen emotions, while Wilder's unshowy style exemplifies his prime directive of direction: "When somebody turns to his neighbor and says, 'My, that was beautifully directed,' we have proof it was not."
Fred MacMurray, who would reinvent himself years later as the bland sitcom dad of "My Three Sons," plays Neff with a cheerful snappiness that barely conceals his inchoate longing to break free from the iron shackles of respectability. Edward G. Robinson, the gangster-star of the '30s who here switched over to his first supporting role, gives the performance of a lifetime as Barton Keyes, the claims manager of Pacific All-Risk Insurance, who loves Walter like the son he never had, then discovers to his horror that his "son" is the killer he's been hunting down. Best of all, though, is Barbara Stanwyck. Part of what makes her so striking is that Wilder showed her villainy in an unexpectedly sympathetic light (an impression underlined by Rozsa, whose music for the love scenes is overtly romantic). In addition, she'd acquired from her earlier comic roles a deftness that allowed her to toss off the film's crisp dialogue with beguiling ease.
None of the makers of "Double Indemnity" knew they were shooting one for the ages. Critics are no better at spotting true innovation, and few of them saw in 1944 how original it was. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times dismissed it as "a variably intriguing crime game" that was "diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length." Even the vastly more perceptive James Agee, writing in the Nation, called it "essentially cheap." Not so: "Double Indemnity" is deadly serious, a moral tale about the thinness of the ice on which human decency rests. In a 1978 interview, Wilder went so far as to admit that it reflected the "deep-seated influence [of] having read a lot of Dostoyevsky."
On another occasion, Wilder called "Double Indemnity" a "love story between two men," alluding to the last scene, in which Neff, who is lying in a pool of blood on the floor of his office, gasps to Keyes that he couldn't see that the murderer he'd sought was "too close. Right across the desk from you." To which the heartbroken Keyes replies in a voice whose hardness cannot conceal his anguish, "Closer than that, Walter." That wrenching climax sums up "Double Indemnity," a pop-culture masterpiece exemplary of the very best that golden-age Hollywood had to offer.

Main Street: Guns and the Do-Something Fallacy

Texto completo: "Do something!" someone shouted at Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. The shout came during a candlelight vigil in downtown Dayton, where a disturbed young man just hours before had shot to death nine innocent people, including his own sister. Others in the crowd quickly chimed in, until "what started as just a smattering of voices had morphed into a deafening chant," according to the Washington Post.
The deafening chant has now moved to Washington, where Congress is feeling pushed to "do something" about mass shootings. In the standard Beltway narrative, were it not for the Second Amendment "absolutists" in thrall to the National Rifle Association, Democrats and Republicans would happily come together on common-sense measures to halt the bloodshed. Even President Trump is now saying, "I think we could get something really good done" -- meaning expanded background checks, which the NRA opposes.
This ought to be Mr. Trump's moment. After all, he ascended to the Oval Office not by abiding by conventional wisdom but by defying it. Right now we could use some of that defiance, because missing from the debate over mass shootings is a national leader willing to endure the opprobrium that comes with speaking a hard truth: There's only so much the federal government can do here.
The American people, we are told, have grown cynical because we know the solutions but can't implement them because of that pesky Second Amendment. But one driver of public cynicism surely has to be that little of what has been put in place so far has worked as promised. If America is serious about dealing with homicidal young men, the answer won't be to dump the problem on local cops, the FBI or some federal database -- especially when no crime has been committed.
"Everything's on the table," Mr. DeWine told reporters after the Dayton killings. But that really isn't true. Like so many other pols, the governor means he's willing to consider legislation controlling guns or access to them. What's almost certainly not on the table? A critical look at whether more extensive background checks or red-flag laws or bans on "assault weapons" will in fact solve this problem.
The same goes at the federal level. Take the Bipartisan Background Checks Act recently passed by the Democratic House and now being urged on the Republican Senate. David Harsanyi, a senior editor at the Federalist and author of "First Freedom: A Ride Through America's Enduring History With the Gun," notes that "the type of universal background checks now being proposed by Washington would have done nothing to deter any of the mass shootings we've seen." The El Paso and Dayton shooters each apparently passed background checks and acquired their guns legally.
Skepticism is also in order for so-called red flag laws, which allow police or family members to petition a state court to confiscate firearms temporarily from a person deemed dangerous. In an op-ed for the New York Times, psychiatrist Richard A. Friedman admitted that even "experienced psychiatrists fare no better than a roll of the dice at predicting violence." The evidence suggests that while red-flag laws do stop suicides, it isn't clear they prevent mass shootings.
So what might be an answer? Hillary Clinton pointed the way in her book "It Takes a Village." Of course, once you move past her title, Mrs. Clinton's village turns out to depend on federal bureaucrats.
But the principle is worth rescuing. There will never be any federal agency or watch list that can match the real-time collective intelligence that communities have about a young man in their midst who is steeped in toxic ideologies, indulging in fantasies of violence and getting hold of firearms. Alas, far from empowering these local leaders to act when they spot trouble -- teachers, scoutmasters, pastors, police chiefs, shopkeepers, coaches -- we have spent the past half century undermining their authority.
A little modesty could go a long way. On the left, few trust the ordinary American as much as they do the federal government, especially with guns. But on the right, Republican congressmen, senators and presidents calling for federal gun control ought to be pressed whether they really believe what they offer is a solution -- or merely enough to quiet the "do something" chorus.
Perhaps before Congress "does something," we ought to let states and localities experiment with giving community leaders the ability to act -- while also protecting due process and other constitutional rights. At the least those who insist the solutions are primarily federal ought to answer the most obvious question: Can you show us exactly how your measure would have prevented earlier shootings if it had been in place?
Some will take this as a counsel of despair. That, too, is an unfortunate consequence of today's narrative. Because acknowledging the limits of the federal government's ability to stop mass shootings isn't the end of the debate. It's the start of an honest one.

Texto completo: The late Thomas J. Stanley spent a collective 170 weeks on The New York Times' best-seller list with the groundbreaking book "The Millionaire Next Door" and its sequel, "The Millionaire Mind."
He and his daughter, psychologist Sarah Stanley Fallaw, had begun working together on a new book when he died in a car crash in 2015. Fallaw, president of Data Points, continued the work and dedicated "The Next Millionaire Next Door" to her dad's memory.
She'll speak Friday at the annual fundraiser for "Aloha to Aging," an organization that offers services for seniors and caregivers, including support groups focused on Alzheimer's disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease.
Gala chair and Aloha to Aging board member Cindy Theiler and Dawn Reed, the group's founder and board president, are thrilled to have Fallaw lending her expertise to the upcoming fundraiser. They also noted that her mom volunteers with the group. "We wouldn't be in existence if it wasn't for volunteers," Reed said.
The event, themed "Building Our Legacy," will highlight a number of areas where aging and finances intersect. Combating elder financial abuse is among the organization's initiatives, as is highlighting the need for financial planning to ensure adequate resources through retirement.
"This is something we have to deal with.We're all heading in that direction," Fallaw said, noting that retirement planning is "not just, 'Can I retire on the beach? It's, 'My spouse might be diagnosed with early onset dementia."
Her father, who died at 71, instilled in her a love for learning that began early.
"One of the fondest memories I have is sitting around the breakfast table reading three different newspapers," she said. "That's the legacy he's left for me."
Thomas Stanley was a marketing professor at Georgia State University whose exhaustively researched book revealed the simple secrets of self-made millionaires. The folks driving flashy, brand-new luxury cars and boasting closets full of designer labels, it turns out, might actually be broke. Those who opt for nicely maintained used cars, use coupons and otherwise live modestly, on the other hand, might actually have a tidy sum in savings.
"He was very good at explaining what it meant to build wealth," Fallaw said. "At the end of the day it is the discipline you apply each and every day."

Texto completo: Convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who died in an apparent suicide over the weekend, once said he wanted to become a minister so his acquaintances would open up to him about their secrets.
Last year Epstein met with New York Times columnist James Stewart, who wanted to talk about whether the multimillionaire was advising Tesla chief executive Elon Musk.
Tesla denies seeking Epstein's help, but Epstein told Stewart that he was considered "radioactive," and Tesla would deny that he had given advice if it ever became public.
"He said this was something he’d become used to, even though it didn’t stop people from visiting him, coming to his dinner parties or asking him for money. (That was why, Mr. Epstein told me without any trace of irony, he was considering becoming a minister so that his acquaintances would be confident that their conversations would be kept confidential.)," Stewart wrote.
Epstein said he knew the dark secrets of a lot of rich and powerful people, including the sexual proclivities and drug use of tech leaders, according to Stewart.
Stewart said this 90-minute conversation, which took place at Epstein's Manhattan mansion, was on background and therefore could not be attributed to Epstein. Stewart said he determined that condition to have expired with Epstein's death in a Manhattan prison cell.

Texto completo: "Do something!" someone shouted at Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. The shout came during a candlelight vigil in downtown Dayton, where a disturbed young man just hours before had shot to death nine innocent people, including his own sister. Others in the crowd quickly chimed in, until "what started as just a smattering of voices had morphed into a deafening chant," according to the Washington Post.
The deafening chant has now moved to Washington, where Congress is feeling pushed to "do something" about mass shootings. In the standard Beltway narrative, were it not for the Second Amendment "absolutists" in thrall to the National Rifle Association, Democrats and Republicans would happily come together on common-sense measures to halt the bloodshed. Even President Trump is now saying, "I think we could get something really good done"—meaning expanded background checks, which the NRA opposes.
This ought to be Mr. Trump's moment. After all, he ascended to the Oval Office not by abiding by conventional wisdom but by defying it. Right now we could use some of that defiance, because missing from the debate over mass shootings is a national leader willing to endure the opprobrium that comes with speaking a hard truth: There's only so much the federal government can do here.
The American people, we are told, have grown cynical because we know the solutions but can't implement them because of that pesky Second Amendment. But one driver of public cynicism surely has to be that little of what has been put in place so far has worked as promised. If America is serious about dealing with homicidal young men, the answer won't be to dump the problem on local cops, the FBI or some federal database—especially when no crime has been committed.
"Everything's on the table," Mr. DeWine told reporters after the Dayton killings. But that really isn't true. Like so many other pols, the governor means he's willing to consider legislation controlling guns or access to them. What's almost certainly not on the table? A critical look at whether more extensive background checks or red-flag laws or bans on "assault weapons" will in fact solve this problem.
The same goes at the federal level. Take the Bipartisan Background Checks Act recently passed by the Democratic House and now being urged on the Republican Senate. David Harsanyi, a senior editor at the Federalist and author of "First Freedom: A Ride Through America's Enduring History With the Gun," notes that "the type of universal background checks now being proposed by Washington would have done nothing to deter any of the mass shootings we've seen." The El Paso and Dayton shooters each apparently passed background checks and acquired their guns legally.

Skepticism is also in order for so-called red flag laws, which allow police or family members to petition a state court to confiscate firearms temporarily from a person deemed dangerous. In an op-ed for the New York Times, psychiatrist Richard A. Friedman admitted that even "experienced psychiatrists fare no better than a roll of the dice at predicting violence." The evidence suggests that while red-flag laws do stop suicides, it isn't clear they prevent mass shootings.
So what might be an answer? Hillary Clinton pointed the way in her book "It Takes a Village." Of course, once you move past her title, Mrs. Clinton's village turns out to depend on federal bureaucrats.
But the principle is worth rescuing. There will never be any federal agency or watch list that can match the real-time collective intelligence that communities have about a young man in their midst who is steeped in toxic ideologies, indulging in fantasies of violence and getting hold of firearms. Alas, far from empowering these local leaders to act when they spot trouble—teachers, scoutmasters, pastors, police chiefs, shopkeepers, coaches—we have spent the past half century undermining their authority.
A little modesty could go a long way. On the left, few trust the ordinary American as much as they do the federal government, especially with guns. But on the right, Republican congressmen, senators and presidents calling for federal gun control ought to be pressed whether they really believe what they offer is a solution—or merely enough to quiet the "do something" chorus.
Perhaps before Congress "does something," we ought to let states and localities experiment with giving community leaders the ability to act—while also protecting due process and other constitutional rights. At the least those who insist the solutions are primarily federal ought to answer the most obvious question: Can you show us exactly how your measure would have prevented earlier shootings if it had been in place?
Some will take this as a counsel of despair. That, too, is an unfortunate consequence of today's narrative. Because acknowledging the limits of the federal government's ability to stop mass shootings isn't the end of the debate. It's the start of an honest one.

Texto completo: Correction officers on Jeffrey Epstein's unit were working overtime to make up for staffing shortages the morning of his apparent suicide Saturday, a source told The Associated Press, while another published report said he was not properly monitored. 
Epstein, a politically connected financier indicted on charges of child sex-trafficking, was found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He was later pronounced dead at NewYork-Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital.
A person familiar with jail operations told the AP on Sunday that the correctional center's Special Housing Unit was staffed with one officer working a fifth straight day of overtime and another who was working mandatory overtime. The person spoke Sunday on the condition of anonymity, the AP said.
The jail staff also failed to follow protocols leading up to Epstein's death, according to a report from The New York Times. Epstein should have been checked on by guards in his cell every 30 minutes, but that didn't happen the night before his apparent suicide, a law enforcement official told the Times, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
A law enforcement source also told the Times that Epstein was alone in his cell early Saturday after his cellmate was transferred. An official with knowledge of the investigation told the paper that the Justice Department was told Epstein would have a cellmate and be monitored by a guard every 30 minutes.
An autopsy was completed on Epstein's body Sunday, authorities said, but no cause of death was disclosed.
New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson released a statement Sunday evening saying: "The ME's determination is pending further information at this time. At the request of those representing the decedent, and with the awareness of the federal prosecutor, I allowed a private pathologist (Dr. Michael Baden) to observe the autopsy examination. This is routine practice.
"My office defers to the involved law enforcement agencies regarding other investigations around this death," the statement said.
It was not immediately clear who Baden, the former New York City chief medical examiner and a former deputy chief medical examiner for Suffolk County, was working for when he attended the autopsy.
The death of Epstein, who in the past had close ties to President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and other notable public officials and financial titans, immediately spurred talk of a wider conspiracy. A day before Epstein's death, more than 2,000 pages of documents were released related to a since-settled lawsuit against him by an ex-girlfriend, one of his accusers.
On Sunday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump wanted all facets of Epstein's apparent suicide investigated, after she was asked about the president's tweets sharing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories surrounding the financier's death.
"I think the president just wants everything to be investigated," Conway said on Fox News Sunday when asked about the president's Twitter posts.
Attorney General William Barr, calling for an investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general's office, said in a statement Saturday that he was "appalled" to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody.
Late Saturday, Trump reposted a tweet from conservative actor and comedian Terrence K. Williams that suggested Clinton was somehow tied to Epstein's death. Clinton, like Trump, had a friendly relationship with the wealthy financier, who was arrested last month on charges of child sex-trafficking.
Clinton spokesman Angel Urena last month said: "President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York. He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein's ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida."
Trump also sought to distance himself from Epstein following the financier's arrest last month by federal authorities in New York. The president told reporters he had not spoken to Epstein, a former member of his Mar-a-Lago resort, for more than a decade.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at the Iowa State Fair on the presidential campaign trail, called for a full investigation into Epstein's death. He said it "just doesn't make sense" that someone so high profile was unsupervised at the jail after either attempting suicide or being assaulted.
"No way it makes sense he was left alone," De Blasio told reporters, adding that "his death should not mean that investigation is dropped ... That could include the richest, most powerful people in the country."
Other Democratic presidential hopefuls criticized Trump for retweeting the conspiracy theory without evidence.
"What he's doing is dangerous," Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said during an appearance Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." "He's giving life to not just conspiracy theories, but really whipping people up into anger and worse against different people in this country."
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday that Trump's retweet is an attempt by the president to shift the focus from the recent mass shootings that killed 31 people last week.
"This is another example of our president using this position of public trust to attack his political enemies with unfounded conspiracy theories and also to try and force you and me and all of us to focus on his bizarre behavior," O'Rourke said on "State of the Union." "He's changing the conversation. If we allow him to do that, then we will never be able to focus on the true problem, of which he is a part."
Fellow candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said in an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation" that "there needs to be a full investigation" into Epstein's apparent suicide.
"I want to know why he was left in a circumstance where suicide was even possible," Gillibrand said.
Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley) also called for answers surrounding Epstein's death in a tweet Sunday and said he believed there was "wrongdoing" but offered no specifics or evidence.
"There is a 100% chance that there was additional, not yet public wrongdoing in the circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's death," Zeldin tweeted Sunday morning. "I'm sure there are some people who want this all to just get swept under the rug, but the public wants & demands answers on what exactly happened."
Conway took issue with previous news reports linking Trump and Epstein, including a video obtained by NBC News last month that shows the two moguls sharing laughs at a Mar-a-Lago party in the late 1990s. The president's top aide suggested the public would want to know more about the host of big names who traveled to Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.
"Trying to connect the president to this monster from years ago, when they're seen dancing in a video versus other people who were actively, I suppose, flying around with this monster on his island, which was known as 'pedophilia island,' perhaps there's a public interest in knowing more about that," Conway said. "But again, this is all speculative."
The records released Friday contained graphic allegations against Epstein, as well as the transcript of his 2016 deposition in which he repeatedly refused to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself.
Asked if the Trump administration could assure Epstein's victims that their allegations will continue to be investigated by the Department of Justice, Conway said: "What I can assure them is that the attorney general took action immediately when he learned of the death of Jeffrey Epstein."
"I think that those victims should have justice, they've been looking for justice for many, many years, and I can't really comment beyond that," Conway said.

Texto completo: What grudge are you holding onto? Almost everyone can recall in intimate detail a specific incident that cut them to their core.
Whether it was public shaming at work, rejection by someone close, or even an off-hand comment by a family member, the painful moment seems to be forever branded into our brain.
I can remember being at a 20-year high-school reunion and overhearing a woman confronting a classmate who had teased her in elementary school. She'd held onto her grudge for 30 years!
Perhaps Reese Witherspoon's character, Madeline Mackenzie, in HBO's "Big Little Lies" puts it best: "I love my grudges. I tend to them like little pets." But what is really gained by holding onto grudges? More importantly, what would be gained by giving grudges up?
"Holding onto a grudge really is an ineffective strategy for dealing with a life situation that you haven't been able to master. That's the reality of it," Dr. Frederic Luskin, founder of the Stanford Forgiveness Project, told The New York Times.
"Whenever you can't grieve and assimilate what has happened, you hold it in a certain way," he added. "If it's bitterness, you hold it with anger. If it's hopeless, you hold it with despair. But both of those are psycho-physiological responses to an inability to cope, and they both do mental and physical damage."
In "Forgive for Good," Luskin explains that hopelessness suppresses our immune responses, a major factor contributing to depression. Anger compromises the immune system's ability to regulate our nervous system, making it the most harmful emotion for our cardiovascular system.
These negative emotions reach their peak of intensity when something happens that we really struggle to cope with. Instead of dealing with the external situation, we internalize the negativity, locking our body into a heightened stress state.
Hurtful situations trigger our fight-or-flight mechanism. Luskin's research shows that practicing forgiveness can help reverse the physical consequences of holding onto grudges and the unhappiness that accompanies them.
A 2019 study found that anger damages our relationships by reducing our ability to see other people's perspectives, an essential ingredient for resolving conflicts.
A study published by the Stanford Forgiveness Project in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that "skills-based forgiveness training may prove effective in reducing anger as a coping style, reducing perceived stress and physical health symptoms, and thereby may help reduce" the stress we put on our immune and cardiovascular systems.
Research published this year revealed that holding onto anger as we age causes higher levels of inflammation and chronic illness.
In fact, the Harvard Health Letter stated: "The four horsemen of the medical apocalypse - coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer's - may be riding the same steed: inflammation."
Convinced that learning to forgive is a good thing, but wondering how to do it?
First, shift to a growth mindset by recognizing three points: 1. Recognize forgiveness is for you, not the person who hurt you. 2. Accept that carrying a grudge has been hurting you emotionally and physically. 3. Commit to freeing yourself from that pain - not condoning what they did or becoming their friend.
Luskin says the there are four steps to full forgiveness.
First, calm yourself. Reduce the physical arousal associated with stressful situations. Breathe deeply and slowly for a minute or two until you feel your body relax. Go for a walk or run in order to slow down your racing mind. The goal is to develop enough separation from what happened to enable you to decide how you're going to deal with it.
The second step is shifting how you talk to yourself about your grudge. You can learn how to change your story from being a victim to being the hero.
Imagine being the more mature person who's able to rise above someone's bad behavior.
Steps three and four go together. Sometimes life just doesn't turn out the way we want it to. But we can shift our attention to the good things in our life in order to counterbalance the harm that we've suffered. Remember that generating four or five positive experiences are usually sufficient to offset negative encounters. These strategies shift your perspective and lower your level of stress.
"That's such an important thing. You're not stuck in your life," Luskin told The New York Times. "What a wonderful thing to know that there are simple strategies, trainings, and technologies that can teach people to do something about what's been burdening them forever."

Texto completo: The Associated Press
"Lost You: a Novel" (Crown), by Haylen Beck
Surrogacy - in which a woman agrees to carry a baby for another person or couple - is a legal swamp in America. In this, veteran crime novelist Stuart Neville, writing under the pen name Haylen Beck, has found the makings of an emotionally wrenching psychological thriller.
"Lost You" begins when Libby, recently abandoned by her husband, decides to take her toddler Ethan to a Florida resort to celebrate the start of her new life as a published author. But the good times turn bad when she turns her head for a moment. Ethan jumps on an elevator, the doors close, and he's gone.
At first, she fears Ethan has been lost, but she soon realizes it's worse - that Ethan has been found.
The bulk of the book consists of a flashback in which readers learn how Libby and Ethan arrived at this moment. The story involves a shady company that arranges surrogate births, a barren Libby whose history has left her with a dangerously obsessive need to raise a child, an impoverished young Anna who agrees to carry Libby's husband's baby for money and a snarl of state laws.
Neville, an Irish novelist whose previous work has made the best-seller lists of The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, says he adopted the pen name Haylen Beck for this and a previous stand-alone thriller because he didn't want to confuse fans who have come to expect his books to be part of his Belfast crime series.
"Lost You" toys with readers' emotions, making them fearful for both Libby and Anna at times, fearful of both at times and uncertain until the very end about who - if anyone - is in the right. The story unravels at an anxiety-inducing pace, and shocking twists appear around every corner.

Texto completo: ATHENS -- Azeez Ojulari found himself in an unfamiliar spot after practice Thursday, standing in front of a bank of video cameras and audio recorders.
It was the first time the outside linebacker from Marietta High had been designated by Georgia coach Kirby Smart to represent the defense in media interviews.The fact he was appointed for that duty as a redshirt freshman speaks volumes about the trust--and expectations -- the coaching staff has for Ojulari.
"I was kind of nervous at first,"Ojulari confirmed. "But I'm here now, so let's do it."
Other than a nervous giggle that followed that first answer, Ojulari was all business after that. And the Bulldogs are expecting Ojulari -- and the rest of the outside linebackers -- to be all business this season.
All that group has heard since the conclusion of last season is how they need to "create more havoc." That's a reference to "havoc plays," which Georgia deems as quarterback sacks, pressures, tackles for loss, fumbles, interceptions and tipped balls. Nationally, the Bulldogs ranked 84th and 95th, respectively, in sacks and tackles for loss last season.
The well-verbalized goal this season is for 20% of the opposition's offensive plays from scrimmage to result in one of those six outcomes. Ojulari, for one, believes that can be achieved.
"This is a group that can wreak havoc, do some damage to teams," he said.
Being a spokesman for the outside linebackers is new ground for Ojulari.To date, he has been best identified as the only (known) Georgia football player who is the descendant of a Nigerian king. His grandfather was confirmed as Prince Twins Sevens-Seven in a New York Times obituary. That detail was unveiled in a story that appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution not long after he signed with the Bulldogs in 2018.
Ojulari can play a little ball as well. It took a while to find that out.He appeared in only three games last season, thus the redshirt tag.But he recorded three tackles (one for a loss) in the Sugar Bowl loss against Texas. He replaced the recently departed Brenton Cox, ineffective that day as the starter, and played the majority of the game.
Fast forward to this season, and not only is Ojulari getting some work with the No. 1 defense, he's sitting on the team's leadership committee. That's a distinction rarely bestowed upon an underclassman.
His performance in the Sugar Bowl helped his ascension, but it has mostly been about what Ojulari has done since then: get bigger, stronger and faster. The 6-foot-3 athlete said he's up "a good 10 to 15 pounds" to 250.
The big question now is how Ojulari fits in. Georgia has a lot of outside linebackers, and most came with a higher recruiting profile than Ojulari, who was no slouch as a consensus 4-star prospect. One of the reasons Cox chose to transfer (he landed at Florida)was he found himself playing behind Ojulari.
In addition to junior Walter Grant, the returning starter at the "Sam," or strongside position, the outside linebackers also feature sophomores Adam Anderson and Robert Beal, and freshman Nolan Smith, who all were 5-star recruits, and Jermaine Johnson, who was the No. 1 overall junior college recruit. That's a glut of talent even with Cox now playing for the rival Gators, especially considering the defense can deploy at most two outside linebackers at a time, and often just one.
Defensive coordinator/ OLBs coach Dan Lanning sees this as a good problem. He intends to assign very specific roles to each of his charges. Cornerback Eric Stokes identified Ojulari as "a big closer,"meaning quick to the ball whether it is being run, caught or about to be thrown.

Texto completo: The Center Theatre for the Performing Arts is presenting a live theatrical version of "Tuesdays With Morrie" in Dover-Foxcroft and Greenville between Aug. 17 and Sept. 8. The funny and heartwarming play was written by Jeffrey Hatcher and Mitch Albom and is based on the New York Times bestselling book written by Mitch Albom.
"Tuesdays With Morrie" is the autobiographical story of Albom, an accomplished journalist, driven solely by his career, and Morrie Schwartz, his former college professor. Sixteen years after graduation, Albom sees Schwartz's appearance on "Nightline" and learns that his old professor has Lou Gehrig's Disease. They are reunited and what starts as a simple visit turns into a weekly pilgrimage and a last class in the meaning of life.
Patrick Myers, the Center Theatre's executive director, is proud to be able to bring the play to the Piscataquis community, "'Tuesdays With Morrie' is such a wonderful story. Whether you've read the book or seen the movie, the live play will bring it to life in a whole new way. There are some very funny moments and scenes that will touch everyone in the audience. It is also an important play to help us explore how we approach the end of life and how it affects those around us. Because of this, we are partnering with Pine Tree Hospice to host discussions after each performance about end of life issues."
Myers said the Theatre is also offering special pricing to encourage parents and their adult children to see the show. Tickets are only $10, and with every paid parent ticket a child of any age can attend for free. The play will be performed at the Center Theatre in Dover-Foxcroft on Saturday, Aug. 17 at 2 and 7 p.m., Friday, Aug. 23 at 7 p.m., Saturday, Aug. 24 at 2 and 7 p.m. and Sunday, Aug. 25 at 2 p.m. Then the show will move to Greenville High School for two performances on Saturday, Sept. 7 at 7 p.m. and Sunday, Sept. 8 at 2 p.m.
"Tuesdays With Morrie" is being sponsored by Dover-Foxcroft Chiropractic Center and Moosehead Cottage Resorts with additional funding provided by the Maine Humanities Council. Tickets are available at the Center Theatre and Moosehead Marine Museum, by calling the Center Theatre at 564-8943, visiting www.CenterTheatre.org or stopping in at the box office at 20 East Main Street between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays. The Center Theatre is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission of making arts, culture, education, and entertainment accessible to our rural communities.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'BETRAYAL' at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater (previews start on Aug. 14; opens on Sept. 5). It wasn't so long ago that Daniel Craig was being deceived on Broadway. Now it is Tom Hiddleston's turn. In a production that premiered in London, he stars, alongside Zawe Ashton and Charlie Cox, in Harold Pinter's chronologically inverted drama about a married couple and the friend who complicates their relationship. Jamie Lloyd directs.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'MAKE BELIEVE' at the Tony Kiser Theater at Second Stage Theater (in previews; opens on Aug. 15). Bess Wohl's play, about abandoned children who grow into unmoored adults, arrives at Second Stage under Michael Greif's direction and starring Susannah Flood, Brad Heberlee and Samantha Mathis. Reviewing an earlier production, Laura Collins-Hughes described the drama as a "beautifully constructed play -- a regret-tinged examination of family and trauma and sibling connections."
212-541-4516, 2st.com
Last Chance
'BE MORE CHILL' at the Lyceum Theater (closes on Aug. 11). The shutdown sequence has started for Joe Iconis and Joe Tracz's show about a nerd who swallows a supercomputer with an operating code set on world domination. In his review, Ben Brantley questioned the musical's craftsmanship, though he noted that unlike other Broadway productions about teenagers, this one "feels as if it could have been created by the teenagers it portrays, or perhaps by even younger people imagining what high school will be like."
212-239-6200, bemorechillmusical.com
'THE CHER SHOW' at the Neil Simon Theater (closes on Aug. 18). Do you believe in life after Broadway? This jukebox bio-musical, which needed three actresses -- Micaela Diamond, Teal Wicks and Stephanie J. Block -- to play one pop diva, closes its sequined doors. While Jesse Green praised Bob Mackie's extravagant costumes, the musical, he noted, is "all gesture, no craft: dramatically threadbare and surprisingly unrevealing."
877-250-2929, thechershowbroadway.com
'FAIRVIEW' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (closes on Aug. 11). Jackie Sibblies Drury's shape-shifting, frame-breaking, soul-shaking play, directed by Sarah Benson, ends its encore run. When this drama, which won the Pulitzer Prize, opened last year, Ben Brantley called it "dazzling and ruthless," and added, "If you see it -- and you must -- you will not be comfortable."
866-811-4111, tfana.org
'GET ON YOUR KNEES' at the Cherry Lane Theater (closes on Aug. 18). The curtain is about to fall on Jacqueline Novak's erudite history of fellatio (though it will reopen on Aug. 28 at the Lucille Lortel Theater). An author and a stand-up, Novak has a style that is brash, brainy and not as lewd as you might expect. Her show is less about the penis than it is about the indignity of being, as she says, "a woman that lusts after the common shaft."
866-811-4111, cherrylanetheatre.org
'KING KONG' at the Broadway Theater (closes on Aug. 18). An oversize ape is out of a job. This Broadway musical, notorious for its giant, intricate puppet, beats its chest for the final time. In a dual review, the New York Times chief theater critics evaluated a show that Ben Brantley described as "spirit-crushing," dismissing the score, the book and even the one-ton gorilla himself.
212-239-6200, kingkongbroadway.com
'PRETTY WOMAN: THE MUSICAL' at the Nederlander Theater (closes on Aug. 18). Having stopped a while and talked a while, this musical based on the popular film concludes its Broadway run. Ben Brantley wrote that this show, which is directed by Jerry Mitchell and features songs by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, "lowers the already ground-scraping bar for literal-minded adaptations of film to stage."
877-250-2929, prettywomanthemusical.com
'THE PROM' at the Longacre Theater (closes on Aug. 11). This winning musical comedy, by Bob Martin, Chad Beguelin and Matthew Sklar, has its last dance. According to Jesse Green, this "joyful hoot," about a quartet of Broadway vets who descend on the heartland to help a teenage lesbian, "makes you believe in musical comedy again."
212-239-6200, theprommusical.com
'TONI STONE' at the Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater (closes on Aug. 11). Lydia R. Diamond's play, about the first female professional baseball player, prepares for its last at-bat. Reviewing Pam MacKinnon's production, Jesse Green praised April Matthis's home-run performance and Diamond's script. The play, he wrote, is "at its considerable best whenever, like its main character, it's at its most unconventional."

Texto completo: Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein began selling off personal real estate about six months before the publication of two articles that enumerated a flood of sexual-misconduct allegations against him, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of property records and people familiar with the transactions.
The purge resulted in the sale of six homes by Mr. Weinstein between October 2017 and April 2018 for an estimated total of $55.9 million. Another one of his homes is now on the market. And in April 2019, he sold a commercial office space he owned with his brother and Weinstein Co. co-founder Robert. Robert Weinstein didn't respond to requests for comment.
Leslie Cohen closed on her purchase of one of Mr. Weinstein's Connecticut homes just three days before the publication of a New York Times article detailing his alleged sexual misconduct. She said that when she saw the article, she was upset and felt "deceived" that no one involved in the transaction warned her what was about to happen. Agents involved in the deal said they didn't know about the article.
Mr. Weinstein is scheduled to go on criminal trial in New York on Sept. 9. Prosecutors have accused him of raping a woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on another woman in 2006. Mr. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex. His lawyers are negotiating an approximately $45 million settlement that would resolve sexual-misconduct lawsuits against Mr. Weinstein.
The residential sales yielded an estimated $17.8 million more than the purchase prices paid by Mr. Weinstein, according to public records. The commercial office space brought $5 million more than the price the Weinstein brothers paid. The home Ms. Cohen bought in October 2017 sold for almost twice what Mr. Weinstein paid for it. But his Amagansett home, which he listed in April 2017, sold in November 2017 at a $1.65 million loss. Two of Mr. Weinstein's residential properties and the commercial office condo sold for below market value, according to local agents, but combined, they still garnered a hefty return for Mr. Weinstein.
Such a flurry of sales isn't unprecedented, especially following a death, divorce or bankruptcy, said Andrew S. Whiteley, an agent at William Raveis. But Mr. Weinstein's move to sell so many properties is much rarer. "I've never seen anyone do that," said Christoper Riccio, a New York-based real-estate agent.
A spokesman for Mr. Weinstein declined to comment on any of his specific real-estate transactions and said, "This is nothing other than Harvey Weinstein consolidating his property ownership to help make his divorce settlement a smoother matter, and to pay his legal counsel."
Here is a timeline of the sale of Mr. Weinstein's properties and of some of his legal and business complications.
APRIL 2, 2017 LISTED
Property: Hamptons family home
Location: Amagansett, N.Y.
Purchased: $11.65 million in 2014 with then-wife Georgina Chapman, co-founder of the fashion label Marchesa. Ms. Chapman didn't respond to requests for comment.

What: 2 bedrooms, 1,100 square feet
At the time the property was listed, it was being rented by actress Jennifer Hudson, said Scott Gorelick, of Compass, the eventual buyer's agent. Ms. Hudson's representatives didn't respond to a request for comment.

According to court documents, Mr. Weinstein shared the proceeds of the sale with his first wife, Eve Chilton. Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Chilton, his former assistant, were married from 1987 to 2004 and have three children. Ms. Chilton couldn't be reached for comment.
Buyer: Leslie Cohen, a Westport designer and developer
"I don't know if I would have bought it at all," said Ms. Cohen, who closed on the purchase three days before the New York Times article was published.
Fate of the home: Ms. Cohen sold it in June 2018 for $1.425 million to the next-door neighbors, New York physician Arturo Constantiner and his wife, Caren Constantiner. Dr. Constantiner said their decision to purchase the house wasn't impacted by Mr. Weinstein's prior ownership of the property, but he thought Ms. Cohen paid too much for it. According to Westport building permits, the Constantiners demolished the home in the fall of 2018. The lot is vacant.
OCTOBER 5, 2017
The New York Times article is published.
The article "came as a surprise to everybody, including us. Everybody took a deep breath and thought, 'I hope we can move this,'" said Beate V. Moore, Sotheby's International Realty, one of the listing agents for Mr. Weinstein's Hamptons family home.
OCTOBER 8, 2017
Weinstein Co.'s board of directors fires Mr. Weinstein. He retains his ownership equity.

Loss:$1.65 million

Property: Westport, Conn., family home

What: 8 bedrooms in main house, plus two additional homes, 6 acres, main house renovated in mid-1990s for roughly $1.2 million, movie theater.
Mr. Weinstein kept the property in the divorce from Ms. Chilton and married Ms. Chapman there in 2007, with a fireworks display launched from a barge on Long Island Sound. In 2012, the couple held a fundraiser on the property for President Barack Obama's re-election.
Buyer: Andrew Bentley, who owns at least two other homes on Beachside Avenue. He didn't respond to requests for comment.
Fate of the home: The terms of the deal allowed Mr. Weinstein to continue living on the property until February 2019, Mr. Weinstein's lawyers said in court. Mr. Bentley has applied to demolish all three structures on the property. As of late July, the two smaller structures had been torn down, but the main house was still standing. Andrew S. Whiteley, of William Raveis, a local broker who wasn't involved in the sale, says he has spoken with Mr. Bentley about his plans, which are to resell the lots with either one or two spec houses on them.
"It isn't what modern buyers are looking for. There is probably some stigma to owning Harvey's house," said Mr. Whiteley, on why the homes are being demolished.

Texto completo: Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein began selling off personal real estate about six months before the publication of two articles that enumerated a flood of sexual-misconduct allegations against him, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of property records and people familiar with the transactions.
The purge resulted in the sale of six homes by Mr. Weinstein between October 2017 and April 2018 for an estimated total of $55.9 million. Another one of his homes is for sale. And in April 2019, he sold a commercial office space he owned with his brother and Weinstein Co. co-founder Robert. Robert Weinstein didn't respond to requests for comment.
Leslie Cohen closed on her purchase of one of Mr. Weinstein's Connecticut homes just three days before the publication of a New York Times article detailing his alleged sexual misconduct. She said that when she saw the article, she was upset and felt "deceived" that no one involved in the transaction warned her what was about to happen. Agents involved in the deal said they didn't know about the article.
Mr. Weinstein is scheduled to go on criminal trial in New York on Sept. 9. Prosecutors have accused him of raping a woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on another woman in 2006. Mr. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex. His lawyers are negotiating an approximately $45 million settlement that would resolve sexual-misconduct lawsuits against Mr. Weinstein.
The residential sales yielded an estimated $17.8 million more than the purchase prices paid by Mr. Weinstein, according to public records. The commercial office space brought $5 million more than the price the Weinstein brothers paid. The home Ms. Cohen bought in October 2017 sold for almost twice what Mr. Weinstein paid for it. But his Amagansett home, which he listed in April 2017, sold in November 2017 at a $1.65 million loss. Two of Mr. Weinstein's residential properties and the commercial office condo sold for below market value, according to local agents, but combined, they still garnered a hefty return for Mr. Weinstein.
Such a flurry of sales isn't unprecedented, especially following a death, divorce or bankruptcy, said Andrew S. Whiteley, an agent at William Raveis. But Mr. Weinstein's move to sell so many properties is much rarer. "I've never seen anyone do that," said Christoper Riccio, a New York-based real-estate agent.
A spokesman for Mr. Weinstein declined to comment on any of his specific real-estate transactions and said, "This is nothing other than Harvey Weinstein consolidating his property ownership to help make his divorce settlement a smoother matter, and to pay his legal counsel."
Here is a timeline of the sale of Mr. Weinstein's properties and of some of his legal and business complications.

Fate of the home: Ms. Cohen sold it in June 2018 for $1.425 million to the next-door neighbors, New York physician Arturo Constantiner and his wife, Caren Constantiner. Dr. Constantiner said their decision to purchase the house wasn't impacted by Mr. Weinstein's prior ownership of the property, but he thought Ms. Cohen paid too much for it. According to Westport building permits, the Constantiners demolished the home in the fall of 2018. The lot is vacant.
October 5, 2017
The New York Times article is published.
The article "came as a surprise to everybody, including us. Everybody took a deep breath and thought, 'I hope we can move this,'" said Beate V. Moore, Sotheby's International Realty, one of the listing agents for Mr. Weinstein's Hamptons family home.
October 8, 2017

Texto completo: In the spring of 2016, writer Casey McQuiston, then 25 years old, was driving on the I-10 highway in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when an idea for a novel came to her. Then came the presidential election. The Louisiana native, now 28, says she had to quickly "grapple with a world that was [now] different than we thought it was." So she set her book aside for eight months. After a trip to Norway, away from news back home, she picked it up again and finished a first draft about six months later. The result is Red, White & Royal Blue, a romantic comic novel about political figures that became an unlikely New York Times bestseller.
Set in a world in which a female Democrat from Texas wins the presidency in 2016, Red, White & Royal Blue chronicles the illicit romance between the president's son, Georgetown senior Alex Claremont-Diaz (Dad is a Mexican-American senator), and Prince Henry of Wales, his childhood nemesis. The book leverages an old romantic comedy trope: the fake relationship that becomes true love. ("Oh my God," says Alex's sister June in the book, "this is like all those romantic comedies where the girl hires a male escort to pretend to be her wedding date and then falls in love with him for real.") After ruining a royal wedding, Alex and Henry are forced to act out a friendship for the press, and they slowly warm to each other, developing a passionate relationship. Alex comes to terms with his bisexuality and Henry struggles with family pressure to stay closeted.
Much of the book's charm comes from Alex and Henry's banter, which, even in the depths of romance, always has a sardonic edge. "You have a lot of moles," Alex texts Henry. "Is that a result of the inbreeding?" Several reviews incorporate the world "melt." Comments on Goodreads are rabid. "*Cries in gay,*" writes one reviewer. "Alex and Henry forever and ever (and ever and ever and ever)."
For the book's publisher, the commercial response has been a surprise. Anne Marie Tallberg, a vice president at St. Martin's Press, a subsidiary of publishing giant MacMillan, says that Red, White & Royal Blue has been through seven printings, with three done prior to publication. While she declined to provide exact sales numbers, she characterized the book's success as massive against expectations and, with 100,000 copies in circulation, powered solely by word of mouth.
"There was no Target book club selection or, you know, Reese Witherspoon's book club or anything like that driving this," Tallberg says. "This was purely the power of everyday folks who champion books and a novel that can uplift our spirits—this was precisely the right book that everyone needed to read at this point in time. And that's what drove it onto the [bestseller] list."
"It gives me chills, because that's why we're all in this business," she says.
The novel was initially acquired by Vicki Lame, a veteran editor at St. Martin's Press and Wednesday Books who works in both young adult and adult fiction (McQuiston particularly appreciated that Lame, like protagonist Alex Claremont-Diaz, is from Texas). She read a manuscript McQuiston's literary agent Sara Megibow had initially submitted to another colleague and was quickly hooked. "Ultimately when I started reading, I was like, 'Ah, whatever. A book with royals,' " Lame says in a phone interview. "But then I started reading it and I couldn't stop. I was up way too late. As soon as I finished it the next day, all I wanted to do was start reading it again. Essentially before I'd even, I think, finalized the deal, I had reread the book five times—because I just loved it."
"Everyone else was as obsessed as I was," she adds. "It was unlike anything I've ever seen, frankly. I was getting Gchats from colleagues throughout the day who couldn't manage to put the book down to do their work."
McQuiston, Lame and Tallberg all agree that the news plays a role in the appeal; the fictional backdrop of a less divided country where there still might be homophobia and predation but where one of the biggest international news stories during an election year is about a ruined wedding cake.
"For people who didn't see the election go the way they wanted, I think this book is a lot of things," Lame says. "I think it's an alternate reality."
McQuiston was inspired by both the caustic humor of Veep and the warm tone of Parks and Recreation, a show in which public servants are depicted as truly wanting to help their constituents. "I think a lot of people right now are really desperate to connect or reconnect with hope," she says.
The fact that Red, White & Royal Blue's romance centers on a queer couple has also struck a chord with readers. After Lame began sending out galleys within the publishing industry, she says she received "some of the longest, most heartfelt, wonderful emails about the book, because people were really feeling seen for the first time."
"Alex finally realizes in the book that he is bisexual, because he hasn't had the bandwidth or the time or the space to realize it within the life that he leads," Lame says. "I think there's not a ton of books out there featuring a main character who is bisexual. I think people were like, 'Oh, my God, finally.'"
But the author adds that while she tends to engage the most with queer young people, she's been surprised by the diversity of the book's readership (her "Maw Maw" is currently engrossed in the book). "I am shocked the way that this has had the ability to transcend demographics," she says. "I've heard from so many different types of people. I've had people at my events from 80-year-old men who just happened to be in the bookstore at the time and decided to sit down for the talk to any kind of young queer person."
Tallberg describes the reader profile as anyone who loves to read "something that I've called 'uplift lit,' where it's going to put a smile on your face."
The book was optioned prior to publication by Amazon Studios and Berlanti Productions, and McQuiston feels it can join the ranks of similar romantic comedies that center on representation. "People are really, really hungry for diversity and for representation in what they're consuming right now," she says. "That's why we're seeing the biggest rom-coms right now with things like Crazy Rich Asians or To All the Boys I've Loved Before or Love, Simon. These things that [depict] loving people who don't get to usually be centered in these big fairy tale stories."

Texto completo: New York Times Co. stock fell sharply Wednesday as the publisher warned digital advertising revenue was expected to decline in the current quarter.
The company estimates digital advertising revenue will decrease by a high-single-digit percentage in the third quarter, while digital-only subscription revenue will increase by a percentage in the midteens.
The warning comes as the New York Times reported second-quarter net income of $25.2 million, or 15 cents a share, up 6.7% from $23.6 million, or 14 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted operating profit fell 6.4% to $55.6 million, and adjusted earnings from continuing operations were flat at 17 cents a share.
Revenue increased 5.2% to $436.3 million, driven by gains in subscription revenue as well as growth in advertising revenue and revenue from the television series "The Weekly" and growth from commercial printing operations.
Analysts polled by FactSet expected adjusted earnings of 15 cents a share on revenue of $439.5 million.
"While profitability declined in the quarter, that is in large part a result of continued investment into growing our subscription business," Chief Executive Mark Thompson said.
Shares of the New York Times closed 12% lower at $31.25. The stock is still up by more than 40% since the beginning of the year.
On an investor call, Mr. Thompson said the company had posted strong digital advertising growth since the third quarter of last year, making comparisons less forgiving. He also said the Times' digital-advertising business was increasingly focused on large, long-term partnerships with big brands that would partly cushion against quarterly variations in digital-advertising revenue.
Mr. Thompson also said that the publisher was making "steady progress toward our goal of reaching 10 million total subscriptions by 2025."
Digital subscription growth slowed 12% from the first quarter. The New York Times added 197,000 net new digital-only subscriptions, including 131,000 from its core news product and the remaining 66,000 from its cooking and crossword offerings. The Times added 223,000 digital subscribers in the first quarter, 79,000 of which were for the lower-cost cooking and crossword apps.
The Times said it ended the quarter with 3.78 million paid digital subscribers.
Including print subscribers, the Times had 4.7 million paying customers at the end of the quarter.
Subscription revenue rose 3.8%, with much of the growth coming from digital-only products.
Advertising revenue was up 1.3% at $120.8 million. Revenue from digital advertising rose 14% to $58 million, while print advertising revenue fell 8% to $62.7 million.
Operating costs rose 6.7% to $398.3 million, reflecting higher content costs and other costs related to labor, commercial printing and advertising.

Resumen: Felicity Huffman plays an empty-nester mom in Netflix's "Otherhood." But where does Huffman legally stand now in the college admissions scandal?

Texto completo: Empty-nester mom movie "Otherhood" starring Felicity Huffman is finally hitting Netflix.
Pushed back from its original spring release due to the brouhaha surrounding Huffman's involvement in the college admissions scandal, "Otherhood" finally premieres on the streaming service Friday.
The film follows three moms – Huffman as Helen, Angela Bassett as Carol and Patricia Arquette as Gillian – as they struggle being left behind after their adult children begin to lead their own lives.
The friends don't quite know how to handle things now that they're "others" instead of mothers. The three women pack up and surprise their sons – who forget them on Mother's Day! – with a visit to New York.
"You know who you are without me," Carol tells her son. "I need to figure out who I am without you. "
Here's what you should know about "Otherhood," and where Huffman's legal charges stand right now.
'A heart that is bigger than the sun': Felicity Huffman has been 'humbled' by the college admissions scandal, says Eva Longoria
'Beginning rather than an ending'
In the film, Carol, a widow, decides she needs some time to figure out who she is when she's not a mother, and temporarily moves in with her son Matt (Sinqua Walls), a successful art director. He's not overly happy about it.
The movie is about the mothers' relationships with their sons, their deep friendship with each other, but also with themselves and what they want out of life, said executive producer Cindy Chupack.
"The women need to figure out who they are in this stage beyond motherhood – otherhood – which might be a beginning rather than an ending," Chupack told TV Insider.
Stars speak out on Huffman's scandal
The movie production wrapped before the story broke about the scandal. But more recently her co-stars praised how Huffman handled being accused of paying $15,000 to have her daughter's SAT answers corrected.
While doing press for the movie, Arquette said she believes her co-star is "sincerely truly sorry. "
"I think she dealt with it the best way that you can deal with it, but I know she's probably carrying a lot of shame and guilt," Arquette told Entertainment Tonight.
Bassett told The New York Times, "We all make mistakes. None of us is perfect. I think Felicity handled these unfortunate circumstances in a mature, responsible way. She held herself accountable and didn’t make excuses for her decisions, and I can only respect that. "
Before the scandal broke, Huffman shared her thoughts with Entertainment Tonight on being a mother on the set of "Otherhood" and said that done right, "you work yourself right out of a job. "
"If you do it badly and you've damaged your kids enough they're going to need you your whole life," Huffman said.
What's the status of Huffman's legal case in the college admissions scandal?
In May, a tearful Huffman pleaded guilty to charges in the nation's largest college admissions scandal, becoming the highest-profile defendant to admit to crimes in the blockbuster case. She is scheduled to be sentenced September 13 in federal court in Boston.
The 56-year-old actress pleaded to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud for paying $15,000 to have someone secretly and illegally correct her older daughter’s SAT answers. As part of the plea deal, federal prosecutors recommended she get a four-month prison sentence, substantially lower than the maximum of 20 years the charges carry.

Trump Visits Shooting Victims, Dismisses Critics; The president reiterated intention to craft legislative response to mass shootings together with Congress

Texto completo: President Trump met with victims in the first stop of his daylong trip to Ohio and Texas in the wake of last weekend's mass shootings, while again floating legislative responses and calling critics of his rhetoric political opportunists.
The president first traveled to Dayton, Ohio, where a gunman on Sunday killed nine people and injured more than two dozen . He then headed to El Paso, Texas, where a suspect is accused of killing 22 people and injuring 24 , allegedly motivated by anti-immigrant feelings.
"I think my rhetoric brings people together," the president told reporters as he left the White House for his trip, dismissing accusations that his often-combative language on immigration and other issues has sowed national divisions or encouraged violence.
Share Your Thoughts
How should the White House respond to calls for lawmakers to act on gun measures? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Trump said he was concerned about hate groups of any ideology. "I am very concerned about it. And I'll do something about it."
The president told reporters he is working with members of Congress to come up with a response to the shootings, expressing optimism that progress can be made on background checks, and indicated he would use his influence to persuade reluctant lawmakers to act.
"I'm looking to do background checks. I think background checks are important," he said, without providing specifics. The White House didn't respond to a request for clarification on what Mr. Trump's plans are on background checks. Mr. Trump has previously vowed to veto legislation, passed by the Democratic House, that would broaden background checks.
Mr. Trump also said Wednesday he hopes to restrict mentally ill people's access to guns, through "red-flag" laws. He poured cold water on calls to ban assault-style weapons, however. "I can tell you there is no political appetite for that at this moment," he said.
An earlier assault-weapons ban expired in 2004. Since then, the measure hasn't garnered enough support to be reinstated despite repeated efforts by Democrats. The last time the Senate voted on an assault-weapons ban was in 2013, when Democrats controlled the chamber, and it fell well short of passage, garnering just 40 votes amid heavy Democratic defections and the support of just one Republican.
Democrats have pressed to revive the assault-weapons ban, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has opposed the effort in the past and hasn't indicated he would allow such a bill to the floor. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) has 30 co-sponsors—all Democrats—for a current bill to ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. A similar House bill has 196 co-sponsors, all of them Democrats.
An NPR/PBS News/Marist Poll taken in mid-July found that 57% of adults thought it was a good idea to "ban the sale of semi-automatic assault guns such as the AK-47 or AR-15."
In recent days, top Democrats have emphasized background-checks legislation, which is seen as having more bipartisan support.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday that Democrats will reject Republican efforts to pursue red-flag laws without passing universal background-checks legislation.
"We Democrats are not going to settle for half-measures so Republicans can feel better and try to push the issue of gun violence off to the side," Mr. Schumer said.
The House passed a background-checks bill earlier this year, and Democrats have demanded a vote in the Senate.
In Dayton, the White House said Mr. Trump met with shooting survivors and their families as well as medical staff at Miami Valley Hospital. Mr. Trump made no public remarks at the hospital.
Several hundred protesters stood outside the hospital chanting.
Marilan Moir, a high-school teacher in Dayton, said she came to support gun legislation more than to protest the president. She said she wants to get assault-style weapons out of the hands of civilians and supports background checks and tightening rules for purchases at gun shows.
"I'm putting heat on gun reform," Ms. Moir said, standing near a 20-foot tall inflatable depicting Mr. Trump as a baby. "Unbelievably, I feel that things are finally starting to move."
Another onlooker, Angela Wilcox, said she came with her son, who carried a Trump flag, and her daughter to back the president.
"He should be here at a time of grieving to show his support," Ms. Wilcox said.
Earlier in the day, the president took a swipe at former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, calling him a "pretty incompetent guy." Mr. Biden used a Wednesday afternoon appearance in Iowa to suggest that President Trump is responsible for mass shootings in Texas and elsewhere because he has boosted white nationalism.
Other Democratic candidates have argued the same point, including Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso, whom Mr. Trump attacked ahead of his visit to Texas.
"Beto (phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage) O'Rourke, who is embarrassed by my last visit to the Great State of Texas, where I trounced him, and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1% in the Democrat Primary, should respect the victims & law enforcement - & be quiet!" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter just before midnight.
The president also sought to highlight that the alleged Dayton shooter apparent supported Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the antifa movement, though authorities haven't determined a motive in the shooting.

The White House also has invited tech companies to a staff-level meeting on Friday to discuss "violent extremism online," according to White House spokesman Judd Deere. The meeting will include senior administration officials and "representatives of a range of companies," though the White House didn't name the officials or the companies that have been invited. The president isn't expected to attend.
Mr. Trump, in his Monday speech on the shootings, called on the Justice Department to work with social-media companies to "develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike."

Texto completo: Lawyers bringing a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America said Tuesday they believe they've turned up allegations of sexual abuse against more than 350 people not previously identified in files released by the organization.
Attorneys with the Abused in Scouting group filed a lawsuit Monday in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court, alleging a one-time scout leader sexually abused a minor identified only by initials.
The suit alleges that the abuse of the then-12- or 13-year-old victim by an assistant scout leader began in 1974 or 1975 and continued until about 1980.
It also says that the lawyers received allegations of abuse from their clients against more than 350 people involved with the scouts who had not previously been named.
The Irving, Texas-based scouts compiled so-called ineligible volunteer files for years on people considered to pose a risk of abuse, and about 5,000 of these files have been made public as a result of court action.
Monday's suit is claiming that the lawyers now have hundreds of names that were not in those public files. It does not list the names.
An email message seeking comment was sent to the Boy Scouts.
The lawsuit comes as states have begun changing their statutes of limitations to make it easier for long-ago victims of sexual assault can seek damages in court.
The Boy Scouts have said previously that when any volunteer is added to the database for suspected abuse, "they are reported to law enforcement, removed entirely from any Scouting and prohibited from rejoining anywhere."
China vows to counter if US places midrange arms in Asia
BEIJING - China said Tuesday that it "will not stand idly by" and will take countermeasures if the U.S. deploys intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, which Washington has said it plans to do within months.
The statement from the director of the Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department, Fu Cong, follows the U.S. withdrawal last week from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a move Fu said would have a "direct negative impact on the global strategic stability" as well as security in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
Fu also advised other nations, particularly South Korea, Japan and Australia, to "exercise prudence" and not allow the United States to deploy such weapons on their territory, saying that would "not serve the national security interests of these countries."
Court allows Palin's lawsuit against NY Times to proceed
NEW YORK - The New York Times Co. must face a defamation lawsuit by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin over a 2017 editorial that linked her to the 2011 shooting of Sen. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a federal appeals court said.
The ruling is a win for the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, though the court said the bar remains high for Palin ultimately to prevail in the case.
The 21-page decision, which reinstated a lawsuit dismissed by a lower-court judge, is largely procedural, with the New York-based appeals court saying Palin's complaint "plausibly states a claim for defamation."
But it now allows her lawyers to obtain documents from The New York Times Co. and also question editorial page editor James Bennet.
Peter Strzok sues FBI for firing him over anti-Trump texts
WASHINGTON - A veteran FBI agent who wrote derogatory text messages about Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday charging the bureau caved to "unrelenting pressure" from the president when it fired him.
The suit from Peter Strzok also alleges he was unfairly punished for expressing his political opinions, and that the Justice Department violated his privacy when it shared hundreds of his text messages with reporters.
"This campaign to publicly vilify Special Agent Strzok contributed to the FBI's ultimate decision to unlawfully terminate him," the lawsuit says.
The complaint revisits a political drama that was seized on by conservative critics of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump.
US envoy to Russia Jon Huntsman to resign post
WASHINGTON - Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, is resigning from the diplomatic post he has held for almost two years, a period marked by growing confrontation and friction between Moscow and Washington.
In a resignation letter sent Tuesday to President Donald Trump, Huntsman characterized his tenure as a "historically difficult" time in bilateral relations. He will depart Oct. 3.
Huntsman had resigned during his second term as Utah governor in 2009 and became the U.S. ambassador to China under the Obama administration. He left that post two years later for an unsuccessful run for president. When he became ambassador to Moscow, he said he would take the job for two years.
In his resignation letter Huntsman, 59, said he wanted to return "to reconnect with our growing family and responsibilities."
Trump, RNC challenge California law on tax returns
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits Tuesday against California officials, challenging a new law that would bar Trump from appearing on the state's primary ballot next year if he declines to disclose his tax returns.
The federal lawsuits, which were threatened last week when Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill into law, argue that the measure requiring presidential and gubernatorial candidates to release five years of tax returns runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution.
Newsom responded on Twitter to the lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento: "There's an easy fix Mr. President - release your tax returns as you promised during the campaign and follow the precedent of every president since 1973."
In Britain: A youth court in London ordered a teenager held on an attempted murder charge Tuesday for allegedly throwing a 6-year-old boy from a viewing area at the top of the British capital's Tate Modern museum.
The French boy was a short distance from his parents Sunday when he was picked up and thrown over the railing of the 10th-floor observation deck.
The police said other museum visitors stopped a 17-year-old British citizen from leaving until officers arrived, and that the two boys had no prior connection.
The 6-year-old is hospitalized in critical but stable condition with a sustained brain bleed and fractures to his spine, legs and arms.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: 'If you see something, say something' applies to white nationalists, too

Texto completo: The 2,300-word "manifesto" believed to have been written by the young man responsible for the massacre in El Paso on Saturday is not a rant. It is not a screed.
However twisted, it is a relatively cogent description of a belief system that justifies mass murder in the name of race and ethnicity. "This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas," reads the second sentence in the document entitled "The Inconvenient Truth About Me."
Some omissions are worth noting. African Americans are not referenced directly -- only immigrants and brown people. More important, God receives only two lower-case mentions. Once as a curse. And that struck a chord with me.
In late 2015, ISIS was at the height its geographic reach in the Middle East, stretching toward Baghdad in Iraq and eating up much of northern Syria. On the internet, young American Muslims were being targeted by Islamic State recruiters. One Georgia teenager had taken the bait and was caught trying to enter Syria.
Earlier in the year, a 24-yearold American Muslim had shot and killed four U.S. Marines and a sailor at a Navy reserve facility in Chattanooga. That December, FBI Director James Comey and his agency had finally concluded that Mohammad Abdulazeez had been "motivated by foreign terrorist organization propaganda."
And so on New Year's Day in 2016, I was at Masjid al Furqan -- West Cobb Islamic Center to hear Arshad Anwar, an imam from Roswell. Anwar was a practiced debunker of radical ideology, and had developed a lecture on how parents could keep their teenagers from falling for the darkness offered via social media.
Federal law enforcement authorities now say white nationalists on the internet are using the same jihadist tactics now that Anwar warned against three years ago.
Both promise an ideal society achieved through violent martyrdom. "Purity" -- whether racial or religious -- is a mutual goal. Forbidden viral videos are a common tool. ISIS had its beheadings. White nationalists now have the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter with a helmet camera.
One thing in particular that Anwar told the congregants three years ago has stuck with me. "The targets are people who don't know much about their religion, converts who have problem with their parents or friends at home," the imam said. They were the ones most easily talked into blasphemy.
The established religions of white America deserve no pass when it comes to matters of race or ethnicity. But they do express ideals that, if adhered to, can serve as guardrails. So can family. And the right friends.
The El Paso shooter's guardrails -- the foundations of his personal theology -- apparently were "The Great Replacement," a 2017 book alleging "white genocide," and perhaps Thanos from the "Avengers" movie series. "If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable," the shooter allegedly wrote.
But there is an important difference between what we're facing now, and what those at Masjid al Furqan were dealing with in 2016.
We like to say that we don't believe in collective guilt, but the people in that mosque understood that a single off-kilter young man -- or woman -- who digested the wrong kind of internet tripe could put their entire Cobb County community at risk. Such was the hostility and suspicion they were faced with.
On Monday, after denouncing white supremacy, President Donald Trump said his administration had "asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism." One tool would be to make domestic terrorism an actual federal crime. Foreknowledge of a violent event would then create accomplices who could be charged.
"In the same way that honorable members of mosques report people who express violent designs, so, too, should people report violent white nationalists to the police," Rod Rosenstein, the former deputy U.S. attorney general, told the New York Times.
That approach would require congressional action -- which grows more unlikely as 2020 approaches. But there might be something to that end that doesn't require Congress' approval.
In the past, one reaction to these mass murders has been to consign the evil-doer to anonymity. The perpetrators have been engaged in a macabre game of one-upsmanship, the theory goes. Refuse them their infamy, and you deprive them of a motive.
I get that. But I also wonder if, by disappearing these men -- and so they nearly always are -- we are also hiding them away in a metaphorical attic, sparing the community that surrounded them the uncomfortable burden of wondering what it might have done to identify and stop them.
The alleged killer of 22 shoppers at a Walmart in El Paso on Saturday has been identified as 21-yearold Patrick Crusius of Allen, Texas.
That information is not a matter of collective guilt, but collective responsibility. Texas authorities are now pointing to a Lubbock woman who turned in another young man -- her homicidal-suicidal grandson -- last month. The inconvenient truth about Crusius is that "if you see something, say something" shouldn't just apply to people with immigrant roots. It should apply to those around murderous white nationalists, too.

Yes, Mass Shootings Are Terrorism

Texto completo: Let me do the New York Times editorial board one better: We should try to stop mass shootings even if they aren't motivated by white-nationalist ideas.
The Gray Lady this week discovered one category of mass shooting that requires invoking the powers of the modern surveillance state, the kind carried out by people who profess white racist sympathies. Its reasoning might have been taken from a column here after the 2017 Las Vegas massacre. As I put it then, Stephen Paddock would not have gotten as far as he did if, in addition to canvassing the country for large planned gatherings and hotel rooms from which to fire on them, as well as acquiring an arsenal of 47 guns and smuggling 23 into a casino suite, he'd spent 30 minutes on an al Qaeda website.
Paddock, as far as we know, did not profess white supremacy sentiments. In fact, the Las Vegas police department and the FBI, after yearlong investigations, never specified a motive.
Then again the question of motive may be a red herring. The shameless exploiters are always first out of the gate after a mass shooting, but the public and the press quickly come to see a political motive, if any, as one more symptom of a warped individuality. Extremist politics may attract such people (and exploit their vulnerabilities), but mass shootings are decidedly a psychological, not a political, phenomenon.
The Times is right, though, that mass-casualty attacks have a lot more in common with terrorism than with regular gun crimes, even in the absence of a professed ideology.
These are statement crimes: Planning and preparation are usually extensive. The individual often has long exhibited a fascination with violence and fetishization of firearms. An unraveling in the perpetrator's personal life is often a triggering factor. The copycat element is glaring. Authorities can and should monitor extremists to get a lead on potential threats, but would likely be swamped with false positives. Success will come from cross-referencing multiple indicators in real time, as only can be done in a society where so much of social activity and virtually all economic activity now leaves a digital trail. The Times might recommend ignoring any signal unrelated to white nationalism. I would not.
Also, contrary to what the paper seems to argue, the U.S. is not in the habit of overlooking homegrown racist threats. When targeting those inside the country, however, it faces legal restraints. It can't criminalize racist sentiment any more than it can Islamic sentiment. How would it be consistent with the First Amendment and other civil liberties that the Times occasionally supports to treat as terrorists people who espouse white-nationalist ideas? Many liberals promote the idea that police are systematically racist but don't want credit for political murders of police. I personally would prefer that the identity-politics genie be put back in its bottle. I don't see the left allowing it.
The big-data approach, if we could find a way to impersonally collate the flood of available information, is a strategy we might actually be able to implement. And, no, the common denominator that's likely to pay off big-time isn't racist leanings. It's an obsession with guns and killing that, along with other more timely signals, would let us interrupt mass shootings in their planning stages. The Journal reports that 40% of domestic FBI terrorist investigations involve racist motivations, and white-nationalist motivations represent a "majority" of these -- which could mean as few as 20%. Most mass shooters may be white, but not many profess political beliefs. Focusing on white nationalism may serve other needs but wouldn't likely lead to many incipient killers.
Most important is an insight the Times can't bring itself to articulate: The U.S. electorate has shown a lot more tolerance for surveillance than for gun-ownership limits. This is the place to start, and certainly more useful than gun-control proposals that either can't be enacted or would have little effect on mass shootings (such as background checks). David Frum, writing at TheAtlantic.com, notes for maybe the 1,000th time that the U.S. is the only country that lets almost anybody buy multiple guns and . . . what? He does not propose letting Germans vote in U.S. elections to create a constituency for German-style gun-control laws. The only problem he solves is his own understandable wish to have something useful to say in the wake of the horrors in Dayton and El Paso.
It would be great if social scientists could show us how, by reprogramming our national and global media, we could short-circuit the social contagion effect that clearly plays a role in mass-shooter psychology. But contagion itself is a digitally mediated phenomenon. Big-data techniques sell us everything from diapers to car insurance. They won't be uninvented. So what kind of democratic safeguards would let us more aggressively explore their policing potential? This discussion has been suppressed for too long.

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
"8chan is coming back online around the world," a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. "Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services."
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a "cesspool of hate," Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: "The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths."
The suspect in Saturday's El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled "The Inconvenient Truth," in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an "invasion" of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
"What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that," said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn't surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
"The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online," he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: "While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online."
There were reports that 8chan which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan's new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: "We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely."
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan's current owner last year.
"Shut the site down," Brennan told the Times. "It's not doing the world any good. It's a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It's a negative to them, too. They just don't realize it."
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan's owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, "We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored."
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants "invading" the United States.
"According to Facebook's ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word invasion'," tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. "Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration."

Meek Mill retrial decision rescheduled
to later this month PHILADELPHIA | A decision on whether Meek Mill will be retried in a 2007 drug and gun case was delayed until later this month after his lawyer asked a judge Tuesday for more time.
The 32-year-old rapper has been on probation most of his adult life over the teenage arrest.
He has become an activist for criminal justice reform since he was sent back to prison in 2017 for technical violations he blamed on his erratic travel schedule as his career soared. He spent five months locked up before an appeals court granted him bail.
Cyntoia Brown scheduled to leave prison after clemency
NASHVILLE, Tenn. | A woman who said she was a 16-year-old sex-trafficking victim when she killed a man in 2004 is scheduled to be released from prison this week after being granted clemency .
Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and other celebrities had lobbied for Cyntoia Brown’s release, and then-Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam agreed in January.
The now-31-year-old Brown will remain on parole supervision for 10 years after her release today, on the condition she does not violate any state or federal laws, holds a job, and participates in regular counseling sessions, Haslam’s commutation says.
Court reinstates Sarah Palin
suit against
New York Times
NEW YORK | A defamation lawsuit Sarah Palin brought against The New York Times was restored by a federal appeals court Tuesday, giving the onetime Republican vice presidential nominee an opportunity to prove her claims that the newspaper falsely accused her of inciting a mass shooting that severely wounded a congresswoman.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower-court judge tossed out the lawsuit too quickly without giving her a chance to obtain email records and other evidence that might aid her lawyers.
ABC to tackle ‘Little Mermaid’ with live production
NEW YORK | Before Disney films its live-action remake of “The Little Mermaid,” ABC will take a crack at it with a live production starring “Moana” actress Auli’i Cravalho as Ariel.
The production, to air on Nov. 5, also will star Queen Latifah as Ursula and Shaggy as Sebastian.
The music will be from the original cartoon film as well as the Tony Award-winning Broadway show.
The cartoon is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year.
Disney plans to remake the film with Halle Bailey from “Grown-ish” in the role of Ariel. Bailey is half of the sister duo Chloe x Halle.

La estricta Nueva York no escapa a los tiroteos masivos: 521 baleados este año, cifra en alza

Texto completo: Aunque los funcionarios de Nueva York condenaron pronto las nuevas masacres de civiles baleados en ataques al azar en otros estados del país el fin de semana, la ciudad tiene su propio problema de violencia armada.
Es cierto que el crimen de Nueva York está en niveles mínimos, pero ello no implica que no haya necesidad de controlar las armas.
Hace apenas unos días, el 27 de julio, un tiroteo masivo en una fiesta comunitaria en Brownsville (Brooklyn) dejó a una persona muerta y 11 heridos. Y la madrugada de ayer, en una vigilia en Crown Heights, cuatro personas más resultaron heridas de bala.
En el ínterin, el gobernador Andrew Cuomo firmó una ley que desde septiembre subirá de 3 a 30 días el período para tramitar un permiso de armas en Nueva York.
Específicamente en NYC, hay un auge de las pandillas violentas y varios inocentes han sido alcanzados por balas perdidas desde principios de junio en toda la ciudad, seis de ellos menores de edad.
Hasta el 28 de julio, 521 personas habían recibido disparos este año en la ciudad de Nueva York, en 441 incidentes, según la policía. Ello indica un alza frente a 501 personas disparadas en 413 incidentes en el mismo período en 2018.
Los disparos no se extienden de manera uniforme por toda la ciudad. Algunos recintos en Queens y Manhattan no han reportado ningún tiroteo este año. Otros han sumado muchos.
En el distrito 79 del Norte de Brooklyn, que incluye a Bedford-Stuyvesant, 24 personas han recibido disparos este año, incluidas las de la fiesta el 27 de julio donde los investigadores dijeron que varias víctimas tenían vínculos con pandillas.
Inmediatamente después de ese ataque en Brownsville, Eric Adams, presidente del condado de Brooklyn y otros más, pidieron que el hecho se etiquetara como un tiroteo masivo.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio inicialmente se resistió a llamarlo así, pero luego sí usó el término, destacó The New York Times.
“Nos hemos vuelto insensibles a la violencia armada en ciertas partes de la ciudad”, comentó Adams ayer. “Once personas en Park Avenue en Manhattan, es un tiroteo masivo y una crisis. Once personas baleadas en Park Place en Brooklyn, es un día (normal) en el vecindario”.
¿Cómo se compara el estado de Nueva York con otros en términos de leyes de armas?
Nueva York tiene una calificación A del “Giffords Law Center” para prevenir la violencia armada. El centro clasifica a Nueva York en el 6to de los 50 estados por la fuerza de sus leyes sobre armas, y el 48 de los 50 por tener una de las tasas más bajas de muertes por armas.
El Centro destaca que existe una correlación directa entre leyes más estrictas sobre armas y menos muertes. Pero los grupos pro derechos de armas creen que estas leyes penalizan a propietarios que son respetuosos de la ley.
¿Cuáles son las leyes de armas de Nueva York?
Después del tiroteo masivo en la escuela primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut en 2012, el estado de Nueva York impulsó leyes más estrictas sobre armas (The Safe Act).
Esas reglas requieren que las armas de asalto se registren cada cinco años con la policía estatal, y hacen que las verificaciones sean obligatorias. en un esfuerzo por evitar que las personas con antecedentes penales graves o enfermedades mentales compren armas.
¿Cuántos delitos se cometen con armas de fuego en el estado de Nueva York?
El año pasado, hubo 7,885 crímenes violentos cometidos con armas de fuego en Nueva York, según cifras estatales. Más de 4,200 de esos crímenes ocurrieron en los cinco distritos de la ciudad de Nueva York, con pistolas como principal arma.
Muchas de las armas usadas en esos crímenes no son de acá. Según la Fiscalía general del estado, llegan a Nueva York desde lugares que no tienen leyes tan estrictas como las locales.
While gun control advocates view no single measure as a cure-all, they see tightening background checks as one of the most basic steps to diminish gun violence. Most Americans support such efforts, polls show, but the NRA portrays them as an affront to the Second Amendment.

Yes, Mass Shootings Are Terrorism; But focusing on white nationalism or even politics would miss most of them.

Texto completo: Let me do the New York Times editorial board one better: We should try to stop mass shootings even if they aren't motivated by white-nationalist ideas.
The Gray Lady this week discovered one category of mass shooting that requires invoking the powers of the modern surveillance state, the kind carried out by people who profess white racist sympathies. Its reasoning might have been taken from a column here after the 2017 Las Vegas massacre. As I put it then, Stephen Paddock would not have gotten as far as he did if, in addition to canvassing the country for large planned gatherings and hotel rooms from which to fire on them, as well as acquiring an arsenal of 47 guns and smuggling 23 into a casino suite, he'd spent 30 minutes on an al Qaeda website.
Paddock, as far as we know, did not profess white supremacy sentiments. In fact, the Las Vegas police department and the FBI, after yearlong investigations, never specified a motive.
Then again the question of motive may be a red herring. The shameless exploiters are always first out of the gate after a mass shooting, but the public and press quickly come to see a political motive, if any, as one more symptom of a warped individuality. Extremist politics may attract such people (and exploit their vulnerabilities), but mass shootings are decidedly a psychological, not a political, phenomenon.
The Times is right, though, that mass-casualty attacks have a lot more in common with terrorism than with regular gun crimes, even in the absence of a professed ideology.
These are statement crimes: Planning and preparation are usually extensive. The individual often has long exhibited a fascination with violence and fetishization of firearms. An unraveling in the perpetrator's personal life is often a triggering factor. The copycat element is glaring. Authorities can and should monitor extremists to get a lead on potential threats, but would likely be swamped with false positives. Success will come from cross-referencing multiple indicators in real time, as only can be done in a society where so much of social activity and virtually all economic activity now leaves a digital trail. The Times might recommend ignoring any signal unrelated to white nationalism. I would not.
Also, contrary to what the paper seems to argue, the U.S. is not in the habit of overlooking homegrown racist threats. When targeting those inside the country, however, it faces legal restraints. It can't criminalize racist sentiment any more than it can Islamic sentiment. How would it be consistent with the First Amendment and other civil liberties that the Times occasionally supports to treat as terrorists people who espouse white-nationalist ideas? Many liberals promote the idea that police are systematically racist but don't want credit for political murders of police. I personally would prefer that the identity-politics genie be put back in its bottle. I don't see the left allowing it.
The big-data approach, if we could find a way to impersonally collate the flood of available information, is a strategy we might actually be able to implement. And, no, the common denominator that's likely to pay off big-time isn't racist leanings. It's an obsession with guns and killing that, along with other more timely signals, would let us interrupt mass shootings in their planning stages. The Journal reports that 40% of domestic FBI terrorist investigations involve racist motivations, and white-nationalist motivations represent a "majority" of these—which could mean as few as 20%. Most mass shooters may be white, but not many profess political beliefs. Focusing on white nationalism may serve other needs but wouldn't likely lead to many incipient killers.
Most important is an insight the Times can't bring itself to articulate: The U.S. electorate has shown a lot more tolerance for surveillance than for gun-ownership limits. This is the place to start, and certainly more useful than gun-control proposals that either can't be enacted or would have little effect on mass shootings (such as background checks). David Frum, writing at TheAtlantic.com, notes for maybe the 1,000th time that the U.S. is the only country that lets almost anybody buy multiple guns and . . . what? He does not propose letting Germans vote in U.S. elections to create a constituency for German-style gun-control laws. The only problem he solves is his own understandable wish to have something useful to say in the wake of the horrors in Dayton and El Paso.
It would be great if social scientists could show us how, by reprogramming our national and global media, we could short-circuit the social contagion effect that clearly plays a role in mass-shooter psychology. But contagion itself is a digitally mediated phenomenon. Big-data techniques sell us everything from diapers to car insurance. They won't be uninvented. So what kind of democratic safeguards would let us more aggressively explore their policing potential? This discussion has been suppressed for too long.

Another Headline the New York Times Has to Rewrite; An appeals court revives former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's lawsuit against the newspaper.

Texto completo: On Monday night the New York Times changed an accurate headline for its Tuesday print edition after some Twitter users complained that it was insufficiently critical of President Donald Trump. A new court decision on another Times story related to gun violence suggests that abandoning journalistic standards can carry a heavy price.
Monday night's early front-page Times headline , "Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism," fairly described Mr. Trump's remarks at the White House. But after various angry tweets, the next edition's headline , "Assailing Hate But Not Guns," included a subtle gripe that the President had not immediately adopted a more liberal position on gun policy in the wake of weekend shootings.
Today the paper quotes Matt Purdy, deputy managing editor at the Times, asserting that internal complaints triggered the rewrite:
We needed to deliver a nuanced message in a very small space under tight deadlines, and unfortunately, our first attempt at that did not hit it right.
When a group of top editors received an email with the first edition of the front page last night, we saw the headline, realized that it was not a good one and decided to change it. It's not uncommon for our masthead editors to adjust headlines as we go.
As this conversation was happening among Times editors, readers began discussing the initial headline on Twitter. They rightly pointed out that the initial headline didn't reflect the story accurately.
Mr. Purdy's explanation seems plausible given the way Times reporters covered the Trump remarks, but readers were flat wrong if they thought the first headline was an inaccurate description of those remarks.
In any case, the headlines still to be written about another controversy are likely of much greater concern at the Times. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit revived former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's 2017 defamation lawsuit against the newspaper. Specifically, the court has vacated a district judge's dismissal of her case.
Joseph Rago Memorial Fellowship for Excellence in Journalism
Matthew Taylor King named the 2019 recipient of the Joseph Rago Memorial Fellowship for Excellence in Journalism.
Mrs. Palin sued the newspaper after it falsely accused her political organization of inspiring a shooting. In a June 14, 2017 editorial following James Hodgkinson's attempted assassination of Republican legislators, the Times recycled a bogus claim that Mrs. Palin's political action committee had incited Jared Loughner to shoot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in a 2011 attack that also wounded others and killed six.
This fake news about Mrs. Palin had been thoroughly debunked years earlier. The smear relied on a map published by her SarahPAC showing crosshairs on various congressional districts, including Ms. Giffords', that Republicans wanted to flip to the GOP column. But there was no evidence that Loughner had ever seen the map and his obsession with Ms. Giffords had begun years before.
The Times later amended its editorial to acknowledge there was no link between Mrs. Palin and the 2011 shooting. But the Times continued to mention her in a story about horrific events to which she had no connection. Even after acknowledging errors, the paper opted for a more subtle smear.
It was the initial falsehood before the Times corrected its editorial that generated the Palin lawsuit. Federal Judge Jed Rakoff dismissed the suit in 2017 after hearing testimony from Times editorial page editor James Bennet. The judge concluded that the Timesman was credible in explaining that honest mistakes led to the false charge against Mrs. Palin.
But the appeals court says that judging the credibility of a witness is the job of a jury, not a judge considering a motion to dismiss. According to the appellate court, "the district court's opinion relied on credibility determinations not permissible at any stage before trial."
The decision of the appeals court lays out the key question which can now be addressed:
Under New York law... "a public figure plaintiff must prove that an allegedly libelous statement was made with actual malice, that is, made 'with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.'"
... When actual malice in making a defamatory statement is at issue, the critical question is the state of mind of those responsible for the publication. Because the Times identified Bennet as the author of the editorial, it was his state of mind that was relevant to the actual malice determination.
The appellate judges make clear that they take no position on the merits of former Gov. Palin's claim, but that she has at least a plausible claim which enables the suit to go forward. The appellate decision states:
The [Palin lawsuit] alleges that, from 2006 to 2016, Bennet was the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, where "he was responsible for the content of, reviewed, edited and approved the publication of numerous articles confirming there was no link between Mrs. Palin and Loughner's shooting."
... By crediting Bennet's testimony, the district court rejected a permissible inference from the articles: that one who had risen to editor-in-chief at The Atlantic knew their content and thus that there was no connection between Palin and the Loughner shooting...
The [Palin complaint] also includes allegations suggesting that Bennet in particular was more likely than the average editor-in-chief to know the truth about the Loughner shooting because he had reason to be personally hostile toward Palin, her political party, and her pro-gun stance. Bennet's brother, a Democrat, had served as a United States Senator for Colorado since 2009. In 2010, Senator Bennet was endorsed by two House members whose districts had been targeted by the SarahPAC map. Two days before the Loughner shooting, a man threatened to open fire on Senator Bennet's offices, and thereafter both Bennet brothers became "outspoken advocate[s] for gun control." Also, during the 2016 election, Palin endorsed Senator Bennet's opponent and Representative Giffords endorsed Senator Bennet.
The appellate judges add: "Palin's allegations are relevant to the credibility of Bennet's testimony that he was unaware of facts published on his watch relating to the Loughner shooting and that he made a mistake when he connected Palin... Palin's allegations present a plausible inference that Bennet's claim of memory loss is untrue."
Thanks to another Times writer who had written a more sensible draft of the editorial before Mr. Bennet went to work on it, its initial publication online actually hyperlinked to a story debunking the Times claim. According to the appellate decision:
The Times argues that the hyperlink shows the absence of malice. But the [Palin lawsuit] alleges that, by including a hyperlink that contradicted the argument of his editorial, Bennet "willfully disregarded the truth."
The district court, siding with the Times, concluded that including the hyperlinked article was further evidence of simple mistake. After crediting Bennet's testimony that he did not read the hyperlinked article, the district judge concluded that a mistake was the only plausible explanation. But the inclusion of the hyperlinked article gives rise to more than one plausible inference, and any inference to be drawn from the inclusion of the hyperlinked article was for the jury—not the court. In any event, under these circumstances, it was arguably reckless for Bennet to hyperlink an article that he did not read.
Now a jury may decide whether Mr. Bennet was reckless. However the lawsuit is resolved, this case seems to be an argument for some crowd-sourcing of editorial judgments on Twitter rather than always entrusting them to Times editors.

Texto completo: A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled that former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin can proceed with a defamation lawsuit against the New York Times over a 2017 editorial that suggested the Republican politician had helped incite political violence.
Overturning a lower-court ruling , the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Ms. Palin had plausibly alleged that the Times had defamed her when it published an editorial—since corrected—suggesting she had helped incite the 2011 assassination attempt against former Democratic Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
The appeals court didn't weigh in on the merits of the lawsuit.
The dispute now returns to the district court to move ahead with the discovery phrase.
Lawyers for Ms. Palin, praised Tuesday's ruling. "This is—and has always been—a case about media accountability," attorneys Kenneth Turkel and Elizabeth Locke said in a statement. "We look forward to starting discovery and ultimately proceeding to trial."
"We are disappointed in the decision and intend to continue to defend the action vigorously," a Times representative said.
In 2017, the Times published the unsigned editorial June 14, hours after an anti-Republican gunman seriously wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) and injured three others at a congressional baseball practice outside Washington, D.C.
Titled "America's Lethal Politics," the editorial discussed the earlier shooting of Ms. Giffords, citing an ad circulated by Ms. Palin's former political-action committee during the 2010 midterm elections that superimposed crosshairs over Democratic House districts, including the former congresswoman's.
"The link to political incitement was clear," stated a later-deleted line from the piece.
The editorial said Ms. Palin's website "put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs."
By June 16, the paper had posted two corrections. One clarified that the crosshairs didn't cover individual Democratic lawmakers, rather just the locations of their districts. The Times also said the editorial had "incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting" of Ms. Giffords.
Ms. Palin's lawsuit said the Times's corrections—and an apology to readers tweeted by its editorial board—were "woefully insufficient" and alleged that the paper knew the defamatory statements were false or "willfully disregarded the truth."
In August 2017, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff dismissed the lawsuit.
After holding an evidentiary hearing, at which the Times's editorial page editor testified, Judge Rakoff concluded that the paper's linkage between Ms. Palin and the Giffords shooting wasn't a reckless smear, but an unintended error.
In a unanimous ruling, the Second Circuit on Tuesday said Judge Rakoff had acted too hastily.
The panel ruled that a jury could plausibly conclude that editorial page editor James Bennet knew before publishing the editorial that it was false to claim that Palin or her political-action committee were connected to the Giffords shooting.
"[W]e are satisfied that Palin has met her burden to plead facts giving rise to the plausible inference that Bennet published the allegedly defamatory editorial with actual malice," wrote Circuit Judge John M. Walker Jr., a President George H.W. Bush appointee.
He continued: "We conclude by recognizing that First Amendment protections are essential to provide 'breathing space' for freedom of expression. But, at this stage, our concern is with how district courts evaluate pleadings."

Advocates say Trump condemnation of white supremacy must go beyond one speech

Texto completo: President Trump's condemnation Monday of white supremacy and bigotry following two weekend mass shootings will ring hollow unless he stops using inflammatory rhetoric himself, civil rights advocates said.
“We need the administration and Congress to treat white supremacy as a legitimate threat to our public safety," said Tanisha M. Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. “ ... We also need the president to acknowledge his role in perpetuating this violence" with his own rhetoric.
Sullivan's words were echoed by Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.
“To hear Donald Trump condemn white supremacy in such strong terms is beyond hypocritical," Beirich said Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. “ ... I think Trump needs to start with himself."
Beirich referenced Trump's prior remarks denigrating lawmakers of color, Mexican immigrants, Muslims, and majority black countries, calling those statements “dehumanizing and demonizing language" that must end.
“He can set the tenor here, if he so chooses," Beirich said. “The same goes for his colleagues in the GOP. They could also speak out against white supremacy and hatred and not engage in these divisive tactics."
Trump explicitly called out racism in Monday's speech, saying that in “one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy," adding that such “sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America."
He delivered his speech after mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Tex. killed at least 31 people. The suspect in the latter attack is believed to have posted a racist, anti-immigrant screed online prior to the rampage.
Robert Trestan, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League's New England region, said Monday that Trump used “the right words" but cautioned that more must be done.
“Those words need to be backed up with action," Trestan said. “ ... It also means not just calling out hatred, but not engaging in it."
Trump has labeled an African-American member of Congress “low IQ" and warned that illegal immigrants will “infest" the country. He also referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists" on the campaign trail and, soon after taking office, instituted a ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries entering the US, a controversial policy that the Supreme Court upheld last year.
The president's rhetoric reached a boiling point last month when he suggested that four freshmen congresswomen of color should leave the country, prompting a fierce backlash.
“I think there's a cumulative effect when you continuously dehumanize groups of people and target them," Trestan said Monday. “Some people hear his words as a call to action, and for those people it's a call to violence. So really, no speech should denigrate or dehumanize people."
Prior to his speech Monday, Trump had taken to Twitter to link the scourge of mass shootings with immigration reform.
“We cannot let those killed in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, die in vain," Trump tweeted before the speech. “Likewise for those so seriously wounded. We can never forget them, and those many who came before them. Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying ... this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform. We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!"
Those remarks, along with references in his speech to “gruesome and grisly video games" and mental illness, drew the ire of critics.
Sullivan took issue with one line from Trump's speech in particular, when he said that “mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun."
Not so, according to Sullivan.
“I would push back on that and say that racism pulled the trigger this weekend, and we need to deal with that reality," she said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Cambridge Democrat seeking her party's 2020 presidential nomination, accused Trump of conflating bigotry with poor mental health.
“White supremacy is not a mental illness," Warren tweeted. “We need to call it what it is: Domestic terrorism. And we need to call out Donald Trump for amplifying these deadly ideologies."
Congresswoman Katherine Clark, a Melrose Democrat, also zeroed in on Trump's reference to mental health.
“Then why did you roll back an Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people struggling with mental illness to purchase guns?" Clark tweeted Monday.
She continued, “The American people don't need hollow talking points. We need honesty and action. ... #MitchMcConnell. Bring. The. Senate. Back. The ball has been in your court since February when the @HouseDemocrats passed not one but TWO gun safety bills."
And US Representative Ayanna Pressley, a Boston Democrat who was one of the four congresswomen Trump referred to when he said those lawmakers should leave the country, tweeted out a quotation from the author James Baldwin.
“Please try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear," the quotation said.
The Massachusetts representatives' words were echoed by Ernest Coverson, campaign manager for Amnesty International USA's End Gun Violence initiative.
“Gun violence reform cannot come at the expense of the human rights of any community," Coverson said in a statement. “When President Trump links background checks for guns with immigration reform, he is once again demonizing immigrants and communities of color. The Trump administration will stop at nothing to shut down the border and limit safety to those who most need it. It is outrageous to denounce bigotry in one breath and terrorize the community that was targeted in one of these shootings."
Coverson said the “first step in meaningful reform to address this crisis would be to pass legislation requiring background checks for the sale of every gun. There are too many guns, and insufficient laws today to keep track of them all."
Sullivan, of the Boston NAACP, called on citizens to support candidates who will take action to fix that problem.
“If this is an important issue to us as a nation, then we need to start acting with our vote," she said.

8chan down after El Paso mass shooting — for now

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
“8chan is coming back online around the world,” a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. “Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services.”
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a “cesspool of hate,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths.”
The suspect in Saturday’s El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled “The Inconvenient Truth,” in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an “invasion” of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
“What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn’t surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
“The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online,” he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: “While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online.”
There were reports that 8chan — which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago — has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan’s new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: “We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely.”
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan’s current owner last year.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the Times. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, “We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored.”
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants “invading” the United States.
“According to Facebook’s ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word ‘invasion’,” tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. “Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration.”

All John Bolton's Wars; What do the Iranian regime, the New York Times and Sen. Rand Paul have in common?

Texto completo: "I believe Mr. Trump does not seek war. But Mr. Bolton and Netanyahu have always sought war." Thus spoke Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, at a Monday press conference in Tehran. It's not the first time Mr. Zarif has tried to drive a wedge between President Trump and his national security adviser, John Bolton—or between the president and his most steadfast international ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But for Mr. Bolton, Mr. Zarif implies, we could have peace in the Middle East tomorrow.
Iran's foreign minister has plenty of support for his argument. Scarcely a week goes by without some article warning the president that Mr. Bolton is leading him to war. The same folks who pound the president for being soft on the world's worst thugs then oddly side with the thugs against the White House official who takes them on.
There can be no doubting Mr. Bolton's unpopularity in Dictatorsville. The North Koreans blame Mr. Bolton (along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo) for the "atmosphere of hostility and mistrust" that fouled the Hanoi summit in February. In Moscow last year, Vladimir Putin asked Mr. Bolton whether he'd removed the olive branches on the American seal.
Venezuela's besieged dictator, Nicolás Maduro, charges Mr. Bolton with trying to have him assassinated. Cuba's foreign minister calls Mr. Bolton a "pathological liar" for accusing the Communist island of fomenting revolution in South America. China denounces him for slander for saying Beijing's behavior toward its Southeast Asian neighbors threatens peace. Along with the New York Times and the Rand Paul/Pat Buchanan axis of the Republican Party, the dictators would all love to see Mr. Bolton run out of the West Wing.
But if war isn't what's guiding Mr. Bolton, what is? At bottom it's the conviction that diplomacy and multilateral organizations are fine—as long as they serve American interests. In the Bolton version, America First means the U.S. Constitution takes precedence over the U.N. Charter.
For all the talk about Mr. Bolton's wish to go to war with Iran, the actual policy has been more limited: pulling out of a bad nuclear deal, applying economic sanctions, isolating Tehran diplomatically, designating the Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization and, more recently, building a coalition to protect oil tankers in the Persian Gulf from Iranian aggression. One way of interpreting Mr. Zarif's increasing complaints is as an admission that Iran's regime is feeling the pinch—and that it longs for the days when it was dealing with the malleable John Kerry.
Ditto for North Korea. Before joining the administration, Mr. Bolton wrote a piece on these pages called " The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First ," so naturally his critics assume that's the game plan. But again the actual policy has been maximum pressure short of war, along with summits. Notwithstanding Mr. Trump's skepticism about using massive military force, moreover, surely he would side with Mr. Bolton over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who announced a no-first-use nuclear policy during the last Democratic debate. In practice this would entail a willingness to sacrifice Los Angeles or Chicago to a nuclear strike before responding in kind.
It's true that the Trump-Bolton relationship has its bumps. A recent Axios profile relayed an anecdote from the Irish prime minister's St. Patrick's Day visit to the Oval Office. "John," Mr. Trump asked his national security adviser, "is Ireland one of those countries you want to invade?"
But the article didn't report Mr. Bolton's rejoinder, which suggests a healthy give and take: "It's still early in the day, Mr. President."
Plainly Mr. Bolton is aware that he's more hawkish than his president. But plainly, too, Mr. Trump finds his national security chief useful. One reason might be that—unlike so many others, even within the Trump administration—Mr. Bolton knows who makes the decisions and doesn't regard the president as stupid.
In making his case to his boss, Mr. Bolton emphasizes both U.S. interests and Mr. Trump's instincts. Sometimes it works, sometimes not.
But the idea that a warmonger is leading an unsuspecting president around by the nose is ridiculous. Mr. Trump was elected on a platform that rejected both what he called the "endless wars" of the George W. Bush era and the pusillanimity of the Obama years. Could it be the president appreciates having around him a national security adviser who puts the fear of God into America's enemies?
Meanwhile the critics carp, from the right as well as left. "I fear that he's a malignancy, a malignant influence on the administration," said Sen. Rand Paul, speaking for the right-wing claque of those who regard Mr. Bolton as a warmonger. While over on the left the New York Times publishes pieces such as "Yes, John Bolton Really Is That Dangerous."
Which is pretty much the same complaint from the autocrats in Caracas, Moscow and Tehran.

Texto completo: I believe there is, because I believe there is something different now that can lead to meaningful action. I’ll share it with you below.
First — and it’s sad that the phrase has become somewhat hollow and depressingly redundant, but it must be said — our thoughts and prayers go out, again, to two American communities.
As I heard state Rep. Cesar Blanco, D-El Paso, say so starkly Sunday, his community and Dayton, Ohio, are separated by many miles but united in grief.
These shootings are a symptom. A horrible symptom of a society gone horribly wrong on too many crucial fronts. I still believe there is far more good than evil in our nation, but sometimes I wonder. And, thanks to technology and other factors, including the importance of the rights we properly and zealously guard, the evil is fed and enabled.
Who would have thought it also would be fed by our elected leaders?
In May, in Panama City Beach, Fla., President Donald Trump defended his continuous use of the word “invasion” in talking about the ongoing, long-standing challenge at our southern border.
“How do you stop these people?” Trump said.
“Shoot them!” yelled a sick soul.
The crowd laughed. And the president got a chuckle out of that on that day in that city in Florida’s Panhandle.
“That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that stuff,” Trump said lightheartedly.
It’s difficult not to think back on that when we are so heavy-hearted today as we read the anti-Hispanic screed of the suspected shooter in El Paso.
There’s nothing wrong with electing people of Trump’s political leanings. But we can (must) elect people without his violence-inciting rhetorical nonsense.
I can’t help but continue to be horrified by violence as entertainment. Too many people, including too many young people with too impressionable minds and sensitivities, see too many acts of violence — sometimes horrific violence — on too many screens of varying sizes.
It doesn’t help and odds are good it hurts to become callous to — indeed entertained by — a consistent and persistent menu of on-screen violence. Less, please.
We are so overdue for action to make it more difficult to acquire high-powered, high-capacity weaponry, the kind civilians don’t need. I have a phrase I’ve used before in expressing my caution about how we proceed: We must be careful in eroding the rights of many because of the wrongs of a few.
There are lots of guns in America; I’ve seen estimates of up to 300 million guns. I fully understand that the overwhelming majority of those weapons are in the hands of law-abiding citizens and cause no harm.
It is wholly unrealistic to believe we’re going to do anything anytime soon about the volume of guns out there. It’s also wholly unrealistic to believe that there’s any law that could keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them. But we can and should make weapons of overkill more difficult to procure. It’s a discussion I’m sure we’ll be hearing more about on the presidential campaign trail.
The National Rifle Association brings legitimate and important input to the gun discussion. But through its money and the political clout it buys, the NRA has had outsized impact.
The NRA has been largely unchecked. But we now see the distinct possibility that that will change, and, as often is the case, it’s a result of internal strife. In June, the powerful organization suspended its second-in-command amid accusations of involvement in what The New York Times called a “recent failed coup against its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre.”
This came in the wake of NRA President Oliver North’s decision earlier this year not to seek another term.
And there was this last week in The Washington Post: “Three National Rifle Association board members who have raised concerns about reports of reckless spending and mismanagement by the group’s leadership resigned Thursday, another sign of mounting dissent within the nation’s most powerful gun-rights group.”
It’s an internal battle headed for courthouses, as well as ongoing investigations by prosecutors in New York and Washington, D.C.
Maybe this is the opportunity we need. Maybe while the NRA folks are fighting among themselves and fending off investigations, the rest of us can go about the difficult business of balancing rights and public safety without the confounding input of too much money and too much clout on one side of that tricky equation.
That’s what I’m thinking and praying.

Colfer's new book tackles prejudice

Texto completo: After completing 12 books for "The Land of Stories" fantasy series, Chris Colfer is back with a brand new adventure – and this one, he reveals, was the "toughest book" he's ever had to write.
The author, known for his role as Kurt Hummel in the Fox musical show "Glee," has captured a huge fan following from his best-selling middle-grade series. "A Tale of Magic" will be a sequel to that series. "A Tale of Magic," out Oct. 1, is special for a variety of reasons.
The tale follows 14-year-old Brystal Evergreen, as she tries to survive the oppressive Southern Kingdom where it is illegal for women to read books. While working as a maid at her local library and having to sneak out titles, she discovers a secret section with a book about magic, which is also outlawed throughout the world, leading her down a complicated path. The book, which tackles powerful issues, was more difficult to write than Colfer imagined.
"At its core, 'Tale of Magic' is a story about overcoming prejudice and oppression and more than anything I hope it inspires and encourages anyone out there who is fighting their own battles of injustice or inequality," he said.
"When I first started, I was not expecting it to be as difficult as it was, but the world changed so significantly since I agreed to do it, to when I started writing it ... I knew I had to tell a story that I thought would help kids and families out there who are having a difficult time with the times we live in," he continued.
Colfer is embarking on a tour for the book, he shared exclusively with USA TODAY. But unlike Colfer's previous book tours for "Stories," which transformed into auditorium-sized events with costume contests, readings and games, the format for his new tale will be much more traditional, beginning with the tour's first stop in New York City on the day of the book's release.
"Since this is a brand-new series I'm going to be doing a traditional book signing this time around," he revealed. "As soon as the readers are familiar with the new story, the new characters, we'll go back to the town hall-style because it was a big hit with the kids – and their parents because they didn't have to wait in a line with their kids."
What the New York Times bestselling author is most looking forward to, however, is the fan reaction to the meaningful story line behind the book. "One of the biggest motivations for this book was actually for parents and teachers, and for all the parents and teachers out there who are having a difficult time talking to their children about the troubling things they see on the news every day," he said. "I really hope that 'A Tale of Magic' acts as a point of reference to make those conversations a lot easier."
Colfer explained that writing has always been a therapeutic activity for him, and helped him get through some of his own toughest times.
"As a kid, I had a sister with special needs, which was very difficult for my family, so whenever times got tough I would just whip out my computer or a pad of paper. ... That tool came in later when I grew up as a closeted gay kid in a public high school, and also being a gay teenager on public television," he said.
As a vocal member of the LGBTQ community, he shared he has received appreciation from LGBTQ fans who connected with his books. "My books are sold in places and do very well in places where LGBT people are discriminated against quite brutally and I do hear from those kids a lot," Colfer said. "If you look at my Twitter you might find some pictures of LGBT kids holding my books up by the Kremlin and other landmarks. That means a lot to me."
Colfer even admitted to having a whole room in his house dedicated to letters, fan art and fan creations, adding "that's my favorite part because I get to see my characters through someone else's eyes." The author added that although "A Tale of Magic" acts as a prequel, it is a "completely independent story, and you don't need to read 'Land of Stories' to enjoy it."
Fans might want to get reading soon because Colfer announced his next literary focus: writing the sequel.

There are no vacations from the unanswerable questions of the sports universe

Texto completo: When I take a column vacation each summer - which often coincides with a reality vacation in Las Vegas - I am soothed by the extended break from the noxious nuttiness that usually provides my wake-up call every weekday afternoon the rest of the year.
(Yes, I said "my wake-up call every weekday afternoon ." That's right - I sleep in. Why wouldn't I? They can't do as much damage to you when you're not awake, and if there's a lot of bad swirling around out there, well, ignorance is bliss; I'll take my nightmares over their nastiness.)
Alas, when I wandered back into Sports Nation the other day, I immediately got a cold splash of verisimilitude.
Let's go to the videotape to review three of these transgressions:
l Maryland will cancel afternoon classes Sept. 27 because the football team is playing Penn State that evening . My beleaguered, misguided alma mater continues to make decisions that compel sober-minded people to scratch their heads and go, "Really?"
Maryland Provost Mary Ann Rankin said that canceling classes in advance of the 8 p.m. game was to "ensure that visitors, students, faculty and staff are not inordinately inconvenienced by the inevitable traffic issues."
Really?
For starters, "inevitable traffic issues" are such a constant in the Washington, D.C., area, the federal government should shut down daily at 10:30 a.m. Plus, if I were the university, I might consider nixing all classes during football season because nothing athletic should ever be "inordinately inconvenienced" by anything academic.
Then again, I remain an outlier proponent of folding the school's athletic department; to replace the revenue loss, simply ticket every seventh car on campus on a daily basis.
Heck, when I matriculated at College Park, I was not allowed to graduate until I settled all my parking violation fees, which, in those simpler days, exceeded my annual tuition costs.
l Carnegie Mellon and Facebook A.I. have developed a poker bot called Pluribus that solves six-player no limit Texas hold 'em . Big deal. Show me some type of A.I. device that can beat keno and sidestep casino resort fees, and then I will be impressed.
I am tired of these computer science research mavens spending untold hours sipping Coke Zeros while devising useless algorithms to topple games of skill that mean little in our complex, ever-darkening cosmos.
And I will still take Doyle Brunson over a Dell desktop anytime, particularly in a Laredo roadhouse.
Besides, if computers solve EVERYTHING, the only thing left for humankind will be Rubik's cubes, the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle and figuring out how to open a jar of kosher pickles in under 45 seconds.
l A Louisiana judge ruled that a state lawsuit can continue against the NFL over the Rams-Saints no-call in January . Nicole Sheppard also ruled that attorney Antonio LeMon can request documents and ask questions of three NFL game officials in depositions over the lack of a pass-interference penalty against Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman when he hit the Saints' Tommylee Lewis near the end of the NFC championship game.
The suit alleges fraud by NFL officials.
I don't know if we have lost our minds, but something tells me they won't be found anytime soon.
"The purpose of the lawsuit is not to get some minuscule amount of money," LeMon said. "It's to get at the truth."
Uh, you want the truth?
The officials made a bad call. End of story.
Yes, it probably changed the winner of the game. But there was no corruption or conspiracy to uncover, no toxins were discovered on the premises, and no animals were harmed in the making of this result.
Hey, I didn't like the call either. What did I do? I waved my hand dismissively at the TV screen, then took Daisy out for a walk. We both took a nap when we got back and slept in the following morning.
Sometimes there's nothing better than a dog's life.
Ask The Slouch Q. Your summer hiatus keeps getting lengthier. Frankly, it's more of a leave of absence, no? (Alex Talbot; Spokane, Wash.)
A. The plan is to increase vacation by one week annually so that, by age 95, I will be down to four columns per year.
Q. Your vacations come earlier every year and last longer. Are you sneaking into retirement? (Don Pollins; Hyattsville, Md.)
A. Johnny Carson - one of my heroes - was working a three-day week on "The Tonight Show" over his last decade hosting it.
Q. Who waters your Chia Pet when you vacate the premises for several fortnights? (Bill Hayes; Carmel, Ind.)
A. Why is everyone obsessed with the amount of time I take off? Just follow the lead of my wife, Toni - when I leave the house, she never asks when I am coming back.

THE POLITICS OF CONSPIRACY

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Even as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the lunar landing, truly one of the greatest achievements of the 20th – or any – century, a sizable minority of Americans persist in their belief that the walk on the moon never happened. It was, they say, a put-up job, a conspiracy. Some even embroider the theory to posit that the film director Stanley Kubrick, or someone else, produced the hoax on a sound stage in some back lot in Hollywood.
I confess that I never gave conspiracy theories or theorists much attention, consigning them to the dustbin of flat-earthers or the anti-fluoride brigade. But I began to rethink that during a recent flight from Atlanta to Burlington.
The conversation started out pleasantly enough. My seatmate and I somehow discovered we had Swiss heritage in common. He had recently moved to Utah (“No, I'm not a Mormon”), and he was involved in some computer-type business. He was, in short, an affable, manifestly intelligent and educated person.
The conversation took a turn when he asked what I thought of Donald Trump. I sensed trouble and, not wanting to wade into a political dispute, tried to sidestep the question. He persisted, and I finally mumbled, “Well, not much,” hoping for a quick end to the conversation and an opportunity to bury myself once again in my New Yorker.
No such luck. My interlocutor was unfailingly pleasant, but he proceeded to inform me that Barack Obama was Muslim and that Michelle Obama, his wife, was actually a man. I was dumbfounded. I might have expected such silliness from a boozy lout, with shoes untied and a Phillies jersey, munching on a bag of Cheetos, but this man seemed utterly respectable.
Conspiracy theories have been around for a long time. Thomas Jefferson was accused of being an agent for France when he ran for president in 1800. Ardent Protestants through the centuries have suspected the pope of being the antichrist. Who can forget the Bilderbergers, the Bavarian Illuminati, the Trilateral Commission or the visit of space aliens in Roswell, N.M.? And did you know that the Denver International Airport was built above an underground city, which is the headquarters for the New World Order?
Perhaps it's my imagination, but it seems to me that conspiracies began to pick up in the 1960s. The John Birch Society had been warning about black helicopters, agents of the United Nations, for a while, but the assassination of John F. Kennedy brought conspiracists into the mainstream – well, almost the mainstream.
Lyndon Johnson was well aware of that possibility, which is why he tapped Earl Warren, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to head a commission to determine who was responsible for Kennedy's death. The commission's finding that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone did little to placate the fevered conspiracists.
The '60s prompted a crisis of authority in America. Johnson had lied to us about Vietnam; Richard Nixon lied about, well, pretty much everything. Confidence in institutions – political, educational, media, business, religious – began to wither. Americans didn't know who to trust, and this lack of trust created a petri dish for conspiracies.
The age of the internet has allowed conspiracy theories to proliferate – and proliferate they have: 9/11, Pizzagate, the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax, which was perpetrated, Trump insists, by the Chinese. The anti-vaxxers, mired in their fears about the safety of vaccines, have precipitated a public health crisis.
A provocateur named Alex Jones has apparently fashioned an entire career out of conspiracy theories, including the doozy that the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook were staged.
And let's not forget the conspirator-in-chief. Donald Trump likely would not be president today were it not for the so-called “birther” conspiracy, the nonsense that Obama was born in Kenya, not in the United States, and therefore was constitutionally unqualified to be president. Trump peddled “birtherism” relentlessly for years, finally prompting Obama to produce his birth certificate, the first president in history to do so.
Trump has continued to propagate conspiracy theories, most of them casting himself and his administration as victims. He thinks that the Mueller investigation was a conspiracy against him as was the investigation of his campaign's contacts with Russian operatives, even though both probes produced copious evidence of wrongdoing.
The incessant banter about “fake news” suggests that the media is conspiring against him.
Why do so many Americans imbibe conspiracy theories? The aforementioned crisis of authority is certainly part of it, I think, but there also may be a less pernicious reason for their popularity: Some – I repeat, some – conspiracy theories can be fun, a kind of parlor game, allowing people to spin out elaborate scenarios and speculate about the actions and the motives of various individuals.
Most conspiracy theories, I hasten to add, are not that benign, especially when they threaten the nation's democratic order. One of the more recent is something called QAnon, which insists that the so-called “deep state” is engaged in an elaborate, secret plot against Trump. (The perpetrators of QAnon participated in the invitation-only “social media summit” at the White House last month.)
Harrison Schmitt, the last man to walk on the moon, has his own theory about why Americans have become so susceptible to conspiracy theories: a failure of education. “If people decide they're going to deny the facts of history and the facts of science and technology,” he told the New York Times, “there's not much you can do with them.” Schmitt, who served as a Republican senator from New Mexico, added, “For most of them, I just feel sorry that we failed in their education.”
In the spirit of conspiracy, I'll close with my own conspiracy theory, one that I've repeated since Election Day 2016 to anyone who will listen. Actually, it's not so much conspiracy as an awful premonition. I fear that even if Trump is defeated in the presidential election of 2020, he will refuse to leave office. He will cry fraud and “fake news” and hunker down, insisting that he really did win re-election, all credible evidence to the contrary notwithstanding.
I have little doubt that Sean Hannity and the sycophants at Fox News would join the chorus demanding that Trump remain in office.
That, in turn, would create a constitutional crisis, especially with a lapdog Senate and a judiciary of Trump's own making. Such a scenario might eventually involve the military, which constitutionally is under the control of the commander-in-chief.
I shudder at the prospect. And if that speculation makes me a conspiracist, I suppose I must take my place alongside the anti-fluoride cabal.

Texto completo: on why deceit and fakery are so hard to overcome
When President Trump's "false or misleading statements" surpassed 10,000 recently, as documented by The Washington Post Fact Checker, political commentators worried that Trump's lying might encourage Americans to lie more frequently. "Without truth and a common factual basis for our national life," Peter Wehner warned in the Atlantic, "a free society cannot operate."
We have good reason to fear that Trump's lying threatens our society. That's why Wehner calls for us to "model truthfulness, temperance, decency, and integrity in our daily lives." Author Sam Harris takes it further: "If you want to improve yourself and the people around you, you need only stop lying."
But pious eulogizing of the truth can oversimplify the problem; equating decency with honesty, and wickedness with lies, ignores the moral complexity of mendacity and our conflicted relationship with the truth. And so while college courses on spotting fake news are proliferating, in my class at the University of Michigan, I teach students how to lie. Not tiny, white lies but big lies, real whoppers, told for political ends. My purpose is not to validate Trump's deceits but to help students understand what commentators like Wehner and Harris overlook: Lying is not only essential for social interaction (to protect our privacy, or the feelings of others, or the oppressed), it is also inherently liberating - and that's what makes it dangerous and seductive.
Each student in my class starts by proposing a lie with a political agenda that could be loosed to great effect. They explain why someone would propagate the lie, and its intended audience. By this point, we've studied several real-world examples, including the Soviets' lie that the CIA invented HIV/AIDS to target African Americans and the GOP's lie that the Affordable Care Act would create "death panels." There's something brilliantly wicked about these falsehoods: how they exploit anxieties within the target populations; how they feel true. In each, you glimpse the creator's ingenuity at work. You sense the purpose, trajectory and outcome: a weapon artfully created to do maximum damage.
Some students struggle. They lack the creativity to dream up an original lie or the moral license to do something self-evidently unethical. Others claim to struggle ( I'm not the kind of person who could do this ) but in fact cook up some corkers. One student, I'll call her Tara, evinced a small-town sensibility - respectful, quiet, unassuming. She didn't like any of the lies she had come up with. They weren't original, she told me in office hours, and anyway, it didn't feel right to assert something that was obviously wrong.
I reminded her of the assignment's rationale, and eventually she relented: What if, she proposed, as part of their opposition to Trump's immigration policy, Democrats put out the lie that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were forcibly sterilizing migrant women at the border?
My God, I said, that's perfect.
Right away you could see it: How such a lie would appeal to liberals' tendency to believe the worst of Trump. How it would call attention to Republicans' sanctity-of-life hypocrisy. All successful lies manipulate the truth. Tara's lie would take advantage of the fact that ICE was already separating mothers from children at the border; it wouldn't take much to convince outraged liberals that the agency had gone further.
Afterward, I asked students to react: What was it like, inventing a big lie? Some reiterated Tara's squeamishness, while others said they had found something exhilarating in the process. Tara herself admitted as much, while another student surprised us all by describing how he had not only invented a lie but formatted it to resemble a New York Times article and sent it to friends and family. I held up my hands in innocence: I wasn't responsible for the spread of fake news. But I had to know - what were the results of his experiment?
Of his 25 targets, 24 accepted the article as true. Only one questioned its authenticity.
Given what researchers have learned about fake news's ability to spread, this wasn't surprising. More startling was the enthusiasm with which this student embraced the task. A military kid, strait-laced, crew cut, who wore his uniform to class. Like Tara, respectful, quiet, unassuming. Yet also like Tara, he found in the assignment an invitation to break the rules, experienced the thrill of crossing illicit thresholds, enjoyed the license to play with reality. The exercise was liberating.
This is classic Nietzsche: the argument that truths are illusions - that conventional morality, stitched together from ancient taboos and superstitions, is a herd mentality that limits our creativity, our individual pursuit of excellence, our experience of life.
Some might argue that my class is corrupting honest youth. That I'm teaching students how to deceive, how to pursue their own agendas without constraint. Don't we have enough scammers without professors training more? Moreover, I worry that, as a fiction writer who enjoys playing with reality, I am transporting my values to a discipline (public policy) where they don't belong.
But as Hannah Arendt wrote, the liar "says what is not so because he wants things to be different from what they are - that is, he wants to change the world." And he does so, Arendt added, using "this mysterious faculty of ours that enables us to say, 'The sun is shining,' when it is raining cats and dogs."
To create something new, you first have to deny the validity of the status quo. Lying is a kind of creation. There is vitality in the act, while defending the truth is inherently static. Liars can say anything. They can make up a story perfectly suited to political exigencies, whereas the truth is stubborn and unpliable.
Creating a big lie helped students acquire a more sophisticated sense of political lying than they could gain by reading moralizing essays. They came to understand that many Americans are attracted to Trump not in spite of but because of his lies; his supporters admit he's lying but believe that it's evidence of his courage to thumb his nose not only at the establishment but also at reality. They thrill in what they perceive to be Trump's vigor.
My students brought a similar vigor to the second part of their assignment, a simulation in which they chose one lie from among the many they had proposed, then in groups attempted to advance the lie or defend the truth. Their chosen lie was another artfully devious conceit: When 517 prisoners went missing from Orleans Parish Prison after Hurricane Katrina (which is true), they were kidnapped, as the lie would have it, by NASA for experimentation.
To begin, each student adopted the persona of a real-world politician, journalist or expert, then used a Twitter-style platform to advance their arguments, criticize their opponents and introduce new "evidence." With gusto, the liars took advantage of the deceivers' playbook, larding their lies with facts (e.g., government experiments on vulnerable populations), asking leading questions, posing worst-case scenarios. Meanwhile, the truthers, beholden to the facts, could not provide an accurate answer to the liars' demands as to the location of the missing prisoners. Instead they feebly attempted to shift the debate to the jobs that NASA creates or criminal justice reform.
I teach another class at Michigan on what I call "applied utopianism." We read utopian philosophers, then study real-world outcomes of their proposals. This demonstrates the dangers of extreme idealism but also shows that, to solve intractable problems, it might be necessary to envision the impossible. Sometimes wild creativity is needed, unconstrained by reality. We study how utopians' fanciful proposals occasionally proved useful - and yet, when students must come up with their own original ideas, they struggle, producing hackneyed recombinations of previous proposals. In fact, it's been in my lying class - not utopia - where students have demonstrated the most creativity.
Maybe it's a flaw in the course or assignment design that inhibits students' imagination in utopia. Or maybe, if we want to inspire future leaders to be creative, we must figure out how to harness the liar's ingenuity and bravado: the fearlessness in the face of reality and willingness to assert that what has been accepted as true might not be the truth after all. To do this without lying - to go beyond reality while maintaining a grasp on the distinction between fact and fantasy - that is the visionary's calling.

Texto completo: One neat thing about being the incumbent in a presidential race is, you get to set the agenda and make your opponent react to what you say and do.
And then you depict his or her reaction as weak, dumb and — worst of all — liberal.
That's why the Department of Justice decision last week to resume executions of condemned federal prisoners — ending a 16-year hiatus — is politically important for President Trump. He, himself, is already the issue of the 2020 campaign and this gives him one more chance to make the Democrats weak. Never mind right and wrong, facts and figures. This is about what fits in a campaign slogan, bumper sticker or sound bite. Trump, tough. Democrats, it's complicated.
Not that there was ever any doubt where he stood. Long before he ran for office, back when he was just a famous rich guy, Trump was calling for reinstatement of capital punishment. He even spent $85,000 on full-page ads in four New York newspapers, urging resumption of executions when five Harlem men were wrongly accused of raping and beating a Central Park jogger in 1989. The men were convicted but later exonerated, and another man confessed to the crime. Trump has refused to say he was wrong about them, or the death penalty.
As president, Trump misses no opportunity to show his toughness. On this issue, after the murders of 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, he said, "People that do this, you have to bring back the death penalty. This is the worst form of terrorism."
It would be hard to find anything major that Trump and the Democratic contenders for president don't hotly disagree about. Tax cuts, immigration, foreign policy, judicial appointments, and that little matter of impeachment — you name it, Trump says he's doing great, and major Democrats deplore it.
So it was no surprise when Attorney General William Barr announced last Thursday that executions will resume at the Terre Haute, Indiana, federal prison in December and January. He also said the government has a new drug, pentobarbital, to replace a troublesome lethal combo that was challenged in court as a cruel and unusual way of carrying out the ultimate sentence.
Trump's challengers reacted quickly and predictably. Sen. Bernie Sanders promised, "When I am president, we will abolish the death penalty." Sen. Kamala Harris called it "immoral and deeply flawed," adding that "we need a national moratorium on the death penalty, not a resurrection."
Joe Biden has had trouble deciding whether he wants to be wishy or washy on those federal crime statutes he supported as a U.S. Senator and chairman of the judiciary committee years ago. He recently came out against capital punishment, though, reversing a long-standing position.
The New York Times reported that a Pew Research Center survey showed 54 percent public support for capital punishment, which is still on the books in 29 states. Florida had its first execution under Gov. Ron DeSantis recently, and no politician has ever suffered for supporting capital punishment in this state.
The Democratic nominee for president will most assuredly promise not to permit any executions in federal prisons, no matter how ghastly the crime or how guilty the killer.
Trump, as we've seen, campaigns with all the nuanced subtlety, moral introspection and intellectual ambiguity of a Roadrunner cartoon. He'll probably have crowds chanting about executions at his campaign rallies.

Texto completo: Everybody talks about bull and bear markets, especially the current one, often called the longest bull market in history at just under 3,800 days. But nobody seems to agree on an exact definition, or knows where the prevailing ones originated, including many investment professionals.
Analysts often say that a bull market is defined by a 20% rise from a market index's most recent lowest point; a bear market, a 20% decline from its latest high.
Variations on that are countless -- and endlessly confusing. Only by looking back at the history of these terms can you get a better sense of what they mean, why they matter and how you should factor them into your thinking.
According to Anatoly Liberman, a linguist at the University of Minnesota, the use of "bull" and "bear" to refer to financial optimists and pessimists, respectively, originated in Britain in the early 18th century.
"Bull" evoked the bellowing of an eager buyer. "Bear" appears to have come from an early proverbial expression, "to sell the bear's skin before one has caught the bear" -- an apt metaphor for a short sale, in which a trader sells borrowed shares in hopes of buying them back at a lower price.
The terms "bull market" and "bear market," however, didn't arise until the 1850s, says lexicographer Barry Popik. Even then, they often referred to only a single day's action.
"The market was feverish this morning, with slight advances in some securities and a falling off in others," reported the New York Herald on Oct. 28, 1855. "It would, undoubtedly, have been a bull market but for the report . . . of two or three failures."
As late as 1874, when Matthew Hale Smith published his chronicle "Bulls and Bears of New York," the term "bull market" still looked strange to readers. "They never buy on what is called a Bull market," Smith wrote about leading speculators, "but always when stocks are low."
For decades, bull and bear markets referred not to long-term moves in the stock market as a whole, but to ephemeral price action in a single asset. "The bull market in wheat Saturday lasted about an hour," reported The Wall Street Journal on May 15, 1899.
The very first issue of the Journal, on July 8, 1889, reported: "The bull market of 1885 began July 2," with the average price of 12 stocks (including Pacific Mail Steamship and Western Union) at 61.49, and peaked May 18, 1887 at 93.27. That was nearly a 52% gain.
But the Journal didn't define a bull market, and many decades would pass before it did.
Charles Henry Dow, co-founder of the Journal, wrote -- not very helpfully -- in 1902: "It is a bull period as long as the average of one high point exceeds that of previous high points. It is a bear period when the low point becomes lower than the previous low points."
Even during the roaring 1920s, the Journal rarely used the term "bull market."
In December 1949, the Magazine of Wall Street wrote: "It is simply not possible to arrive at a precise definition of so variable a thing as a bull market or bear market." Settling on "a considerable rise in stock prices over a considerable period of time," the magazine cited the action in the Dow between May 1947 and June 1948 -- an 18% gain -- as an example of a bull market.
The 20% threshold for bull and bear markets began to take hold only "in the latter 1950s and early 1960s," said John Prestbo, former markets editor at the Journal. "It became the seed around which consensus formed, helped partly by the financial press [including Dow Jones, the Journal's parent] adopting it as a simplistic -- and brief -- definition."
An article in the New York Times on July 23, 1962, pegged May 28 of that year as the beginning of a bear market. That day the S&P 500 was first down 20% from its high in 1961, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Westport, Conn.
The 20% threshold took a long time to gain traction, however.
In January 1967, as the Dow approached a 14% gain from its trough the previous October, the Journal said many analysts were "pronouncing the words 'bull market' again for the first time in a long while."
On Sept. 13, 1970, with stocks up 22% off their lows that spring, the Times still thought it was too soon to declare a bull market.
Only after the epic performance of the 1980s and 1990s, when stocks delivered roughly 18% average annual returns, did the definitions with a 20% threshold take hold for good.
Where does all this leave investors?
First, realize how arbitrary the terms "bull market" and "bear market" are. No one knows why the definitions don't include a minimum length of time. Or why they're usually based on closing prices instead of intraday highs and lows. Or who came up with the 20% threshold and why it wasn't 25% or 30% or 41.2879%. (Defining a "correction" as a 10% decline is equally arbitrary.)
Consider, too, that the terms can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. From Sept. 20 through Dec. 24, 2018, the S&P 500 fell 19.78%, narrowly missing the common definition of a bear market.
Had stocks closed a mere 0.22% lower last Christmas Eve, headlines would have read something like STOCKS ENTER BEAR-MARKET TERRITORY.
Many more investors and financial advisers might have sold shares in response, presumably deepening the decline. Instead, the 19.78% tumble enabled the market to pause without panicking and, ultimately, to resume its rise in 2019.
Investors always want more precision than the collective mood swings of markets tend to offer. In this case, the fact that the decline was just shy of 20% appears to have given investors the confidence that the market hadn't entered bear territory -- and changed their behavior.

Texto completo: There was no Google Maps to help you find the Woodstock Music and Arts Festival on Aug. 15-18, 1969. In place of social media there was only word-of-mouth. But that was enough to draw more than 400,000 people to a rented 600-acre parcel of Max Yasgur's dairy farm, 100 miles north of Manhattan in the White Lake area of Bethel, N.Y.
As Woodstock approaches its 50th anniversary, nostalgia runs as thick as the ankle-deep mud in Yasgur's pasture. Today, schoolchildren tour The Museum at Bethel Woods to view the handwritten lyrics of "Goin' Up the Country" by Alan Wilson of Canned Heat and the bass guitar of Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane under glass. Any square can order a tie-dyed Woodstock T-shirt from Amazon and have it delivered faster than a Volkswagen bus could have navigated the snail-slow New York Thruway on the festival weekend.
But the real Woodstock, in all its grimy, rain-soaked glory, was an authentic historical climax. Anchored by 33 musical acts, it was the defining 1960s counterculture party: a four-day cyclone of peace, love, rock 'n' roll, shaggy hair, hippie fashion, torrential downpours, Vietnam War angst and underground revolt. And lots of mind-altering drugs. From the stage, MC Edward "Chip" Monck famously warned that "the brown acid that is circulating around us is not specifically too good." But he also said, "Of course it's your own trip, so be my guest"—and legions hungering for higher consciousness did.
Richie Havens opened the festival at 5 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 15. Though he'd been slated to play for only 20 minutes, the organizers asked him to keep going because the next act, Sweetwater, was running late. Extemporizing, Havens improvised an ecstatic "Freedom" chant that became, thanks to documentary film footage, a signature Woodstock moment. "It was about spirituality," Havens said, "about love, about sharing, about helping each other, living in peace and harmony."
That wasn't a universal reaction among performers. The Who's Pete Townshend was appalled by the drug-induced mayhem unfolding around him. "What was going on off the stage was just beyond comprehension—stretchers and dead bodies and people throwing up and people having bad trips," he remembered in "Woodstock: Three Days That Rocked the World," the authoritative history of the festival published in 2009, which includes interviews with many of the participants. "I thought the whole of America had gone mad."
That sentiment was widespread at the time. Woodstock proved irresistible to the news media, which trumpeted its LSD overdoses, public nudity, food shortages, transportation problems, rancid latrines, collapsing stages and electrocutions. The New York Times deemed the event "Nightmare in the Catskills," after a teenage concertgoer was run over and killed by a tractor while asleep in a field. Another man died from a heroin overdose, and around 6,000 people were treated at the festival's makeshift first-aid tents.
Bob Dylan, who was living in the actual town of Woodstock, N.Y. at the time (40 miles northeast of Bethel), had turned down a spot in the festival. "I didn't want to be part of that thing," he said. "I just thought it was a lot of kids out and around wearing flowers in their hair, taking a lot of acid. I mean what can you think about that?"
For many, of course, that was the whole point. Rebelling against their parents' values and angry at America's prosecution of the war in Vietnam, the era's young people saw Woodstock as a cultural liberation, while their elders viewed it with fear.
CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite, whose own daughter had sneaked off to Woodstock, was consumed with worry. "My gosh," he recalled, "the next thing we know, coming on television is this wild bunch in the muck and the mud up at Woodstock with the dope running rampant."
Beyond the muck and the mud was the music. There were highs (swamp-rockers Creedence Clearwater Revival) and lows ('50s nostalgia act Sha Na Na). There was the stupendous funk sizzle of Sly and the Family Stone, the raw blues of Janis Joplin and the blistering Latin rock guitar of Carlos Santana. There was a pregnant Joan Baez singing "We Shall Overcome" and British belter Joe Cocker gyrating through the Beatles' "With a Little Help from My Friends." Jefferson Airplane performed "Somebody to Love" and "White Rabbit."
"You feel proud to have been a part of it," guitarist Robbie Robertson of The Band later recalled. "You feel it was amazing, you feel it was a first, you feel it said something."
The music pushed past midnight on Sunday, then past daybreak Monday. At 8:30 a.m., the festival's headliner finally took the stage. A one-time U.S. Army private, 27-year-old Jimi Hendrix had gained world-wide fame since releasing his first album, "Are You Experienced," in 1967. At the time of Woodstock he was the highest-paid performer in the world.
Wearing a blue-beaded white leather jacket, with a red scarf tied around his Afro, Hendrix surveyed the garbage-strewn landscape. The crowd had thinned, with only about 30,000 people remaining. But Hendrix, backed by his new band Gypsy Sun and Rainbows, launched into a fierce two-hour set that produced one of the greatest filmed moments of the 1960s: his gonzo rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner."
It was a lesson in being an American in 1969. Bending notes and sculpting feedback to mimic bombs bursting in air, at one point dropping in the funereal notes of "Taps," Hendrix transformed the national anthem into a cry for freedom, peace and ecstasy. When the TV host Dick Cavett later questioned Hendrix about the brazen performance, he said calmly, "All I did was play it. I'm an American, so I played it…. I thought it was beautiful."
Hendrix's mind-boggling rifts crowned Woodstock—and with it, in a very real way, the 1960s. In little more than a year, both Hendrix and Janis Joplin would be dead from drugs. The Vietnam War peaked, then ended. Flower Power gave way to the Me Decade.
Fifty years later, however, the utopian promise of Woodstock is still powerful. The lesson of the festival, to many, is that life isn't about the storm but about dancing in the rain. "Woodstock is in our mind," said Country Joe McDonald, who performed on the second day. "Not the present or past. It can happen anywhere, anytime."
But such positive remembrances are hardly the whole of Woodstock's legacy. A warning coda is also necessary for all those concertgoers and their peers encouraged to gobble Orange Sunshine acid like cookies and drop out of society. Too many of the festival's wayward pilgrims were led by the promise of psychedelic liberation down a path of no return. "I thought I was going to die on drugs—end of story," recounted Woodstock veteran David Crosby in a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone. "I don't know why I'm alive and Jimi isn't, and Janis isn't...and all my other friends. I have no idea why me, but I got lucky."

Texto completo: Headnote Turning trash into school
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast - She left home before dawn. Her four children were still asleep in her concrete block house in Abobo, a maze of shops and houses occupied by dockworkers, taxi drivers, factory laborers and street sellers.
She and a friend crossed into the upscale neighborhood of Angré, home to doctors and businessmen. They tossed the plastic castoffs of the consumer class into bags slung over their shoulders as the cocks crowed and the sun peeked over villa walls draped with bougainvillea.
Mariam Coulibaly is part of a legion of women in Abidjan who make their living picking up plastic waste on the city streets and selling it for recycling. Now they are lead players in a project that turns trash into plastic bricks to build schools across the country.
They are working with a Colombian company to convert plastic waste - a scourge of modern life - into an asset that will help women earn a decent living while cleaning up the environment and improving education.
She sees it as a chance to better her life, maybe even to rise into the middle class.
"We don't get good prices" from the current buyers, Coulibaly said. "This will help us."
In the past year, the venture has built nine demonstration classrooms out of recycled plastic bricks in Gonzagueville, a scrappy neighborhood on the outskirts of Abidjan, and in two small farming villages, Sakassou and Divo. The first schools were built with bricks imported from Colombia. But in the fall, a factory now rising in an Abidjan industrial park will begin making the bricks locally.
The new plastic-brick classrooms are badly needed. Some classrooms now pack in 90 students, according to the country's education minister. The company building the factory, Conceptos Plásticos, has a contract with UNICEF to deliver 528 classrooms for about 26,400 students, at 50 students per classroom.
In the tiny village of Sakassou, people draw water from the well with a foot pump, raise pigs and chickens, and cook over open fires. Until this year, the children went to school in a traditional mud-brick and wood building. The mud brick eroded in the sun and rain and had to be constantly repaired.
But the three new plastic classrooms could last practically forever. The interlocking bricks look like black and gray Legos. They are fire retardant and stay cool in hot weather. The other day, villagers used one of the brightly decorated classrooms to hold a village meeting.
"This is 10 times better," said Joachim Koffi Konan, the school director in Sakassou.
The project would be impossible without the organizing skills of Coulibaly, president of a 200-strong women's community association called "The Fighting Women."
She has been collecting trash for about 20 years, since she was 15. Her husband drives aworo-woro, a shared taxi.
After collecting trash the other morning, she went home to do the housework, then returned to work at night, this time in the vast open-air market of Adjamé at closing time.
She and other women waltzed through dimly lit alleyways, past the fishmonger and the tailor still bent over his sewing machine. They even picked up the small triangular bags of plastic used to sell a quick gulp of water on the street.
While the women wait for the factory to open, they sell their plastic to middlemen - most are men - at a recycling market in Abobo-Baoulé.
The country's official minimum wage is roughly $25 per week, though many people earn far less. The women say they earn $8.50 to $17 a week.
Coulibaly puts her money into private school tuition for her three school-age children, who tell her they want to become a pilot, a doctor and a police officer.
The women in the association each contribute some money to a fund which is then redistributed, ensuring that even a woman who is sick will receive some income.
When they start selling to the factory, they may be able to double or triple their income, the company says. That's because the factory will buy types of plastic, like snack packaging and cellphone parts, that the women cannot sell now.
Some of Coulibaly's neighbors have suggested that she and the other women will be exploited. But she said she is confident that the project will deliver the higher pay, equipment and sacks that have been promised.
The project has the blessing of Kandia Camara, Ivory Coast's outspoken education minister, who says it can only lift women up.
"For us, it's not a humiliating profession," Camara said in an interview at her office, decorated with photographs of her with other prominent women, like Ivanka Trump and Christine Lagarde, the former head of the International Monetary Fund. "It is a job organized for them, their financial autonomy, their dignity, family, society, and their contribution to the development of the country."
The project was the brainchild of Aboubacar Kampo, a medical doctor, who just ended a term as Ivory Coast representative for UNICEF. He recruited Conceptos Plasticos, a for-profit plastic recycling company with a social mission of building housing and creating jobs for poor people. The founders of the company, Oscar Andrés Méndez and his wife, Isabel Cristina Gámez, agreed to work with Kampo after visiting Ivory Coast last year.
They were moved by the sight of women, carrying babies, picking up trash in Akouedo, a landfill notorious as a dumping site for hazardous waste, and thought they could help. "It had a big impact for us," Méndez said.
The couple moved to Abidjan in June to get the project up and running, and they are planning to expand into other parts of West Africa.
They expect to employ 30 people at the factory and to buy plastic from about 1,000 women in its first year of operation.
The first few classrooms cost about $14,500 each, compared with $16,500 for a concrete classroom, said Méndez. He expects the price to drop about 20% when the bricks are made locally.
There is no shortage of plastic waste. Abidjan produces about 300 tons of it a day, but only 5% of it is recycled, the project organizers say. Each classroom takes about 5 tons of plastic trash to build.
Kampo envisions expanding to plastic housing for teachers and latrines for schools. The teachers in Sakassou share houses while their families are housed in other villages. In Gonzagueville, there are 14 latrines for 2,700 children and their teachers.
Before all this happened, the leader of the Fighting Women had been considering a new line of work: selling cold drinks.
But now, Coulibaly says, "We think there is a future in plastic."

Where Did This 'Bull Market' Come From, Anyway? Investors talk about bull markets, especially the current one, but nobody seems to agree on a definition or where the term came from

Texto completo: Everybody talks about bull and bear markets, especially the current one, often called the longest bull market in history at just under 3,800 days. But nobody seems to agree on an exact definition, or knows where the prevailing ones originated, including many investment professionals.
Analysts often say that a bull market is defined by a 20% rise from a market index's most recent lowest point; a bear market, a 20% decline from its latest high.
Variations on that are countless—and endlessly confusing. Only by looking back at the history of these terms can you can get a better sense of what they mean, why they matter and how you should factor them into your thinking.
According to Anatoly Liberman, a linguist at the University of Minnesota, the use of "bull" and "bear" to refer to financial optimists and pessimists, respectively, originated in Britain in the early 18th century.
"Bull" evoked the bellowing of an eager buyer. "Bear" appears to have come from an early proverbial expression, "to sell the bear's skin before one has caught the bear"—an apt metaphor for a short sale, in which a trader sells borrowed shares in hopes of buying them back at a lower price.
The terms "bull market" and "bear market," however, didn't arise until the 1850s, says lexicographer Barry Popik. Even then, they often referred to only a single day's action.
"The market was feverish this morning, with slight advances in some securities and a falling off in others," reported the New York Herald on Oct. 28, 1855. "It would, undoubtedly, have been a bull market but for the report…of two or three failures."
As late as 1874, when Matthew Hale Smith published his chronicle "Bulls and Bears of New York," the term "bull market" still looked strange to readers. "They never buy on what is called a Bull market," Smith wrote about leading speculators, "but always when stocks are low."
For decades, bull and bear markets referred not to long-term moves in the stock market as a whole, but to ephemeral price action in a single asset.
"The bull market in wheat Saturday lasted about an hour," reported The Wall Street Journal on May 15, 1899.
"I couldn't stem the bull market" in one day's trading of an Iowa railroad stock, said a character in Edward Everett Rose's 1910 novel, "Father Kelly of the Rosary."
The very first issue of the Journal, on July 8, 1889, reported: "The bull market of 1885 began July 2," with the average price of 12 stocks (including Pacific Mail Steamship and Western Union) at 61.49, and peaked May 18, 1887 at 93.27. That was nearly a 52% gain.
But the Journal didn't define a bull market, and many decades would pass before it did.
Charles Henry Dow, co-founder of the Journal, wrote—not very helpfully—in 1902: "It is a bull period as long as the average of one high point exceeds that of previous high points. It is a bear period when the low point becomes lower than the previous low points."
Even during the roaring 1920s, the Journal rarely used the term "bull market."
In December 1949, the Magazine of Wall Street wrote: "It is simply not possible to arrive at a precise definition of so variable a thing as a bull market or bear market." Settling on "a considerable rise in stock prices over a considerable period of time," the magazine cited the action in the Dow between May 1947 and June 1948—an 18% gain—as an example of a bull market.
The 20% threshold for bull and bear markets began to take hold only "in the latter 1950s and early 1960s," said John Prestbo, former markets editor at the Journal. "It became the seed around which consensus formed, helped partly by the financial press [including Dow Jones, the Journal's parent] adopting it as a simplistic—and brief—definition."
An article in the New York Times on July 23, 1962, pegged May 28 of that year as the beginning of a bear market. That was the day the S&P 500 was first down 20% from its high in 1961, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Westport, Conn.
The 20% threshold took a long time to gain traction, however.
In January 1967, as the Dow approached a 14% gain from its trough the previous October, the Journal said many analysts were already "pronouncing the words 'bull market' again for the first time in a long while."
On Sept. 13, 1970, with stocks already up 22% off their lows that spring, the Times still thought it was too soon to declare a bull market.
Only after the epic performance of the 1980s and 1990s, when stocks delivered roughly 18% average annual returns, did the definitions with a 20% threshold take hold for good.
Where does all this leave investors?
First, realize how arbitrary the terms "bull market" and "bear market" are. No one knows why the definitions don't include a minimum length of time. Or why they're usually based on closing prices instead of intraday highs and lows. Or who came up with the 20% threshold and why it wasn't 25% or 30% or 41.2879%. (Defining a "correction" as a 10% decline is equally arbitrary.)
Consider, too, that the terms can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. From Sept. 20 through Dec. 24, 2018, the S&P 500 declined 19.78% based on closing prices, narrowly missing the common definition of a bear market. (Using intraday pricing, the S&P did decline 20.21% from Sept. 21 through Dec. 26.)
Had stocks closed a mere 0.22% lower last Christmas Eve , headlines—including in the Journal—would have read something like STOCKS ENTER BEAR-MARKET TERRITORY.
Many more investors and financial advisers might have sold stocks in response, presumably deepening the decline. Instead, the 19.78% tumble enabled the market to pause without panicking and, ultimately, to resume its rise in 2019.
Investors always want more precision than the collective mood swings of markets tend to offer. In this case, the fact that the decline was just shy of 20% appears to have given investors the confidence that the market hadn't entered bear territory—and changed their behavior .
The more you know about financial history, the less surprised you should be by how bull and bear markets unfold.

Texto completo: President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" — if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage. "'Watch your step,' someone called out as the group neared a dead rat," the Times reported.
The city's "regression has been swift and demoralizing," the Times wrote, adding that officials have "struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge." One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, "we're all bolted in our homes, we're locked down."
In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita — more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 — up from 147 homicides at the same time last year.
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once compared Baltimore to "a Third World country" and said it is "a community in which half of the people don't have jobs [and] in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable." This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor's office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump's presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics.

Texto completo: Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator struggling to gain footing in the 24-person Democratic presidential field, scored what most candidates dream of in a crowded, nationally televised debate: a viral soundbite.
During Wednesday night's Democratic primary debate, CNN's Dana Bash asked Gillibrand about her support for Green New Deal legislation and whether its job-security promises are realistic.
But first, Gillibrand shoehorned in a laugh line that served as a dig at President Donald Trump.
"So the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand said.
The partisan crowd at Detroit's Fox Theatre erupted in laughter and applause. Gillibrand began trending on Twitter, where thousands of people tweeted the line. Outlets like The New York Times and Marie Claire suggested it was the quote of the night.
Gillibrand had been using the line for weeks For those closely following Gillibrand's campaign, the line wasn't a surprise. Gillibrand had been using the Clorox quote on the campaign trail for weeks. And it's easy to understand why: It's been a reliable hit among her supporters and those who come out to hear her speak.
Take her talk at the National Urban League Conference in Indianapolis last Friday, when a moderator asked how she would stop the "antics" of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"On the first day that I become president, after I Clorox the Oval Office" —the crowd guffawed and the moderator chuckled — "which as a mother, I would do," Gillibrand said, "the second thing I will do is restore our moral leadership on the world stage."
In a small gathering in New Hampshire early last month, a voter asked Gillibrand how she would repair the United States' reputation in the eyes of world leaders.
"So, after I Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand started in response, according to a video from New York Now, a weekly television show.
Again, it got big laughs.
Roots of Clorox line date back months Gillibrand's Clorox line has roots going back at least to February, about a month after she launched an exploratory committee for a presidential run.
At a small gathering Feb. 17 in Keene, New Hampshire, an attendee asked Gillibrand what her first act in the Oval Office would be "after fumigating the White House, of course."

Texto completo: Manhattan state prosecutors have subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to a hush payment to a former adult-film star during the 2016 election, according to a person familiar with the matter, the latest investigation to examine the company's involvement in the payment.
The subpoena sought documents from the company, owned by President Trump and managed by his sons, related to the $130,000 payment Michael Cohen, a former Trump lawyer, made to Stephanie Clifford in October 2016. Ms. Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, had alleged an affair with Mr. Trump, which he has denied.
The Manhattan district attorney's office has also subpoenaed American Media Inc., publisher of the National Enquirer, people familiar with the matter said. American Media made another payment, also arranged by Mr. Cohen, to a former Playboy model who alleged an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has also denied that affair.
Mr. Cohen in August 2018 pleaded guilty to federal charges, including two campaign-finance violations related to the hush payments, which he has said he arranged at Mr. Trump's direction. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. Mr. Cohen began a three-year prison sentence in May.
Marc Mukasey, an attorney for the Trump Organization, called the investigation a "political hit job." In a statement, he said, "It's just harassment of the president, his family, and his business, using subpoenas and leaks as weapons. We will respond as appropriate."
The subpoenas were reported earlier by the New York Times.
A spokesman for Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, declined to comment.
The subpoenas come weeks after the federal probe into the hush-money payments, run by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, appeared to close without any indictments of Trump Organization executives.
Manhattan federal prosecutors advised the court last month that they had effectively concluded their campaign-finance investigation.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported that prosecutors were examining discrepancies between Mr. Cohen's account and that of Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer who testified before a grand jury last summer.
In addition to the Manhattan district attorney's office, congressional investigators are continuing to probe the hush payments and what role Trump Organization executives played in them.
Last month, the House Oversight Committee chairman asked Manhattan federal prosecutors whether a Justice Department policy barring charges against a sitting president played any role in their decision not to indict Mr. Trump for campaign-finance violations in which he was implicated. The chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), also requested the evidence prosecutors gathered during their campaign-finance investigation.
When Mr. Cohen appeared in federal court in August 2018, he said he arranged the hush payments at the president's direction. Since then, prosecutors in December court filings have implicated the president in the scheme. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

When Will the 2020 Field Start to Shrink? Perhaps Not Soon Enough

Texto completo: For two nights this week, voters once again watched a total of 20 Democratic presidential candidates try to outmaneuver their rivals on the debate stage. But it's inevitable: At some point, the historically large field of Democratic candidates will get smaller, the debate stage less crowded.
The question now is when. And for some Democrats, the moment can't come fast enough.
"Oh my gosh, I hope it's soon," said JoAnn Hardy, the Democratic chair of Cerro Gordo County, Iowa, where most of the field will descend next week for a major Democratic dinner.
[ The race is fluid, and other things we learned from the July Democratic debates. ]
"I have some activists who are not getting involved because they like to study the candidates, learn all about them, and it's too overwhelming to do," Ms. Hardy said.
Representative Eric Swalwell of California is the only candidate who has ended his bid since the race got competitive. But a number of factors in the coming months could prompt other fringe candidates to join him among the ranks of the also-rans.
Candidates who have failed to catch on with donors could run out of money. They could throw in the towel once they fail to meet the September debate qualifications. Or they could decide to drop out to further their ambitions at home.
Here is what we're watching for in the coming weeks.
There's little incentive to drop out right away
The packed schedule of events being held in early-voting primary states means even long-shot contenders have little incentive to drop out anytime soon. They believe they will have multiple chances to press their cases in front of voters and activists in August.
More than 20 candidates are scheduled to attend the Iowa State Fair, which begins next week and stretches through Aug. 18. Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who made his debate stage debut this week, is expected to be the first candidate to speak, on Thursday, and Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who failed to qualify for either set of debates, is set to go last, on Aug. 17.
The Iowa Democratic Wing Ding, a major Democratic event that will be held in Ms. Hardy's county on Aug. 9, will feature 22 candidates, said Randy Black, the event's chair.
And 21 candidates are listed as confirmed attendees for the Polk County Democrats' steak fry on Sept. 21 in Des Moines.
In New Hampshire, the state party has said it anticipates that all of the candidates will appear at its convention, slated for Sept. 7 in Manchester.
But some candidates may start to run out of money
As the summer months roll on, the amount of money even the most determined (and stubborn) candidates have in the bank will become increasingly important.
Heading into the fall, the candidates will need to start building up their campaign operations and deploying more staff on the ground in early-voting states to stay viable. Many will also want to start running television ads in those states.
All of this costs money, and some candidates could soon realize that they simply don't have enough to continue running a competitive campaign.
As of the end of June, only five candidates -- former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. -- had more than $ 10 million in the bank.
Several, including Mr. Moulton, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, had less than $ 1 million cash on hand.
What's most important, though, is a candidate's burn rate -- that is, how much a campaign has spent relative to its fund-raising. Too high a burn rate can spell trouble for the long haul.
Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland, for instance, had a burn rate of more than 750 percent in the second quarter. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, whose campaign has a large staff, had a burn rate of 185 percent. Mr. Hickenlooper was at 142 percent. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii had a burn rate of 121 percent.
On the other hand, some campaigns that have not raised much money have managed to keep costs down. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, for example, had a burn rate of 47 percent. Mr. de Blasio's was 33 percent and Mr. Bullock's was 28 percent. While they have failed to catch fire, these candidates could see no real reason to drop out just yet.
And many face a steep climb in the polls
In a Quinnipiac University national poll released Monday, 14 presidential candidates did not even register 1 percent support, while four others earned 1 percent each. It was a stark reminder of just how long the odds are for the vast majority of the field.
After two debates, none of the lowest-polling candidates have managed to generate the kind of meaningful, lasting momentum that would allow them to break into the next tier of contenders.
Certainly, there is still time to create a viral moment and to work to capitalize on it, and for some candidates, that dream is enough to prevent them from dropping out in the near future. But that goal grows more elusive every day as the top contenders dominate the spotlight.
"I don't understand why some of the 1-percenters aren't leaving the field," Ms. Hardy said. "We need some people to drop out."
The September debate deadline is approaching
For the first two rounds of debates in June and July, the Democratic National Committee set the bar to qualify relatively low: assemble 65,000 donors or register at least 1 percent in three polls. Twenty candidates made the cut.
But it's about to get a lot tougher for candidates to qualify for the next debate, to be held Sept. 12 and 13 in Houston. To guarantee a third-round debate spot, candidates will need to collect 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 percent support in four polls. They have until Aug. 28 -- or about four weeks left -- to do so.
So far, only seven candidates -- Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Harris, Mr. Buttigieg, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas -- have met both criteria and are ensured a spot onstage.
Three other candidates -- Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former housing secretary Julián Castro and the technology executive Andrew Yang -- are close. And it's possible that the self-help author Marianne Williamson, the billionaire activist Tom Steyer and perhaps some others could qualify as well.
An analysis by The New York Times of polls and donor numbers suggests only 10 to 12 candidates will make it to the third round, leaving the remaining ones, many of whom are already struggling to break through, with an even narrower path to national exposure.
Some may decide it's just not worth it, especially if they are facing a competitive race at home -- or if they see better odds running for the Senate.
Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting.

Justice Dept. Declines to Prosecute Comey Over Memos About Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department declined to prosecute the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey after determining that two memos he wrote about his interactions with President Trump contained classified information and examining whether he mishandled the documents, according to people familiar with the matter.
The F.B.I. upgraded the memos to confidential -- the lowest level in the government's system of classifying information -- shortly after the president fired Mr. Comey in May 2017, the people said. Mr. Comey had kept several memos at his home and shared one with a friend when he thought they contained only routine information, but the determination that some memos included classified material prompted the investigation into whether he mishandled them.
Prosecutors quickly determined the case did not warrant charges, the people said. It is not clear which memos spurred the inquiry, but the upgrade to confidential dealt with foreign relations, a person familiar with the classification review said.
The Justice Department's inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been investigating Mr. Comey's handling of the memos but has said little about the inquiry. A report on his findings is expected to be delivered by the fall.
John S. Lavinsky, a spokesman for the inspector general's office, declined to confirm or deny the existence of the investigation.
Mr. Comey's memos, first revealed in the days after his dismissal two years ago, jolted Washington and infuriated the president with their accounts of Mr. Trump's demands of loyalty from law enforcement. Mr. Comey later told lawmakers that he had sought to make them public in part to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
Mr. Comey wrote several memos after he met with Mr. Trump in the first days and weeks of his presidency, saying later that he worried that the president "might lie" about their discussions. Mr. Trump and his allies accused Mr. Comey of illegally leaking the memos as they tried to undermine his standing as a key witness in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
The F.B.I. collected four memos from Mr. Comey's house in Virginia in June 2017, and he told agents he had written two others but did not have them. The F.B.I. eventually recovered seven memos in total, which were later turned over to Mr. Mueller. Congress made the memos public in April 2018, and Mr. Comey wrote about them in a book published last year.
Mr. Comey showed copies of a memo to a friend, Daniel C. Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School, Mr. Richman has confirmed. "I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter," Mr. Comey testified to Congress in June 2017. "I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel."
Mr. Trump's request to Mr. Comey that the F.B.I. end an investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the president's first national security adviser, was revealed in a New York Times article that cited one of the memos. The Justice Department announced the appointment of a special counsel the next day.
"Confidential" is the lowest of the three classification levels established by an executive order that regulates the handling of government information deemed sensitive. The highest level, "top secret," is applied to information whose unauthorized disclosure could be expected to cause "exceptionally grave damage" to national security. Leaks of "secret" information would cause "serious damage" and of "confidential" information, mere "damage."
The Justice Department typically does not prosecute the mishandling of confidential information.
The Hill newspaper first reported that prosecutors had decided not to pursue Mr. Comey.
Congress released the bulk of the memos last year. News outlets, including The Times, have sued for their full text. But the F.B.I. has argued in the lawsuit that parts of the memos must remain private because of national security concerns.
In June, a Federal District Court judge in the District of Columbia upheld only some of the F.B.I.'s redactions, ruling that other information that officials had blacked out must be revealed.
The judge, James E. Boasberg, said that the F.B.I. had to peel back redactions in most of the information related to Mr. Flynn, deeming the F.B.I.'s arguments for secrecy inadequate.
"The bureau has provided no line of reasoning linking the disclosure of these redactions to any harm to the United States' relations with a foreign country or leader and a consequent harm to national security," Judge Boasberg wrote.
He also ordered the F.B.I. to be more transparent with some information in the memos concerning conversations that Mr. Comey and Mr. Trump had about leaders of other countries.
Mr. Comey's memos were also closely guarded pieces of evidence in the special counsel's investigation into whether the president obstructed justice, which ended this year. When news organizations first sued the Justice Department for access to them, prosecutors for Mr. Mueller told Judge Boasberg that making them public risked compromising testimony from those under investigation, who could have tailored their responses to line up with Mr. Comey's accounts.

Texto completo: The Jewish Week, the largest Jewish community newspaper for the largest Jewish community outside Israel -- that would be New York City's -- has announced its first new editor since 1993.
Andrew Silow-Carroll, the editor in chief of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, a news wire service, will assume the editorship next month, when The Jewish Week's longtime editor and publisher, Gary Rosenblatt, steps back. Rich Waloff, currently the associate publisher, will take over as publisher, Mr. Rosenblatt said.
The changes were announced a week after The Forward, the national Jewish newspaper that recently ended its print edition, named Jodi Rudoren, a New York Times managing editor, its next editor in chief.
Mr. Silow-Carroll, 58, said he wanted the paper to stay in the center of Jewish communal life, politically and otherwise, as it tries to survive despite a sharp decline in synagogue affiliation and a media environment that has decimated print weeklies. The Jewish Week's print circulation has slipped to around 40,000, from more than 65,000 in 2005, according to Mr. Waloff.
"It has to reach out to a new generation, which unfortunately doesn't have the same habits of journalism or Judaism," Mr. Silow-Carroll said.
The Jewish Week, which is published by the Jewish Week Media Group, a not-for-profit organization under New York law currently seeking tax-exempt status, has increasingly published investigative articles and stir-the-pot commentary.
Last year, it broke the news that Steven M. Cohen, a prominent sociologist of Jewry, had committed sexual misconduct against at least five women (Mr. Cohen did not contest the reporting and resigned from a position).
It also reported that Hillel International, the Jewish campus foundation, was investigating one of its biggest donors, the philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, for making sexually inappropriate remarks to an employee.
The article prompted an irate letter to the editor from a Jewish Week board member, along with further reporting by other outlets, including The Times, uncovering similar stories about Mr. Steinhardt. (Mr. Steinhardt has denied some allegations and said other remarks were intended humorously.)
Mr. Rosenblatt noted that in the battle to hold on to print readers and advertisers, The Jewish Week had an advantage that most newspapers did not.
"A number of our religiously observant readers don't go online on Shabbat and want to hold and read a newspaper," he said. "It's part of how we time our publication date."

Texto completo: Manhattan state prosecutors have subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to a hush payment to a former adult-film star during the 2016 election, according to a person familiar with the matter, the latest investigation to examine the company's involvement in the payment.
The subpoena sought documents from the company, owned by President Trump and managed by his sons, related to the $130,000 payment Michael Cohen, a former Trump lawyer, made to Stephanie Clifford in October 2016. Ms. Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, had alleged an affair with Mr. Trump, which he has denied.
The Manhattan district attorney's office has also subpoenaed American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer, people familiar with the matter said. American Media made another payment, also arranged by Mr. Cohen, to a former Playboy model who alleged an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has also denied that affair.
Mr. Cohen in August 2018 pleaded guilty to federal charges including two campaign-finance violations related to the hush payments, which he has said he arranged at Mr. Trump's direction. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. Mr. Cohen began a three-year prison sentence in May.
Share Your Thoughts
What do you think this new subpoena means for the Trump Organization? Join the conversation below.
Marc Mukasey, an attorney for the Trump Organization, called the investigation a "political hit job." In a statement, he said, "It's just harassment of the president, his family, and his business, using subpoenas and leaks as weapons. We will respond as appropriate."
The subpoenas were reported earlier by the New York Times.
A spokesman for Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, declined to comment.
The subpoenas come weeks after the federal probe into the hush-money payments, run by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, appeared to close without any indictments of Trump Organization executives.
Manhattan federal prosecutors advised the court last month that it had effectively concluded its campaign-finance investigation .
The Journal previously reported that prosecutors were examining discrepancies between Mr. Cohen's account and that of Allen Weisselberg, Trump Organization's longtime chief financial officer who testified before a grand jury last summer.
In addition the Manhattan district attorney's office, congressional investigators are continuing to probe the hush payments and what role Trump Organization executives played in them.
Last month, the House Oversight Committee chairman asked Manhattan federal prosecutors whether a Justice Department policy barring charges against a sitting president played any role in their decision not to indict Mr. Trump for campaign-finance violations in which he was implicated. The chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), also requested the evidence prosecutors gathered during their campaign-finance investigation.
When Mr. Cohen appeared in federal court in August 2018, he said he arranged the hush payments at the president's direction. Since then, prosecutors in December court filings have implicated the president in the scheme. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing.
The district attorney probe could investigate the way the Trump Organization accounted for the reimbursement it paid to Mr. Cohen for the payment he made to Ms. Clifford. Falsifying business records is illegal under state law.
Prosecutors said in a charging document that the Trump Organization accounted for the reimbursement checks to Mr. Cohen as "legal expenses," when, in fact, there was no such retainer agreement. The reimbursement Mr. Cohen sought was "not in connection with any legal services he had provided," prosecutors have said.
In testimony before the House Oversight Committee in February, Mr. Cohen showed a $35,000 check that Mr. Trump signed on Aug. 1, 2017, which Mr. Cohen said was one of the monthly installments he had received as reimbursement. He showed another signed by Mr. Trump's son, Donald Jr., and Mr. Weisselberg.
Mr. Vance's office is also pursuing criminal charges against Paul Manafort , the Journal reported earlier this year, raising the possibility that the former Trump campaign chairman could face legal liability even if the president pardons him of multiple federal crimes . Mr. Trump has said a pardon for Mr. Manafort, who was convicted of multiple federal crimes last year and who faces a two-decade federal prison sentence, is "not off the table." The president doesn't have the authority to pardon people convicted of state crimes.

Left Must Acknowledge Violence Against LGBTQ Palestinians

Texto completo: NO MATTER WHAT side of the Israeli-Palestinian divide you're on, and there are many, there are positions that some in the LGBTQ community are taking that might give us all reason to question cultural and political practices.
Were not going to debate religion or nationality here. Let's simply debate the politics. Israel has a government that has programs and policies that many consider to be diplomatic, but others consider anti-Palestinian. For that reason, some in the LGBTQ community have embraced a boycott of Israel. Such a boycott is not in itself anti-Semitic unless you connect it to religion and attack that religion rather than the state. That would be anti-Semitic.
So a boycott on political positions is acceptable if you agree that Israel is a bad actor against Palestinians. But does that mean you're pro-Palestine?
In the case of LGBTQ people or those who support the LGBTQ equality movement, being pro-Palestine is a dangerous position to take. The Palestinian authorities who control the West Bank, along with Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, are homophobic. LGBTQ activists should be calling them out for that homophobia. Those who don't call it out have a serious lack of knowledge of the culture and politics of the Middle East, particularly the practices of the Palestinians towards its LGBTQ citizens.
If you call out Uganda for its kill-the-gays law, why not also call out the Palestinians, who in the Gaza Strip have a similar law?
While I am a full supporter of the two-state solution, I am not a fan of the policies of the current Israeli government. I am a firm believer in the need for a Jewish state, and I would support an Islamic state if the Palestinians choose to have one. But I don't support the call for a boycott of Israel for a number of reasons.
Those calling for the boycott seem to be supporting people who embrace genocide of the LGBTQ community in Gaza and honor killings in the West Bank. LGBTQ people literally have to escape the region to save their lives. Many of them flee to Israel.
How bad is it? The grandson of Hamas founder/leader Sheikh Hassan Yousef, Mosab Hassan Yousef, had to escape, worried that he, too, would be executed. Yes, he's a gay man,.. and he is worried that his father would kill him in an honor killing. His father gave an interview where he clearly stated that if his son returned, he'd face Islamic justice. Even being the son of a leader is not a pass to be gay.
When asked if I support a boycott of Israel by someone in my community, I often ask, "Do you support a boycott of the Palestinian lands where LGBTQ people are killed?" They're often shocked by that answer. I follow up by telling them that I'm certainly not thrilled with the current government of the United States, but this is my country and I know the issues, and then I usually ask: "Do you think we should ask Israelis or Palestinians to boycott the U.S.?"
Rather than a boycott of a different culture, our time would be better utilized fighting injustice in our own. Yes, Israel might be unfair to Palestinians, but Palestinians still wish to murder LGBTQ people, and they publicly say so. And if you say it's just talk, just ask Mahmoud Ishtiwi, a former commander in the armed wing of Hamas, who according to the New York Times "was accused of moral turpitude, by which Hamas meant homosexuality," and then was tortured and shot to death in 2016. Whether he was gay is a matter of dispute. What is not in dispute is that Hamas used his homosexuality as a legitimate reason to kill him.
If you call out Israel for its treatment of Palestinians, why are you not calling out Palestinians for their treatment and killing of LGBTQ people? It speaks to the inability of people to understand the gravity of the murder of LGBTQ people under Palestinian control.
How dangerous is it for LGBTQ people in the Palestinian territories? There was a TV show last year in the West Bank and Gaza called Out of Focus. It was meant to be a comedy about a group of gay people living in Gaza. People demonstrated en masse in the streets and called for the actors' imprisonment, and the producers were called in for questioning by the Palestinian Authorities in Ramallah for breaking Islamic law. It was. taken off the air for being an offense against Islam simply for having LGBTQ characters.
Can you imagine, then, the treatment of real, live LGBTQ persons living under that threat? You don't have to. Just Google "Ramallah, LGBTQ." Ramallah is the capital of the West Bank. You'll discover that there are no LGBTQ organizations or public meeting places. Even Uganda has LGBTQ organizations.
So here's a suggestion for our leaders. The next time you are invited by the Palestinian Authority to visit the West Bank, simply ask, "When was the last time a LGBTQ person was killed?" When they don't give you a clear answer, you might remind them of Mahmoud Ishtiwi, and walk away.
Mark Segal is the nation's most awarded journalist in LGBTQ media and publisher of the Philadelphia Gay News. Flis memoir, And Then I Danced: Traveling the Road to LGBT Equality, was named best book by the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association. His activism began with Stonewall and The Gay Liberation Front in 1969.

Legalizing Marijuana

Texto completo: "The U.S. "war on drugs" - a decadeslong policy of racial and class suppression hidden behind cannabis criminality - has resulted in the arrest, interdiction and incarceration of a high percentage of Americans of color. The legal cannabis industry represents a great opportunity to help balance the detrimental effects of the war on drugs by creating an equal playing field for all people to benefit from the changing legal landscape." - Minority Cannabis Business Association
It's difficult to overstate how devastating America's racist "War on Drugs" has been for communities of color. Although Black and white people use marijuana at similar rates, Black people have been four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession.
In Michigan, which has already legalized marijuana for recreational use, a 68-year-old man named Michael Thompson is 25 years into a 40- to 60-year sentence stemming from the sale of three pounds of marijuana to an undercover officer.
Last week, Illinois made history when it passed a marijuana legalization law that seeks to atone for the injustice of the War on Drugs.
Illinois' law gives low-income communities of color - the very communities ripped apart by decades of racist drug policies - a fair shot at dispensary and grow-shop licenses. A portion of tax revenue generated by cannabis sales will be directed to investment in those communities through the Restore, Reinvest and Renew Program.
Under the new law, arrest records for possession of small amounts of marijuana will be expunged automatically and the board that makes clemency recommendations to the governor will receive a list of everyone convicted of minor possession offenses.
Nearly 800,000 criminal histories could be erased under the law.
We applaud Illinois historic achievement. We stand ready to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the law. We urge other states to follow Illinois' lead when crafting legislation to legalize marijuana by looking comprehensive at redress for past wrongs and creating economic opportunities for communities that bore, and continue to bear, the negative effects of the War on Drugs.
The history of cannabis in the United States - which became known as marijuana in the early 1900s - is fraught with racist hysteria. Following the Mexican Revolution, more than 890,000 Mexican people legally immigrated into the United States between 1910 and 1920. Even though cannabis long had been used in the United States as an ingredient in unregulated "patent medicines," the Spanish term marijuana became associated with fear and prejudice against new immigrants. By 1930, 16 states had outlawed prohibited marijuana as a way to target the growing Mexican community.
In 1971 President Richard M. Nixon launched the "War on Drugs," which was exposed in 2016 by White House Counsel John Ehrlichman as a political ploy to target African Americans and anti-war protesters. Two years after Nixon proclaimed drugs "public enemy number one," presidential hopeful Nelson Rockefeller, then-governor of New York, signed the most draconian drug statues in the nation, setting the sentence for selling two ounces of certain drugs, including cannabis, or possession of four ounces, at a minimum of 15 years to life in prison. The laws have been blamed for tripling New York's prison population.
Even now, as states have begun legalizing recreational marijuana use, recent investigation by The New York Times found that Black people were nearly 15 times more likely than whites to be arrested in New York City for low-level cannabis crimes.
It's going to take much more than simple legalization to level the playing field - and Illinois' new law recognizes the challenges.
Illinois will waive half of the application fee for license-seekers who are either long-term residents of a "disproportionately impacted area" or who have been incarcerated for a minor pot crime that is eligible for expungement under the bill.
These applicants who receive a license to grow or sell marijuana in Illinois will also be eligible for special low-interest loans from the state, direct grant aid for startup costs, and other benefits.
As Illinois state Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth said, "What we are doing here is about reparations. After 40 years of treating entire communities like criminals, here comes this multibillion-dollar industry, and guess what? Black and brown people have been put at the very center of this policy in a way that no other state has ever done."

Texto completo: Manhattan state prosecutors have subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to a hush payment to a former adult-film star during the 2016 election, according to a person familiar with the matter, the latest investigation to examine the company's involvement in the payment.
The subpoena sought documents from the company, owned by President Trump and managed by his sons, related to the $130,000 payment Michael Cohen, a former Trump lawyer, made to Stephanie Clifford in October 2016. Ms. Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, had alleged an affair with Mr. Trump, which he has denied.
The Manhattan district attorney's office has also subpoenaed American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer, people familiar with the matter said. American Media made another payment, also arranged by Mr. Cohen, to a former Playboy model who alleged an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has also denied that affair.
Mr. Cohen in August 2018 pleaded guilty to federal charges including two campaign-finance violations related to the hush payments, which he has said he arranged at Mr. Trump's direction. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. Mr. Cohen began a three-year prison sentence in May.
Marc Mukasey, an attorney for the Trump Organization, called the investigation a "political hit job." In a statement, he said, "It's just harassment of the president, his family, and his business, using subpoenas and leaks as weapons. We will respond as appropriate."
The subpoenas were reported earlier by the New York Times.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – As President Donald Trump doubles and triples down on attacks on legislators of color, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is staying out of the fray.
DeWine, a Republican, was elected last year after winning support from Trump and his one-time GOP rival then-governor John Kasich. DeWine said he will attend Trump's Cincinnati rally Thursday night at U.S. Bank Arena, and his role will be to introduce Vice President Mike Pence.
DeWine was asked by The Enquirer whether Ohioans should view his appearance at the rally as support for Trump's recent divisive tweets, which Trump critics, including a small number of Republicans, have called racist.
"I think you know throughout my career, you know, we have to denounce racism, anything that has to do with racism," DeWine said Tuesday, after signing the hemp bill at the Ohio State Fair. "Some people have interpreted his comments that way. Those are his comments."
Asked whether he interpreted them that way, DeWine said he's focused on his work in Ohio.
"My focus is on the state of Ohio. I'm not going to spend my time every day reading the Washington Post or the New York Times or see what's on CNN or Fox," DeWine said. "I have other things to do."
In a tweet two weeks ago, Trump said "progressive Democrat congresswomen" should "go back" to their countries. It was widely interpreted to target four minority representatives at odds with Democrat leadership – three of the four women were born in the U.S. and the fourth came to the U.S. as a child refugee.
DeWine told a Cleveland TV station Trump's comments were "not appropriate." (The following week, he attended a West Virginia fundraiser with the president.)
DeWine reiterated his position opposing the tweet on Tuesday.
"We have in this country from the beginning of this country a one-class citizenship – if you're a citizen, you're a citizen," DeWine said. "You have the same rights as any other citizen. That's not an appropriate thing to say, obviously, to tell someone to go back to their country."
Last weekend, Trump took to Twitter again, this time aiming missives at Rep. Elijah Cummings, an African-American Democrat whose Maryland district includes Baltimore. Trump said Cummings' minority-majority district was "a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess" compared to the clean conditions at immigration facilities near the Mexico border. In a subsequent Tweet, Trump called Cummings a racist.
During his 2018 campaign for governor, DeWine navigated the ongoing feud between Trump and Kasich. His line then was similar: He's focused on Ohio.
On the broader issue of civility and bipartisanship, DeWine, a former U.S. Senator and representative, emphasized that he and other Ohio politicians, from both parties, can work together on Ohio issues.
"As I traveled around the state the last few years, one of the things people always said to me was why don't you guys, meaning men and women in politics, get stuff done, work together and focus on our problems," DeWine said. "So that's what I'm doing and trying to do as governor each and every day so you'll have to excuse me if I don't follow what's going on in Washington every single day."
Gov. Mike DeWine appeared at a Trump campaign rally in Cleveland in 2018. DeWine says he will attend Trump's rally in Cincinnati today.

An Originalist Libel Defense

Texto completo: A federal judge in Kentucky dismissed high-school student Nicholas Sandmann's libel suit against the Washington Post last week. That's no vindication of the newspaper's skewed reporting on the teen's run-in with American Indian activist Nathan Phillips on the National Mall in January. But it's a vindication of the First Amendment's limitations on state libel law, which have come under scrutiny of late, including from President Trump and Justice Clarence Thomas.
Mr. Sandmann and his peers were targeted by a Twitter mob, and the Post joined in portraying him as the villain in a "white privilege" morality play. Mr. Sandmann claimed the Post had defamed him by repeating Mr. Phillips's claim that Mr. Sandmann had physically "blocked" him. That judge held that was an opinion, not a factual claim, and therefore shielded by the First Amendment.
That conclusion may be debatable, but the First Amendment's protection of opinion shouldn't be. It is the legal expression of America's "national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open," as Justice William Brennan put it in
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), which established that the Constitution imposes limits on state libel law.
Mr. Trump said in 2016 that he wanted to "open up" libel laws, and in February Justice Thomas wrote a solo opinion arguing that Sullivan departs from the Constitution's original meaning. He has a point: Brennan's reasoning is all policy. For decades, originalists like Justice Antonin Scalia have criticized it as an exercise of raw judicial power. Yet there's a good originalist case for limits on libel law.
Sullivan established that government officials suing for defamation must demonstrate that the defendant either knew that the defamatory statements were false or acted with "reckless disregard" for their accuracy -- a standard confusingly known as "actual malice." Later decisions extended the requirement to all "public figures," whether or not they hold office.
Sullivan made it far more difficult for plaintiffs to win libel suits, even for statements that are false and seriously damaging. That price is worth paying, the justices reasoned, to provide breathing room for "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open" debate of public issues, given that inadvertent falsehoods are inevitable. Critics blame Sullivan for declining journalistic standards -- including the Post's mobbing of Mr. Sandmann and his classmates.
But that's all policy. What about the law?
Sullivan was right to recognize the Constitution's relevance in libel cases. It doesn't matter that libel suits are brought by private parties, rather than the state, because it is the state's law that imposes the liability. If the First Amendment precludes a statute imposing fines for speech criticizing government officials, why would the constitutional analysis be different for a law that awards money to a plaintiff?
And while it may be that "the freedom of speech" recognized by the First Amendment does not protect defamatory speech -- which was Scalia's view and apparently is Justice Thomas's -- no one seriously argues that a state can punish any speech it wants, free from constitutional scrutiny, merely by labeling it "defamation." That means the court has to define the term somehow.
For all Justice Thomas's criticism of Sullivan, he doesn't take issue with its conclusion that the Constitution limits the reach of libel law. His beef is with the actual-malice standard. And that's where things get complicated.
To begin with, he doesn't say what he thinks the proper constitutional standard should be. He observes that judge-made common law provides the "backdrop" for understanding the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and the press, and he cites cases showing that the adoption of the First and 14th amendments "did not abrogate the common law of libel." That suggests he would have courts scrutinize libel claims for whether they comport with the historical understanding of defamation -- if so, the speech would be unprotected. As he notes, it was black-letter law at the time of the framing that a libel plaintiff didn't have to assert actual malice at the outset of the case.
But plaintiffs often did have to prove actual malice to prevail. The law recognized circumstances in which a libel defendant could assert a "qualified" or "defeasible" immunity from damages and thereby put the plaintiff to the burden of proving "express" or "actual" malice under more or less the same standard Sullivan prescribed. One musty treatise, published in 1877, reports such immunity applies whenever the speaker has a "legal, social, or moral" duty to comment on another's character, fitness or conduct, including in matters of business, crime, morality or religion. Moreover, libel claims concerning government officials' conduct were often subject to the actual-malice standard, as were claims for punitive damages. Sullivan's reasoning was loose, but it didn't fashion actual malice out of whole cloth.
And it may be that Justice Thomas's understanding of the First Amendment is wrong. What if "the freedom of speech" does protect defamation? There was no reason for it to be excluded. James Madison's view was that freedom of speech should be understood as a broad natural right, not a specialized legal concept. The only other appearance of "speech" in the Constitution is the Speech or Debate Clause, which completely immunizes members of Congress from liability for legislative speech. The federal government had no general authority to punish or regulate libel. No one expected in 1789 that the First Amendment would apply to state law, and it didn't until it was incorporated under the 14th Amendment.
Yet this poses a conundrum: Imposing so strict a rule on the states would abolish libel laws altogether. Among the ways a court might reconcile the First and 14th amendments, actual malice has the benefits of historical pedigree, practical experience, and balancing vigorous public debate with at least some compensation and deterrence.
Modern originalism is young, and answers to these questions of original meaning often involve some doubt. Yet the Sullivan court might have stumbled onto a standard that comports with the Constitution.

Planned Parenthood needs abortion

Texto completo: There are public relations problems and there are public relations crises. Then there is what Planned Parenthood is experiencing with the departure of its former president, Dr. Leana Wen.
Wen, the first doctor to run the abortion chain in nearly five decades, is not going quietly into the night. Rather, she is essentially blowing the whistle on the organization on her way out the door, making her the most senior staff member ever to publicly duke it out with the billion dollar behemoth.
Wen smartly got ahead of the narrative, laying down rhetorical stakes in a tweet immediately after news broke of her firing. She and Planned Parenthood had "philosophical differences." She wanted Planned Parenthood to prioritize women's health. The board did not.
In a piece for the Sunday pages of The New York Times, Wen expanded on what she meant by women's health. Planned Parenthood has a duty, she argued, "to increase care for women before, during and after pregnancies," care such as mental health care for women suffering from postpartum depression or treatment for pregnant women struggling with addiction. Though I am an ardent anti-abortion activist, I found myself admiring Wen for what is clearly a genuine commitment to providing care and treatment to women as a whole.
Women's health as a front, not an aim Here's why I also admire Wen. As she makes clear, the board that hired her tasked her with refashioning the organization — beleaguered by things like prior President Cecile Richards' highly publicized admission that Planned Parenthood doesn't offer mammograms, or campaigns catching them offering ultrasounds only to confirm fetal gestational age for an abortion — as one that is about women's health, not just abortion advocacy.
With a wink and nod of course.
No doubt what the board really meant was Wen should pretend Planned Parenthood care about the full spectrum of women's health, not actually start implementing programs that amounted to "mission creep," as anonymous staff called it in The Times. Board members wanted to use Wen's medical credentials and obvious passion for women's health care to prop up the sagging myth that Planned Parenthood is more than just the most well-oiled abortion lobbying machine in the world.
Planned Parenthood is vulnerable Then came the biggest legal and financial blow dealt to Planned Parenthood perhaps ever. Undoubtedly, it was expecting the new regulation from the Department of Health and Human Services requiring family planning clinics that receive taxpayer dollars not to promote abortion as a method of family planning to be struck down in court. Shockingly, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rule, meaning that tens of millions of Planned Parenthood dollars, in addition to its entire business model, are now on the line.
The day after the Trump administration announced it would begin enforcing the rule immediately, Wen was out.
Coincidence? Hardly.
Wen's departure has left Planned Parenthood perhaps more exposed than ever. She didn't just ding the organization for failing to prioritize women's health. She irreversibly exploded the myth that comprehensive women's health is something it cares about.
Wen also revealed her willingness and interest in working with those who disagreed about abortion. Though her goal was, as she put it, "to normalize abortion care as the health care it is," she also wanted to help find "space for those of us in the middle to come together around shared values."
The problem is that, for pro-lifers, there is no middle ground on abortion. It is, every single time, the unjust and violent taking of a life from the most vulnerable class of human beings. We will never stop working until it is not just illegal but unthinkable. An important part of that work is exposing Planned Parenthood for what it really is, a taxpayer-funded abortion political advocacy group and abortion chain. By firing its best hope at masking that reality, Planned Parenthood is now doing our work for us.

Texto completo: Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar took a subtle jab at Republican Sen. Rand Paul on Monday, sharing a tweet that referenced him being attacked on his lawn in November 2017.
In response to Paul's interview with Breitbart News, in which the Kentucky senator offered to pay a plane ticket for the Minnesota representative to visit her home country of Somalia to learn to be more grateful of the United States, actor Tom Arnold took to Twitter Monday morning to mock Paul.
"Imagine being Rand Paul's next door neighbor and having to deal with @RandPaul lying cowardly circular whiney bullcrap about lawn clippings," Arnold tweeted. "No wonder he ripped his toupee off."
The tweet, which Omar subsequently retweeted, referenced one of Paul's neighbors, Rene Boucher, assaulting the senator while he was mowing his lawn in 2017. The incident resulted in Paul suffering several broken ribs. Boucher served a 30-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to assaulting a member of Congress.
An Omar spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about Paul's interview. However, others, such as Arnold and Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, did condemn Paul.
"Continued efforts to paint Congresswoman Ilhan Omar as anything less than a proud American are offensive to say the least," Yarmuth, chairman of the House Budget Committee, previously told the Courier Journal. "It's safe to say that Ilhan understands Somalia a lot better than Rand, and he'd be better suited just keeping quiet than making foolish and condescending remarks like this one."
Omar is one of four congresswomen — known as "The Squad" — who President Donald Trump told to "go back" to their ancestors' countries instead of criticizing U.S. policies.
A few days later, Trump held a campaign rally in North Carolina where the crowd chanted "send her back" when the president spoke of Omar, a Somalian refugee who came to the U.S. as a child in 1992.
Trump condemned the chant when later asked by reporters, but he subsequently called those who attended the rally "patriots" in later comments.
Omar wrote in a recent op-ed in The New York Times that the "send her back" chant "will be a defining moment in American history."
"Throughout history, demagogues have used state power to target minority communities and political enemies, often culminating in state violence," Omar said in the op-ed. "Today, we face that threat in our own country, where the president of the United States is using the influence of our highest office to mount racist attacks on communities across the land."

For a great pasta salad, think quality over quantity

Texto completo: As much of a recipe and rule follower as I am, I do enjoy going off-script and improvising. I get to feel creative and, ideally, use up odds and ends around the house, or capitalize on what looks the best that moment at the farmers market.
The summer staple pasta salad is one of those ideal winging-it kind of dishes, but you want to put some thought into it. Here are tips for making your best one yet.
Avoid the kitchen-sink mentality. "Just because you're making a pasta salad, don't succumb to the compulsion to empty the contents of your refrigerator into the bowl," former Post recipe editor Stephanie Witt Sedgwick wrote in 2005. "A well-made salad deserves fresh ingredients."
Quality, in other words, is much more important than quantity. At its most basic form, "You just need a nice tomato, some pasta, olive oil and salt and pepper," says chef Amy Brandwein of Centrolina in Washington. "You don't really need that much else." Pick a few ingredients and let them shine, ideally without drowning them in dressing.
Choose a good shape. "Things with ridges are great," Brandwein says. Look for shapes that will allow sauces and ingredients to cling to them. Top contenders include fusilli, rotini, orecchiette, shells, farfalle (bow tie) and campanelle. After using ditalini in a pasta salad, I'm sold on adding it to my playbook. Its tiny tubes were uniform in size with the kernels of corn and diced tomatoes. Because pasta salads are such common on-the-go, potluck dishes, stick with shorter shapes that are easily scooped and eaten standing up (or hunched over a desk?). Longer shapes are not only trickier to eat in certain situations, but also more prone to breaking when cold.
Cook it properly. Suggested strategies differ here, and I can see the rationale behind all of them. The most typical advice is to cook the pasta to the point where it still has a little bit of bite left and isn't completely soft. Brandwein says the pasta will continue to cook a bit as it cools anyway, and keeping the noodles on the firmer side will prevent them from turning to mush in the salad. Her preferred strategy is to toss the cooked pasta with olive oil and let it cool on a sheet pan.
Sedgwick recommends taking the cooling a step further by rinsing the cooked pasta under cold water. "Rinsing the just-cooked pasta extracts excess starch that can make the pasta gluey, ensures that the pasta will stay firm and eliminates the need for a lot of dressing," she writes. On the other hand, Melissa Clark at the New York Times recently suggested tossing hot pasta with dressing to keep the pasta from sticking together and to help it soak up flavor.
To throw a completely different possibility in the mix, Annie Petito at Cook's Illustrated turns conventional wisdom on its head by suggesting you cook your pasta several minutes past the slightly firm (al dente in commonspeak) stage. "Just as leftover rice hardens when it is refrigerated, al dente pasta tastes overly firm once it cools," she explains. That is a result of starch that pulls back together once the pasta cools and traps water. When you slightly overcook the pasta, her argument goes, by the time it hardens, it will achieve the right texture.
The fact of the matter is that no matter which strategy you choose, your pasta salad will likely be fine. Think about which method seems most reasonable/easiest to you, as well as how you plan to dress your salad and how much of that dressing you want to use. You're experimenting with pasta, which is pennies per serving. Don't sweat it.
Dress judiciously. "The flavor in a pasta salad should come from its guest stars - fresh herbs, cheese, vegetables, meat. The oil and the vinegar just help them along," according to Sedgwick. "Always start with less dressing than you think you will need." For her part, Brandwein is not a fan of vinegar or vinaigrettes in salad. She thinks they eat away at the pasta. Instead, she prefers to dress pasta salad with olive oil and lemon juice for acidity. But if you do plan on using vinegar or a vinegar-based dressing, especially if you're assembling in advance, you may want to hold off on adding it until shortly before you plan to serve the salad.
Prep. When you think about typical pasta salad add-ins, "a lot of these things need to be cooked first," Brandwein says. She includes broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini and greens on that list. Hard pieces of vegetables, especially with softer pasta, aren't something she likes, and raw vegetables will not soak up flavors as well. Roasting and, especially, grilling will improve texture and flavor. Hold off on more delicate ingredients, such as herbs, until the last minute. Brandwein also prefers to add tomatoes at the end so they don't get watery and mealy.
Put it all together. Go as traditional or eccentric as you want. "There's no need to reinvent the wheel," Sedgwick advises. "Pick pairings you know work: mozzarella and basil; chicken and tarragon; Parmesan cheese and, well, anything." No matter what you want to include, it's worthwhile to take colors, textures and taste into account. Ingredients such as capers or olives can add enticing pops of briny flavor. Your cheese can be assertive and distinct (cubes of feta, curls of Parmigiano-Reggiano) or creamy and mellow (ricotta stirred in, torn pieces of mozzarella). Or finely chop some anchovies for an umami hit, as Brandwein recommends. Pasta salad also takes well to the addition of proteins such as chicken, salmon and even sausage, which can help elevate it out of side dish territory.

Texto completo: DETROIT - It has been building since the first primary debate in Miami ended, and on Tuesday night, it broke out into the open, a full-scale ideological brawl about the direction of the Democratic Party and what it will take to defeat President Trump in 2020.
In Miami, the presidential candidates collectively advocated for policies that highlighted the party's dramatic shift to the left, including government-run health care that would eliminate private insurance, the decriminalization of the southern border and health care for undocumented immigrants. On Tuesday, the moderates in the field pushed back.
The fault line that was exposed between left and center now fully defines the Democratic nomination contest and will continue to do so as the candidates move through the summer and fall and head toward the primaries and caucuses early next year. It ultimately will be up to Democratic voters to resolve the differences, but the choices have become clearer and will now become harder to paper over.
The targets Tuesday were two of the most liberal and leading candidates in the field, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who were accused of embracing "free-everything . . . fairy tale" policies and making "impossible promises" that could compromise the party's chances of winning back voters they lost in 2016 - a loss that cost them the White House.
Warren and Sanders more than stood their ground during two spirited hours of sharp and passionate exchanges. At one point, a frustrated Warren shot back to one of her principal antagonists, former congressman John Delaney (Md.), "I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for. . . . I'm ready to get in this fight. I'm ready to win this fight."
Ahead of Tuesday's debate, there were questions about whether either a rising Warren or a slipping Sanders, competing for many of the same voters, would go at each other. Instead, they were forced into solidarity, at least for the night, after they came under assault during the other candidates' opening statements.
It began with Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who did not qualify for the first debate in Miami and was under pressure to make his mark quickly. "Watching that last debate," he said, "folks seemed more concerned about scoring points or outdoing each other with wish-list economics than making sure Americans know we hear their voices and will help their lives."
Moments later, Delaney, who has been in the race longer than anyone but has little to show for it, was even more pointed. "Folks, we have a choice," he said. "We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare-for-all, free everything and impossible promises that will turn off independent voters and get Trump reelected."
But they were not the only ones to challenge Warren and Sanders. Critiques came from former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio). Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., sought to walk a careful line between the two wings, as did former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.). Author Marianne Williamson, animated as much as anyone, found ways to go in both directions.
Health care dominated the early portion of the debate, and it turned into the most pointed discussion of whether the party should embrace Medicare-for-all and the elimination of private health insurance or pursue a path that would build on the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option or another plan to provide universal coverage. It was, as Hickenlooper cast it, a question of "an evolution, not a revolution."
Sanders, who was far more energetic Tuesday than he was in Miami, has said repeatedly that his plan would require raising taxes on the middle class, although he added that, in the end, Americans would pay less overall for their health care than they are now paying.
CNN moderator Jake Tapper pressed Warren and others who favor Medicare-for-all to answer whether they would do the same. Warren hedged. "So giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more," she said. "Middle-class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care."
Ryan said that Medicare-for-all would mean that union workers, who have negotiated for good health-care coverage sometimes at the expense of wage increases, would lose those benefits. Sanders insisted that his plan would allow for benefits as good or better than what those workers now have.
"You don't know that, Bernie," Ryan responded.
"I do know it," Sanders replied. "I wrote the damn bill."
The sparring that began Tuesday will no doubt be repeated on Wednesday, when former vice president Joe Biden, who has clashed with Sanders over health care, will be at center stage and looking to improve on a lackluster performance in Miami.
He will be next to Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), whose attack on Biden in Miami became the most memorable moment of the two June nights, and he could tangle with Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who has been aggressive in signaling his differences. But those battles will have to compete with the other questions left unresolved on Tuesday night.
Among the Democrats, there is clear sensitivity to how Trump's reelection campaign will attempt to lump all the candidates together, painting the party's eventual nominee with a broad brush no matter his or her positions. Sanders made reference to that issue, challenging the premise of some of the questions, calling one a "Republican talking point."
"It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say," Buttigieg said at one point. "It's true that if we embrace a far-left agenda, they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they're going to do? They're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists."
But many Democrats do worry. Not just how the Republicans will attempt to brand their nominee and the party but the degree to which a historically liberal agenda would make winning states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin far more difficult.
Hickenlooper said elements of the Green New Deal, a liberal climate change plan, would be "a disaster at the ballot box. You might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump."
Ahead of Tuesday's debate, the candidates received unsolicited advice from some of the party's current and former elected officials. The message: Don't make Detroit a rerun of Miami.
Rahm Emanuel, a former mayor of Chicago and a veteran of the Obama and Clinton White House teams, put it bluntly in a publicly posted memo to candidates on Monday that criticized the candidates' performances in Miami.
"Too often, you succumbed to chasing plaudits on Twitter, which closed the door on swing voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio," he wrote. "If you win the nomination in a way that forecloses a path to victory in the general election, we will lose, and your name will go down in infamy."
The Trump campaign found Emanuel's memo so appealing that its rapid response operation sent out an email Tuesday morning pointing to it. Beyond that, the president's campaign took out ads in the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press with a message that the Democrats would move the country dangerously to the left if their nominee wins in 2020. "They're all the same," the ad read, following by a subheadline that proclaimed: "Democrat plans to wreck America."
Many Democratic strategists dismiss such charges, as the candidates did on Tuesday night. But several Democratic governors recently expressed their concerns to the New York Times, and on Tuesday, the Democratic Governors Association urged the contenders to follow the lead of the governors and other Democrats who won in 2018 by emphasizing "kitchen table" issues.
Tuesday's debate brought to the surface the substantive differences and questions of political strategy that the Democrats now must resolve among themselves before they will be truly ready to take on the president in November 2020.

Texto completo: Older Americans face a housing crisis. Here’s what Congress should do about it.
Retirement savings reform isn’t a hot topic for journalists, but it’s one of the few areas where Democrats and Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump could pull off some bipartisan reform when legislators reassemble in September.
The list of necessary fixes to current law is long and well known: As people live longer, the rules regarding “required minimum distributions” from savings plans need to have their age triggers increased. Overall maximum contribution levels should rise. Defined-contribution plans ought to be available for groups of employers so the costs of establishing and maintaining the accounts are not so high.
The amount of assets that Americans have stashed away for retirement is significant. The Investment Company Institute reported that the total of such assets stood at $28 trillion at the end of the first quarter, with $7.7 trillion in defined-contribution plans and $9.2 trillion in individual retirement accounts. Many Americans have little or no retirement savings, but a lot of Americans are regular contributors to their long-term fiscal health.
Most attention gets paid, understandably, to those who will depend entirely or nearly entirely on Social Security, with much less focus on those with healthier balances in their retirement savings. When Congress gets to retirement reform in the fall - Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon lead the effort - congressmen ought to pause and consider how they can use their reform efforts to also help seniors stay in their homes as incomes decline or stop but mortgage payments stretch out into the future. Older Americans on fixed incomes face a housing crisis, and one part of the solution is retirement reform.
The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University found that nearly three-quarters of senior Americans want to live in their own homes as they age. But because “housing is the single biggest item in most household budgets,” Aging Options reports, “housing-related expenses disproportionately affect a senior’s financial security and their ability to save for the future.” The burden of housing costs got heavier when Congress severely limited the deductibility of home mortgage interest in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
If retirement reform allows seniors to pay off all or part of their home mortgage debt with money saved in their own retirement accounts without triggering taxes on the money used, then Congress will have taken a big step toward solving one part of this problem. Seniors with mortgages would then have the option of offloading their mortgage debt using money saved for their retirement without first having to pay federal and state income taxes on the money used to pay off the home loan. Millions of seniors would find themselves without a mortgage bill to pay and not facing a staggering tax bill as a consequence.
The Urban Institute concluded that the most valuable nonfinancial asset in the United States is a home, and that 69 percent of all families own one. Housing is the key element of financial security in retirement. Allowing Americans to use the money they have saved to pay off the homes they have purchased is the most obvious “fix” in the world, but congressional staffers I have asked about this always reply that it increases the risk of seniors having lower incomes from savings while also reducing future tax receipts. The latter objection makes little sense, as the taxable event of a withdrawal to pay off mortgage debt can simply be postponed from the date of the withdrawal to the date of the sale of the home.
What opponents of allowing Americans to use their money to lower or eliminate housing costs won’t see or refuse to admit is that retirement security begins with a place to live. A senior American doesn’t need as much savings if his or her home loans are paid off. This should be a no-brainer for every legislator, but it’s not part of the draft laws circulating though the House or Senate.
Current data is difficult to find, but a 2012 New York Times story found that 1.5 million homeowners over 55 lost their homes between 2007 and 2011, with the largest group being over 75 years of age. Those years followed the panic, of course, but even if seniors with mortgage debt are not losing their homes, they are enjoying life less if they are making a mortgage payment they could avoid if their own retirement assets were available to pay off the mortgage.
The biggest obstacle to this obvious reform is the same one to most reforms: Permanent D.C. didn’t think it up and hasn’t internalized its logic. Maybe Grassley can change that, and in so doing, improve the quality of retirement for millions of Americans.

Dr. Leana Wen's departure from Planned Parenthood exposes its true identity | Guestview

Texto completo: There are public relations problems and there are public relations crises. Then there is what Planned Parenthood is experiencing with the departure of its former president, Dr. Leana Wen.
Wen, the first doctor to run the abortion chain in nearly five decades, is not going quietly into the night. Rather, she is essentially blowing the whistle on the organization on her way out the door, making her the most senior staff member ever to publicly duke it out with the billion dollar behemoth.
Wen smartly got ahead of the narrative, laying down rhetorical stakes in a tweet immediately after news broke of her firing. She and Planned Parenthood had "philosophical differences. " She wanted Planned Parenthood to prioritize women’s health. The board did not.
In a piece for the Sunday pages of The New York Times, Wen expanded on what she meant by women’s health. Planned Parenthood has a duty, she argued, “to increase care for women before, during and after pregnancies,” care such as mental health care for women suffering from postpartum depression or treatment for pregnant women struggling with addiction. Though I am an ardent anti-abortion activist, I found myself admiring Wen for what is clearly a genuine commitment to providing care and treatment to women as a whole.
Women's health as a front, not an aim
Here’s why I also admire Wen. As she makes clear, the board that hired her tasked her with refashioning the organization — beleaguered by things like prior President Cecile Richards' highly publicized admission that Planned Parenthood doesn’t offer mammograms, or campaigns catching them offering ultrasounds only to confirm fetal gestational age for an abortion — as one that is about women’s health, not just abortion advocacy.
Abortion access: Texas made it hard to have my abortion. With Roe at stake, I’m going home to expand access.
With a wink and nod of course.
No doubt what the board really meant was Wen should pretend Planned Parenthood care about the full spectrum of women’s health, not actually start implementing programs that amounted to “mission creep,” as anonymous staff called it in The Times. Board members wanted to use Wen’s medical credentials and obvious passion for women’s health care to prop up the sagging myth that Planned Parenthood is more than just the most well-oiled abortion lobbying machine in the world. No doubt Wen figured it out, and refused to play along.
Planned Parenthood is vulnerable
Then came the biggest legal and financial blow dealt to Planned Parenthood perhaps ever. Undoubtedly, it was expecting the new regulation from the Department of Health and Human Services requiring family planning clinics that receive taxpayer dollars not to promote abortion as a method of family planning to be struck down in court. Shockingly, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rule, meaning that tens of millions of Planned Parenthood dollars, in addition to its entire business model, are now on the line.
The day after the Trump administration announced it would begin enforcing the rule immediately, Wen was out.
Coincidence? Hardly.
Commonality across politics: I'm pro-life, but I have a lot in common with Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards
Wen’s departure has left Planned Parenthood perhaps more exposed than ever. She didn’t just ding the organization for failing to prioritize women’s health. She irreversibly exploded the myth that comprehensive women’s health is something it cares about. The proof is Planned Parenthood's willingness to take the extreme public heat for firing a passionate young doctor, and a minority immigrant at that, eight months into the job because the board so badly wants to protect access to abortion and little else. That board members were OK with being exposed as a pure political advocacy group despite the public relations toll it would bear belies just how extreme they have become.
Wen forced out for moderation
Wen also revealed her willingness and interest in working with those who disagreed about abortion. Though her goal was, as she put it, “to normalize abortion care as the health care it is,” she also wanted to help find “space for those of us in the middle to come together around shared values. ”
The problem is that, for pro-lifers, there is no middle ground on abortion. It is, every single time, the unjust and violent taking of a life from the most vulnerable class of human beings. We will never stop working until it is not just illegal but unthinkable. An important part of that work is exposing Planned Parenthood for what it really is, a taxpayer-funded abortion political advocacy group and abortion chain. By firing its best hope at masking that reality, Planned Parenthood is now doing our work for us.

Fed puts its credibility on the line with plan to cut rates while US economy is still healthy

Texto completo: The Federal Reserve is about to do something unusual: Cut interest rates when the US economy is in good shape.
Central bank officials are all but certain to announce the reduction, the first since 2008, when they wrap up their two-day meeting on Wednesday. They will cast the move, which has been telegraphed for weeks, as insurance against the rising risk of a recession. The Fed almost always lowers rates when the economy has already run out of gas.
“It's better to take preventative measures than to wait for disaster to unfold," John Williams, vice chairman of the Fed's rate-setting committee, said in a speech earlier this month.
Williams, who is also president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was speaking about monetary policy theory, not this week's meeting. Still, he sent a clear signal that the Fed is prepared to give the economy a booster shot sooner rather than later.
But the Fed's insurance strategy comes with its own risks — most notably, that it won't work.
The economy, which is in the midst of a record-long expansion, is flashing contradictory signals, making it hard to forecast what direction it will take in the months ahead. Moreover, even after raising rates nine times since the Great Recession, the current target for the Fed's benchmark rate — 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent — is low by historical standards. The expected quarter-point cut may not do much, and leave officials less leverage when — not if — the next recession hits.
“The Fed is not husbanding its ammunition wisely," said Robert Pozen, a former chairman of MFS Investment Management in Boston and now a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “Instead, it's setting the expectation that it will bail out the economy at every little sign of softness."
Here's a look at what's at stake for the Fed and for us regular folk.
The backdrop
The economy has been growing since 2009, but the pace slowed in the second quarter of this year to 2.1 percent from 3.1 percent in the first three months. While that's still a respectable rate, some other recent data have been worrisome.
Manufacturing and business investment have waned; growth in China and Europe is weak, which saps demand for American exports; and long-term bond rates are lower than short-term yields, a reversal of the usual relationship that is considered a recession warning.
On the plus side, the job market is strong, with unemployment hovering at 50-year lows, and consumers remain upbeat. Stocks are trading at record highs.
The inflation mystery
Normally, the Fed would not be lowering rates under such relatively healthy conditions. But these aren't exactly normal times.
First, the chaotic trade situation has hurt business confidence and made life difficult for automakers, farmers, and companies reliant on Chinese customers. The Fed has pointed to global trade as a main area of concern.
Second, inflation has not picked up as would be expected when the jobless rate stands at 3.8 percent. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge hasn't consistently hit its 2 percent target for years. Last year, when it looked like prices were finally picking up, policy makers raised rates four times and planned to continue the hikes this year to keep costs from getting out of hand.
But after the fourth increase, in December — and a lot of criticism from investors and President Trump — the Fed had a change of heart. Chairman Jerome Powell pledged to be patient and make future decisions based on the data coming into the Fed. The predicted uptick in inflation never came. The Fed has held rates steady since then.
Why has such low unemployment not driven up wages and other costs, as Economics 101 teaches it should?
“Economists don't understand it," said Chester Spatt, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business and a visiting professor at the Sloan School. “I would have never thought you'd have the Fed cutting rates when unemployment is so low."
The Fed, like a ref who blew a call earlier in the game, may be trying to correct for that final rate hike.
“Milton Friedman had his famous saying that 'inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,' " said Peter Ireland, a professor of economics at Boston College and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. “And if you believe that, it pushes you strongly toward thinking that the December rate increase was a misstep that ought to be reversed."
Risky business
The Fed has backed itself into a corner, putting its credibility on the line.
I defended Powell when Trump attacked him and his colleagues for raising rates last year. I don't believe they are prepping to cut rates now just to please the president. I do think they've become too accommodating of big investors.
Yes, a sustained market sell-off can have an impact on the real economy, which is one reason why the Fed paused its credit tightening after last fall's stock rout. But now, acting without any imminent threats, policy makers seem too eager to avoid another market meltdown.
I get it: Powell doesn't want a recession on his hands. Low, even negative rates, in other countries complicate his job by driving up the value of the dollar, making US products more expensive overseas.
But he's setting the Fed up for potential problems down the road.
“Not only will rate cuts leave the Fed with less room, it could destroy the Fed's credibility just when the Fed needs it most," said Megan Greene, an economist and senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard's Kennedy School. “If rate cuts don't boost inflation and growth — and I don't think they will — then no one will believe in the Fed's tools when the next recession hits. A central bank without credibility is completely ineffectual."
What's next?
After Wednesday's rate cut, the Fed could nudge rates down another quarter-point this year, perhaps at its September meeting.
Barring an unexpected disaster — military confrontation with Iran, complete collapse of trade talks with China — investors will push stocks higher. And they'll take increasingly more risk to make up for the lack of yield in safer bond investments. Savers will be squeezed once more.
Dan Kern, chief investment officer at TFC Financial in Boston, doesn't see the harm in the Fed trimming rates a couple of times this year, especially with inflation quiescent.
He argues that while Powell hasn't acknowledged this explicitly, the easing is designed not only to benefit the US economy, but other countries, too.
The United States “is no longer insulated from the rest of the world," he said.
Very true.
But as Kern told me, “There is a fine line between being sensitive to market dynamics and being reactive to market sentiment."
Powell is walking that fine line. Let's hope he keeps his balance.

Texto completo: Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. went through separate staff shake-ups Monday, as Uber cut about 400 jobs in its marketing department and Lyft eliminated the role of chief operating officer.
The two ride-hailing companies have been under pressure from Wall Street amid heavy losses and disappointing market debuts, with both stocks still sagging below their initial public offering prices.
Uber cut about one-third of its marketing arm in a reorganization of a division that had grown to around 1,200 employees, an Uber spokesman said. Less than two months ago, marketing was put under the portfolio of Jill Hazelbaker, who previously ran communications and policy.
In an email to staff, Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi wrote that the cuts are part of an effort to become more agile amid concerns about slowing growth.
"Put simply, we need to get our edge back. Being fast wins," he wrote. "Many of our teams are too big, which creates overlapping work."
The Uber staff cuts were reported earlier by the New York Times.
Lyft said in an email to staff Monday that Jon McNeill -- a former Tesla Inc. executive who was hired in early 2018 as chief operating officer -- is leaving the company and that his roles will be distributed to other executives.
Lyft Chief Executive Logan Green and President John Zimmer said in the email that it was "with gratitude that we say goodbye" to Mr. McNeill. The message didn't offer further detail on the reason for his departure.
Mr. McNeill's focus at Lyft included driver supply and retention, a critical issue for ride-sharing companies. He received compensation valued at $32.8 million in 2018, including a $420,000 bonus "in recognition of his outstanding leadership and contributions to our 2018 performance," according to regulatory filings. Mr. McNeill's departure was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

ONLY IN THE AJC HIGHER EDUCATION: 3 Georgia universities have financial ties to Saudi Arabia: More than 20% of foreign money at Tech, Emory is from Saudis.

Texto completo: After a series of recent protests sparked by the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, some have questioned whether universities should continue accepting money from Saudi Arabian donors, The New York Times reported.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology began "reassessing" its relationship with the country after Khashoggi's October 2018 death, which the United Nations found was likely ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. At Harvard University, an administrator said the school would stop reserving seats in a summer program for Saudi students sponsored by bin Salman's foundation, The Times reported.
In Georgia, three of the state's top universities still have contracts with Saudi donors. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked Georgia Tech, the University of Georgia and Emory University if The Washington Post reporter's death will affect their relationships with the country in the future, once those contracts expire. From their responses, that is not clear.
The Department of Education's foreign gift log tracked money given to U.S. colleges and universities from other countries from 2012 to 2018. Collectively, Saudi benefactors donated more than $10.6 billion to U.S. colleges and universities in that period.
The log shows money from Saudi universities, companies and government agencies account for more than a fifth at Tech and Emory.
At Tech, Saudi donations and contracts made up 25% of foreign funds and totaled about $14.7 million, the largest amount, according to an AJC analysis of the database. At Emory University, the Saudi amount was nearly 22%, second only to England, and totaled around $8.4 million.
Georgia Tech most recently accepted $280,000 from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, named after bin Salman's uncle, in December 2018. Eight of the 20 payments Tech accepted from Saudi donors in the six years documented in the log came from King Abdullah University, as part of an ongoing research contract to study sensors for personalized health monitoring. The school makes a distinction between money given as a gift and money given through research contracts.
"Georgia Tech places a high value on ethical and moral conduct and participates in research collaborations that adhere to those values," the school said in a statement. "There was not a gift accepted in December of 2018 ... (The contract) is a continuation of an ongoing project that started in 2016 and is scheduled to continue until 2020."
Aramco Services Company, the U.S. arm of Saudi Arabia-based Aramco -- one of the largest oil companies in the world, which is partially owned by Texaco, Exxon and Mobil--was another frequent contributor.
Georgia Tech has contracts with these donors, along with two other Saudi universities, for eight research projects such as information security training and the development of a solar gas turbine system. These contracts total close to $7 million. The university has not received any corporate donations from Saudi Arabia in 2019, and no foreign gifts were withheld from the log, aside from a $5 private donation from a Saudi student, according to a Georgia Tech spokesperson.
The University of Georgia received only one gift from a Saudi donor, in 2012, from King Abdulaziz University, a public institution named for the country's first monarch. The $286,000 donation was used to fund the research of a UGA faculty member and two of his research partners, who attended King Abdulaziz University, according to a UGA spokesperson. Most of UGA's foreign aid came from France.
Georgia Tech and UGA are public colleges. At Emory University, a private school, all Saudi donations but one came from the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission. The SACM website says its mission is "to administer programs and policies to meet the educational and cultural needs of Saudis studying in the United States."
The agency grants scholarships to these students, which were paid to Emory as "fees for service, not a donation," the school said in a statement.
Recipients must major in specific types of engineering, medicine, accounting, law, computer science or other studies approved by the country's Ministry of Education. The student must also attend a school ranked in the top 100 globally, as determined by the ministry, according to its website, which was translated for this story.
The SACM monies have gone to students enrolled in Emory's schools of arts and sciences, medicine and public health, the statement said. SACM could not be reached for comment.
The other contribution to Emory came from the Jazan University School of Medicine. Aside from Saudi donors, Emory also received large amounts of aid from Canadian, English and Swiss donors. At Georgia Tech, English, Chinese and South Korean patrons also gave top amounts.
No other Georgia schools were listed as having received money from Saudi institutions.

Texto completo: I'm sorry to be the one to say this, but somebody has to: We are going to have to deport Baltimore.
I'm not naive. I know that deporting the Maryland city, which itself is one of America's busiest ports, will be a logistical headache. And yet, it could not be clearer that Baltimore has no place in President Trump's America.
The president has in the past few days described Baltimore as a "corrupt mess" and a "disgusting," "very dangerous" and "filthy place" that "ranks last in almost every major category" and is "the Worst in the USA" where "no human being would want to live."
It's easy to see why Trump feels this way. Everything that Baltimore is, Trump is not, and vice versa. There isn't enough room in this country for both of them. Consider:
Baltimore is a city of letters, home of Edgar Allan Poe, Upton Sinclair, H.L. Mencken and Tom Clancy; Trump dishoners English in unpresidented and covfefe ways.
The Second Continental Congress met in Baltimore in the winter of 1776, and Baltimore's Samuel Chase signed the Declaration of Independence; Trump says the Continental Army "rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do."
Baltimore is where Francis Scott Key penned "The Star-Spangled Banner" while detained with prisoners of war on a British warship; Trump says "I like people who weren't captured."
Baltimore produced New York Yankees great Babe Ruth; Trump says of himself: "I was the best baseball player in New York."
Steel from Baltimore's Sparrows Point built the Golden Gate and George Washington bridges; Trump almost built a tower in Moscow.
Baltimore is the "Charm City"; Trump has insulted 598 people, places and things on Twitter over the past four years, per a New York Times tally, and he once shoved the prime minister of Montenegro.
Baltimore's blue crab is the world's finest and its aquarium world-famous; Trump's top seafood dish is McDonald's Filet-o-Fish.
Baltimore occupies a key place in African American history, with ties to Thurgood Marshall, W.E.B. Du Bois and Frederick Douglass; Trump says Douglass is "an example of somebody's who's done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more."
Baltimore's Little Italy produced Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. and his daughter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Trump eats pizza with a fork.
The Baltimore Orioles were one of the charter franchises of the American League, and Camden Yards the inspiration for the modern ballpark; Trump promised to start a baseball league and failed to deliver.
Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr. is called the Iron Man for his record-setting endurance; Trump took a golf cart while other world leaders walked during a Group of Seven summit in Sicily.
Baltimore Colts (and later, Ravens) fans have been unfailingly loyal through good times and bad; Trump paid hush money to Stormy Daniels.
Billie Holiday grew up in Baltimore; Jennifer Holliday pulled out of a performance at Trump's inauguration.
Baltimore's Johns Hopkins is one of the world's top medical institutions; Trump says windmills cause cancer.
To be fair, there are a few areas in which Baltimore and Trump have some common ground: Baltimore, in the early 19th century, was the first American city to embrace gas lighting; Trump, in the early 21st century, embraces gaslighting. Baltimore inspired "Hairspray" and "The Wire"; Trump gave us "The Apprentice." Baltimore, in Trump's telling, is a "rat and rodent infested mess"; Trump's Mar-a-Lago was cited for 78 health-code violations over three years.
Trump also has some evident similarities to one of Baltimore's own, Spiro Agnew. And Trump, when wearing white tie and tails to meet the queen, looked a lot like the tuxedo-clad mascot for Baltimore-born National Bohemian beer, Mr. Natty Boh.
But these are the exceptions.
It should be obvious that Baltimore and Trumpism are fundamentally incompatible. If we are truly to Make America Great Again, we will have to send Baltimore back to the place it came from - in this case, Ireland. (Baltimore is named for the second Lord Baltimore of the Irish House of Lords, Cecil Calvert, the first Proprietor of the Province of Maryland.) Also to be deported are other portions of the country Trump has recently deemed unsuitable: Cincinnati, Detroit and New York (Trump had tweeted that nonwhite congresswomen from these cities should "go back" to the "totally broken and "crime infested places from which they came"), and now San Francisco (Trump, in a misspelled tweet Sunday, said Pelosi's district is "failing badly" and "not recognizeable").
Some will mourn Baltimore when it is gone. I, however, will take some advice from Baltimore's favorite son.
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Baltimore!
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

Texto completo: HILLSBOROUGH, N. C. — In the summer of 1976, I first drove through the town of Smithfield, North Carolina. I was 19 and had just finished my sophomore year in college. The following day I planned to start a summer internship bringing health and legal services to the migrant farm workers — mostly African Americans — who traveled the East Coast each season to pick sweet potatoes, cucumbers and tobacco. As I approached the town, a giant and frightening billboard suddenly appeared roadside.
“This is Klan Country," it said. 'LOVE IT or LEAVE IT. Help fight communism and integration. Welcome to Smithfield”
For those unfamiliar with the highways and byways of North Carolina, Smithfield is but 70 miles from Greenville, North Carolina, the site of President Donald Trump’s rally where chants of “send her back” echoed last week. More than 40 years later, the refrain really hasn’t changed. Substitute “socialism” for “communism” and "immigration" for "integration. "
The past is never really past
Like many other white people coming of age in the 1970s, I had heard terrifying stories of the Ku Klux Klan’s violence. But I was unaware that this hate group had for the most part remained active and powerful in many parts of the Tar Heel state, especially in the mid-1960s. Chalk that up to my naiveté — and outsider status (I grew up in New York City).
It has happened to every immigrant: Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.
Upon graduation, I took a job in another isolated North Carolina county, just a few miles from Mount Airy, the birth place of Andy Griffith and the model for the town of Mayberry, the fictional and pastoral home to “The Andy Griffith Show. ” With a small state salary, I rented a trailer home from a white couple who showed me every courtesy but, fortunately, never asked me about my job — to ferry Hispanic farm workers from the migrant camps to health clinics. In retrospect, I’m sure my whiteness made my approval pro forma.
In a few short weeks, having paid my weekly rent on time, the talkative landlord began to confide in me. Not quite mano a mano. More like blanco a blanco.
Among the revelations: His membership in the local KKK chapter. Soon enough, he invited me to a Klan gathering, again my white skin appeared to tell my story. By then 21 years old, I was less naive than when I first encountered the Klan billboard in Smithfield. A foolhardy (to put it mildly) young man, I agreed to go along. Out in an open field, I witnessed a cross burning, the wearing of robes and a sea of Confederate flags in support of white nationalism. The rabid hatefulness of that dark night shocked me. It also terrified me: There was more to me than my skin color. I was of Jewish blood and then a closeted gay man, both disqualifying marks in the eyes of the Klan.
I left North Carolina the following year, never expecting to return. But I did in 2006 when my husband and I moved to Chapel Hill from the Bay Area to be nearer our ailing parents. All too soon the DNA of hate manifested itself, notably with the passage in 2016 of House Bill 2, what’s known as the “bathroom bill,” that mercilessly targeted transgender people for using the wrong restroom.
The law (yes, it was passed and signed into law, in the after hours of darkness) was mean-spirited and fear-based — and some of the surrounding rhetoric reminded me of what I had witnessed decades before. Shock? If only.
Hate: A national epidemic
The year before, in 2015, my adopted home town of Hillsborough struggled with and finally decided to remove the words “Confederate Memorial” from the local history museum. That action spurred a backlash as hundreds descended on our town in a protest. Along with them: Confederate flags, kids in “rebel” caps and parents in Stars and Bars T-shirts.
Enough: My black, disadvantaged students live with racism. They don't need to see it on sneakers.
“They’re gonna race as fast as they can to erase us off the face of the Earth,” one speaker told the crowd. The Raleigh News and Observer reported: “They eee-yowed the rebel yell on cue and intoned Dixie in unison, proclaiming that Southern culture and their way of life are in dire peril. ” Again, I felt the power of hate but not shock.
That’s the same reason I wasn’t shocked by the chants of “send her back” at Trump’s rally in Greenville on Wednesday. I wish I could tell you I was, that such ribald hate is out of character for many of my fellow Tar Heels or my fellow Americans. But it is not.
I wish I could attribute it all to Donald Trump — a man who thrives on race hate, the fear of difference, and the disruption of social mores and manners. But I can’t. I wish I could say North Carolina is an exception to the rule in these United States, but it is not. If I’ve learned anything in my two residencies in North Carolina, it’s as William Shakespeare wrote, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. "

Texto completo: A shooter descended on the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California on Sunday, wounding multiple people, police said.
Video of the aftermath posted on Twitter showed people lying on blood spattered ground as medics tended to their wounds.
The New York Times reported that at least three people were killed and 12 had been injured, citing Gilroy Councilman Dion Bracco.
As the chaotic situation unfolded, the number of victims could not immediately be confirmed and police did not provide details. It was unclear if the shooter was still on the grounds, but according to reports police were searching a heavily wooded area near the festival, and the San Francisco office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was sending investigators to Gilroy.
"This is nothing short of horrific," Gov. Gary Newsom tweeted. "Tonight, CA stands with the Gilroy community."
"The hearts of Gilroy PD and entire community go out to the victims of today's shooting at the Garlic Festival," the police department tweeted. "The scene is still active. If you are looking for a loved one, please go to the reunification center at Gavilan College at parking lot B."
Local NBC affiliate KNTV reported witnesses saying they saw and heard at least one shooter.
Julissa Contreras told the station: "White male, I would say mid-30s, early 30s," she told NBC, which was livestreaming from the site. She said he was firing a semiautomatic weapon and that she heard three to four shots per second. Contreras said the shooter was wearing a cap, sunglasses and had clips strapped to him.
"He definitely was prepared for what he was doing."
She told the station the shooter came in near a service entrance, between booths, one of which had kids coming down an inflatable slide. His back to them, he started spraying the crowd, she said.
"We heard the shooting," she said. "After about the eighth shot I realized they weren't firecrackers. We just ran." They hid behind a row of tents, and she could see over the tops of them.
"I could see him shooting in every direction, and the kids were just running out of the slide frantically," she said, adding that he appeared to be spraying the crowd. "Left to right, right to left, back and forth."
The festival, which runs for three days, was winding down but about 300 people were still there, KNTV reported. Police were called at about 5:30 p.m.
Ambulance crews were told that 11 people were down at Gilroy's Christmas Hill Park, according to early reports.
Ryan Wallace was running a rock climbing wall for kids when he heard what he thought were firecrackers or fireworks. He said he saw someone wearing what looked like military-tactical clothing. "He was walking like he wanted to get stuff done," Wallace told NBC. "And it was horrifying."
Festival public relations head Katherine Filice told The Mercury-News that her publicity team members were "all OK."
One man told KNTV that he was helping people, including his wife, escape.
Evenny Reyes, 13, told The Mercury News that she and friends "were just leaving and we saw a guy with a bandana wrapped around his leg because he got shot. And there were people on the ground, crying."
"There was a little kid hurt on the ground. People were throwing tables and cutting fences to get out."

Campus paper enmeshed in free press case

Texto completo: It was a routine story for the University of Massachusetts Boston student newspaper that came straight out of the police blotter.
Campus security officers were looking for an unidentified man who had allegedly taken photos of women around the university. The newspaper published a short story about the search with a photo under the headline “Have You Seen This Man?"
Now, six years later, that story is at the heart of a free press battle and defamation case that has reached the state's highest court and could upend longstanding journalism protections.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has stepped in to defend the former student editor and the college paper's right to publish the story, deeming the case to be in the public's interest. Media attorneys are penning friend-of-the-court briefs and warning that — if the plaintiff succeeds — this case could severely hamper how journalists do their jobs and inform the public.
“I fear it would have a severe chilling effect on the news media to report on police investigations," said Jeff Pyle, an attorney with Prince Lobel Tye, who has represented The New York Times and The Boston Globe.
At issue is whether Mass Media, the university's independent student newspaper, overstepped by publishing the police report and photo.
Jon Butcher, a former security engineer at UMass Boston's information technology department and the man police were looking for, argued that the story defamed him and damaged his relationship with his boss, forcing him to eventually leave UMass Boston. Butcher denied taking any photos of women, and after police searched his phone, they mostly found pictures of people riding the T or on the bus, according to court documents.
Police never arrested or charged Butcher with a crime. Butcher, who is representing himself in the case, could not be reached for comment.
A Massachusetts Appeals Court agreed with Butcher and concluded that because police never issued a search warrant or made an arrest, the information in the police report wasn't protected and the newspaper was liable. That decision has been appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which is likely to hear the case this fall.
That a student newspaper would now be at the center of one of the most important statewide fights over press freedoms in the past two decades is unusual, Pyle said.
“It's not the normal type of case you would see in the defamation case book," he said.
But, he noted, “The student press is not immune from claims of defamation. . . . Student journalism is important journalism and can ruffle feathers the same way."
The UMass Boston weekly school newspaper has generally focused on campus life issues, such as student parking fees. When the paper has engaged in First Amendment fights, it has usually been against university staff or administrators who are withholding information or, as they did this past spring, removing and covering over newspapers in a public area during prospective student visits, because of an embarrassing front-page article.
“We don't get into a lot of conflicts," said Kelsey Hale, 21, a rising senior and editor-in-chief of the paper.
The reporters at the paper are careful about what they publish, Hale said. But they don't back away from controversial stories or chasing public records to get the news. For example, last school year, when university administrators were vague about a chemical incident in the new dorms, the reporters found the fire department reports that indicated a student was allegedly trying to manufacture drugs in his room and set off the alarm, drawing police and other emergency personnel in hazardous material suits.
“Our writers stayed up until midnight on a Friday to make sure it was accurate," Hale said. “We worked very hard to publish factual information."
The case in front of the Massachusetts high court predates Hale's time at UMass Boston. Still, she said, the police blotters remain an important source of information, and the newspaper receives them on a weekly basis.
Police incident logs are crucial for all reporters, David Kravitz, a deputy state solicitor in Healey's office argued in court documents filed earlier this month.
Police provide media organizations with reports of unidentified people of interest or those involved in suspicious activities frequently, including in stabbings or robberies, Kravitz said in court documents.
“Publications of this kind serve important public interests: They alert residents to reports of possible wrongdoing in their neighborhoods, they inform residents of the activities of local law enforcement agencies, and they may assist law enforcement in completing investigations of suspected wrongdoing," Kravitz wrote.
As long as the news report is a “fair and accurate" reflection of the police log, it should be protected, Kravitz said. Requiring independent verification by the media, he wrote, would be a heavy burden.
But Richard Peltz-Steele, a professor at the University of Massachusetts School of Law, said the media should be more careful about simply reporting from police reports.
The police can be wrong, and in the Internet age that incorrect information about a person can live on and do damage long after the case is closed, Peltz-Steele said.
“I think 25 years ago this would have been a clean victory for the press," he said. “Today I see courts more willing to parse the facts and give plaintiffs a chance. . . . We as a society went massively protective of media in the name of a free press. But today the capacity of mass media to injure reputation and cause real suffering has reached unprecedented heights."
If the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upholds the lower court decision, the defamation case against the newspaper's editor will go to trial.
Cady Vishniac, 33, the ­UMass newspaper editor who was part of the team responsible for the publication of the original story in 2013, said she understands the damage that can be done by news articles.
She was the only student editor whom Butcher was able to serve with court documents, and her name is now linked to this defamation case.
Vishniac, who now lives in Michigan, has received a graduate degree in creative writing and is no longer in journalism. She said she worries about potential employers and colleagues searching her on the Internet and finding this defamation lawsuit.
“I am sure that there are greater issues at stake here," Vishniac said. “I just don't for the life of me understand how it got this far."

'The Lion King' Wins The Box Office Race

Texto completo: In "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," the new '60s Los Angeles pastiche from Quentin Tarantino, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an actor whose stardom is in steady decline. This weekend demonstrated just how different DiCaprio's career is from his character's.
"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" sold about $ 40.4 million in tickets at theaters in the United States and Canada from Thursday night to Sunday. That's a win for both Sony, the film's distributor, and Tarantino, its director; it rivals "Inglourious Basterds" in 2009 for his best opening weekend ever. (Adjusted for inflation, the $ 38.1 million total for "Inglourious Basterds" comes out slightly ahead.)
Having two of the biggest names in Hollywood lead the new movie probably helped. The story centers on the professional relationship and friendship between a made-up TV actor, Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), and his longtime stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Its splintered story mixes fact and fiction, and attempts to capture the energy of an era that saw Hollywood and hippie culture collide. The movie also features portrayals of many real-life figures, most notably the actress Sharon Tate, who is played by Margot Robbie.
"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" received generally strong reviews from critics -- it currently holds an 86 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote that the film "will stand as a source of debate -- and delight -- for as long as we care about movies."

But all of that success was only enough to land "Once Upon a Time" in the No. 2 spot at the box office this weekend. The reason? Donald Glover, Beyoncé and millions of strands of digital fur.
Yes, first place again went to Disney's "The Lion King," the realistic remake directed by Jon Favreau, which sold $ 75.5 million tickets domestically in its second weekend. The movie picked up an additional $ 142.8 million internationally, according to the studio, bringing its cumulative global total to a whopping $ 962.7 million.
Also notable was A24's "The Farewell," a subtitled dramedy from the filmmaker Lulu Wang that expanded from 35 to 135 theaters and brought in about $ 1.6 million this weekend, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. While that was only enough for 10th place overall, "The Farewell" had a per-screen average of $ 11,510, the second best of the weekend behind "The Lion King." It outpaced the $ 11,028 average for "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes reportedly working with FTC on Facebook breakup

Texto completo: Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is reportedly helping regulators as they investigate whether the social media behemoth should be broken up for violating antitrust rules.
According to reports from The New York Times and The Washington Post, Hughes has met with the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies which are all interested in examining Facebook's market power. He is said to be working with antitrust academics Scott Hemphill from New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University.
During the meetings with regulators, which Hughes attends alone, the former Facebook exec presented a 39-page slide deck outlining reasons why the social network should be broken up, reports the Times, including the fact that the company made "serial defensive acquisitions" to stomp out competition.
$5 billion FTC fine! Facebook must update and adopt new privacy, security measures
Co-living spaces: How millennials, Gen Z create affordable rent situations in big cities
This comes just months after the entrepreneur called the power of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg "unprecedented and un-American" in an opinion piece published by the Times.
Hughes left the company more than a decade ago, but his insight could still be valuable for those who say Facebook is a competition-crushing monopoly.
The 35-year-old entrepreneur, who has publicly advocated for breaking up Facebook for a while, previously called out the company for becoming "too powerful" after acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp.
Wu called the acquisitions a “plain-vanilla violation of antitrust law, just low-hanging fruit," according to the Washington Post.
Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at the consumer group Public Knowledge, told the Times that a successful case against Facebook would have to demonstrate that economic harm was done as well as prove that the company intentionally bought competitors.
Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Wednesday, Facebook separately announced that it was settling a record-breaking $5 billion fine with the FTC for violating consumer' privacy rights.

Secrets &amp; lies How two unrelated deaths from 1969 inspired Laura Lippman's 'Lady in the Lake'

Texto completo: It's a good day to be Laura Lippman. The Baltimore crime novelist breezes into a Locust Point pub wearing a canary yellow off-the-shoulder dress from Rent the Runway that she likes so much she thinks she might buy. She's smiling, glowing even. An important review has just come in, the most important review.
Stephen King has written in The New York Times that her latest novel, "Lady in the Lake," is "special, even extraordinary." Lippman heard the news while she was sitting in traffic waving off a squeegee kid. Her publisher, William Morrow, has just announced a five-book deal, including a collection of personal essays.
This morning, she and her 9-year-old daughter walked into the girl's summer camp singing "You gotta have a gimmick," from the musical "Gypsy." Soon, the two will head to Italy for vacation after Lippman is done teaching at a conference there. (Husband and 'Wire' creator David Simon has to work.)
She orders a glass of chardonnay and some appetizers.
It's a good day to be Laura Lippman.
Then again, it was good to be Maddie Schwartz.
At least, it looked that way to the outside world. The protagonist of Lippman's newest novel, published July 23, ditches her doting husband and big Pikesville home to pursue a career as a newspaper reporter. She becomes obsessed with unraveling the mystery of two separate killings: 11-year-old Tessie Fine and a bartender named Cleo Sherwood.
It's the mid 1960s. Times are changing, and so is Maddie. She takes a black cop as a lover, straightens her hair and moves into an apartment off Cathedral Street. Meanwhile, whites are leaving Northwest Baltimore in droves, heading for the whiter suburbs. The novel, which flips between Maddie's perspective and people she interacts with, brings to life a Baltimore that's been largely abandoned and demolished, from the tea room at Haussner's to Maison Marconi, a spot Maddie chooses to meet her ex-husband for dinner. (The bright lighting, she thought, would ensure he doesn't see it as a date.)
Being a reporter allows Maddie to step outside the rigid confines of life for women at the time. "Normally I wouldn't tell such stories to a lady, but you're a reporter," The Star's veteran police reporter John Diller, "more cop than reporter," tells her as he details the tactics of a local serial killer. Still, she wrestles with a culture that sees her as past her prime in her late 30s.
The two deaths that anchor "Lady in the Lake" are inspired by real events that happened in 1969, when Lippman herself was a 10-year-old living in Dickeyville. One was the abduction and killing of 11-year-old Esther Lebowitz, bludgeoned to death in the basement of a store selling tropical fish. Lebowitz's death traumatized the city's Jewish community for years to come. Another death barely made a ripple in white Baltimore, though it was covered extensively in The Baltimore Afro-American. Shirley Lee Widgeon Parker, a beautiful barmaid and former Urban League secretary, vanished in April. Her body was found in the fountain of Druid Hill Lake. Decades later, her death remains a mystery.
Lippman only heard about Parker's death after arriving at The Baltimore Sun years later. Why?
In the novel, Maddie's editors at The Star are pleased by her reporting on the death of an 11-year-old, but scold her for spending too much time pursuing the death of a black woman.
The Star is not stand-in for The Sun, Lippman says, but there are coincidences. The tough-talking labor reporter, nicknamed the "battle axe," who writes her copy in the women's bathroom while smoking cigarettes, was inspired by the late Helen Delich Bentley. Aspects were informed by the life of Lippman's father, who joined The Sun in 1965 and interviews with his colleagues.
"Everything is factual except for what isn't," Lippman said.
The book is dedicated to the five victims of last year's Capital Gazette shooting, which took place the day after Lippman had submitted the first draft of "Lady in the Lake." Among the dead, Lippman's friend, Rob Hiaasen, with whom she had worked as a reporter at The Sun. They found a common bond in their love for writing stories about the kind of people that no one else wanted to write stories about.
"Rob had so much more to say and do," she said, brushing away tears.
As a reporter, Maddie myopically ignores the small stories and side characters, chasing the bigger scoops that will furnish a front-page byline.
"Maddie in many ways represents a person I fear I will become," Lippman said. "She is so heedless in her ambition. ... She causes a lot of damage." But Lippman, however ambitious, is quick to point out the differences between herself and the character. Maddie is stunningly beautiful, Jewish, married by age 20 to a successful lawyer. "Not me," Lippman said.
Lippman's own last year as a reporter was miserable. Mid-divorce and locked in a dispute with Sun management, she was so stressed out one day that she cracked two molars and spat them out in her hand.
It's a memory she recalls in a piece titled "Game of Crones," to be reprinted in the forthcoming collection of personal essays. In it, she reflects on the unexpected joys of becoming a mom late in life, despite being frequently mistaken for her child's grandmother. The essay begins: "My daughter was 10 days old the first time I was asked if I were her grandmother."
In a phone interview days after our initial meeting in Locust Point, Lippman admits that in her embrace of domestic life, "I'm kind of the anti-Maddie. ... I derive a lot of satisfaction from my life as a parent. I like making dinner. I like looking after my kid."
And then she begged off, saying it was time to figure out what to do for supper, before she toted her daughter to a book signing.

Texto completo: Here's a favorite (rejection letter) from a 1983 butt-kicking, sent to me by a New York literary agent: "I read five pages and wondered if you've ever been scared by a performing flea; read 10 more and developed a severe case of vertigo." That said, I've had an excellent run since then, and I'm very grateful for my good fortune, which is, all things given, pretty darn surprising.
Martin Clark
Devoting decades to his life to the rough-and-tumble field of law has been pure inspiration for the fictional stories that have made Martin Clark one of the most awarded and acclaimed legal thriller writers today.
The latest evidence of that claim: "The Substitution Order," Clark's newest novel, crafting a tale that embraces, at times, despair, hope, and unanswered questions about a lawyer who's hit rock bottom after an unrestrained summer of bad choices leaves him broke and broken-hearted.
Martin is a retired Virginia circuit court judge of 27 years whose previous novels ("The Jezebel Remedy," "The Legal Limit," "Plain Heathen Mischief" and "The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living") have garnered awards including a New York Times Notable Book, A Washington Post Book World Best Book of the Year, a Bookmark Magazine Book of the Year, a Boston Globe Book of the Year, a winner of the Library of Virginia's People's Choice Award in both 2009 and 2016, and many more.
He and his wife Deana, a photographer, live on a Virginia farm with dogs, cats, chickens and three donkeys.
After graduating from law school 35 years ago and going on to serve as a Virginia circuit court judge for 27 of those years, the law – and writing novels with law-related stories – must have become somewhat second nature for you. Your first book, "The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living," was published in 2000, followed by three others and now "The Substitution Order." All have garnered much attention. Has it surprised you that your books were immediately met with such success, which continues today?
I probably shouldn't admit this – your version sure makes for a better history – but my books were definitely not "immediately met with success." Like so many other writers, I collected years and years of rejection letters, until 1999, when Knopf took a chance on "The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living." To this day, at every gig I do, I read from those rejection letters. Here's a favorite riff from a 1983 butt-kicking, sent to me by a New York literary agent: "I read five pages and wondered if you've ever been scared by a performing flea; read 10 more and developed a severe case of vertigo." That said, I've had an excellent run since then, and I'm very grateful for my good fortune, which is, all things given, pretty darn surprising.
Your works carry a dry sense of humor that is built into the twists of the plots and the personalities of the characters. Have you found that to be one of the most appealing aspects of writing – does it come naturally to you?
Pretty much. Plus, there's so much sadness and heartbreak in the court system that occasional levity helps all of us get through the days. Eighty percent of my job as a judge was sentencing people for theft, drug charges and probation violations – a smile or a wry comment or quiet joke often made some weeks just a tiny bit more tolerable.
In "The Substitution Order," you place a likeable, down-and-out attorney in the position of combatting scam artists trying to undo his career for good, even as he struggles to win it back by playing by the rules. His journey plays out amidst health issues, relationship foibles and legal loopholes. How do you go about developing characters and their circumstances, and do you tend to base the substance of your plots on what you've seen during years of law and court experience?
I absolutely draw on my time in the courtroom – write what you know, correct? But the characters and the plots are largely fictionalized, given that much of what happens in court is frequently mundane and routine. More to the point, if, as a reader, you invest in a book, you don't want a legal primer, you want a good ride, some entertainment, some twists and turns, and maybe a very small instruction at the end. And, to be clear, in "The Substitution Order," Kevin Moore certainly knows the rules and how to use them, but I wouldn't say he follows them to the letter.
The end of "The Substitution Order" was a bittersweet surprise. Is that in sync with your experience of handling legal cases that may not have turned out as you expected?
Thank you for mentioning that. As writers, we hope to tell a realistic, entertaining story, create likeable characters that readers will root for, and then provide a payoff over the last few pages. "Bittersweet surprises" is a great way to put it and exactly what I hope "The Substitution Order" delivers. As for handling court cases and how I've seen them turn out, virtually any lawyer will tell you that you just never know. Plus, as I highlight in the book, sometimes it's a victory for a litigant when things don't go totally and completely sideways, and you sneak out with minor wounds and not a full-blown bloodletting.
What have you enjoyed most about creating these stories, and what would you say is your biggest challenge when writing?
My biggest writing challenge these days is finding the stamina and focus to slog through all the technical, picayune final edits. I love writing, but debating commas and preferred spellings and capitalization rules is tedious. Necessary, but tedious.
You can check behind me, and you'll discover I've never said anything like this before – I generally don't care to praise my own writing – but "The Substitution Order" is by far the best novel I've ever put on paper. On December 30, 2015, I almost died, and it took me about a year to fully recover. I was lucky enough to have a steadfast wife and a godsend, genius surgeon, and now I'm fixed, totally normal. So, truthfully, I enjoyed simply being able to sit down and write this novel, being able to do it. Brushing against ruin tends to make you slightly wiser and a little more thoughtful. As my editor told me about this book: "You've always had a great story to tell, but now you actually have something worthwhile to say."
Here's a favorite (rejection letter) from a 1983 butt-kicking, sent to me by a New York literary agent: "I read five pages and wondered if you've ever been scared by a performing flea; read 10 more and developed a severe case of vertigo." That said, I've had an excellent run since then, and I'm very grateful for my good fortune, which is, all things given, pretty darn surprising.

POLITICS: Polls reveal lay of the land in battleground Georgia: Republicans hold some high ground for now, surveys say.

Texto completo: Expectations are that Georgia will be a battleground in the 2020 elections, but recent polls show it's hardly an even field that red and blue armies will traverse.
Republicans hold some high ground, according to a Morning Consult poll that showed both Gov. Brian Kemp and U.S. Sen. David Perdue in the 50%range. An NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll gave Kemp an approval rating of 61% -- with 30% strongly approving. Those disapproving accounted for 37%.
But President Donald Trump is in a hole, although the depth varies by survey.
That NBC News poll showed 48% approve of the president's job performance. He's trending upward:When the same surveyors polled the state a year ago, they put him at 44%.
His favorability rating was slightly lower, at 45%, in a survey of 602 Georgia voters conducted by the left-leaning Public Policy Polls. His disapproval rating was 49%.
Those are better numbers than what an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found in April, when 40%approved of the president's performance. An AJC poll in January put Trump's favorability rating at 38%.
What does this mean for 2020? The Magic 8 Ball would probably say, "Ask again later." The elections are a long way off, more than 15 months, and polls are just snapshots at a specific moment in time with plenty of capacity for change.
But at the moment, the Morning Consult poll also showed Trump losing Georgia to a generic Democrat, as if there were such a thing, by 50% to 46%.
The NBC News poll offered a little insight into who that Democrat might be, at least if it were up to Georgians.
Former Vice President Joe Biden led the field at 31%. A pack of three other candidates came in after that: U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (15%), U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (13%) and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders(12%).No other Democrat rose above single digits.
An issue that could shape the field: Abortion was also covered in the NBC News poll. It did not, however, deal specifically with House Bill 481, the state anti-abortion law set to go into effect in January that would ban most abortions once fetal cardiac activity has been detected -- about six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant.
The NBC News poll found that 60% of Georgia voters oppose "completely" overturning the 1973 Roe v.Wade decision that legalized abortion.
For the sake of comparison, the AJC poll in April found that 70% of Georgia voters opposed overturning Roe v. Wade.
In the same poll, 26% said abortion should be illegal in most cases. An additional 10% said it should be illegal in all cases.
Unlike the NBC News poll, that April AJC poll did ask Georgia voters to weigh in on the new anti-abortion law. It found that 48% strongly opposed or somewhat opposed HB 481, compared with 43 percent who strongly supported or somewhat supported the law.
Fiscal friction: Perdue campaigned on fixing a broken budget process, and in the past he's voted against agreements like the one the White House and congressional Democrats just reached to suspend the debt limit until August 2021.
There have been exceptions, especially for deals pushed by the Trump administration. Perdue is one of the president's closest allies in the U.S. Senate.
But it was still a bit surprising that he supported this new two-year deal, which would raise federal spending limits by $320 billion.
It was apparently a matter of timing.
"In a compromise, neither side gets 100 percent of what they want. The bottom line is with just 15 working days until the end of the fiscal year on September 30, Congress cannot afford to waste any more time," Perdue said in a statement.
That wasn't enough for everybody interested in the process, such as Freedom-Works, a group whose views have often aligned with those of Perdue, especially in the case of fiscal matters.
"With this 'deal,' GOP 'leadership' has ceded its ground on fiscal responsibility, which for years was supposed to be a core tenet of the party," said Adam Brandon, the group's president.
Those quote marks around "deal" and "leadership" carry some sting.
Israel vote, two approaches: Whether to condemn a movement to boycott Israel over its policies toward Palestinians has been an issue that has divided the Democratic Party.
At its center are U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashia Tlaib of Michigan, two Muslim freshmen who have faced accusations of anti-Semitism over public remarks they have made concerning Israel and the Holocaust. They are also two of the four Democratic congresswoman that Trump singled out in tweets telling them to "go back" to their own countries, even though three were born in the U.S. and Omar is a naturalized citizen.
Two Georgia Democrats chose their own paths on a U.S. House vote this past week to condemn the boycott movement.
U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Atlanta co-sponsored a separate resolution with Omar and Tlaib that "affirms that all Americans have the right to participate in boycotts in pursuit of civil and human rights at home and abroad, as protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution."
But on the House resolution to condemn the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, Lewis voted aye.
U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson of Lithonia has his own history regarding Israel. One of the more liberal members of Georgia's congressional delegation, he has voiced concerns in the past about how the Israeli government has treated Palestinians. Three years ago, he had to issue apologies after he likened that nation's settlement policy in the West Bank to "a steady (stream), almost like termites can get into a residence and eat before you know that you've been eaten up and you fall in on yourself."
During this week's House vote, Johnson voted "present," meaning he voted neither for nor against the resolution.
Get it on paper: Special counsel Robert Mueller's appearances before the U.S. House Judiciary and Intelligence committees drew the most attention, but he wasn't the only person to testify before Congress this past week about election meddling.
FBI Director Christopher Wray, a former Atlanta attorney, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Washington Post
reported that Wray said he had been involved in meetings within the Trump administration -- that the president also attended -- that described "Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2018 midterm elections and elections going forward."
"Wray said he would also support elections officials using backup paper ballots during elections," the Post wrote.
Here's another nugget from Wray's testimony: He reported that the FBI had recorded about 100 arrests of domestic terrorism suspects over the past nine months. Most were alleged to be white supremacists.
Priorities: When it comes to Trump, policy and legislation aren't really at the top of his agenda. That's what his friends are saying.
In a New York Times article examining the president's record, Newt Gingrich -- a former Georgia congressman, onetime U.S. House speaker and close ally to the president -- had this to say about Trump's interest in policy accomplishments:
"I think he doesn't mind if it happens, but it's not his primary focus. His primary focus is to so thoroughly define Democrats as the party of the radical left. I think that matters much more to him than any particular bill."
Candidates, endorsements, etc.:
|Republican Philip Singleton, a candidate in the Sept. 3 special election to represent state House District 71, has gained the support of the anti-abortion group Georgia Right to Life. To help you keep track of which anti-abortion group is which, GRTL is the one that withdrew endorsements for legislators who supported HB 481. It opposed exceptions included in the law that would allow abortions in cases of rape or incest, provided the woman had filed a police report. The District 71 seat opened up when state Rep. David Stover, R-Newnan, resigned earlier this summer.
|John King, the state's newly appointed interim insurance commissioner, is showing signs he'd like to shed "interim" from his title. King filed paperwork this past week to start raising money for a likely run in 2022. He told the AJC earlier this month that he planned to run for the job in the next election. There is the matter of Jim Beck, who added "suspended" to his title as insurance commissioner while he faces federal fraud charges. Beck is still getting paid $120,000 a year (as is King), so he may not want to get out of the way, provided he successfully wends his way through the court system.

Where the GOP got its questions for Mueller

Texto completo: Historian Nicole Hemmer says right-wing news outlets cooked them up
When Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) had his turn to quiz former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III during the hearing Wednesday morning, he came armed with what he seemed to think was a smoking gun: that neither Glenn Simpson nor Fusion GPS were mentioned in Mueller's report.
Most Americans no doubt shared Mueller's apparent confusion about the line of questioning. He said he was not familiar with Fusion GPS, a private strategic-intelligence firm, and that Simpson, the organization's founder, was outside the scope of his investigation. Yet as the hearings wore on, Republican lawmakers returned again and again to Simpson and Fusion GPS, treating them like household names. And for conservatives on a steady diet of right-wing media, they are: the linchpins of a conspiratorial witch hunt to impeach President Trump.
The GOP's laserlike focus on Simpson, Fusion GPS, former FBI agent Peter Strzok and other bits of right-wing lore probably played well in conservative media (and, as a consequence, in the Oval Office). But it was almost certainly inscrutable to any American who is not dialed into Fox News, right-wing talk radio or conservative-leaning Facebook feeds. That has real consequences for a party that, in learning to speak to its siloed-off base, has forgotten how to reach a wider audience.
For the benefit of the Fox News crowd, Republicans raised a host of boogeymen Wednesday. In his opening statement in the House Intelligence Committee's afternoon hearing, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) first dismissed election interference as the "Russia collusion conspiracy theory," then spun out a conspiracy of his own, a rush of names including Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and - of course - Simpson, a topic he returned to during his question time. Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) interrogated Mueller on the number of times his report referenced the New York Times (75) and The Washington Post (60) vs. Fox News (25), as though that provided mathematical evidence of just how biased the special counsel's team was. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) accused the government of "spying" on the Trump campaign, and he name-checked "Halper, Downer, Mifsud, Thompson" and Azra Turk, barely pausing to suggest who they were, much less what they might have done or how their circumstances exonerated Trump.
Republicans did not always speak in an impenetrable dialect. Well into the 2000s, Republican politicians found ways to dog-whistle to the base while still addressing a broad national audience; John McCain argued in 2008 that Barack Obama would turn the IRS into a "welfare agency" but still defended Obama from fringe-motivated questions about his citizenship. But as conservative talk radio proliferated and the influence of Fox News on intra-GOP politics crystallized, Republican candidates increasingly turned their attention, and their rhetoric, toward that narrower audience. For good reason: Whenever Republican officials stopped moving in lockstep with conservative media and the base that consumed it, they found themselves enveloped in scandal - as when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele was forced to apologize for criticizing Rush Limbaugh in 2009 - or out of a job, like conservative stalwarts Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), who lost primary elections in 2012 and 2014 to candidates who sounded more like talk-radio hosts than mainstream politicians.
The hearings Wednesday were not the first time Fox Newspeak has been a problem for the right since that dynamic took hold. In 2014, President Barack Obama sat down for a pre-Super Bowl interview on the main Fox broadcast network with Bill O'Reilly, who at the time hosted the most-watched program on Fox News (he would be ousted three years later over multiple sexual harassment allegations). It was a huge opportunity for the network. O'Reilly's show drew, at its peak, about 3.3 million viewers; the Super Bowl that year had 112.2 million. Even if just a small fraction of those game-watchers tuned in, it would be a substantially bigger, and different, audience for O'Reilly.
But O'Reilly used the opportunity to air a number of conservative grievances that meant very little to nonconservatives: the number of days it took to fully assess a terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya; an already debunked accusation that the IRS had persecuted conservative organizations; Obama's statement that his 2008 election would play a role in "fundamentally transforming" America. Each of these were played as "gotcha" moments, but anyone watching who wasn't familiar with the stories must have been wondering what, exactly, had been "got."
Maybe Republicans on Wednesday, and O'Reilly back then, were trying to expose non-Fox News watchers to conservative arguments. But in neither case did they explain the underlying conspiracy theories they were gesturing to. Rather, they dropped keywords such as "Benghazi" and "Glenn Simpson" that left conservatives salivating and the rest of the country confused.
These in-group moments are great for the base, but they squander the right's opportunity to shape a broader national debate. When it comes to major congressional hearings such as Mueller's, that is a significant political shortcoming. That's because such proceedings have real power (or at least, they used to). In the 1960s and 1970s, televised hearings helped remake the country in powerful ways, from ending a war to curbing government abuses.
The Fulbright hearings in 1966, for instance, empowered the antiwar movement when they raised serious questions about the origins of the Vietnam War. Though not the first congressional hearings on Vietnam, they were the first to be televised - and they had a profound effect in eroding public support for the war. The hearings could do that because the senators made their case to the public, instead of spinning off half-understood references to conspiracies about the Lyndon Johnson administration.
The same was true of the Church Committee hearings, televised in 1975. Those hearings were deliberative inquiries into the secret and often illegal actions of the U.S. intelligence community during the 1950s and 1960s, from assassination attempts to domestic spying. They involved careful investigation of wrongdoing, which, when laid out for the public, helped build support for a number of new policies, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.
There is little chance that Republicans' grilling of Mueller on Wednesday will inspire the same sort of change in policy or public opinion, because there is little chance that their questions made any sense to most people watching. The lawmakers were there not to investigate but to instigate, to rile up a base that had made up its mind about Mueller around the same time Trump did.
Republicans traded their big-tent strategy for a base-only one a long time ago. Their conduct at the hearings was just another sign that they have given up on reaching a broader public and will instead double down on minoritarian politics. Questions that wander off into the weeds of right-wing fever dreams are of a piece with efforts to purge voting rolls, gerrymander districts, strip power from Democratic officials and change the census. The strategy may be mysterious to the rest of us - but it's helping the right retain its hold on power.

Trump's secret foreign aid program

Texto completo: Donald Trump often complains that the media don't give him credit for his achievements. And I can think of at least one case where that's true. As far I can tell, almost nobody is reporting that he has presided over a huge - but hidden - increase in foreign aid, the money America gives to foreigners. In fact, the hidden Trump program, running around $40 billion a year, is probably the biggest giveaway to other nations since the Marshall Plan.
Unfortunately, the aid isn't going either to poor countries or to America's allies. Instead, it's going to wealthy foreign investors.
Before I get there, let's talk for a second about a claim Trump often makes about a highly visible part of his economic strategy, the tariffs he has imposed on imports from China and other countries. These tariffs, he has insisted again and again, are being paid by China and represent billions in gains to the United States.
This claim is, however, demonstrably false. Tariffs are normally paid by consumers in the importing country, not exporters.
So Trump's tariffs aren't a tax on foreigners, whatever he may think. On the other hand, his other policies have given selective foreigners a huge tax break.
Remember, Trump's only major legislative achievement is the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The core of that bill was a sharp reduction in corporate tax rates, which has led to a drastic fall in tax revenues, on the order of $140 billion over the past year.
Who gains from this tax cut? Supporters of the bill claimed that the benefits would be passed on to workers in the form of higher wages, and they made a big deal over a flurry of corporate bonus announcements in early 2018. But those bonuses weren't actually very big, and they didn't continue.
What about the argument that tax cuts would promote a huge swell in business investment, which would push up wages? Well, that isn't happening, either; when it comes to business spending, the tax cut has been a big fizzle.
So who is benefiting from the tax cut? Basically, shareholders, who have received increased dividends and seen a lot of capital gains as corporations use their windfall not to invest, but to buy back their own stocks.
And a big share of these gains to shareholders has gone to foreigners.
We live, after all, in an era of globalized finance, in which wealthy investors normally own assets in many countries. Americans own trillions in foreign equity, both directly in the form of foreign stocks and indirectly in the form of stocks of U.S. corporations with foreign subsidiaries.
Overall, foreigners own about 35% of the equity in corporations subject to U.S. taxes. And as a result, foreign investors have received around 35% of the benefits of the tax cut. As I said, that's more than $40 billion a year.
To put this in perspective, Trump's tariffs on China have raised $20 billion.
Alternatively, we can compare Trump's gift to foreign investors with our actual spending on foreign aid (which is much smaller than most people imagine). In 2017, the U.S. spent $51 billion on "international affairs," but much of that was either the cost of operating embassies or military assistance. The Trump tax break for overseas investors is considerably bigger than the total amount we spend on foreign aid proper.
Trump's giveaway to foreign investors isn't going to make or break us, although it's probably enough to ensure that the tax cut will be, overall, a net drain on economic growth: Even if the tax cut has some positive effect on the total income generated here , this will probably be more than offset by the increased share of that income accruing to foreigners rather than U.S. citizens.
Still, even in America, $40 billion here, $40 billion there, and eventually you're talking about real money. Furthermore, it does seem worth pointing out that even as Trump boasts about taking money away from foreigners, his actual policies are doing exactly the opposite.

Texto completo: Facebook may have agreed to pay $5 billion this week to settle a case with the federal government about how the company has protected its users data, but that doesn't mean the feds are done with the social-media giant.
Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes is reportedly working with federal regulators, and a pair of prominent antitrust academics, to build a case for the government breaking up the company that he started when he and company Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg were students at Harvard University. The New York Times and the Washington Post both reported on Hughes' involvement in the effort to force Facebook to either split up, or divest itself of properties that have increased the company's dominance in the social networking industry and given in access to the personal data of billions of individuals around the world.
The Times reported that Hughes has been working with Scott Hemphill, of New York University, and Tim Wu of Columbia University, and meeting members of the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and some states attorneys general, on build a case for the U.S. government to seek the breakup of Facebook on antitrust grounds. Among the examples being cited of Facebook's alleged unfair market dominance are the company's $1 billion acquisition of Instagram, in 2012, and its 2014 purchase of messaging app company WhatsApp, for $19 billion.
While Hughes has been involved in presentations made to the federal officials, the degree of his involvement remains in question. According to the Times, Hemphill would only say that Hughes "has been an important contributor to thinking about these issues."
Hughes hasn't worked at Facebook since he left the company in 2007 and cashed out his stock holdings worth approximately $500 million. However, his role as a Facebook co-founder, and his calls for Facebook to be broken apart, have added ammunition to other efforts to rein in the company, and power of CEO Zuckerberg.
In May, Hughes published a lengthy editorial piece in the New York Times saying, among other things, that the government needs to step in a split up Facebook, and that Zuckerberg's 60-percent share of Facebook's voting shares give him a degree of corporate and societal power that is "unprecedented and un-American" in nature.
Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Hughes.

'Molly of Denali' breaks new ground with first Native American hero on children's TV

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – Children’s television has made heroes out of a bookish aardvark, a singing dinosaur and pizza-munching turtles. It’s about time a Native American girl got a shot.
“Molly of Denali,” new this week on PBS, breaks new ground with its casting, furthering the case that, when it comes to diversity, kids’ programming leads the way.
“Dora the Explorer,” which Nickelodeon premiered in 2000, cleared a path for more Latino representation on the airwaves. Disney’s “Doc McStuffins,” wrapping up its fifth and final season, triggered more than $500 million in merchandise sales in 2013 – a record for a toy line based on a black character, according to the New York Times. TPT’s “Hero Elementary,” a science series due to premiere in 2020, will pay just as much attention to diversity as it does to brainpower.
But Molly Mabray is the first star of an animated children’s show to be a proud, contributing member of a Native American tribe, sharing her adventures from her Alaska home with young viewers across the country.
“We’re going to see Molly and her friends doing everything from dogsledding to working in her garden to traveling with her mom, who is a bush pilot who can’t land the plane because there’s a moose in the runway,” said Lesli Rotenberg, PBS’ chief programming executive for children’s media and education.
Tradition with a twist
Kids from all backgrounds can relate to Molly’s obsessions with the internet, sports, animals and music.
But there’s almost always a twist.
The 10-year-old uses the computer to monitor a bald eagle watching over her eggs. She may shoot baskets, but she’d rather be competing in a birch-canoe race.
She’s determined to heal her grandpa’s emotional wounds after she learns that he lost his love of music after the boarding school he was forced to attend as a child forbade him from playing his people’s songs.
She bonds with an intimidating aunt after the two of them come up with a new tribal name for her. No lemonade stand for Molly; instead, she answers phones at the family’s trading post.
“She’s learning these traditional practices, like snowshoeing or hunting for agate stones, but she’s also just an everyday kid that’s super-relatable,” said the show’s creative producer, Princess Daazhraii Johnson.
Johnson, a 13-year Hollywood veteran who grew up in Alaska, is uniquely qualified to lead the series.
Her younger brother, Evon Peter, was the youngest chief in Arctic Village, Alaska. She also has two children at home who are members of the show’s target audience.
“I can do that, too”
All the Native American characters are voiced by Native American talent; the Yupik band Pamyua provides the catchy theme song, featuring traditional drums and the Athabaskan fiddle. Dewey Kk’oleyo Hoffman, leadership development director of the First Alaskans Institute, is a consultant.
But not all the characters have Native roots. Trini, a black youngster, has recently moved north after her military father was transferred. In many ways, she represents viewers who might think all Alaskans live in igloos.
“We’ve got an episode in which Trini has this idea planted in her head from a friend in Texas that polar bears are everywhere and she’s terrified to go outside,” said series co-creator Dorothea Gillim. “Molly and her friend Tooey want to help Trini feel more at home, so they look at old westerns and get stereotypical ideas of what it means to be Texan. We’re really kind of exploring and trying to debunk stereotypes of all types.”
Lorne Cardinal, who plays Grandpa Nat, said there’s still a perception among his fellow Native Americans they can’t be featured in a positive light on TV – let alone aspire to be in show business themselves.
“When I do Q&As after a theater performance, we have Native people in the audience who say, ‘Oh, I didn’t know we were allowed to do that,’?” said Cardinal, best known for his role as Sgt. Davis Quinton on the Canadian sitcom “Corner Gas.”
“We’re still having to fight for the idea that we can do anything we want. We still have to do the hard work. There are no free passes. But by us doing this show, there’s a step for kids to go, ‘Oh, I can do that, too.’?”

D.C. Memo: Referring all inquiries to our political consultant

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, Jay Inslee talked about Minnesota, Al Franken returned to the public eye, and Dean Phillips’ challenger declined to comment.
One issue. Two candidates. Line 3.
Minnesota politics entered the national political scene as presidential hopeful Washington Gov. Jay Inslee took a clear against stance on Enbridge’s Line 3. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) took a stance on the pipeline months ago.
Two non-Minnesotan candidates weighing in left a question that we struggled to answer: Where does Minnesota’s own Sen. Amy Klobuchar stand on the pipeline? Read more at MinnPost.

Minnesotans center stage at Muslim Caucus
A good portion of Minnesota’s political scene was in Washington on Tuesday. Why? They were attending the innagural conference of the Muslim Caucus Education Collective.
Zarina Baber , vice president of the group (and a Minnesotan) said that there were a large number of Minnesotans at the event not because it was Minnesota focused, but because Minnesota has set an example of what is possible nationally. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison was in attendance, as was Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis, who replaced Ellison in Congress in 2018.
Ken Martin , the DFL Chair who spoke throughout the day, is on the advisory comittee of the Muslim Caucus. And St. Paul Rep. Betty McCollum received the inaugural Human Rights Champion Award. Read more at MinnPost.
Al Franken returns
In The New Yorker, award winning journalist Jane Mayer makes the case that we should reevaluate how the allegations that prompted the resignation of Sen. Al Franken were handled . Some things she points out: There are some inaccuracies with the initial story that prompted the whirlwind of Franken criticism. And several senators admitted to regretting their role in pushing for his resignation without a hearing.
But a good number of senators do not.
“With the first accuser, we didn’t call for his resignation from the get-go. It was a difficult decision,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, told the New York Times. “But when the eighth person comes forward, there’s a pattern. Women have been putting up with this B.S. from time immemorial. And we’re sick of it.”
Other than Hirono, officials who said they stood by their decision to call on Franken’s resignation: Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Patty Murray (D-WA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Cory Booker (D-NJ).
Franken is admittedly clumsy and comes from a different world: entertainment. And that might be what many people are missing, says Dianna E. Anderson, the Minneapolis-based author of “Problematic: How Toxic Callout Culture Is Destroying Feminism.”
“I think his position as a comedian makes this transition different from that of a regular politician, especially since the entertainment world as a whole is much more likely to be forgiving, particularly with events viewed as small slights rather than horrendously violent acts,” says Anderson.
“I think part of what people are conveniently ignoring is right there in Mayer’s article: his political team basically had to retrain him out of his entertainment behavior, which was described as handsy and clumsy and with a tendency to greet women with kisses, which speaks to how entertainment and politics views interactions like this differently. Most regular politicians know they have to go into private life after something like this.”
The Huffington Post’s Zachary Roth, who wrote about two women who accused Franken of sexual harassment, goes further to point out that Mayer’s story, while incredibly detailed on one account, doesn’t quite hone in one several others:
Neither woman has backed away from her allegation. Franken hasn’t denied touching either woman’s butt (though he told HuffPost at the time that he’d never asked anyone to visit the bathroom with him). And the women’s decision not to speak to The New Yorker about claims made previously to a different news outlet shouldn’t cast doubt on their stories.
‘Racist policies’
As President Trump continues to invoke Omar’s name to rile up his supporters, the Fifth District Democrat responded with an op-ed in the New York Times. She criticizes Trump not just for racist words, but for racist policy:
The only way to push back is to be unequivocal about our values. It is not enough to condemn Mr. Trump’s racism. We must affirmatively confront racist policies — whether the caging of immigrant children at the border or the banning of Muslim immigrants or the allowing of segregation in public housing. It is not enough to condemn the corruption and self-dealing of this administration. We must support policies that unmistakably improve working people’s lives, including by strengthening collective bargaining, raising the minimum wage and pursuing a universal jobs guarantee.
A challenger appears
The Third District’s Rep. Dean Phillips finally has a Republican challenger. Kendall Qualls has filed as Republican to challenge Rep. Dean Phillips, something National Republican Campaign Committee Chair and 5th District Rep. Tom Emmer hinted at last week.
Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voting Index placed Phillip’s district as D+1 in 2017, noting a slight Democratic advantage, prior to Phillip’s win against Erik Paulsen. But also notably, Cook currently places CD3 in its safest category: a likely Democratic District.
When the Star Tribune asked Qualls, a Black health care executive and veteran for comment, this is what happened:
Qualls declined to comment when reached by phone by the Star Tribune, saying he is referring all inquiries to his political consultant. The consultant did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The president next door
Who will Klobuchar be debating on July 30th? CNN conducted a prime time event to draw candidates in a bingo-like game. Here is what they came up with:
* Author Marianne Williamson
* Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH)
* South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg
* Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)
* Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke
* Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper
* Rep. John Delaney
* Montana Gov. Steve Bullock
What will I be watching for? During the first debate, Klobuchar spent much of her time attacking someone not on the stage: President Donald Trump. This time, will she contrast her policies, and the steps she will take to enact them, with some of the others on stage with her?
Klobuchar has leaned heavily on Minnesota donors to maintain enough momentum to continue and has even adopted some accounting tricks in order to inflate her cash on hand.
In other news
* Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló announced his planned resignation on Wednesday, after citizens took to the streets for a week of protests and it became clear that impeachment proceedings would take place. The protests began after nonprofit news site Centro de Periodismo Investigativo exposed hundreds of pages of transcripts, in which Rosselló disparaged his colleagues with sexist and misogynistic jokes. Rosselló will step down on August 2nd.
* Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified on Wednesday, relaying many of the facts already available in report he released in April. Instead of the hearing itself, the news story quickly became how pundits and outlets characterized his performance, rather than what Mueller confirmed. When asked by Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler if he totally exonerate the president, Mueller replied, “No.”
* A U.S. citizen was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection for 23 days. Francisco Erwin Galicia told Dallas Morning News that he was not able to shower for the entire time he was in custody and lost a total of 26 pounds.
Quote of the week
“The problem: The presidential seal was not, in fact, the presidential seal at all… Instead of arrows, the eagle clutched a set of golf clubs in a talon. It appeared as the president emerged onstage.” ⁠— Sarah Mervosh and Niraj Chokshi in the New York Times, describing the scene at a speech by given President Trump this week.
What I’m reading
Elisa von Joeden-Forgey in the Inquirer: My friends were detained by ICE in Philly. Here’s what happened when I tried to help them.
In a perspective piece, Professor Joeden-Forgey goes over her experience trying to assist her friends, Elly and Fnu, two asylum seekers from Indonesia, and described how difficult it was to provide them legal assistance. It’s worth reading if you want to understand just how difficult it can be to formally deal with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Molly Langmuir in Elle: Jia Tolentino Makes Sense Out of This Nonsense Moment

Texto completo: A wise old man was once asked how he'd like to be judged. "I've made a lot of friends and a few enemies in my life," he replied. "On the whole, I'm proud of my enemies."
I was reminded of that fine rule for living as I watched the unfolding political spectacles on both sides of the Atlantic this week. On Wednesday, in Washington, Robert Mueller, the special counsel in whose work the enemies of President Trump have invested so much hope, testified about his investigation before a brace of congressional committees. At exactly the same time in London, Boris Johnson, to the dismay of his many foes, finally reached the top of the greasy pole, as Benjamin Disraeli called it, and entered 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister.
For both leaders, the occasions were—in different ways—a victory over their adversaries, a long-awaited coda to a political melodrama that has played out in a very public way for the last few years.
Mr. Mueller's seven hours of faltering, flat, occasionally bafflingly underprepared testimony probably just about killed off any remaining prospect that President Trump would be impeached. Sure, the special counsel's report documents many instances of some highly reprehensible behavior by the president; the cynicism, chicanery and mendacity it describes are eye-opening.
But the appetite for impeaching Mr. Trump—on the basis of a report that uncovered no collusion with Russia but some (mostly risibly ham-fisted and ultimately unexecuted) efforts by the president to curtail the investigation—has more or less vanished. As Mr. Mueller fumbled and mumbled his way through his brief, you could almost hear the air going out of the balloon of indignation that has been floating over Washington for the last two and a half years. Only a few diehard Democrats, such as Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, vowed to plow onward after the hearing.
In London, Mr. Johnson's elevation similarly left the dual armies of political opponents and mass media in thinly disguised anguish. While his enemies have been trying to remove Mr. Trump from office, in Mr. Johnson's case they've been spending the same amount of time and energy trying to prevent him from entering it. Since he led the successful campaign to take Britain out of the European Union in 2016, he has been the target of all those who want to undo the referendum result and restore the glorious status quo. He's mostly avoided the quasi-legal tangle in which Mr. Trump has found himself, but the political hammering has been no less fierce.
For both men, though, it's their enemies who are in reality turning out to be their best friends.
I've written before about the hysteria these two iconoclastic figures seem to induce in the supposedly sane. It's become clear that the more certain parts of the press and TV scream Trump and Boris headlines, the more inclined it makes their supporters to come to their aid—and the more it makes others, who don't share these passions, simply tune it all out.
This week, the loony quotient was way up there, with certain pundits and politicians ranting ever more loudly about the unfitness of the two men for office. "Boris Johnson Is How Britain Ends," said an opinion piece in the New York Times, a news organization that has, by the way, been deep into Britain's eschatology ever since the Brexit vote three years ago.
The issue is not that the two men are above reproach or that critics don't have a case.
The problem is that what really animates so many of their more deranged enemies is an absolute refusal even to come to terms with the political context that produced the Trump-Boris condominium.
It remains a constant source of astonishment to me that, three years on from the Brexit-Trump shock, the people who control most of our public dialogue seem to refuse to accept that there is any legitimacy to the political sentiments that caused it. Both phenomena are ascribed to the Neanderthal brains of racists and fools. There's never been a serious effort to understand why so many voters have found the existing political order in need of a radical change.
The irony, of course—still entirely lost on those who oppose them—is that both Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson are where they are largely because, given a choice, voters decided they disliked their enemies even more.

Texto completo: We're our worst enemy

I agree with Steven Conn's excellent piece in the July 21 issue of The Blade: "Racial nationalism is root of shameful history." The most likely country to destroy America is America.

To those people yelling or thinking "Send them home!" when they see someone who doesn't resemble themselves: Please stop proving that statement.

ProMedica effect

Many thanks to the July 19 letter writer of "Taxpayers own space." I don't think I will ever go to our convention center again if it says ProMedica.

ProMedica says they have invested a lot of money in Toledo. What they don't admit is it was on the broken bankbooks of many of our Toledo residents.

Increased spur use

What is happening to the East Toledo Belt Street spur of Norfolk Southern? Lately there has been increased train traffic, longer blocked traffic on neighborhood streets, malfunctioning crossing gates that are only temporarily fixed, faster moving freight trains, and increased horn blowing. This spur goes through a quiet neighborhood with a lot of homes built close to the track.

The spur was abandoned for a long time, then reopened by Norfolk Southern to service the Sun Oil Refinery and as a bypass.

Now, freight trains are running at all hours. This morning one train engineer found it necessary to blow the horn the full length of the spur at 6 a.m.

School will be opening in just over a month from now and a lot of children cross this spur on Nevada Street on their way to Raymer School.

I fear for their safety with the increase of freight trains and the speeds they are running through this quiet neighborhood.

Left's brainwashing

It was with dismay, disbelief, and disgust that I read Mike Sigov's commentary on July 21. I expect that kind of treasonous tripe from the Washington Post and the New York Times, but not from The Blade.

President Trump is not a racist, and anybody who thinks he is has been brainwashed by the Left's propaganda.

The Blade should not be contributing to that.

Nor is President Trump in league with the Russians. It's fake news to say he is. Again, The Blade should not be party to that.

The Left's only hope of winning in 2020 is to have the American public believe that President Trump is worse than a communist.

If people think that the President is a racist, they might be willing to vote for a communist.

Does the Blade have a staff writer that can tell the truth about the President?

Texto completo: SAN JUAN – The next governor of Puerto Rico is a close ally of the current one, a former women's advocate and a controversial figure on this politically energized island.
Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez, 58, is poised to assume the island's leadership Aug. 2 following the swift rise and meteoric fall of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. The governor resigned late Wednesday after almost two weeks of sometimes massive protests fueled by the release of tasteless and cruel private text messages two weeks ago.
Vázquez is jumping the line of succession. The secretary of state normally would be next up, but the job is vacant after Luis Rivera Marín, who figured prominently in the texting scandal, resigned the post.
Vázquez's close political ties to Rosselló, along with her own political history, have many people here viewing her as only a temporary solution. Within hours of Rosselló's announcement, #WandaRenuncia began trending on Twitter.
“I was here until about 2 a. m. , and when they said through the megaphone that Wanda would be the one to take over, everybody started saying ‘No’ and immediately started yelling, ‘Wanda resign,'" said Yomarili Rosa, 28, a librarian protesting Wednesday in front of La Fortaleza, the governor's mansion.
Eduardo Garcia, 62, said he believes Vázquez is corrupt.
"She’s a justice secretary who won’t prosecute anybody from the party in power," the retired agronomist said. "She's not going to last a week and a half. "
A lawyer, Vázquez has a long history of government service. She worked in the Housing Department before assuming a series of positions with Justice. In 2010 she was appointed to head the department's women's rights office, where she sometimes clashed with feminist leaders.
Saadi Rosado of the advocacy group Feminist Collective told The New York Times that feminist groups were critical of Vázquez and said she was a bureaucrat who failed to address gender violence.
Rosselló appointed her secretary of justice when he began his four-year term in January 2017. Her short term, however, has been riddled with controversy. She was investigated for claims of favoring family members in a possibly criminal dispute, but an investigator found insufficient evidence to go forward. She also has been accused of dragging her feet on some investigations such as questionable licensing of medical marijuana clinics.
But the strongest issues have concerned corruption related to Hurricane Maria recovery. The storm devastated the island in September 2017, and many neighborhoods have yet to become whole. Many here want to know what happened to the relief money and accuse Vázquez of dragging her feet trying to find out.
Vázquez issued a statement Thursday saying the marijuana issue was referred to a prosecutor and is under investigation.
"She didn’t address directly in the press release the issue with María relief," noted Carlos A. Suárez Carrasquillo, a Puerto Rico native who lectures on Latin American at the University of Florida. "There is significant opposition to her. "
Vázquez also has been at odds with Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz, who is taking over Rosselló's role as president of the powerful, pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Many on the island believe Schatz wants the job more than Vázquez.
School teacher Miriam Melendez, 35, cited newly released documents indicating Vázquez avoided prosecuting the Rosselló administration for alleged corruption and mismanagement.
“There are documents coming out now showing she did not investigate, she was not ethical," Melendez said. "That’s meant to prop up Schatz. We don’t want them either. ”
Rosselló isn't out the door yet. He announced his resignation effective at the end of next week, but he had not issued a resignation letter Thursday. Legislators are digging in. An impeachment report from the speaker of the House, Johnny Méndez, suggested that five criminal activities related to the Telegram messenger chats had been committed.
The texts were sent among and between Rosselló and about a dozen male associates from November 2018 to January 2019. One female political foe was described as a "whore"; popular San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and beloved singer Ricky Martin were mocked. Insensitive comments were made against women, disabled people and some residents suffering after Maria.
Rosselló has apologized and said the texts were a way to vent frustration privately – or so he thought. But the controversy would not die. And it may not die with him, as Vázquez is learning.
"Vázquez is unlikely to stay as a permanent governor," Suárez said. "Especially if accusations keep piling up and protest against her continue and pick up steam. "
Bacon reported from McLean, Va.

DoorDash to revamp tipping policy

Texto completo: Following a report critical of how DoorDash doles out tips to its delivery staff, the chief executive of the San Francisco-based food-delivery company said it will make major changes to its tipping policy that had been, in effect, cutting its employees out from many of their tips.
Tony Xu, DoorDash's CEO, said on Twitter late Tuesday that his company would ensure that its employees, called "Dashers," will soon see their earnings "increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order," instead of using tips to subsidize those employees' base pay levels.
The brouhaha began with a New York Times story in which a reporter wrote about his experiences as a deliveryman for services such as DoorDash, Uber Eats and Postmates. The reporter described DoorDash's tipping policy, in which tips left in DoorDash's app were being used to complete minimum payments that the company had promised for its delivery staff.
The Times gave an example of how the policy worked: If DoorDash said it would pay $7 for a delivery, and a customer didn't use the DoorDash app to provide a tip, DoorDash would pay the delivery person $7.
However, if the customer gave a tip of $3, DoorDash would pay the Dasher $4 directly, then add on the $3 tip for a $7 payment.
"We thought we were doing the right thing by making Dashers whole when a customer left no tip," Xu said, on Twitter. "What we missed was that some customers who did tip would feel like their tip did not matter."

FEDERAL INVESTIGATION: Facebook fined $5B for privacy violations

Texto completo: The U.S. government Wednesday issued a rebuke of Facebook after a year of massive privacy mishaps, charging the company deceived its users, as part of a settlement that requires the tech giant to pay $5 billion -- the largest fine in U.S. history for a privacy violation -- and submit to significant federal oversight of its business practices.
Sixteen months after opening its investigation, the Federal Trade Commission alleged Facebook deceived its 2.2 billion users by failing to disclose that phone numbers uploaded to enhance their security would be used for advertising purposes, for example, and it charged Facebook misrepresented to millions of users that some facial-recognition features were on by default.
As part of the settlement, Facebook no longer can use phone numbers this way, and it must obtain explicit permission before deploying facial recognition in new forms. The agreement also seeks to remedy other highly publicized abuses at Facebook, including a March 2019 incident where hundreds of millions of users' passwords had been stored in plain text. Now, Facebook must encrypt them, and scan its databases to ensure that they are, the FTC said.
The company will still be able to make product decisions as it always has, and will still be able to collect the same data from users.
But the punishment does amount to a major, formal rebuke for chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in the eyes of Facebook users, workers and investors. Zuckerberg and his fellow executives maintained for more than a year that Facebook never violated the consent decree it struck with the FTC in 2011.
What's next
Facebook must submit to 20 years of oversight from an independent committee on the board. During that time, any violations could result in more fines and punishments, and Zuckerberg could be held personally responsible for future infractions. A third-party organization will be tasked with reviewing Face-book's data-collection practices and those of its other services, Instagram and WhatsApp.
--The Associated Press, Washington Post and The New York Times contributed to this report

MORE DEVELOPMENTS Things Facebook must do
The U.S. government's $5 billion fine and other requirements of Facebook for its widespread violation of consumers' privacy is a major rebuke for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who had long denied any such violation.
NIALL CARSON / TNS
Antitrust investigation
The FTC's order doesn't add any significant new items for the company to fix, and many of the broad stipulations in the settlement require Facebook to do things the company is already doing or has promised to do. A few examples:
|Conduct a privacy review of every new or modified product, service, or practice before it is implemented.
|Exercise greater oversight over third-party apps and terminate app developers that fail to comply.
|Provide clear notice of facial recognition technology, and obtain user consent prior to any use.
|Encrypt user passwords and regularly scan to detect whether any passwords are stored in plaintext.
--BLOOMBERG
Facebook announced Wednesday that it was informed in June that it is under an antitrust investigation. Critics say a breakup is needed because Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its apps to mimic the services of other companies.

Which Disneyland attraction has the most riders since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened? You’ll be surprised

Texto completo: You’d be forgiven for assuming the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction has had the most riders of any Disneyland attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened — but you’d be off by a long shot.
Disneyland announced last week that 1 million riders have ridden the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge debuted. That statistical peek behind the curtain tells us a lot about the ride capacity of the E-Ticket attraction and the number of people visiting the new themed land .
The Ridgeway family of Ocean Springs, Miss. were recognized as the 1 millionth riders of Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run on July 16, according to Disneyland.
Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily crowd sizes and ride wait times at theme parks, says that based on the available information Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has averaged about 27,000 riders per day since May 31, approximately 76% of the attraction’s ride capacity.
That pales in comparison to It’s a Small World (57,000 riders per day) and Pirates of the Carribbean (55,000) during the same period and is just short of Big Thunder Mountain (35,000), Hyperspace Mountain (31,000) and Indiana Jones Adventure (31,000), according to Touring Plans estimates.
You read that right: The half century-old Small World has had way more riders than the 2-month-old Smugglers Run.
But of course, Small World and Pirates are high-capacity people-eater rides that vacuum up visitors and often still manage to maintain relatively short wait times.
Disneyland officials said Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has performed extremely well with very little downtime during the million-rider run thanks to the hard work and dedication of cast members and Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative arm of the company.
“Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is among our highest rated attractions and we are thrilled by the guest reviews we have received since opening,” Disneyland officials said in a statement.
SEE ALSO: How to fly the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run
Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge officially debuted on May 31 after a series of employee and media previews. Disneyland instituted a reservation-only period for Galaxy’s Edge that ran through June 23. Beginning June 24, the new Star Wars land was opened to all visitors. A virtual queue boarding pass system put in place to manage crowds has been rarely used.
While the million-rider mark sounds impressive, other Disneyland attractions likely outpaced Smugglers Run during the same period.
During Smugglers million-rider run, Small World and Pirates could have hit the same mark operating at approximately 45% of their hourly capacity while Big Thunder could have done it at 70% capacity and Hyperspace Mountain at 80%, according to Touring Plans.
Smuggler’s Run can accommodate up to 1,800 riders per hour, according to the New York Times.
The average wait time for Smugglers Run dropped from 47 minutes on opening day to 22 minutes on June 23, according to Touring Plans data. The average Smugglers Run wait time spiked to 59 minutes on June 24 — the first day guests could enter the land without a reservation — and reached a high of 89 minutes over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Using Smugglers Run ridership as a guide, Touring Plans estimates that Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has attracted between 2.7 million and 5 million visitors since opening day.
“My strong suspicion is that the number is toward the bottom end of that range based on the low wait times we saw throughout June,” said Len Testa, president of Touring Plans, an online subscription service that lets users create custom theme park itineraries.
Disneyland rarely if ever talks about attendance numbers or ridership figures.
Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is the lone anchor attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge until the Rise of the Resistance dark ride debuts on Jan. 17, six months behind schedule.
To the surprise of many theme park observers, Disneyland has experienced lighter than usual summertime traffic since Galaxy’s Edge opened May 31.

Texto completo: House Democrats hoped that Wednesday's hearings would allow them to highlight their favorite portions of the Mueller report for people who haven't read it. Democrats didn't expect this segment of Americans to include the author.
Largely unwilling to promote, defend or elaborate on a document with which he seemed strangely unfamiliar, former Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller let stand the report's finding of no Trump-Russia collusion and, intentionally or not, ensured that his work will not be used to drive a duly-elected President from office.
By late morning it was clear that the Democratic effort to coax a dramatic reading of the Mueller report from its ostensible author was failing. Eliana Johnson wrote in Politico:
"So far, so good," a senior White House official said in a text message when lawmakers took a brief break about 90 minutes into the Judiciary Committee hearing. Another Trump ally described the mood in the White House simply as "euphoria."
The president himself, who said Monday he was unlikely to tune into the hearings, has been gleefully telling people he thinks Mueller's testimony will stop any momentum toward impeachment, according to a source familiar with the conversations.
The impeachment dream is dead, and nobody has more explaining to do at the next meeting of the House Democratic caucus than Judiciary committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York. In 2017 he asked his colleagues to entrust him with one job. As this column has noted , after former Rep. John Conyers Jr. resigned amid numerous allegations of harassing women, the New York Times described the Nadler argument for replacing him:
Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York has a bold pitch to take over the top Democratic spot on the House Judiciary Committee — that he is best positioned to lead impeachment proceedings against President Trump.
"As our constitutional expert, and with his demonstrated leadership on impeachment in the 90s, Nadler is our strongest member to lead a potential impeachment," Mr. Nadler wrote on a pocket-size leaflet outlining his record.
As House Democrats reflect on his bold pitch from 2017, perhaps they will decide it's time for a stronger member to lead the committee.
Of much greater significance, the death of the impeachment dream means that Democrats will now have to persuade voters—not just congressional colleagues—to dump Mr. Trump.
How refreshing that even a group of political actors casting themselves as a "resistance" still has to use the constitutional process in America if they wish to remove a President from office.
***
Speaking of attempting to gain power via a legitimate democratic process, the additional bad news for Democrats this week is that one of the leading contenders to replace the President is still struggling to resolve an issue that goes to the core of his candidacy.
Last week this column noted that socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who claims to advocate for workers against corporate managers, has managed to inspire a worker protest against the management of his presidential campaign:
Disgruntled comrades are accusing the campaign led by the country's most famous anti-capitalist of denying them fair wages. They've lately been sticking it to the man by taking to an online messaging service to demand reform of his pay practices.
This week Mr. Sanders still hasn't managed to make his union problem disappear. Hassan Kanu and Andrew Wallender of Bloomberg report :
Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) 2020 presidential campaign has been hit with an unfair labor practice complaint alleging illegal employee interrogation and retaliation against staffers.
The July 19 complaint to the National Labor Relations Board, filed by an unnamed individual in Indiana, was posted to the agency's website late July 22. It comes as tense negotiations between the Sanders campaign and the union representing staffers recently boiled over publicly. The Washington Post reported July 23 that unionized organizers for the campaign had won a pay raise and reached a compromise to reduce the hours of some workers.
A copy of the charge has not yet been made public, but the agency's July 22 docket lists five potential violations of the National Labor Relations Act. The charge also alleges that the campaign unlawfully discharged an employee, modified a labor contract, and engaged in illegal discipline.
The NLRB website has a page devoted to the case, which has been assigned to a regional office in Indianapolis.
It's too early to say for sure whether Sen. Sanders retaliates against workers who summon the courage to raise their voices about conditions in his workplace. But the senator appears to recognize how difficult it will be to win the Democratic nomination if he doesn't at least appear to be sympathetic to the plight of working people. For example, an abrupt scheduling change brought him to a Tuesday night rally staged by a union of airline workers threatening to walk off the job at Reagan National Airport. Ian Kullgren and Alex Thompson of Politico report :
"Bernie was very last-minute," said Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, who had the crowd roaring in her own speech Tuesday night. "There was no plan for Bernie to be here. I can show you the lineup I had yesterday, and he wasn't on it."
Perhaps Mr. Sanders would also consider showing up unexpectedly to listen to the concerns of his employees who have been struggling to make ends meet. As any good manager can tell him, the time to engage with workers is before they threaten to strike.

Texto completo: DoorDash Inc. plans to change how it pays food-delivery workers after facing criticism for applying customer tips to the minimum payments that workers receive for each drop-off.
The closely held delivery service will roll out a new compensation structure to ensure worker pay rises when customers tip on its app, Chief Executive Tony Xu said Tuesday on Twitter.
"The new model will ensure that Dashers' earnings will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order," Mr. Xu said.
The company, which in May was valued at $13 billion following a $600 million funding round, didn't respond to a request for comment.
Share Your Thoughts
Has news about DoorDash's current policy made you rethink how you tip on app-based services? Join the conversation below.
DoorDash currently guarantees workers a minimum amount for each delivery based on the time and effort it expects is required to complete the task, it says on its website.
When customers electronically add a tip to their total bill, the company puts that payment toward the guaranteed minimum it pays the worker, rather than increasing the payment by the amount of the tip. Workers see how much the minimum is before they agree to handle the delivery, according to DoorDash.
"We did not launch our current model to pay Dashers less," Mr. Xu said on Twitter.
The New York Times published a story on Sunday that discussed the compensation model, sparking criticism of how DoorDash handles tips.
DoorDash has been pushing to expand its footprint and sign deals with restaurants . The company recently agreed to start delivering food for McDonald's Corp. The hamburger chain also has tapped Uber Technologies Inc.'s Uber Eats business to provide delivery services.

Deutsche Bank Tied To Epstein Finances

Texto completo: Deutsche Bank AG played a key role in Jeffrey Epstein's financial dealings in recent years, helping the accused sex-trafficker move millions of dollars in cash and securities through dozens of private-banking accounts with the German bank, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Epstein, a wealthy American financier facing two counts in New York related to alleged sex trafficking of minors, used Deutsche Bank's private-wealth division to hold and manage assets connected to him, clients or entities he was affiliated with for a number of years, some of the people said.
Bank executives believe they severed the lender's relationship fully with Mr. Epstein by the end of June, the people said.
"Deutsche Bank is closely examining any business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and we are absolutely committed to cooperating with all relevant authorities," a spokesman said.
A lawyer for Mr. Epstein declined to comment.
The New York charges come more than a decade after Mr. Epstein had been under investigation for similar allegations in Florida. That investigation ended with Mr. Epstein signing a nonprosecution agreement in 2007 that immunized him from federal charges. In exchange, he pleaded guilty to two Florida state counts related to prostitution, served a 13-month sentence and registered as a sex offender.
Germany's biggest bank faces a criminal money-laundering probe in the U.S. In addition, Congress is scrutinizing its relationship with President Trump and others in his circle.
The bank has said it is cooperating with investigations and working on improving its processes for detecting and preventing illicit cash flows.
Deutsche Bank's relationship with Mr. Epstein appeared to pick up the pace around the time another big bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., dropped Mr. Epstein as a client, people close to both banks said. JPMorgan had a longstanding private-banking relationship with Mr. Epstein from the 1990s through about 2013, when it cut ties in part based on reputational concerns, people close to the bank said. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.
It couldn't be determined how much cash and other assets the Deutsche Bank accounts held, or how much belonged to Mr. Epstein. Some accounts weren't obviously linked to him by name, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. People who have known Mr. Epstein say that over the years he obtained authorization to trade through accounts of associates, sometimes investing money for them or otherwise directing transactions.
Deutsche Bank managers began to shut down some accounts tied to Mr. Epstein in late 2018 after an employee raised concerns based in part on articles about his Florida plea agreement in the Miami Herald in November, the people familiar with the matter said. The concerns were raised to supervisors involved in efforts to stem client money flows that could fund illegal purposes and to protect the lender against reputational issues, some of the people said.
Employees had raised concerns in the past about some transactions related to business affiliated with Mr. Epstein, but the bank maintained relationships with numerous accounts, the people said. They said the bank is still reviewing the scope of the business in light of the charges against Mr. Epstein.
The New York Times on Tuesday reported the existence of dozens of accounts and concerns raised inside the bank.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan on July 8 unsealed charges against Mr. Epstein alleging he recruited dozens of girls for sex abuse, including in his Manhattan home, as part of a broader sex-trafficking operation involving girls as young as 14. Mr. Epstein has pleaded not guilty.
After his arrest, federal prosecutors said they obtained Mr. Epstein's records from a financial institution, which they said show Mr. Epstein late last year paying $350,000 to two of his associates who might be called to testify against him. Prosecutors haven't identified the financial institution. The bank didn't say whether it was involved in those transactions.
Prosecutors cited the alleged payments to argue that Mr. Epstein engaged in possible witness-tampering and would pose a risk to the government's continuing investigation if released on bail.

Sweet news: The sugar snap pea turns 50

Texto completo: In the spring of 1969, in Twin Falls, Idaho, Calvin Lamborn, a young plant breeder at the Gallatin Valley Seed company, crossed a snow pea with a thick-podded rogue type pea — yielding a most unusual new plant whose plump pod was as delicious as its little green pearls. Lamborn's creation would become known as the sugar snap pea. That cult legume — once hailed as the vegetable of the century — turns 50 this year.
Lamborn died in 2017, but Bill Albers, now owner-president of Albers Enterprise, a snap pea seed production and marketing firm, was also in the field on the fateful day in 1969.
“They handed me a pod, and I started to shell it — out of ignorance," Albers, at the time assistant manager of Gallatin Valley Seed, recalls. “They told me to eat it pod and all, so I reluctantly took a bite."
Today, we have forgotten how transgressive that first bite would have been. Our cultural amnesia is, in fact, proof of the sugar snap's rise to dominance.
Built up from nothing only 50 years ago, sugar snap peas are now an international, multi-million-dollar industry. The total fresh sugar-snap market in the United States is currently valued at $153 million, according to Mann Packing Company (a division of Del Monte Produce), which controls 51 percent of the market. Maine-based seed purveyor Johnny's Selected Seeds, whose customers include small-scale commercial farmers as well as home gardeners, now sells more sugar snap seed than any other type of pea.
Like many of humanity's great inventions, the sugar snap pea cleaves history into two distinct eras.
I was born in 1986, squarely in the post-sugar snap age. This means, among other things, that I've never had to shell a single pea.
“My dear, you have missed an experience," Bonnie Lam­born, Calvin Lamborn's widow, told me.
Born in 1943, she grew up in Shelley, Idaho, where her father grew shell peas in the family garden.
“I would sit under the elm tree in the front yard in the shade and shell them," she recalls. “I would just have a bucketful all shelled, and here came Dad with another bucketful." She laughed at the memory of the Sisyphean chore.
My own food-obsessed, millennial set has so fully embraced romantic visions of kitchen labor that everywhere one reads of the great pleasure of cooking: the joy of chopping and frying and roasting and basting; the true ecstasy of dinner prep in the upper-middle-class kitchen. Rarely do we read of work.
Looking back, I suspect that for an earlier generation of American women — who, after all, did most of the pea shelling and pea cooking and pea serving — the sugar snap must have been a liberation.
Even the 1950s English food writer Elizabeth David — usually a true friend to veg, and not shy of kitchen work, either — once confessed that “shelling peas is certainly a good deal of trouble."
Bonnie Lamborn, who refers lovingly to the sugar snap as “really quite a nice little vegetable," has not shelled a single pea since 1969.
“After they were invented, I never went back to the old English pea," she admits.
Her children grew up in a new world where pea pods were edible.
Rod Lamborn, now CEO of Magic Seed, a company started by his father in 1997, remembers his first, confusing, childhood encounter with a conventional shell pea at a neighbor's house.
“I couldn't understand why you just couldn't eat the pod," he recalls.
“I eat the pod," he'd protested at the time. “We eat the pod."
“You don't know what you're talking about," the grown-ups had insisted.
“It definitely was a revolution," he told me by phone recently. “The idea of eating the pod . . . really kind of changed the system."
Everyone did not, it turned out, want to join the revolution. During the sugar snap's long development before commercial launch, resistance was institutional, as well as cultural.
“Our biggest opponents were our own upper management," Albers recalls. “People wanted the research department to focus on the real bread-and-butter breeding programs of peas and beans for canning and freezing. That was the company's business."
In 1979, when the sugar snap was finally introduced to America, it caused a national sensation. The York Daily Record of Pennsylvania raved, “New pea almost as sweet as candy." “So insipid a comparison," argued the food critic at The New York Times, “does not do justice to the sophisticated verdant flavor of this new vegetable." For The Washington Post it was “a super legume . . . [that] might revolutionize children's attitudes towards vegetables," and, furthermore, such a sweet feat with “only three calories in each pod — less than conventional peas." By the end of its first growing season, the sugar snap had been “a rage across the U.S.," according to one Canadian writer.
There have been many other varieties since — including a now ubiquitous stringless pod that Mann Packing stocks at Star Market, 7-Eleven, Walmart, and Target, among other places — but for Rod Lamborn no subsequent snaps have ever matched the first for flavor.
His father had once told The New York Times the luxury of breeding for flavor was part of what made his new pea unique.
“You can't breed for everything at once," he'd told the Times, “and flavor is usually what is considered last."
Not so with the original sugar snap.
Bill Albers still remembers his reaction to that very first bite.
“Jesus Christ, this tastes good," he'd said that day. “This tastes like a fruit. Kids will love it."
“And it was true," he told me 50 years later.

Coca-Cola stock boosted by sales of less sugary drinks
Coca-Cola Co. shares surged to open at a record high Tuesday after its latest earnings got another boost from drinks with less sugar, more than offsetting the company's sluggish home market. It also updated its forecast for the full year, saying it now expects to post organic revenue growth of 5 percent, up from the 4 percent target it had issued earlier. Coke, as it tries to fend off Pepsi and other competitors, has been diversifying beyond sugary drinks. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SHIPPING
UPS to begin Sunday pickups and deliveries next year
United Parcel Service Inc. will begin Sunday pickup and delivery next year, joining competitor FedEx Corp., which announced the move to seven-day service in May. The two largest US couriers are under pressure to speed up deliveries as longtime customer Amazon.com Inc. morphs into a competitor by building out an overnight cargo-airline and ground-delivery service. UPS said the Sunday service would include SurePost, which are packages handed off to the US Postal Service. A new five-year union contract created a new class of driver that gave UPS the flexibility to deliver on weekends. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Lyft is making research data on self-driving technology public
Lyft Inc. is making research data on self-driving technology available to the public in a bid to accelerate the development of robotic cars, which is seen as critical to the ride-hailing giant's future viability. Billing it as the largest such trove of data made available to researchers and rivals, Lyft said Tuesday the initiative includes more than 55,000 three-dimensional frames gleaned from cameras, lidar, and radar installed on its research fleet. It also includes data from highly detailed maps created by Lyft's test vehicles, which have been gathering data for nearly two years. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

NYC City Council to consider banning sale of cellphone location data
New York's City Council will consider a bill to ban the sale of cellphone users' location data to marketers. The New York Times reported that the bill to be introduced Tuesday would make it illegal for cellphone companies and app developers to share location data with third parties while a customer's mobile device is within city limits. Telecommunications companies make billions of dollars a year selling customer location data to a variety of businesses. Mark Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, says the collection of location data "raises far-reaching privacy concerns." No federal law specifically protects cellphone customers' location data. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Veteran NYT editor and reporter to lead The Forward
The Forward, a 122-year-old Jewish publication, named a new leader of its newsroom Tuesday, appointing Jodi Rudoren, a veteran editor and reporter at The New York Times, as editor-in-chief. In hiring Rudoren, a former Jerusalem bureau chief for The Times, The Forward is taking another step past a tumultuous period. After moving from a weekly to a monthly schedule, the publication ceased its print edition this past spring. It also cut nearly 30 percent of its staff, including the previous editor-in-chief, Jane Eisner. Last week, the publisher and chief executive, Rachel Fishman Feddersen, announced the receipt of a $500,000 gift from Craig Newmark, the Craigslist founder and media philanthropist. Feddersen said the money would be used to revitalize The Forward's website and expand its readership. Rudoren, who joined The Times in 1998, is an associate managing editor at the paper, developing strategies to better engage readers. She is expected to start her new job in September. — NEW YORK TIMES
MOTORCYCLES
Harley-Davidson cuts outlook on weak global sales
Harley-Davidson Inc. cut its full-year operating margin outlook and 2019 bike shipment forecast after weak global motorcycle sales and the impact of tariffs dented second quarter earnings. The Milwaukee-based manufacturer slashed its shipment forecast this year to 212,000 to 217,000, from a previous range of 217,000 to 222,000. Lower shipments also prompted it to reduce its expected 2019 operating margin on its motorcycles to 6 percent to 7 percent of revenue, from a previous 8 percent to 9 percent. Retail sales in the United States, its biggest market, fell 8 percent, the 10th consecutive quarter of declines, while worldwide sales dropped 8.4 percent. European deliveries, which had resisted steep declines in recent quarters, tumbled 12.5 percent. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SOCIAL MEDIA
Snapchat recovers after improving mobile phone app
Snapchat's growth accelerated after the social-media company rolled out an improved version of its Android mobile phone app, a sign of recovery after a rocky period. Snapchat, the messaging and photo-sharing app owned by Snap Inc., said an average of 203 million users logged in daily in the second quarter, well ahead of the 191.7 million estimated by analysts. In a statement on Tuesday, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based company also said sales in the period jumped 48 percent to $388 million, topping the $360.5 million average projection, according to a Bloomberg survey. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Hasbro profit up on sales of Avenger and Aladdin toys
Hasbro Inc. reported second-quarter profit and sales that exceeded analysts' projections as shoppers snapped up Avengers and Aladdin toys following the latest blockbuster film releases. Shares surged to the highest intraday level on record. Revenue for the world's largest publicly traded toymaker was $984.5 million, the second straight quarterly gain. Chief financial officer Deborah Thomas reiterated that Hasbro expects to return to profitable growth in 2019. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
REAL ESTATE
Home sales fell in June
US home sales tumbled 1.7 percent in June, with rising prices and a scarce supply locking out many Americans from ownership. The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that homes were sold last month at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.27 million units. Sales have shriveled 2.2 percent over the past 12 months, despite such positive trends as a robust job market and falling mortgage rates. But home prices have been climbing faster than incomes for the past seven years. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
AUTOMOTIVE
Chinese company buys bigger share of Daimler
Beijing Automotive Group said Tuesday that it would acquire a stake in the German carmaker Daimler, deepening the company's ties to China's vast but troubled car market and illustrating the country's growing clout in the global auto industry. The Beijing company said it would acquire shares and voting rights equal to a 5 percent stake in Daimler. The two companies are already partners in China, which has long required foreign automakers to strike comprehensive joint ventures with Chinese firms in order to make cars. — NEW YORK TIMES
FAST FOOD
Austrian McDonald's to paste over slogan that angered Italians
The Austrian branch of McDonald's says it will paste over a slogan that drew the ire of Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on posters in an Italy-themed ad campaign. McDonald's put up posters with the slogan "Fuer echte Mampfiosi," or "for real Mampfiosi" — the latter apparently a play on the German "Mampf," meaning "chow," and mafiosi. Salvini on Sunday tweeted a picture of a billboard with the comment: "Italians all Mafiosi? How sad." The company's Austrian branch said Tuesday the offending slogan will be pasted over with the words "Fuer echte Amici" (“for real friends") in the coming days. Marketing director Joerg Pizzera said that "of course it wasn't our intention to insult Italians in any way and we apologize to all those who feel insulted." — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Texto completo: How can a senator issue a warning about U.S. debt levels without noting the massive debt of the federal government? On Monday Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass) published an essay entitled "The Coming Economic Crash and How to Stop It." While sounding the alarm on private borrowing, the only problem she cited with federal debt was the risk that Congress and the President might not authorize more of it.
Turns out she didn't need to worry about an end to the federal borrowing binge. Just hours after Sen. Warren's warning, a bipartisan agreement ensured that she and her colleagues can continue adding to Washington's $22-trillion debt pile for at least another two years.
The new agreement also calls for a two-year federal discretionary spending surge of $320 billion above the limits set in a 2011 budget law. This latest turbo-charging of federal borrowing doesn't seem to have triggered a warning from Sen. Warren, who focused this week on other concerns. "I see a precarious economy that is built on debt — both household debt and corporate debt — and that is vulnerable to shocks," she warned on Monday.
Household and corporate debt can certainly contribute to financial crises. But what has to irk taxpayers is that in making her case that household borrowing is too high, Sen. Warren notes the rapid increase in student debt since the last financial crisis. Has any active politician done more than Sen. Warren to expand student debt since the financial crisis?
A relentless campaigner for more taxpayer-backed education financing, Ms. Warren was making the case even before she was elected to the Senate. A Journal editorial in October of 2012 noted her debate against then-Sen. Scott Brown:
The fun began when Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren, a law professor at Harvard, attacked Mr. Brown for voting against the umpteenth Senate bill to expand student-loan subsidies. According to the New York Times, Mr. Brown responded that "she makes $350,000 to teach one course" and received a no-interest loan from Harvard. This, he added, is "one of the driving forces behind the high costs of education."
Rising federal subsidies have allowed colleges to raise their prices, pocketing the increased aid that is allegedly intended to help students.
Once in office, Sen. Warren used fraudulent government accounting to sell the student loan program as a tremendous windfall for taxpayers.
Now the joke's on taxpayers. The day after Monday's debt warning, Ms. Warren proposed another raid on the federal fisc—a plan to "cancel student loan debt for 42 million Americans." According to her summary of the plan, taxpayers will have to provide at least partial debt cancellation for borrowers in households with up to $250,000 in gross income.
Some may naturally wonder why a household taking in $250,000 per year cannot manage to pay its student loan obligations. But any taxpayer thinking that perhaps such a household is spending too much or has borrowed too much is unlikely to find a sympathetic ear in Sen. Warren.
In issuing this week's warning about an "economic crash," the former law professor claimed credit for predicting the financial crisis of 2008. She bases this boast on gripes she made about mortgage lenders in the years before the housing crash. She was also griping about providers of other types of loans. As a student of bankruptcy, she focused on heavily indebted borrowers and often viewed them as victims of circumstances or irresponsible lenders. In 2003 she was discussing her research on a National Public Radio program called "Talk of the Nation" when a caller named Nicholas from Pittsboro, North Carolina challenged her assumptions, according to the transcript:
I notice when I hear these programs a lot of times talking about bankruptcy and debt, a lot of the focus is on joblessness and on health problems. But what I don't hear a lot of is the issue that Americans today really take out way more debt than they probably should. I mean, I'm a 29-year-old, I've got a job and I've got good health, but I also live in a modest-sized home that I purchased and it was not outside of my budget. I don't have credit card debt. I pay down my debt every month. And I'm careful with my money. I notice a lot of people driving the big, fancy cars and living in houses that are a lot bigger than they should be, and they really just take out a lot of debt that they shouldn't have. And I wonder if you could discuss that a little bit.
Ms. Warren reported that people with debt problems were generally not overspending and in fact were spending less on items like clothing than in previous eras. But certain items had simply become much more expensive. The transcript continues:
Prof. WARREN: They're not buying new houses and they're not buying bigger houses. Let me tell you what I think they're buying and why they're spending so much on it. They're trying to buy schools. The public school system has failed middle-class families, especially anywhere near metropolitan areas. And so, unlike a family a generation ago who could buy a house based on what they thought they could afford and then send the kids to the school down the street and count on everything working out, today's family shops school district, school district, school district. And the problem is they're paying a real premium for that. Here's a place where you work out ahead, Nicholas. It turns out that cost in housing has risen more than twice as fast for families with children as for households with no children. They shop in a much narrower range of housing, and the prices are being driven up because of those school districts.
This column has generally looked to things like federal housing subsidies, monetary policy, bank capital rules, and government-anointed credit ratings agencies to understand the financial crisis of 2008. But the Warren thesis suggests that the failure of public education is among the root causes of the crisis. Fascinating. As the senator now seeks endorsements and votes from teachers unions, will she be making this case on the campaign trail?

Texto completo: Luzerne County remained in the national spotlight on Monday, unable to shake the negative attention generated by Wyoming Valley West’s recent threat to send children to foster care over unpaid school lunch debt.
The cable news channel CNN aired a segment about the controversy in which Luzerne County Manager David Pedri vowed Children and Youth officials will never strip parents of their children over school lunch debts.
“This is not something we do. The foster care system should be used as a shield to protect children, not as a sword. Foster care should never be used as a weapon,” Pedri told CNN.
In recent days, the controversy has been covered by some of the nation’s most prominent media outlets, such as the NBC Nightly News and CBS Evening News on television and the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers.
Presidential candidate Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders even weighed in on Twitter.
“School lunch debt should not exist in the wealthiest country in the history of the world,” Sanders wrote. “When we are in the White House, we are going to provide year-round, free universal school meals.”

Texto completo: Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is one of the most revered chefs in the world.
The Michelin-starred chef has fed Oprah, George Clooney and the Dalai Lama. His eponymous fine-dining restaurant in New York got a rare four stars from the New York Times.
Born and trained in France, Vongerichten owns and operates 39 restaurants worldwide and has shared his work on programs like the "Today Show," "Good Morning America" and "Top Chef. "
We caught up with the acclaimed chef as he prepped his latest restaurant Jean-Georges Philadelphia, which opens at Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia in August. Vongerichten dished on food trends and let us know what's fresh and what's past their expiration date.
Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.
Question: What's your favorite trend happening in food today?
Jean-Georges Vongerichten: When I came to New York in 1986, people were eating Chinese food on Sunday nights. I feel today, people eat Asian food two or three times a week because they’re looking for new sensation, new flavors. . . . palates have changed nowadays. They have more tolerance for spice, for acidity, for more flavor on the food.
Q: Are there any food trends you don't like?
Vongerichten: Molecular gastronomy. What I love is the last couple years, we went back to more basics, like simple food. I’m not too crazy about sous vide as well, because I feel like, if you live in a city like Philadelphia or New York, you don’t need to put things in a bag or cook it in a bag. I like fire. I like live cooking. I think we’re going back to that, to a more simple, more direct way of cooking. I feel we are going back in touch to more simple life and more simple things. Nobody needs chemicals in their food. I feel the molecular gastronomy was a little out of wack. I don’t want a shrimp to turn into a noodle. If I eat shrimp, I eat shrimp.
Q: What food will never go out of style?
Vongerichten: People are always going to eat Italian food. They’re always going to have sushi. Is it creative sushi? Is it traditional sushi? I mean, it’s still sushi. Same thing with Italian. But you know what’s never going to go out of style? Good food. Delicious food. Some type of people are looking for weird combination, but, in the end, we’re all going back to delicious.
Q: Your career in food and dining has taken you all over the world. Are there any food trends from other countries you wish were more popular in America?
Vongerichten: When I go to a new city I’ve never been to… I drop my luggage in the hotel. I go straight to the market, and I see how people eat. I feel like all the markets in Asia are run by people cooking at the market. If you look at the food trucks and everything else, the only street food we had in New York for many years was hotdogs. Now we have all kinds of food. . . I’m a big fan of street food.
Q: What's an older trend that isn’t in style anymore but you think should be brought back?
Vongerichten: I feel like in the old days, everything was on a platter. Everything was cooked in a pot, and put the pot in the middle of a table, and people served themselves. I feel we’re going back to that a little bit. I don’t know if it’s the "Game of Thrones" cooking, where you put the leg of lamb in the middle of the table and people slice their own. People want to see the real food. They want to see a head of cauliflower. They want to see a leg of lamb. They want to see a whole squab of chicken or things like that. I feel like we’re going back to bigger pieces, less plating, less touching the food.
Q: How important would you say presentation is to the overall dining experience?
Vongerichten: Oh, it’s very important. I mean, everything has to be Instagramable. Is it a whole chicken on fire or is it something beautifully presented with edible flowers? I think today, visual is very important, as you know. Is it simple? Is it complicated? But the visual I think today where everyone is posting food, everybody is taking pictures of views of design, I think it’s a way of communication today. Sometimes if I go to a restaurant, I go to Instagram to see what the food looks like before I actually make a reservation.
Q: How do you think people will be eating in the future?
Vongerichten: I believe that the future of food is really plant-based. I was saying that to all my chefs. I think with the climate change today and everything, what’s happening in the world, plant-based is really the future of food. We’re still gonna eat steaks and fish and a lot of things, but I think, as a daily diet, we’re probably gonna eat more plants and grains.
Q: You’ve had such an expansive career. Who are some celebrities or famous people you’ve served in your restaurants?
Vongerichten: Oh my God, I have a huge list, but I don’t remember all the names. You know, George Clooney to Oprah. We cooked for the Dalai Lama once. Every day, we have people coming to our restaurants as well, but I feel like everybody is somebody. When you come to us, we treat you the same way.

PSYCHIATRISTS TO USE MUELLER REPORT TO ARGUE TRUMP IS MENTALLY UNFIT: House Democrats are eager to hear from former special counsel Robert Mueller about his investigation into Russian election interference and whether President Trump obstructed justice, but a group of mental health experts who view the president as dangerous see another angle.
In an online town hall Tuesday, they will make the case that Trump is mentally unsound and will urge lawmakers to ask Mueller questions that seek to glean more information about the president’s mental capacity. The event, which will kick off at 5 p.m., will allow viewers to submit questions anonymously.
The town hall, called “Critical Mental Health Questions for Robert Mueller,” will be led by Dr. Bandy Lee, a psychiatrist at Yale School of Medicine. Others set to present are Edwin Fisher, clinical psychologist from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and psychiatrists Drs. Leonard Glass of Harvard Medical School, James Merikangas of George Washington University, and James Gilligan of New York University.
Lee is editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, a book the other panelists also authored that argues psychiatrists have a responsibility to warn the public when a president is dangerous. The position is controversial because psychiatric associations urge members never to diagnose patients they haven't personally evaluated, saying it undermines the scientific rigor of the profession.
But Lee and others who agree with her stance say that their description of the president's behavior is different from a diagnosis. The assessment they issued about the Mueller report, for instance, says Trump has an "inability to take in critical information and advice," "loss of impulse control, recklessness, and ability to consider likely consequences," and "proneness to placing himself and others in danger."
"The signs are so glaring and somebody has to speak the truth," Lee told the Washington Examiner.
The event initially had been set to occur on Capitol Hill last week, but was rescheduled and will now only take place online after the congressional committees moved back the Mueller testimony by a week. Tuesday's forum is separate from another Capitol Hill event that has been in the works, whose exact timing will be revisited in the fall, Lee said.
The panelists won't be keeping track of which lawmakers tune in to view the 5 p.m. event. They also are hosting a conference call at 3 p.m. that will only be for members of Congress and their staff, which is closed to the press and will allow participants to be anonymous. Lee said she hoped both Republicans and Democrats would be open to hearing about the findings.

FIRST MUSTARD GAS TREATMENT GETS APPROVAL: The Food and Drug Administration has approved a product called Silverlon that helps to manage burns caused by mustard gas. The government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority developed the product to protect against a potential biochemical weapon. Silverlon is manufactured by Argentum Medical, and has already been approved and used by first responders as well as the military to treat wounds from burns and blasts.
VERMA SLAMS ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL,’ PUBLIC OPTION HEALTH PLANS: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma slammed both proposals as means to use “the force of government to strong-arm doctors and hospitals into accepting below-market payment rates” in a speech Monday at the Better Medicare Alliance Medicare Advantage Summit. She said that history has shown through the flaws of Obamacare that the proposals would disrupt a “well-functioning market,” in which insurers “can on price and quality.” Introducing further government-funded options, in which competition is discouraged, is not the answer, she said.
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS FAVOR PUBLIC OPTION OVER SINGULAR GOVERNMENT PLAN: POLL: Most Democratic voters would like to have the option to buy into a government plan rather than be forced off private health insurance into one, suggests a CBS News battleground tracker of Democratic primary voters published by YouGov. Of those polled, 63% said a national health insurance plan would work better if it “competed with private health insurance, as a choice for those who wanted it.”
BIDEN WON’T PROMISE HIS HEALTHCARE PLAN WILL LET PEOPLE KEEP THEIR DOCTORS: 2020 presidential contender Joe Biden was hard-pressed to promise Americans what former President Obama promised in 2009 about Obamacare: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, a statement later deemed lie of the year by Politifact in 2013. On a Las Vegas campaign stop Saturday, Biden said he couldn’t promise that private insurers wouldn’t drop certain doctors if they have to compete with government-funded healthcare. The remarks stand in contrast to Biden’s comments last week that people could keep their private health insurance, comments he later amended by adding the caveat, “if your employer is still prepared to pay for the insurance.”
JUDGE RULES IN FAVOR OF CHEAPER SHORT-TERM INSURANCE PLANS: Federal Judge Richard Leon ruled Friday that the Trump administration can sell short-term insurance plans that can be renewed up to two times for a total of 36 months. The plans, which opponents call “junk insurance,” aren’t required to include benefits for mental health or maternity care, or to cover pre-existing conditions. Leon ruled that the “benefits are undeniable,” for those who are priced out of the market. March of Dimes said Monday that the organization is “disappointed in the court’s decision to allow… limited-duration health insurance plans. We're concerned these plans destabilize insurance markets, forcing people to pay more in premiums or be unable to obtain insurance entirely.” Similarly, Margaret Murray, CEO of the Association for Community Affiliated Plans said Friday, "We remain firm in our contention that the Trump administration's decision to expand dramatically the sale of junk insurance violates the Affordable Care Act and is arbitrary and capricious.”
FORMER PLANNED PARENTHOOD CEO SAYS SHE WAS OUSTED FOR TRYING TO ‘DEPOLITICIZE’ ORGANIZATION: Dr. Leana Wen, who, as of last week, was the president of Planned Parenthood, said she was removed from the organization for trying to put more focus on women’s health rather than politics. In a New York Times op-ed published Friday, Wen said she wanted to promote Planned Parenthood’s healthcare services to counter the criticism that the organization is primarily geared toward providing abortions and lobbying for abortion rights.
THE MEASLES COUNT RISES AGAIN: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday that as of July 18 confirmed measles cases in 30 states had risen to 1,148, an increase of 25 cases since the previous week.

Texto completo: It's time for Congress to step up and restore a balance of power in the use of U.S. military force that it has largely ceded since World War II. While recent House amendments to the $733 billion defense authorization bill went too far, the call for limits on a president's ability to start another war in the Middle East is welcome.

After deciding against a military strike on Iran following the downing of a U.S. drone, President Donald Trump asserted his right to authorize such action without Congress' OK. The president's claim of authority to attack Iran, and potentially start a major war, appears to be tied to the post-9/11 congressional authorization that preceded the Iraq War of 2003 and our military's nearly 18-year engagement in Afghanistan.

A State Department official said in a June letter that the administration had not yet interpreted that 2001 measure as authorizing war with Iran. But the same letter appeared to do just that, by adding "except as may be necessary to defend U.S. or partner forces engaged in counterterrorism operations."

As the letter's recipient, U.S. Rep. Eliot L. Engel, a New York Democrat and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told The New York Times, that it's "a loophole wide enough to drive a tanker through."

In June the Senate unfortunately rejected a chance to narrow the gap between presidential and congressional war powers. A bipartisan measure that would have required Congress' OK before striking Iran failed on a 50-40 tally that required 60 votes to pass.

"We must tell the president and affirm to the American people that we will assume our constitutional responsibility," said Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. In response, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell managed to completely ignore the issue of defending Congress' war powers.

"The president made it absolutely clear that he is not interested in starting a war with Iran," McConnell, R-Ky., said following the vote. "Everybody ought to take a deep breath."

In this case, taking a deep breath appears to mean ignoring Congress' role in major military actions — the power to declare war is its alone — and continuing the troubling trend of dodging that responsibility by ceding it to the president.

Debating the wisdom of military action does not have to mean not trusting the president of the United States. It can and should mean getting the nation behind him and our troops before such action is undertaken.

The president is commander in chief of U.S. armed forces. His hands should not be tied if military force is needed to protect our nation, but that's not what's happening in the Persian Gulf.

No vital U.S. interest was at stake in the dispute over whether the U.S. drone Iran shot down last month was over international or Iranian territorial waters.

While some House amendments passed recently go too far — tying military funds to other policy disputes that should be fought in court instead — Congress is well within its rights to insist on its central role in the use of force.

And Trump of all presidents should be sympathetic. He's the one, after all, who said in his most recent State of the Union address that "As a candidate for president, I loudly pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars."

King, ABC-TV, boxing and a prison

Texto completo: For an afternoon in 1977, Marion was at the epicenter of the sporting world.
That's what happens when Don King and Howard Cosell, boxing and national television, future world champions and an all-time great are mixed together inside the walls of a prison.
It's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it started in the late 1960s when Marion received a new resident. King, better known then as inmate 125734 according to a story written by Pulitzer Prize winning sports writer Red Smith in The New York Times, was sent to prison for manslaughter, but paroled in 1971.
As he left the gates of Marion Correctional Institution, he vowed to come back.
Some might have taken it one way, but he meant something else. Once on the outside, King made up for lost time. In less than six years, he became boxing's biggest and most famous promoter.
And he fulfilled that promise. He returned to MCI, only this time he brought a few friends with him.
The crowning of U.S. champs In 1976, America was giddy with patriotism while celebrating the Bicentennial, and the country couldn't get enough of boxing. At that year's Olympics in Montreal, five Americans brought home gold medals, while "Rocky" was winning over fans at the box office.
King, who was quickly becoming a major player in the sport, saw the confluence and the connection. He quickly conceived of the idea of a tournament called the United States Boxing Championships that would crown undisputed American champs in all weight classes.
He partnered with Ring Magazine to make it so.
"I needed their reputation and their ratings and their sanction to give validity and authority to the tournament," King told Sports Illustrated.
He then sold the concept to ABC Sports President Roone Arledge, the man better known for constructing the NFL's Monday Night Football franchise. It was to be a centerpiece of programming for ABC's Wide World of Sports show that owned the 1970s sporting consciousness.
One quarterfinal of the tournament was held on the deck of an aircraft carrier off the coast of Florida. Another was held at the Naval Academy. The third installment was the strangest venue yet.
The show was coming to Marion — not to be held in its coliseum, but its prison.
King was indeed coming home.
A captive audience The seven-fight card was set for Sunday, March 6, 1977. An unprecedented 90-minute block would be set up to broadcast at least two matches live from 3 to 4:30 p.m.
It was the first nationally televised live program from a prison, so the logistics were many. MCI is not Madison Square Garden. According to a recap in The Marion Star, to get a TV signal out of the prison, it had to be beamed to a dish atop Central Soya's grain silos in town and then on to WTVN-TV in Columbus where it went international from there.
Cosell was the voice of boxing in the '70s and called the matches.
Beloved former heavyweight champion Joe Louis was ringside, while former Olympic heavyweight boxer Pete Radamacher was a referee and judge.
Other dignitaries were Smith, who was writing his "Sports of the Times" column about the event, as well as the New York Post's Vic Zeigel, AP boxing writer Ed Schulyer and Time Magazine female writer P.J. Phillips among others.
By this time Arledge didn't go on the road much, but the head of ABC Sports was in Marion to make sure it went off without hassle.
The show was not open to the public. Save for the media members and a few local VIPs, the room was packed with MCI's 1,400 inmates. And they were ready to be entertained.
Before the matches, King climbed into the ring wearing a gold jacket over a frilled white shirt and took the microphone.
"I look around and see many familiar faces," Smith reported of King's brief speech. "I am one of you."
The crowd ate it up.
"It is with mixed emotions that I am coming back to what was trauma in my life," he continued. "I am happy and proud to be able to bring back some entertainment for you because you have been part of my life."
The inmates went wild with cheers and applause.
"Wherever I have gone outside, I have never tried to hide Marion C.I. I never forget No. 125734," King said with the crowd going bonkers.
Following King's introduction, in came Louis for a wave, which the inmates heartily appreciated. Then Cosell was introduced as a couple ringsiders held up signs that said, "Finally, Howard is where he belongs," and "Howard got in — will he get out?"
MCI Superintendent Pete Perini was "warmly booed," according to Smith, while prison chaplain Father Fred Furey was cheered. Walter Hampton, head of the parole board, brought a great many jeers upon his introduction, which caused King to tell the crowd, "That's the dude that sprung me."
Boxing at the prison King was sure his captive audience would be entertained.
Art "Tap" Harris, a former world-ranked welterweight from Akron, was in one of the featured bouts. Harris, like King before him, was also an inmate at MCI, serving time for shooting a man in a bar.
Fighting for the third time inside the prison's gates, Harris won by TKO in the fourth round over Johnny Heard of Chicago after Ray Phillips backed out days before the middleweight fight.
"This is my home now," Harris told The Marion Star's Bob Thatcher after winning his 29th straight match. "I wish I had looked better. I've told them I'm the best middleweight. I need some high-caliber fighters to show it. I've got a debt to pay to society, and I feel four-and-a-half years is enough. I hope society feels I should have a chance."
Harris would get out soon enough and resume his career with five more wins before losing his final two pro bouts, first to "Sugar" Ray Seales in 1980 and then to Manning Galloway in 1981.
Back inside the gates of the prison, heavyweights Stan Ward and Kevin Issac did not entertain. After two rounds of circling one another, someone in the crowd yelled, 'Come on! I've only got 20 years!"
Ward won by decision, but another match was lively. Rocky Mosley was knocked down in the first round but rallied to beat Johnny Baldwin when he couldn't answer the bell in the fifth.
Future heavyweight champion Michael Dokes of Akron, competing in just the fourth fight of his career, handled oval-shaped Charlie Jordan, showing flair in doing so.
Featherweight Ruben Castillo earned his 22nd straight win in an eight-round decision over Kenny Weldon, and lightweight Ruby "The Snake" Ortiz of Brooklyn took a unanimous decision over Vinnie DeBerros of Connecticut.
The main event included 18-year-old welterweight phenom and top-ranked Wilfredo Benitez and No. 10 Mel Dennis of Houston.
Benitez was 29-0-1 and recognized as the world junior welterweight champion at the time of his bout in Marion, becoming the youngest world champ in history at the age of 17. He won the eight-round fight at MCI via a decision in what BoxRec.com considered a four out of five star match. Benitez would leave Marion and go on to win two more world titles in two other weight classes in his hall of fame career.
The show was a success across the board.
Plug pulled on tourney But as entertaining as it was in Marion, the U.S. Boxing Championships were on the ropes.
A month later, ABC cancelled televising the series when investigative reports found at least 11 fighters in the tournament had false win-loss records with King associates allegedly buying rankings from Ring Magazine to bolster the boxers' statures.
There were further charges of promised kickbacks from fighters to bookers to get into the tournament, plus lots of other shenanigans.
By May, Sports Illustrated ran a piece spelling out all the trouble associated with the boxing championships, including FBI and IRS probes and a federal grand jury in Baltimore looking into it.
As said, it's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it fittingly came to an end in a prison in Marion, Ohio, in March of 1977.

The speech Nixon would have given

Texto completo: America's landing on the moon now stands as such a stunning success that, 50 years later, we have trouble imagining that it could have gone terribly, tragically wrong.
But in the days before the landing, on July 20, 1969, there were acute fears of a mishap. Officials in the White House and at NASA laid out lugubrious contingency plans in case astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon but then were unable to get off the surface and back to the space capsule. Had that happened, they would have been doomed to die there, either by slow asphyxiation or perhaps by suicide.
The White House chief of staff instructed William Safire, then a White House speechwriter (and later a New York Times columnist), to draft a remarkable speech for President Richard Nixon to deliver to the nation if the astronauts were stranded. Along with the speech, Safire included instructions for other actions that should be taken. In particular, he wrote, Nixon should telephone the wives of the astronauts, whom he chillingly referred to as the "widows-to-be." At a certain point, NASA would "end communications" with the astronauts, Safire wrote, and a clergyman should then conduct the equivalent of a burial at sea, ending with the Lord's Prayer.
Safire's undelivered speech lay hidden for nearly three decades before I found it. In the late 1990s, researching a book on America's opening to China, I was rummaging through the archives of the Nixon administration (then in the Washington suburb of College Park, Maryland) when my eyes suddenly fell on something I wasn't looking for. It was a memo from Safire to White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman titled, "In event of moon disaster."
The short text still brings tears to the eyes. It begins, "Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace." It ends with the words, "For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind."
What Safire wrote would have qualified as the most eloquent speech Nixon ever gave - and one of the most poignant by any American president. Thankfully, it never had to be delivered.

Texto completo: Alvin Zhou laid all the ingredients for a triple-decker cheesecake tower on a kitchen counter. Then he reached into his backpack for a secret one -- concealer to hide a small scar just above his left knuckle.
"This stuff is like magic," says Mr. Zhou, who makes cooking videos. "We get comments all the time about our hands."
It used to be that chefs considered burns and scars a badge of honor. Now, bird's-eye views of cooks slicing and dicing and performing kitchen magic have become big business on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. They want their hands looking dazzling.
Stubby, gnarled, hairy or pudgy fingers are all considered unappetizing. Long nails and bright polish usually are no-nos, too, because they could clash with the food, says Sharon Rechter, president of First Media, a company that produces cooking videos through its So Yummy brand.
With the average food publisher notching five times as many video views on Facebook last year than the average U.S. publisher, according to media monitoring company Shareablee, presentable paws command a premium.
Many video chefs had little or no cooking experience before landing their jobs. Producers try to match those with precise, graceful hand movements to intricate work such as decorating cakes. Those with heftier hands are tasked with making comfort food such as macaroni and cheese, says Ms. Rechter.
"The hands are the primary means to establish trust with our viewers," says Tess Panzer, creative director at So Yummy. "If the hands aren't confident and relaxed, the viewers aren't confident and relaxed. When I get newbies, the minute the camera goes down, the hands become tense and malfunctioning, and they have no idea what they're doing. That's the biggest point of training. Get the hands to be completely and utterly relaxed."
Mr. Zhou, whose hands appear in some of the internet's most-watched cooking clips, has been making videos for Buzzfeed's Tasty brand since 2015. His hits include "Sliders 4 Ways" (211 million views on Facebook) and "Mirror Glaze Cake" (more than 150 million views).
Tasty alone notched 1.2 billion Facebook views for its videos in May, nearly double what it did in June of last year. Many were shot with a camera pointing down from the ceiling to the kitchen counter. They rarely show the cook's face -- only a tight frame around a dish being prepared by a graceful, beautifully cared for pair of hands.
Mr. Zhou, who trained as a classical pianist before landing his video-chef gig, has muscular hands. Besides the damage to his knuckle, he covers up a scar on his right hand where a piano teacher, he says, once stabbed him with a pencil after he flubbed a note.
When Mr. Zhou seasons a dish, "he likes to do a swirl, like he's casting a spell," says Vaughn Vreeland, a former colleague at Tasty who now works at a New York Times cooking site. "He swishes and flicks." The idea, Mr. Vreeland says, is to make viewers feel "they are the ones doing the cooking."
Mr. Vreeland says he got a $20 manicure before his own job interview with Tasty.
At Hearst Magazines' Delish brand, Lauren Miyashiro is known for making large foods, such as 8-pound bagels, giant Pop-Tarts and doughnuts as large as a dozen. She has two burn scars from working at Delish: one on her right hand and the other on the left arm. She doesn't bother to cover them up.
Her former Delish colleague Lindsay Funston was known as the master of the "cheese pull," the photogenic effect that comes when melted cheese is pulled apart in long strands, often leading to more views. Some of the people she used to work with said her hands look like claws in some of the videos.
Viewers can be unforgiving. When Tara Maini made mac-and-cheese burgers for the U.K.-based cooking brand Twisted, viewers called her fingernails "grubby" and "gross." "Let's hope she didn't lose a nail in there somewhere," one wrote.
Ms. Maini now gets fortnightly manicures and expenses them to her company. When she joined a netball team last year, a referee asked her to cut her nails so she wouldn't scratch anybody. She wouldn't. "I'm now the oddball wearing gloves to play," she says.
Video editing can correct some mistakes by online chefs, and camera angles can make hands appear smaller and daintier than they really are. Even so, Mr. Zhou says it is important to make sure his movements are as fluid as possible, like a choreographed routine. "Cooking on camera is different," he says, "but trying to keep it natural is still key."
Ms. Panzer, the So Yummy creative director, says there is another element to the best cooking videos. "What I try to establish with my hands, in particular, instead of just doing it, I'm doing it just so. There's this grace and elegance to it. It's very relaxing. People tell me they lie in bed at night and just watch videos till they fall asleep."
Hand models looking to break into the cooking-video business realize that they can't get by on beauty alone.
Johnny Tyronne got work modeling watches and colognes before investing $100 in a course on knife skills. He says he wanted to learn how to quickly and safely chop fruit and vegetables. He recommends that other hand models get their own sets of knives and keep them sharp.
"Food is the biggest market," says Mr. Tyronne, who lives in New York. "Just by learning how to use knives, I booked quite a bit of work."

THE NATION; ELECTION 2020; Presidential field now exceeds ... 700? Vermin Supreme is running. So is Seven the Dog. Don't forget Chocolate Pancakes.

Texto completo: There is just about every shade of politics you can imagine represented by the people who run for president.
There is Vermin Supreme, the perennial candidate who wears a boot for a hat and wants to give everyone free ponies. Or 89-year-old Mike Gravel, a former senator from Alaska who allows two teens to run his antiwar candidacy. And there's Seven the Dog, whose principal campaign committee is the "Puppy Party -- Friends of Seven the Dog."
Yes, they all are running.

Including two dozen prominent candidates running for the Democratic nomination, more than 700 people have filed with the Federal Election Commission to run. (Some, we hope, are in jest, like Chocolate Pancakes of Manchester, Conn.)
Qualifying is easy -- an individual must be at least 35 years old, a natural-born citizen and a U.S. resident for at least 14 years. Filing is a cakewalk -- presidential hopefuls need to fill out a statement of candidacy with the FEC, which is free to do.
And so hundreds have filed: 279 as Democrats, 107 as Republicans, 34 as Libertarians, 156 as independents and others under names such as the Independent Conservative Democratic Party, American People's Freedom Party or the George Wallace Party.
The majority are running long-shot campaigns most voters will never hear about. Some acknowledge they have little hope of gaining traction. Other candidates think, just maybe, there's a shot that their message might catch on.
But it's not likely. Those seeking the Democratic or Republican or third-party nominations must earn the support of delegates during state caucuses and primaries to have a shot at the national nominating convention. Candidates striking out on their own as independents must petition each state and Washington, D.C., to get on the ballot.
Many candidates say they are running solely to draw attention to issues such as the marginalization of Native Americans, taxation or promoting a progressive agenda. Others think the two-party system is damaging and want third parties to be a part of the election conversation.
Here are a few who have filed to run:
* Dan Behrman wears a huge yellow hat decorated with bumper stickers reading "Taxation is theft." The hat started as a gimmick, then became part of his campaign strategy, says Behrman, 38. Now, he wears it regularly when he hosts events, even to the airport.
"Don't let the hat fool you," he tweeted in June, "this is a serious campaign."
The software engineer is running for the nomination of the Libertarian Party, which will pick its candidate in May at its national convention in Austin, Texas.
In 2014, Behrman ran as a libertarian for the Texas House of Representatives against Democratic incumbent Justin Rodriguez; he got 23% of the vote.
Behrman said he decided to run for president because the country is divided and he believes his experience as a software engineer gives him a practical perspective on finding solutions "without shutting one side down."
He supports "firing" the IRS, ending the war on drugs and eventually abolishing taxes, according to his website. The "digital nomad," the site says, is "currently running his presidential campaign from Cancun, Mexico."
* Mark Charles, a citizen of the Navajo Nation, is running as an independent. It has been more than 30 years since a prominent Native American has vied for the presidency.
Charles, 48, a public speaker based in Washington, announced his candidacy May 28. His campaign, he said, focuses on the marginalization of Native Americans by the federal government and on race, gender and class inequality in the U.S.
"Because we don't know how to acknowledge our history, and the racism and the sexism and the white supremacy that's embedded into our foundations, we don't know how to solve the problems we're facing today," Charles said.
He proposes an agency similar to the truth and reconciliation commissions in Canada and South Africa, established to give citizens a chance to air grievances and hold officials responsible for change. He also wants to talk about the way indigenous people in the U.S. have been marginalized by the Doctrine of Discovery, a 15th century Catholic document that allowed Spaniards to claim indigenous land in the Americas.
Charles frames his campaign as an "18-month-long dialogue" to educate voters on American history through a Native American lens.
* To run for president, Crystal Bergfield quit her part-time job in the parks and recreation department of Westminster, Colo.
"For me, deciding to run was recognizing I have the skills, I have the courage, compassion and an innovative way of thinking," said Bergfield, 36, who served in the Army as a unit supply specialist from 2004 to 2006.
She was medically discharged from the Army following a sexual assault incident, she said. Bergfield used the healing process to become a better leader. In January, she filed to run as an independent; she believes divisions in the country are exacerbated by the two-party system. She said she is running a "values-based" campaign and would hold appointed officials and federal employees to high standards and target government corruption.
She has six paid campaign staffers, and friends have volunteered to help where they can, she said.
Bergfield recognizes that she faces "an uphill battle" as an independent candidate.
"For me, my eye is on being president."
* Mike Gravel didn't really want to run.
The former two-term Alaska senator, known for his antiwar and anti-imperialism platform, ran an unsuccessful bid for the 2008 Democratic nomination. He is perhaps better known for reading the Pentagon Papers aloud in 1971 into the public domain and breaking into tears.
He's now retired, and he lives in Seaside, in Monterey County, with his wife and their 14-year-old dog.
But earlier this year, two teens from New York sent him a request: They wanted to support his 2020 run for the presidency.
In June, the teens, Gravel and his Twitter account were profiled in the New York Times Magazine, in part for their effort in using political humor to elevate their cause.
"In an online world where everything is understood to be a performance, @MikeGravel looks us squarely in the eye and admits, 'Every politician is just a bunch of kids in a trench coat -- so why not make them actual kids?' " Jamie Lauren Keiles wrote.
"They've been running the show," Gravel said of the teens. "I've not lifted a finger."

When getting the story means years of threats, even bullets

Resumen: Singer R. Kelly and financier Jeffrey Epstein faced new charges of sexual crimes after journalists’ investigations. Both were denied bail this week.

Texto completo: As a music critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis received his first tip about R. Kelly via fax. It alluded to the R&B star’s problem with “young girls.” The critic broke the story of Mr. Kelly’s alleged sex with minors in December 2000.
The following month, Mr. DeRogatis received an anonymous sex tape. Within 12 hours, a bullet burst through his front porch window.
“I cannot say it was R. Kelly, but I think it was a message,” he says.
Mr. DeRogatis has covered Mr. Kelly for two decades, interviewing dozens of women who claim they survived the musician’s abuse. Mr. Kelly, who faces 18 charges from two federal indictments, was denied bond this week. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Mr. DeRogatis’ peers used to deride his coverage of the famed Chicagoan. Today, many herald Mr. DeRogatis’ work as helping advance justice.
It’s hard to separate empty threats from real danger, he says, though he recognizes that survivors of sexual crimes have it much worse. Mr. DeRogatis says he took heat from members of Mr. Kelly’s camp, including a phone call with the message, “We know you have a daughter.” Online attacks spiked around the release last month of his book, “Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly.” To his alarm, people have circulated images and video of his family on social media. “I never slowed down for a minute,” he says. “If anything, it redoubled my efforts.”
Reporters who pursue sexual misconduct allegations against high-profile individuals say they face a flurry of pressure – from fans, newsrooms, and targets of stories. But the increasing impact of investigative journalism in exposing sexual violence cases may point to something promising: The pushback isn’t working.
“The bigger the targets, the more pushback you get,” says Mark Feldstein, a former investigative journalist and journalism historian. “But what actually strikes me about #MeToo is kind of the opposite – yeah they’re fighting back, but they’re not succeeding.”
Not so two decades ago. Journalists had dug into Harvey Weinstein’s rumored abusive behavior years before his arrest in May 2018. Mr. DeRogatis says three newsrooms turned down his story on Mr. Kelly’s alleged sex cult before BuzzFeed published it in July 2017. Former Vanity Fair reporter Vicky Ward tried to reveal allegations against financier Jeffrey Epstein in the early 2000s. 
While reporting a profile, Ms. Ward says she landed on-the-record interviews with two sisters who accused Mr. Epstein of sexual abuse. One alleged she’d been underage.
Leading up to publication, Ms. Ward, who was pregnant with twins at the time, says he called multiple times to threaten her and her unborn children, warning something would happen if the story displeased him. A lawyer for Mr. Epstein did not return requests for comment.
“I actually had to ask the hospital to make sure that they had 24/7 security for two months,” Ms. Ward said on a Slate podcast. “It was a horrendous time.”
As for the threats, “they made me more determined to nail” the story, Ms. Ward wrote in an email to the Monitor.
However, the women’s allegations were excised from the 2003 Vanity Fair profile. Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair’s then-editor, defended the cut, saying he “didn’t have confidence in Ward’s reporting,” Politico reported.
The registered sex offender’s arrest and new charges in July came 11 years after a controversial nonprosecution agreement. Alexander Acosta, who helped broker the deal as a U.S. attorney, resigned as U.S. labor secretary last week. Many credit extensive reporting by Miami Herald journalist Julie K. Brown for renewing scrutiny of Mr. Epstein.
“We were assisted by some excellent investigative journalism,” said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman for New York’s Southern District. On Thursday, a federal judge denied Mr. Epstein’s request for bail, calling him a danger to the community and a flight risk. Mr. Epstein has pleaded not guilty to the new charges.
Intimidation of the press in the U.S. dates back to the first Colonial newspaper in 1690. British authorities shut down Boston’s Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick after one issue. President Donald Trump’s calling reporters “enemy of the people” is the latest in a long history of government pressure. In 2018, the killing of five Capital Gazette employees in Maryland brought home to U.S. journalists a horror more often faced by peers abroad. Twenty journalists have been attacked in the U.S. this year, reports U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.
“When we see an increase in harassment and threats to journalists, it can have a real chilling effect on journalism,” says Sarah Matthews, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “It’s depriving the public of important stories.”
In 2017, Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore threatened to sue the news site AL.com, after the local outlet published allegations of his “predatory behavior” toward teenage girls in Etowah County dating back to the 1970s. Mr. Moore’s counsel argued the coverage defamed the former state judge, who denied the claims.
Alabama Media Group rejected the cease-and-desist letter and stood by its reporting. Kelly Ann Scott, AMG’s vice president of content who joined in 2018, says the threat of litigation didn’t pack a punch.
“It made folks even more motivated to pursue the truth,” says Ms. Scott.
“There’s an openness now” Mr. Weinstein awaits trial for rape and other offenses following his arrest last year. He has denied wrongdoing.
He’d spun a web of enablers with his towering influence who tried to snuff out allegations against him and derail negative press, according to reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker.
Mr. Weinstein allegedly hired private security agencies – including Israeli ex-intelligence officers – to track accusers and journalists, Ronan Farrow reported for The New Yorker in 2017. At the time, a spokesperson for Mr. Weinstein said it was “a fiction” to suggest that individuals were targeted.
A professor of journalism at the University of Maryland, Mr. Feldstein knows well the risks of investigative journalism – he was once beaten up for exposing migrant slavery in Florida in the 1980s. He says there could be more pushback on issues of sexual harassment because of the volume of current coverage.
“The men who predominantly run newsrooms in the United States now have come face to face with what women have found for a long time,” he says. “There’s an openness now to doing those stories, and a willingness now by the sources, the victims, to talk about it in ways that they weren’t willing to before.”
As Ms. Brown began digging into Mr. Epstein’s alleged sex ring in 2017, she’s said, a former Palm Beach, Florida, police chief warned her that previous reporters had failed, and the Miami Herald could face pressure to kill the story. Ms. Brown persisted, poring over thousands of records and tracking more than 60 alleged survivors of sexual abuse. Eight agreed to interviews.
Miami Herald managing editor Rick Hirsch says the #MeToo era contributed to people opening up about what they hadn’t been willing to share before.
The Herald didn’t face threats for its series – “nor would it have mattered,” says Mr. Hirsch.
“I had it coming at me on all sides” In her book “Chasing Cosby,” former Philadelphia Daily News reporter Nicole Weisensee Egan says she faced incessant intimidating calls from Martin Singer, a former lawyer for Bill Cosby, as she investigated sexual abuse claims in 2005. Some media slammed her reporting on “America’s dad.”
“I had it coming at me on all sides, but my newspaper had my back the entire time,” says Ms. Egan.
She continued to follow the story at People and The Daily Beast. She finally saw the media take the allegations against Mr. Cosby seriously when a joke by comedian Hannibal Buress went viral in 2014. Dozens more women came forward to accuse Mr. Cosby of abuse.
“Cosby could control the media, but he couldn’t control social media,” says Ms. Egan.
Some observers called Mr. Cosby’s 2018 conviction a #MeToo milestone. The entertainer is serving three to 10 years for sexual assault, and continues to deny wrongdoing. An assistant for Mr. Singer did not respond to requests for comment.
Ms. Egan may have been spared online harassment because she uncovered allegations against Mr. Cosby pre-Twitter. Mr. DeRogatis, on the other hand, says he found a “hacker for good” to help him with cybersecurity. Two decades on the story, he perseveres.
“Sometimes you choose a story, and sometimes it chooses you,” says Mr. DeRogatis. “I think you don’t let go of it if you are a journalist. Not when people are being hurt.”

Texto completo: Since returning from France and the U.S. women's national team's latest FIFA World Cup triumph, it's been a self-described whirlwind tour of celebrations and media commitments for Rose Lavelle. "It's been busy," said Lavelle, the former Mount Notre Dame and Cincinnati United Premier standout, with a wry smile. Lavelle was in Cincinnati's northern suburbs Thursday for a media tour prior to more appearances later in the day, including one at the FC Cincinnati versus D.C. United match at the University of Cincinnati.
On Friday, Lavelle will be publicly celebrated by the City of Cincinnati and FC Cincinnati in an event on Fountain Square in Downtown.
After she gets through this week, though, Lavelle said she expected the hoopla to die down.
Some of it won't die down, of course. That's the nature of being a member of the all-conquering 2019 "USWNT," a diverse and tight-knit collection of players that, collectively, aren't afraid to ruffle feathers and stand tall in the face of perceived controversy.
Lavelle's national team is attached to a host of polarizing issues and conversations, from one of her teammates feuding with President Donald Trump on social media to discussions of gender and pay inequality, among other things.
"I think it's been cool to see how this team has used its platform to help kind of push the boundaries and push the status quo, and I think it's great," Lavelle said. "I think it's great to be able to use our platform to be able to do that and while we've made strides and things have gotten better, it's not where it needs to be. Better doesn't mean it's equal, so I think we still have some steps we need to take, everyone, needs to take for us to get to where we need to be."
With Megan Rapinoe taking the lead on issues like opposing the customary trip to the White House for sporting achievements, President Trump himself and the pay gap between the U.S. men's and women's national teams, Lavelle's been able to avoid taking controversial positions that could alienate her from some sects of her fans.
Lavelle expressed admiration for Rapinoe but seemed to suggest during her Thursday interview with The Enquirer that stepping into the public arena to discuss issues outside soccer might not be her desired path.
Asked if she'd prefer to keep the focus on her soccer, Lavelle, 24, expressed an interest in growing into someone like Rapinoe.
"I'm kind of more of like a low-key, chill person," Lavelle said, "but I also, I know that I do kind of have a special position and not everyone has this platform to be an advocate. (Rapinoe) is such an incredible example of that. She's so unapologetically herself and so unwavering. No matter how many times people try to knock her down, she still stands tall and is so fearless in every pursuit and I really looked up to that.
"I think I learned so much from her off the field because of that and, I don't know, hopefully, I can maybe grow into someone like that."
It appears it will be difficult for Lavelle to escape all the subjects on which the women's national team is contributing to or leading the conversation on.
In Lavelle's own hometown, Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble called out U.S. Soccer on equal pay for women players in a full-page ad in The New York Times, according to the publication.
The consumer goods giant, which already sponsors U.S. Soccer, donated $529,000 to the women's team's players association.
"I think it's so cool," Lavelle said of P&G's donation. "It makes me really proud to be from the city. I think it's awesome and definitely a step in the right direction but I still think there's still a long way to go, I think, but I love that they're contributing to it and helping keep this conversation going."
VICTORY TOUR: We know Cincinnati's out of the running to host one of the Victory Tour matches for the U.S. women's national soccer team, but Ohio cities are still in the mix.
The U.S. Soccer Federation hasn't announced the opponents or venues for four out of five stops on the tour, which will commemorate the American women's recent FIFA World Cup triumph.
The tour begins Aug. 3 against Ireland at the Rose Bowl and continues on to Aug. 29, Sept. 3, Oct. 3, and Oct. 6.
Sources indicated to The Enquirer that is was 50-50 as to whether a match would be staged in Ohio, which is no stranger to high-profile U.S. Soccer matches.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday that Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, home to the NFL's Eagles, was leading the race to host the match scheduled for Aug. 29.

"I think it's been cool to see how this team has used its platform to help kind of push the boundaries and push the status quo, and I think it's great," Lavelle says.

Texto completo: House Democrats are setting records with their abuses of power, which means they aren't stopping at just the Trump administration. Witness their new targeting of free-market nonprofits and businesses, straight out of the intimidation playbook.
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. a month ago sent a letter to five separate entities. The recipients included two nonprofits, Americans for Prosperity and the American Legislative Exchange Council; a trade association, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers; an oil company, Marathon Petroleum; and a coalition, Energy4US, that includes dozens of union locals and business groups. The letters -- sent without notifying GOP committee members -- didn't mince words.
Mr. Pallone explained he was investigating the administration's move to reform Barack Obama's auto-efficiency standards. A change to these rules was a given on day one of the Trump presidency. Yet Mr. Pallone insists they were the result of a "covert lobbying and social media campaign." His evidence was a December 2018 New York Times investigation, which sought to describe a straightforward policy push as a sinister, secret plot orchestrated by (who else?) the libertarian billionaire Koch brothers.
Mr. Pallone then got down to his unconstitutional demands. He insisted that these private entities turn over "all documents exchanged and communications" about the rule with any employee, current or former, of key federal departments and the office of the president. The groups were also ordered to hand over documents and communications they'd exchanged with each other. Mr. Pallone further demanded groups like AFP detail all of their efforts, "whether directly or indirectly," in "lobbying" or "social media efforts" related to the reform. He gave them two weeks to sign up for his colonoscopy.
Democrats first experimented with these brutish tactics in 2013, when they ran the Senate. Illinois's Dick Durbin blasted out a letter to 300 organizations, demanding to know if they were affiliated with or contributed to ALEC, whose free-market work he loathes. The stunt earned Mr. Durbin a rebuke from editorial boards across the country; his hometown Chicago Tribune scored him for using the "power of his high federal office as a cudgel against his enemies." Yet it didn't stop other Democrats, from Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse to Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, from building on these threats against conservative groups and efforts to sic government offices on them. See the IRS.
The good news is that at least nonprofits now understand the left's strategy -- to scare them (and those who affiliate with them) out of free-market or conservative advocacy. And they aren't rolling over for it. That's evidenced by two impressive letters that landed back recently on Mr. Pallone's desk, which I've seen, one from AFP (which does receive Koch funding) and one from ALEC.
Mark Holden, a member of AFP's board, pointed out to Mr. Pallone that the sum total of the Times's crack evidence of AFP's involvement in a plot was that one of AFP's 3.2 million members "spoke in favor" of the reform at a public meeting in Michigan. Mr. Holden, in a spirit of helpfulness, revealed that AFP had also submitted a comment in favor of the rulemaking -- one of 600,000. The rest of the letter served as a tutorial for Mr. Pallone on the First Amendment and its longstanding protection of free association and speech. AFP is not turning over documents.
Nor is ALEC. Its own letter, penned by Washington attorney Cleta Mitchell, pointed Mr. Pallone to a very public record showing ALEC's support for a model policy to reform fuel-efficiency standards. She kindly included links to several readily available tweets highlighting ALEC's noncovert position. She drolly noted that her own investigation turned up nothing in committee rules that authorized Mr. Pallone to snoop into "the activities, programs, or internal operations of a non-governmental, private sector organization's policy development activities."
The question is whether companies and trade groups will show the same fortitude against this and future harassment. The business sector has generally rolled over to such intimidation, hoping to avoid bad headlines or public opprobrium. But caving in doesn't stop the bullying; it only encourages more. At least so far, the other three targets don't appear to have acceded to the Pallone demands.
House Democrats are losing the debate about auto efficiency as the public passes on electric cars, so they've moved to shutting down the other side. This is the modus operandi of the progressive left. Mr. Trump wants to make the 2020 election about socialism, but it's just as important to focus on the thuggish tactics and authoritarianism that accompany Democrats' march toward that philosophy. Progressives now feel entitled to abuse individual rights without constraint. Imagine that attitude in the White House.

Conversation Killers on Campus; A former Yale dean sees a big problem at elite schools.

Texto completo: Yesterday readers were treated to the disorienting experience of a liberal New York Times columnist expressing shock at the radicalism of Donald Trump's potential 2020 campaign opponents.
Now a donor to Democratic politicians and former Yale Law School Dean, Anthony Kronman, is warning about the culture of the modern campus. Mr. Kronman talks to the Chronicle of Higher Education about his forthcoming book, "The Assault on American Excellence":
What is it that distresses me? The eclipse of what I call "the conversational ideal." The idea of the university as a space apart, given over to the rare and difficult task of pursuing the truth.
That's been compromised in a variety of ways. I'll just mention a couple: Any time anyone, faculty or student, says, "Well, you just don't understand it because you're not me, you don't share my experience, you don't see things as I do, you haven't suffered as I have" — whenever a claim of that kind is offered as a trump, in conversation, as something that would be unseemly or inappropriate or unjust to challenge, the conversation comes to an end. That's a conversation-killing move.
Another example: When students complain that a speaker invited to campus, or the curriculum in a course, is an insult to them because it disrespects them, fails to recognize the intensity of their feelings, of their suffering, and they want the speaker denied or the curriculum restructured — in that way too, feelings, whether justified or not, are given a conversation-killing trump status. That is antithetical to the conversational ideal...
"Elite" today means hard to get into. And our elite schools trumpet that, they play to it, they market it, and they pride themselves on being elite in this respect. But that is a perversion of what I mean by elite. It is focused entirely on what happens at the turnstile, at the point of entry. It completely disregards the other side of the turnstile. In fact, very little attention, certainly in the humanities, is now paid to the quality of the education these precious few are receiving once they've been admitted. What does it matter how difficult it is to get into a club if the club isn't doing anything worthwhile?
***
Speaking of a lack of conversation at Yale, the university doesn't appear to have said anything about its recent settlement of a lawsuit from a former student. On July 1 KC Johnson, a history professor at Brooklyn College, described the case and observed that across the country many students expelled for alleged sexual misconduct have been challenging university decisions in court:
Some 500 lawsuits have been brought by accused college students in Title IX cases since the Obama administration's "Dear Colleague" letter of 2011 made it easier for accusers to prevail. Of those 500, one of the most troubling has been the case of basketball star Jack Montague, expelled by Yale in 2016 just as his team was about to enter the NCAA tournament for the first time in 44 years.
Last week, the long-lasting lawsuit between Yale and its former basketball captain was settled without releasing the terms of the agreement. Normally after such an outcome, the university spokesperson issues an anodyne statement to the effect that the school prioritizes safety and will continue to do so in the future. In this instance, Yale took a different course: according to a June 25 AP article, university spokesperson Thomas Conroy declined to comment. (The day before, Conroy did not respond to a request for comment from me.)
In that July 1 piece, Mr. Johnson alleged numerous violations of due process by Yale, including violations of its own rules and federal law. Perhaps Yale will choose to address this topic in the future. In the meantime, Mr. Johnson notes this week a new federal court ruling which could have a nationwide impact. Writing in City Journal, Mr. Johnson observes :
Last month, the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals sided with a student who sued his school for unfairly finding him guilty of sexual assault. Reversing a lower court's dismissal of the anonymous student's claims against Purdue University, Judge Amy Coney Barrett wrote that it was "plausible" that Purdue's investigation panel "chose to believe Jane [Doe] because she is a woman and to disbelieve John [Doe] because he is a man." The court held that the university violated the student's due process rights and engaged in gender discrimination, forbidden by the Title IX statute...
In John Doe v. Purdue University, the plaintiff relied solely on a statement written on the accuser's behalf by the campus victims' rights office. Despite scant evidence, the Title IX investigator deemed the accuser the more credible party—without ever speaking to her. In what Judge Barrett called a "perplexing" decision, Purdue found the accused student guilty of sexual assault after a hearing in which the accuser didn't even appear. Doe suffered life-altering consequences, losing his ROTC scholarship and his dream of serving in the Navy.
As Barrett noted, "Purdue's process fell short of what even a high school must provide to a student facing a days-long suspension." Purdue's investigator declined to speak with Doe's roommate, who he said would corroborate his version of events. The university then withheld the investigator's report from Doe, a decision that the court labeled "fundamentally unfair." Indeed, university officials appeared to have rendered their verdict upon hearing the accusation.

Texto completo: Federal judges are supposed to be neutral decision-makers. But any pretense of neutrality has slipped away as the appointment process for Supreme Court justices and prominent lower-court judges has become mired in political partisanship.
President Donald Trump seems to expect his appointees to automatically side with him, just as he expects judges selected by President Barack Obama to be against him. His administration has allowed conservative advocates to play an outsize role in picking nominees. And the Senate, with its power to confirm or reject those choices, has sunk deeper into partisan score-settling.
Republicans and Democrats alike have contributed to today's hyper-politicized process. But nothing approaches the muscle that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exerts. McConnell thwarted Obama's opportunity to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 and, once Trump took office in 2017, began directing the swift approval of a record number of appeals court judges, as well as two Supreme Court justices.
In his new book, "Confirmation Bias," journalist Carl Hulse delves deeply into recent confirmation battles, describing the Senate's advice-and-consent power as "corrupted to what appears to be the point of no return."
The book is an absorbing, if dispiriting, look at the maneuverings of inside players like McConnell and Donald McGahn, Trump's first White House counsel, and outside advocates like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, who appears to have steered judicial selection as much as anyone at the White House.
Hulse, a New York Times correspondent and Illinois native, probes moments of escalation over the years and the backroom machinations of the Trump strategy now transforming the courts and the law. Inevitably, he covers previously reported ground, but "Confirmation Bias" is an important guide at this crucial time for the stature of America's judiciary.
Chief Justice John Roberts, himself a Republican appointee, has lamented the current state of affairs. In November Roberts pushed back on Trump. Roberts issued a statement saying: "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."
Yet individual judges have sometimes reinforced the notion that they are bent on favoring the president who appointed them. Of equal concern, the selection process appears patently designed to produce men and women who will do just that.
Tracing the origins of the Trump plan for the federal bench, Hulse recounts McGahn's early interaction with the candidate. They were introduced by David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. Trump inscribed a copy of "The Art of the Deal" to McGahn's young son, Don III, writing, "You've got a great dad." McGahn then helped draw up Trump's spring 2016 list of possible Supreme Court nominees.
Once Trump became president, McConnell and McGahn formed an early partnership to place ideological soul mates on the bench. McGahn engineered the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. In 2018 he managed the resignation of Justice Anthony Kennedy and his replacement by Brett Kavanaugh.
Back in 2008, Kavanaugh, then an appeals court judge, swore in McGahn after his confirmation to the Federal Election Commission. "That guy's going to be on the Supreme Court someday," McGahn said privately. Nearly a decade later, in 2017, Hulse writes, McGahn confided to Trump strategist Steve Bannon his continued interest in Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court choice.
During the televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, McGahn coached the nominee on his response to Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegation. As Ford testified before senators, Hulse reveals, McGahn received "worried texts from his circle" and then urged Kavanaugh to respond aggressively: "He wanted to see the nominee push back, cut off his interrogators, and turn their questions back on them." Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations dating back to their teen years in suburban Maryland, chalked them up to partisan critics and challenged senators about their drinking habits after they suggested that Kavanaugh drank to excess as a young man.
For decades, Republicans in Washington, dismayed at the judicial liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s, have made judicial appointments a higher priority than Democrats have. There have been exceptions, of course, when Democrats went on the offensive. In 1987 the Democratically controlled Senate rejected Robert Bork, and in 2013 Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid instigated a change in filibuster rules to win confirmation of stalled Obama nominations. A decade earlier, Reid helped block several nominees of President George W. Bush.
Yet Republicans such as McConnell have more recently been in control and ready to play hardball, partly as retribution. On Feb. 13, 2016, when Scalia died, McConnell received early word. When the death became public, McConnell was ready with his statement that an appointment to the seat should be saved for the next president, to be elected in November. On that same Feb. 13 McGahn called Trump to advise him on addressing the vacancy and offering names of possible successors.
Hulse writes of the ensuing angst among some on Obama's team that the president moved too slowly on a successor. Ron Klain, then chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, wanted the president to quickly name presumptive nominee Merrick Garland, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit. The well-regarded moderate's name had been kept in reserve for just such a moment.
Within a few days of Scalia's death, Hulse reports, Klain told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough: "The president ought to go to the Rose Garden tomorrow and name Merrick Garland. Tomorrow. Not a month from now. Tomorrow. Every day that ticks by is a day that you are letting McConnell consolidate his position."
Obama announced the Garland choice a month later. Senators never held a hearing.

Texto completo: Los Angeles is viewed today as one of the most thrilling cities in the world to eat. It is a place of sun-kissed produce, internationally diverse communities, and free-spirited artistry that stokes the imaginations of chefs and culinary trend-setters everywhere.
But that wasn't Aleksandra Crapanzano's impression when she began flying there regularly from her native New York as a budding screenwriter. Over countless steak-and-martini dinners and chopped salad lunches, she observed how diners were more preoccupied with the fashions of the clientele than the food on their plates.
Then her son was born, right around the time the Writers Guild went on strike. An avid home cook, she turned to nesting and a side gig writing for The New York Times Magazine food pages.
Screenwriters like herself took their laptops out of the writing rooms of Hollywood's major movie studios and into L.A. coffee shops and cafes, where a new breed of chefs was catering to a more casual market less interested in splurging on an expense-account steak than "ceremonial-grade matcha lattes and wild strawberries with yuzu sugar."
Crapanzano kept a journal of dishes she wanted to re-create at home. These recipes are the backbone of "Eat. Cook. L.A.": Chicken Salad with Indian Spices from Nancy Silverton of Osteria Mozza; Turmeric-Grilled Sea Bass from Bryant Ng of Cassia; Green Tea Basil Smash from Margarita and Walter Manzke of La Republique; Carrot Coconut Vegan "Panna Cotta" from Amanda Chantal Bacon of Moon Juice. The author expertly presents this melting pot of backgrounds and styles in one cohesive package from the perspective of an accomplished but practical home cook, with gorgeous food and environmental photos to put them in context.
Interspersed are glimpses inside some of these game-changing establishments and insights about the chefs behind them, but mostly the author lets the recipes do the talking.
That's enough to inspire me to get cooking, while plotting my own script for an eating vacation to the City of Angels as soon as possible.

Texto completo: At Sumaq Peruvian Restaurant in Cape Coral, the young woman behind the bar handed over a metal spork.
A spork?
"It's perfect for eating ceviche," she said, "because there are the pieces you have to poke and the juice you have to sip."
She was right — the spork was perfect for navigating the chunks of raw seafood heaped into the bowl and also slurping up the leche de tigre sauce made from lime juice, garlic and Peruvian peppers.
Pan flute music played on the speakers in the casually elegant restaurant as other diners tucked into plates of lomo saltado, Peruvian stir-fry. From the kitchen, the smells of grilled meat wafted into the dining room.
Sumaq opened quietly in February in the same plaza as Five Guys and Firehouse Subs off Santa Barbara Boulevard, and since then the restaurant has been offering diners a taste of South American cuisine. Husband-and-wife owners Francisco and Roxana Oller hail from Chimbote, in northern Peru. Opening the restaurant was a long-held dream for them, especially Francisco.
"Francisco loves to cook," Roxana said, "and he always wanted for the locals here to get to know Peruvian food."
Before the couple opened the restaurant, they ran a market in the same plaza, which they still own. The market sells products from different Latin American countries, as well as meat and prepared ceviches. Francisco's success with his ceviche dishes in the market gave him the inspiration to expand into a full-service restaurant.
Peruvian cuisine features influences from Asian and European cultures. Diners will see a mix of these on Sumaq's menu, from the Chinese-influenced fried rice dishes known as chaufas to Italian-inspired pesto over fettuccine to Spanish-style paella. The menu also highlights Peruvian ceviches, from the mixto with lime-marinated fish, green mussels, shrimp and calamari to the leche de tigre with the same marinated fish in a yellow Peruvian hot pepper sauce.
"All of our dishes, from our appetizers and ceviches to our desserts, are made with ingredients imported from Peru," Roxana said.
"That gives it a unique, authentic flavor."
The word "sumaq" comes from Quechua, the native language of the Incas. It has a range of meanings, including beautiful, delicious, pretty and friendly. Sumaq the restaurant appears to be all those things. Add in a few well-placed sporks, and, well, customers can't seem to get enough.
"We love hearing our customers tell us how much they enjoyed their meals and seeing them time and time again," Roxana said.
"It motivates us to continue improving."

Texto completo: René Redzepi is considered to be the world's greatest chef.His rule-defying New-Nordic restaurant Noma in Copenhagen was voted No. 1 in the world four times by Restaurant magazine. The Danish cook has influenced chefs all around the globe with his near religious use of local products, his love of fermentation, his passion for foraging, his pioneering throw-nothing-away "trash cooking," his utilization of insects and his encouragement of informality and warmth among his servers.Yet when Redzepi wanted to meet food writer Jeff Gordinier in New York City, the then food reporter for the New York Times (Gordinier is currently the food and drinks editor for Esquire magazine) was not eager for the tête à tête."I didn't want him rant to me about his cookbook," said Gordinier, a 52-year-old dad of four, who lives in Irvington, NY. Nevertheless, Gordinier grudgingly said yes — and much to his surprise, and delight, ended up following Redzepi for the next four years as he traveled the world looking for new flavors and ideas.
That adventure is chronicled in Gordinier's new book, "Hungry: Eating, Root Tripping, and Risking It All with the Greatest Chef in the World," (Tim Duggan Books, a division of Penguin Random House).
Gordinier watched as Redzepi shuttered his renowned restaurant, Noma, and replaced it, elsewhere in Cophenhagen, with what most everyone calls Noma 2.0. (Recently Noma 2.0 was named the second Best Restaurant in the World.)
Gordinier's fly-on-the-wall globe-trotting journey, he admits, turned him into a huge fan of Redzepi.
"It's not just his cooking. It's the way he's communicating. He is saying things about our culture and environmental landscape that no other chef is saying," Gordinier said. "I see Noma's influence everywhere": in fine-dine restaurants that eschew white tablecloths and fancy cutlery; in wine lists that feature natural wines; churn their own butter, dry and preserve their own fruits and vegetables.
Gordinier is now an unabashed member of the "cult of Noma" made up of food lovers, chefs and restaurateurs lucky enough to have feasted on Redzepi's absurdly innovative dishes. (The uninitiated may call them weird or yucky.) Among his culinary gems: vegetables hidden in a clay pot in edible "soil"; cabbage leaves sporting creme fraiche; spears of asparagus wrapped in mold; and a slab of white chocolate encrusted with crunchy bee larvae.
A great deal of experimentation takes place in Noma's kitchen, which features a Fermentation Lab and an ant farm. Noma has served jumbo shrimp covered with tiny black ants and citrus-y wood ants in birch ice cream. (Noma has set up a "Nordic Food Lab" at the University of Copenhagen to study and experiment with all sorts of food, bugs included.)
The food the restaurant serves, Gordinier will tell you, is like nothing you've ever tasted. "It's intoxicating, elevating," he said. "You feel like a new being."
A swashbuckling, adventurous foodie himself, Gordinier was the perfect journalist to tell Redzepi's tale.
Gordinier, who grew up in Pasadena, Calif., inherited a love of food from his parents whom he affectionately calls "restaurant nuts." For the family of five — Gordinier has a younger brother and sister — dining out was "our form of entertainment; it was our theater, how my family engages with culture."
At a young age, he and his siblings ate oysters, foie gras, frog's legs, rabbit. "We weren't squeamish."
Nor, for that matter were they food snobs. They loved the fancy "Hollywood canteens" where the stars would dine — — as well as hole-in-the-wall Lebanese, Mexican, Filipino, Szechuan joints where the locals would eat.
His parents' ability to appreciate both the fancy and the dive prepared him well for admiring Redzepi's sensibility. Diners come in jeans to Noma. The tables are not graced by starched white cloth — or any cloth. The chef who cooked your dish serves your dish.
Noma is more than just a restaurant, Gordinier said. "It's an experience."
A heady, thrilling experience that keeps changing what it offers according to the season: It proffers three menus a year: seafood in the spring and fall, the "plant kingdom" in the summer, and wild game in the winter.
"Each one represents an entirely new restaurant," Gordinier said. "And the dishes are never repeated."
This year's seafood dishes will be completely different from next year's — and what will be on the menu is a delicious mystery. According to Adam Platt, restaurant critic for New York magazine, rumor has it that the next fall menu may include "nonvegetarian delicacies like raven, puffin meat, deer hearts, and even a shot or two of moose blood."
Good luck, however, getting to taste that puffin meat or drink the moose blood. It's notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to secure a table.
A would-be poet Despite being raised to love food, Gordinier did not plan to make a career out of it. He attended Princeton, hoping to to be a poet. "It turns out it's not that lucrative," he said. He tried fiction but "ran out of things to say at 20." Then in a class taught by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer John McPhee, he learned that "you can write about other people" — something, it turns out, he excelled in."I was good at listening," he said.
From 1994 to 2002, he wrote for Entertainment Weekly: profiles of Prince, Leonard Cohen, Willy Nelson, Van Morrison, Julia Roberts, Lucinda Williams and his all-time favorite musician David Bowie twice.
Bowie, upon learning that Gordinier was about to become a father, gave him sleep-training advice.
"I implore you," Gordinier mimicked Bowie saying in an English accent, "put the child in her crib, close the door and let her howl."
"He was right," he continued.
Recently, he has used Bowie's sleep-training technique on his youngest progeny — 1-year-old twin boys, the products of his recent second marriage. "Changing diapers at 52 is a curve ball," he said. His older kids — a 17-year old daughter and 13-year-old son live nearby and come over frequently.
Finding the best He went on to write for Details magazine and eventually, from 2011 to 2016, the New York Times, and today Esquire, for which every year he travels all over the country to find the Best New Restaurants in America. His reporting sometimes requires eating as many as seven meals in a day.
"I often eat when I'm not hungry," he said. "It's not recommended."
But when he finds a great restaurant, he said, no matter how stuffed he may be, he frequently can't stop eating. "It's a kind of exaltation," he said, "a feeling of abandon. I lose myself in the food." As a consequence, he said, "I struggle with my weight a lot."
Over the years, he has championed chefs and restaurants, and not just hoity toity ones. Last year, Karenderya, a casual Filipino restaurant in Nyack, N.Y., made his Best list. "It's nice when you can make a difference in someone's life, particularly good people."
"He's been a hero in the food and wine world," said Sean Feeney, the owner of highly touted Lilia and Misi in Brooklyn, NY. about Gordinier.
Feeney read "Hungry" two times "in the first 24 hours I had it," he said. "It's extremely powerful. It is the gold standard for literary food writing. It will be required reading in culinary schools. The book has the power to inspire anyone who picks it up."
Westchester-based Dan Peres, who as editor in chief of "Details" brought Gordinier to the magazine, is also a fan.
"He is a shrewd cultural observer, meticulous reporter and a beautiful writer," Peres said of Gordinier, who is today a friend — and his best source for spot-on food recommendations. "He has an insatiable curiosity and loves food. Wherever I'm going, I can ask him for a recommendation and rarely, by the way, is it a fine-dine restaurant that he suggests. It may be a taco truck."
Tacos lead to Noma Tacos are in fact what inspired Redzepi to contact Gordinier in the first place.
Redzepi was contemplating a pop-up restaurant in Mexico and was on a quest to find the perfect taco. Gordinier, who had grown up eating tacos in Southern California, was an expert.
In the process of working on "Hungry," Gordinier ate at Noma seven times. He can't say he loved every dish. But every Noma dish, he said, is "something I couldn't even imagine."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- America stinks. At least that's what Donald J. Trump seemed to be saying before becoming president.
He did not believe in "American exceptionalism," he said, because America was not exceptional. Instead, it was a "laughingstock" that was no better than Vladimir V. Putin's Russia. By promising to make America great again, he made it clear that he believed it was not great anymore.
That was then. Now the president who trash-talked America more than any other in modern times says anyone who trash-talks America should leave. The president, who took office with an inaugural address decrying "American carnage," now says that it is unpatriotic to speak ill of the country. And on Tuesday, he went further, equating attacks on him by his political opponents with attacks on "the Country, the Flag."
The love-it-or-leave-it argument is hardly new, but in recent years, it has rarely played out at the volume and level it has since Mr. Trump on Sunday told a group of liberal, first-year Democratic congresswomen of color to "go back" to their home countries, even though three of the four were born in the United States.
Assailed for inflaming racial divisions, Mr. Trump this week sought to reframe his attack on the so-called Squad of congresswomen into a question of patriotism and loyalty, claiming that they "hate our country."
The blistering debate that has followed is all the more remarkable given that Mr. Trump spent much of the last few years essentially disparaging America. It was the high-octane fuel for his campaign, the notion that this was no longer the United States of old because it had succumbed to politically correct, multicultural, open-borders globalism and allowed itself to be taken advantage of by allies and adversaries alike.
As president, however, Mr. Trump has wrapped himself in the flag -- at one point hugging it at a conservative political gathering -- and waged a monthslong campaign against African-American football players for protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem. He effectively co-opted the national celebration of the Fourth of July, making himself the red-white-and-blue star on center stage. He has contended that he has transformed the United States into a beacon of strength again, crediting himself with reversing the national decline he identified as a candidate.
"As president, he now sees America as an avatar for himself -- it must be great because he's great," said Nicole Hemmer, a scholar of conservatism who is taking a position at Columbia University to work on its oral history of Barack Obama's presidency. "From this perspective, to allow that America has faults would be to allow that Trump himself has them, something he has never been willing to do."
In a way, this is a struggle over what the United States really stands for. Mr. Trump and his allies argue that the Squad and its followers do not share core American values because they are critical of the system and advocate or flirt with socialism, while the president's critics say it's the other way around and that he does not subscribe to the core national beliefs in free speech, immigration and the rule of law. At stake is who gets to define what constitutes Americanism.
There is no doubt that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and her allies made provocative, even incendiary statements that have struck even many of their fellow Democrats as radical. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota in particular has used anti-Semitic tropes to attack supporters of Israel and suggest Jewish lawmakers were loyal to a foreign country while making comments that seemed to minimize the horror of terrorism, even the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
The Republican National Committee on Tuesday issued a list of what it called the "vile, hateful, anti-Israel and anti-American rhetoric" used by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar and Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, citing among other things comments attacking the Border Patrol and accusing the administration of running "concentration camps" on the southeastern border.
"He's tired, a lot of us are sick and tired of this country -- of America -- coming last to people who swore an oath of office," Kellyanne Conway, the president's counselor, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.
The Squad's supporters argue that their comments were not anti-American but policy criticisms of an administration they disagree with, just as Mr. Trump's backers argue that his past remarks were not rejections of America but expressions of frustration with what he viewed as the damaging leadership of Mr. Obama and other presidents of both parties.
Geoffrey R. Stone, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School who has studied the era of McCarthyism, said criticism of the government represents one of the greatest strengths of the United States.
"Not all criticisms are warranted, of course, but it is through such criticism that we improve over time," he said. "It was criticism that led to the civil rights movement, the women's rights movement and the gay rights movement. The president should learn to value criticism, even when he disagrees with its message."
Ben Domenech, a founder and publisher of The Federalist, a conservative online publication, said the debate of recent days reminded him of a "South Park" episode where the characters say that America has problems, but anyone who does not root for the home team should get out of the stadium.
"The president is doing the same thing, with an added tinge of xenophobia," said Mr. Domenech. "It's tribal, it ramps up the intensity of everything, but it plays both in his interest and the interests of the congressional members involved from their perspective."
Mr. Trump was less bothered by criticism of the United States in the years leading up to his election. He repeatedly said "our country is a laughingstock" and took issue with the term "American exceptionalism." In 2013, he praised Mr. Putin for an "amazing" Op-Ed in The New York Times that said the United States was not special and criticized Mr. Obama for asserting American exceptionalism.
Speaking on CNN, Mr. Trump said, "You think of the term as being fine, but all of a sudden you say, what if you're in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 different countries? You're not going to like that term. It's very insulting, and Putin really put it to him about that." As for whether Americans were exceptional, he said, "Why would we be?" citing the disastrous Iraq war.
He likewise rejected the term in 2016 as a presidential candidate when asked about his praise for Mr. Putin's Op-Ed. "And that's basically what Putin was saying, is that, you know, you use a term like 'American exceptionalism,' and frankly, the way our country is being treated right now by Russia and Syria and lots of other places and with all the mistakes we've made over the years, like Iraq and so many others, it's sort of a hard term to use," he said on Fox News.
During other interviews, he has said the United States was no better than Russia when it came to its moral values on the international front. During a conversation with Bill O'Reilly on Fox shortly after Mr. Trump took office, the host pointed out that "Putin's a killer." Mr. Trump replied by saying, "What, do you think our country is so innocent?"
Mr. Trump's affinity for Russia was so pronounced during the campaign that Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, now the Republican leader in the House, privately told colleagues that "I think Putin pays" Mr. Trump. Last year, Mr. Trump blamed poor relations with Russia on "many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity" -- to which the Russian Foreign Ministry then tweeted, "We agree."
Asked on Sunday to reconcile Mr. Trump's latest love-America line with his repeated assertions that America needed to be made great again, and therefore was not great, Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the president's re-election campaign, offered a variation on the slogan: "Keep America great."

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump , aseguró el lunes que “muchos, muchos” inmigrantes fueron capturados el domingo por el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) en el primer día de la operación con la que planeaba arrestar a al menos 2,000 personas.
Hasta el momento no se han tenido noticia de detenciones masivas, pese a que tanto los migrantes (aterrorizados, y escondidos en sus casas) como los activistas (en guardia, defendiendo los derechos de los afectados) están en alerta máxima.
“Simplemente, ustedes no conocen lo que ha sucedido”, explicó Trump sobre esta falta de noticias sobre arrestos. “Fue un día muy exitoso, pero no vieron mucho de lo que pasó”, añadió el presidente, sin citar cifras concretas.
La operación, que debería llevarse a cabo durante toda la semana en nueve ciudades (Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Ángeles, Miami, Nueva York y San Francisco), puede ganar fuerza en cualquier momento.
Y ICE, en cualquier caso, no ha dejado de arrestar a inmigrantes.
Entre el 7 de julio y el pasado jueves, por ejemplo, detuvo a docenas de personas en Los Ángeles. La semana pasada, arrestó a 20 migrantes, la mayoría con antecedentes criminales, en San Diego. El lunes capturó a seis más en una redada en un edificio de apartamentos de Houston (Texas).
En Estados Unidos hay 10,5 millones de indocumentados. ICE cifra en 565.892 los fugitivo s (migrantes que han desobedecido una orden final de expulsión).
La agencia federal arrestó a 160,000 personas (440 al día) en el año fiscal de 2018, y deportó a 256,000 (700 al día). Es decir, en una semana normal detiene a más de 2.000 migrantes y deporta a casi 4,000, cifras muy similares a las anunciadas para la operación de esta semana.
Si se cree en peligro, recuerde sus derechos y siga los consejos de activistas sobre qué hacer si se ve involucrado en una redada.
Agentes de ICE tocaron a la puerta de una vivienda en Passaic (Nueva Jersey) el domingo a la una de la madrugada, según cuenta el diario The New York Times. Despertaron a una joven adolescente, pero gracias a que había leído una información en Internet sobre qué hacer en estos casos, decidió no abrir.
“Dijeron, ‘tenemos que hablar contigo, ¿puedes salir, puedes abrir la puerta?’. Yo dije, ‘¿tienen permiso para entrar en mi casa, tienen un papel?’”, explicó la joven. “Ellos dijeron, ‘no estamos intentando entrar en tu casa, sólo queremos hablar contigo’, y yo dije, ‘no, no voy a salir”, añadió.
Los agentes regresaron a las cinco de la madrugada, pero la joven se escondió con sus padres hasta que se fueron, según cuenta el diario.
No fue la única redada.
“Hablan del domingo, pero no necesitamos esperar al domingo, ya están deteniendo a inmigrantes”, explicó la activista Nora Sandigo a la cadena NBC.
Según contó, el viernes fueron detenidos cinco hombres en el área de Homestead (Florida), al menos uno de ellos en su casa y otro mientras esperaba a las puertas de un centro comercial Home Depot esperando trabajo en la construcción.
Se trata de un guatemalteco que lleva 16 años en el país y tiene cinco hijos de entre dos y 16 años. “Es totalmente injusto”, explicó Sandigo, “es el que trae el dinero a la familia, una buena persona sin problemas con la ley, su único problema es que no tiene papeles”.

As goes Pennsylvania, so goes 2020 election

Texto completo: While Democrats wade through a marathon of intraparty debates, the national punditocracy is increasingly asking two urgent questions about the impending 2020 presidential contest: Can President Donald Trump win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin again? And can he win a second term without those three states?
Both questions reflect a stark reality in American presidential elections: The presidency is won or lost in the Electoral College — a body dominated by a handful of large so-called battleground states that can determine the outcome.
Trump triumphed in 2016 by winning narrowly these three Rust Belt states, which he was expected to lose. Pennsylvania was the biggest surprise as well as the biggest prize among them. In theory, Trump can win without these three — either by replacing them with three other large states — or by picking up several smaller states that equal their combined 46 electoral votes.
But where will those replacement states come from? The New York Times reports that Trump is far behind in Pennsylvania (16 percentage points), Wisconsin (10 points) and Michigan (11 points). According to the Morning Consult, Trump’s current approval rating in Pennsylvania has plummeted 19 points since Inauguration Day.
The president could go after states — including New Hampshire, Nevada and Minnesota — he narrowly lost in 2016. But combined these would not nearly make up for losses in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
In addition, Trump may be on the defensive in states he won in 2016 and must win again in 2020. Florida and even Texas are wobbly while North Carolina, a Trump stronghold in 2016, is trending blue in statewide elections. Even winning all three again won’t compensate for losses in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Inarguably then, Trump almost certainly cannot win the Electoral College without winning these three crucial Rust Belt states, which have voted as a bloc seven elections in a row — supporting Democrats in six consecutive elections before shifting to Trump and the GOP in 2016. As goes Wisconsin and Michigan also goes Pennsylvania; and in 2020, as goes Pennsylvania, so goes the election.
But can Trump win Pennsylvania again? What are the keys to the Keystone State?
Trump’s strategy
— Increase the turnout among his base. Trump’s strength is rooted in rural and small-town western Pennsylvania with its long tradition of old-economy “smokestack industries,” as well as the old mining and mill towns in the northeast and southwest. To win he may need a historically high turnout in these areas to overcome an expected anti-Trump surge in the suburbs.
— Make it a referendum. The president must convince his supporters that he kept his promises: bringing back jobs and business lost overseas; ending bad trade deals; and fixing the immigration problem. Presidential elections are almost always a referendum on the incumbent.
— Be a cultural warrior. Trump must continue to appeal to culturally conservative Democrats, who remain strongly pro-life and anti-gun control. Trump’s 2016 cultural message resonated strongest in western, rural and small-town Pennsylvania.
— Expand the base. Republicans must attract new voters who did not support the GOP ticket in 2016. Trump is running with a good economy at his back and no new wars. These conditions strongly favor incumbents and are attractive to independent voters who prefer the status quo.
Democrats’ strategy
Democrats still think they can beat Trump. Here’s how they expect to do it:
— Nominate a moderate candidate. While Pennsylvania can temporarily lean left or right, its instincts are moderate and centrist. If the Democrats choose a candidate perceived to be “far left,” Pennsylvania will be difficult for Democrats to win.
— Produce the widely predicted “Democratic surge.” Certainly, there were strong indications during the 2018 midterms and special elections that state Democrats are locked and loaded for 2020. To beat Trump, however, Democrats now must translate 2018’s promise into 2020 results. If they fail to galvanize the Philadelphia suburbs, Trump will win Pennsylvania in 2020.
— Tend to the base. Democrats must recover some of the previously Democratic voters who now support Trump. Former Democratic strongholds such as Luzerne, Northampton and Erie went for Trump in 2016, sealing his sliver-thin win. Democrats must address the fears and hopes of these lapsed party voters, especially white males.
— Engage younger voters. Finally, Democrats must attract younger voters to the polls in 2020. Voters under age 35 have been among Trump’s fiercest critics. Yet this cohort normally votes at a rate about half that of older Pennsylvanians. Increasing youth turnout could spell the difference between defeat and victory.
It is foolish to conclude Trump cannot win Pennsylvania — just as it was foolish to write him off in 2016. Trump’s base in rural and western Pennsylvania will support him at least as strongly as in 2016. Furthermore, no incumbent in modern times has lost reelection in an era of economic prosperity such as we are now experiencing.
Undoubtedly the greatest threat to Trump is a Democratic turnout tsunami in Philadelphia and its suburbs. The suburbs and city were disaster areas for Republican candidates in the last midterms — and early polling suggests the anti-Trump sentiment continues.
Right now, Pennsylvania is the Democrats to lose in 2020. But that was also true in 2016. How did that turn out?

Texto completo: El domingo, el presidente Donald J. Trump conminó a congresistas demócratas progresistas a regresar “a los países infestados de crimen de donde vinieron”. Aunque Trump no las nombra, se refería a las cuatro congresistas electas en los comicios intermedios de 2018: Alexandria Ocasio Cortés, nacida en Nueva York y de ascendencia puertorriqueña; Ayana Pressley, de Massachusetts; Ilhan Omar, de Minnesota; y Rashida Tlaib, de Michigan. Solo Omar es inmigrante y llegó aquí como refugiada de Somalia a los 10 años de edad. Es ciudadana estadounidense.
Es obvio que para Trump ser estadounidense equivale a ser blanco. Y es esa premisa la que mueve su estrategia de campaña, ahora de reelección, así como su estrategia política y sus decisiones de política pública, especialmente en materia migratoria. De hecho, Trump lleva semanas anunciando el inicio de redadas en varias ciudades del país para detener a inmigrantes con órdenes finales de deportación, acción que para Trump es un capítulo más del reality show que es su presidencia, para infligir terror entre la comunidad inmigrante y demostrar ante sus seguidores que está cumpliéndoles lo prometido. De hecho, para garantizarles que su plan de promover división guiará su campaña de reelección.
No hay que olvidar que fue Trump quien encabezó la campaña que cuestionó la ciudadanía estadounidense del expresidente Barack Obama afirmando que había nacido en Kenia, como su padre, y no en Hawaii.
Trump no dudó en atacar a un senador federal, luego candidato y luego presidente estadounidense, abogado constitucionalista egresado de Harvard y nacido en Hawaii de madre estadounidense y padre africano. El domingo afirmó que las congresistas demócratas progresistas deben “regresar” a los países de “donde vinieron”, aunque ese país sea Estados Unidos. “Regrésate a tu país” es la frase preferida de los prejuiciosos, y muchos hemos sido el objetivo, sobre todo al hablar español en público, aunque seamos ciudadanos estadounidenses. ¿Qué pueden esperar entonces los inmigrantes al interior del país y los migrantes que arriban a la frontera o que ya están detenidos y hacinados en condiciones infrahumanas?
Si su gobierno ni siquiera tiene compasión con niños y bebés migrantes detenidos en insalubres condiciones documentadas por el Inspector General del propio Departamento de Seguridad Interna (DHS), ¿hay quien todavía ponga en duda que el único objetivo de Trump es explotar políticamente la divisiva estrategia de “ellos contra nosotros” cimentada en el nativismo, el prejuicio y el racismo?
Y claro está, sus cómplices le siguen el juego. Solo hay que remitirse a la visita del vicepresidente Mike Pence a la frontera el pasado viernes. Mientras las cámaras de la prensa que cubre al vicepresidente mostraron las terribles condiciones de hacinamiento e insalubridad y los propios reporteros indicaron que la pestilencia era abrumadora y que incluso algunos agentes portaban máscaras debido al mal olor, Pence trató de minimizar las condiciones y, claro está, culpó a los demócratas por la falta de fondos para abordar la crisis. Incluso tachó de “deshonesto” un video de CNN del hacinamiento.
Solo había que ver el rostro de Pence al observar a los migrantes enjaulados. Parecía que quería salir corriendo. Pero tenía que completar la visita para hacer creer que hay compasión, cuando en realidad Trump está utilizando la crisis humanitaria con fines electorales. La imagen de rostros morenos hacinados le sirve a Trump en sus planes de promover miedo y prejuicio entre sus huestes.
Que Trump lo haga, a nadie sorprende, pero la hipocresía del evangélico Pence es indignante aunque no sorprendente. La prensa reportó que Pence también visitó un centro de detención de niños migrantes acompañado de su esposa y de tres senadores republicanos, Lindsey Graham, de Carolina del Sur; Mike Lee, de Utah, y John Cornyn, de Texas.
The New York Times reportó que Lee le sirvió de intérprete a Pence, quien les preguntó si tenían comida y cuidados, a lo que los niños respondieron que sí. “Pero cuando les preguntó si tenían un lugar para asearse”, los niños movieron la cabeza en señal de no, según el diario.
“Dos niños le dijeron al Señor Pence que habían caminado por dos o tres meses para llegar a Estados Unidos, a lo que Pence respondió en inglés ‘God bless you’, y ‘gracias’ en español”, reportó The New York Times.
Me pregunto dónde Pence esconde su Biblia y los preceptos religiosos que tanto defiende, cuando le hace el trabajo sucio a Trump. Pence cumplió su cometido y dio la espalda al problema.
Pero el daño infligido, sobre todo el daño psicológico a los niños, ya está hecho.
Porque si algo ha demostrado Trump y su gobierno es que la crueldad y el prejuicio no tienen límites, así se trate de niños, o de expresidentes, o de congresistas que no llenen el molde racial que el presidente defiende. La estrategia electoral del “ellos (los de color) contra nosotros (los blancos)”, sigue vivita y coleando en los planes de reelección de Trump.

Democrats Smear Democrats; Once reserved for Republicans, the race card is now being played against Biden and Pelosi.

Texto completo: For a moment there, Nancy Pelosi looked lost. After Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) accused her of "singling out . . . newly elected women of color" for criticism, it fell to Donald Trump to defend the speaker of the House. To call Mrs. Pelosi a racist, Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday, "is a disgrace."
Not exactly the rescue she was hoping for. Fortunately for her, by Sunday Mr. Trump had followed up with a series of tweets saying the progressive Democratic congresswomen accusing Mrs. Pelosi of racism should go back to the countries whence they came, fix the problems there, and then return to America to teach us what to do. That gave Mrs. Pelosi the opening she needed to get back on the familiar ground of attacking Mr. Trump as racist and xenophobic.
Even so, Mrs. Pelosi must know the newfound party unity over mutual denunciation of the president won't last. Because the larger, emerging story of 2020 is Democrat-on-Democrat infighting as progressives accuse moderates of racism. Saul Alinsky would recognize it as forcing targets to live by their own rules.
The most notable strike came on the second night of the Democratic presidential debates, when Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) accused Joe Biden of having been too cozy with segregationists (also Democrats) who were still around during Mr. Biden's early years in the Senate, and working with them "to oppose busing."
It's nonsense, of course, to imply that a man who loyally served as vice president for the first African-American president is a racist. Ditto for the accusation against Mrs. Pelosi. As Maureen Dowd aptly put it in the New York Times, "A.O.C. should consider the possibility that people who disagree with her do not disagree with her color."
It's good to read about how vile and unfair it is to assume people who have a different point of view must be motivated by racial animosity. But it's illuminating that we're only hearing this outrage now because the target of these Democratic accusations of racism are other Democrats.
The way things are going, by the end of the campaign, few of the Democratic presidential aspirants will emerge unscathed. Take Pete Buttigieg. After a white South Bend, Ind., police officer shot and killed an African American wielding a knife, the mayor was asked at a contentious South Bend rally if he is a "racist" and if he believes "black lives matter."
Meanwhile, an African-American radio host recently asked Elizabeth Warren about her claims to be Native American, calling her "the original Rachel Dolezal," a "white woman pretending to be black." Even Ms. Harris has herself been accused by a writer for TheRoot.com of having "spent her whole career as a prosecutor locking up black men in California." And right before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez accused Mrs. Pelosi of criticizing women because of their color and not their politics, her chief of staff tweeted (then deleted) that Democratic moderates "certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s."
On the substance, almost all these accusations of racial animosity—against Mr. Biden, against Mrs. Pelosi, against Mr. Buttigieg, against moderate Democrats—are false and repellent. Yet in another sense, there's a certain rough justice that these Democrats today find themselves having to defend themselves against these accusations.
Not because they are racist. But because so many have played the same vile card against equally guiltless Republicans and conservatives.
Start with Mrs. Pelosi. Only days before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez played the race card on her, Mrs. Pelosi declared that the "Make America Great Again" hat was really all about making America "white again." Got that? The MAGA hat is itself racist, as presumably is everyone who wears it. Now she's hoping to drown out her intraparty feud with an upstart progressive wing by seeing who can shout the loudest that the president is a racist.
As for Mr. Biden, he's understandably outraged by how he's been painted as a segregationist sympathizer. But back when he and Barack Obama were running against Republican Mitt Romney, Mr. Biden told a largely African-American audience that Mr. Romney was "going to put y'all back in chains."
It isn't the only time he's pulled this card from the bottom of the deck. A year ago, Mr. Biden appeared on MSNBC with the Rev. Al Sharpton to say there is only one reason Republicans support voter-identification laws: "They don't want black folks voting."
Come to think of it, there's Mr. Sharpton himself. Over the years, without any apologies, one of the greatest race-baiters of all time has managed to transform himself into a Democratic Party elder statesman. To the point where almost all the party's top contenders dutifully have made the pilgrimage to kiss his ring.
So, yes, both Mr. Biden and Mrs. Pelosi have been falsely accused of racism. Then again, they are also both reaping what they have sown.

Did the breakup between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez have to be so ugly?

Texto completo: It was an awkward relationship from the start, a marriage of convenience for the good of the Democratic Party.
Their friends hoped it would last at least until the 2020 elections -- long enough to get Donald Trump out of office -- but the alliance never made it through the honeymoon stage. But it seems now the older establishment wing of the Democratic congressional caucus has parted ways with its much younger, progressive "squad."
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the moderate old guard, and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the head of the liberal "squad," are no longer trying to make a go of it. They're done with their loveless working relationship, and neither is willing to continue faking it.
The public fallout began when Pelosi appeared to dis Ocasio-Cortez and her squad of three other freshman minority women in an interview with The New York Times. Ocasio-Cortez retaliated by calling Pelosi "outright disrespectful" to newly elected women of color. Somehow, that got translated into labeling Pelosi a racist.
How quickly things can sour when politics are involved.
Just five months ago, a diverse coalition of Democratic women, many of them recently elected and all wearing white, formed a sea of unity at Trump's State of the Union address. How impressive it was to watch Pelosi, presiding from her perch behind the president's lectern, direct them with a single hand motion or subtle facial expression, when to applaud and when to stay silent.
Perhaps it was the half-century age gap that ultimately doomed the new power couple. Pelosi is 79. Ocasio-Cortez, or AOC as her friends and enemies call her, is 29. The May-December relationship was doomed from the start, and unless someone figures out how to get them back together, Democrats are going to suffer the consequences.
This breakup cannot be pinned on Trump, though he clearly will benefit most. It is the manifestation of a brutal ideological battle among Democrats that, while centering on many of Trump's policies, has more to do with the generational styles of two groups that don't complement or even understand each other.
The whole mess began in June when Pelosi caved to House Republicans and allowed a bill providing $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid for migrants to pass in the House without making any demands on Trump to protect children caught up in the border crisis.
The "squad," consisting of U.S. Reps. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan were livid. They voted against the measure, and some criticized Pelosi publicly.
No one could benefit more from the political infighting within the Democratic Party than Trump. The fact that it is a nasty division between the party's white female leader and four outspoken women of color is an added bonus.
It gives Trump and the Republicans an example to use when they bring up a point often posed to minorities, "Democrats only use you to win elections. Why are you still with them?"
Already, Trump has chimed in with a self-serving defense of Pelosi, proclaiming that she is not a racist and that she deserves Ocasio-Cortez's respect. This endorsement by a man whose own racist tendencies are in question was not intended to ease tensions between the estranged pair.
His goal was to drive a thicker wedge between them by siding with the speaker whom progressives deem to be too soft on him.
But if Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez are smart enough, they could use it their advantage. All they have to do is go back to pretending.
Maybe they could even post a photo on Instagram of the two of them hugging. No one would care at this point whether it's real. Just indulge the public until Nov. 3, 2020.
If they do decide that it's worth it to get back together and work on building a more solid coalition, there are a few things to keep in mind. Anyone who has been in a lasting relationship knows that longevity requires hard work. But most of all, it requires mutual respect.
Maybe Ocasio-Cortez and her squad were feeling a little abused. Maybe they were tired of being treated like children, dismissed to a back room when the grown-ups are talking. Maybe they were tired of being called into the principal's office for speaking the truth and being called out for not following the rules.
Maybe Ocasio-Cortez was sick of being belittled by a political partner who once suggested that a "glass of water" could have won in a district as liberal as hers. Maybe she and her squad deserve better than that from Pelosi and the rest of the old guard.
In order for this relationship to have any hope of a revival, Pelosi will have to stop acting as though Ocasio-Cortez and her squad need her more than she needs them. While it's true that Pelosi wields most of the power, she doesn't have to flaunt it every chance she gets.
Pelosi never should have let that piece of chocolate New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd gave her prior to an interview earlier this month allow her to drop her guard. She never should have dismissed the public appeal of the squad and its millions of social media followers.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," she told Dowd. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people, and that's how many votes they got."
Someone as experienced as Pelosi knows that everything that pops into your head shouldn't come out of your mouth, especially when your relationship is on shaky ground. And surely the speaker knows that you can't say anything behind someone's back in Washington and think it won't get back to them.
Maybe it was Pelosi's way of telling Ocasio-Cortez that it's time to move on.

Texto completo: Zipping through the Orioles' lineup, Ryan Yarbrough was unaware of his role in potential history until the Tampa Bay left-hander was deep into the finest outing of his career. After taking over for Ryne Stanek in the third inning Sunday, Yarbrough was poised to be part of the major leagues' first combined perfect game.
"I was so locked in, not until I went out there in the eighth to warm up and I heard a kid yell, 'Don't blow it,' did I realize what the situation was," Yarbrough said.
Hanser Alberto beat the shift with a leadoff opposite-field single in the ninth inning, taking some of the edge off a 4-1 victory in Baltimore.
Hall of Famer Gibson will begin treatment for pancreatic cancer
St. Louis Cardinals legend Bob Gibson is fighting pancreatic cancer.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the 83-year-old Hall of Famer was diagnosed with the cancer several weeks ago and revealed the news Saturday to the other living Hall of Famers.
Gibson's longtime agent, Dick Zitzmann, told the Post-Dispatch that Gibson has visited the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and has been hospitalized in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, for the past two weeks. Zitzmann said chemotherapy is likely to begin today in Omaha.
Big catch by Markakis preserves Braves win in Saturday night thriller
The Braves, clinging to a 7-5 lead in the 10th inning, thought the game was over. The Padres' Francisco Mejia skied a pitch into the San Diego night, what surely appeared to be a three-run homer.
Nick Markakis caught it while slamming into the right-field wall. After a walk, reliever Luis Perdomo was forced to hit with the bases loaded because the Padres were out of position players. Luke Jackson struck him out, and the 7-5 victory Saturday night secured the Braves' first series win in San Diego since 2011.
"I knew it was going to be close," Markakis said of the catch. "I was just getting back there to time my jump."

The Hidden History of Liberty Island; Before the statue and long before the brand-new museum, there were pirates, real-estate ventures and public executions

Texto completo: As a rule, a museum tells more by what it leaves out than by what it includes. It's akin to framing a photo to show the patriarch and the favorite son but exclude the black sheep who's brought this family nothing but trouble.
Take, for example, the Statue of Liberty Museum on Liberty Island, the 15-acre rock at the mouth of New York harbor. Since 1886, the island has been home to the 305-foot statue, with gown, torch and tablet, standing amid broken chains—the first glimpse of America seen by generations of immigrants, symbolizing the nation's best sentiments.
The museum, which cost $100 million to build, opened in May in a celebrity-packed ceremony, featuring photos and films of the statue and the original copper torch, which was replaced by a gold-leafed replica in 1985 after it was damaged by leaks. But there is another story that the museum doesn't tell: the deep history of Liberty Island, what it meant to those who lived and died in eras before the statue arrived.
The saga is still there, of course, only papered over, forgotten: a site of military strategy, land speculation, piratical pursuits and, most notoriously, public executions. In this, Liberty Island epitomizes the telling of all history—each generation overwrites the past. You discover it with a thrill, as when at around age 10, you ask your mother, "Did someone live in this house before us?"
To Europeans who sailed through the Narrows in the 17th century, the island was a cork that stoppered the mouth of the greatest natural harbor in the New World, teeming with seagulls and shellfish when the tide ebbed. On Dutch maps, it was marked as Great Oyster Island, a Lenape hunting ground. With the coming of the British, it entered the only history that counts: commercial.
Its views of town and sea—they would call it a double exposure now—marked it as a choice piece of real estate. A Captain Robert Needham, given the island by the British governor of New York in the way of swag, sold it to a merchant named Isaac Bedloe (also recorded as Bedlow and Bedloo) on Dec. 23, 1667. Until being renamed for the statue in 1956, it was usually known as Bedloe's Island, awash in Manhattan's property churn, sold and resold, gussied up, sold again. At one point, it rented as a vacation property called Love Island. At another, it was a quarantine hospital where the stricken looked longingly at the bustling port across the bay.
It was turned into a military base in the run-up to the War of 1812 and became the site of a star-shaped fort, cannons facing the sea, whose distinctive walls would later support the statue. The fort was ultimately named for Lt. Col. Eleazer Derby Wood, killed in the 1814 British siege of Fort Erie.
All the while, the island was being put to a grisly use that still haunts it. For hundreds of years, Liberty Island was a place for hangings. Dozens of pirates met their fate there, including one Cornelius Wilhelms, a Dutch sailor who, along with confederates, killed the captain of his ship and its officers, killed the male passengers and then, according to a 1860 New York Times article, went after the women: "After a series of indignities, one lady was killed and thrown overboard, and the other was tossed overboard alive." Wilhelms was executed on Bedloe's Island on June 21, 1839. By then, the island had long been associated with buccaneers. According to some legends, Captain William Kidd, a famous New World pirate and an early resident of Manhattan, buried part of his lost treasure there.
New York's final public execution also took place on the island. Albert Hicks was an infamous killer, both the city's last pirate and its first gangster. He worked on whaling ships all over the world but lived on Cedar Street in Manhattan, lingering around the waterfront dives where the ships were so thick that their bowsprits came together to form a canopy above the East River docks. In March 1860, Hicks, a first mate on an oyster sloop, killed his entire crew in the lower bay, made off with money in a dinghy, landed on Staten Island and lighted out.
What followed was one of the most intense manhunts in city history. The trial became a sensation. More than 12,000 people gathered in ships in the harbor on July 13, 1860, to watch Hicks die.
From the gallows, he would see the upper bay, the lower bay and the red-brick front of the seaport, the entire theater of his crime. The execution became a carnival, a debauch, which is one of the reasons it was the last of its kind. Public executions, which had already been discontinued by the city—Hicks had been convicted of piracy, a federal crime—had become an embarrassment.
When the statue was dedicated on the same site just 26 years later, on Oct. 28, 1886, more than a million came out for a ceremony and New York's first-ever ticker-tape parade. That day, the statue stood for American greatness. Six years later, with the opening of the immigration inspection station on nearby Ellis Island—formerly Gibbet Island; pirates were hung there too—it also came to stand for human inflow and American promise. Annie Moore was the first of 12 million immigrants to land on Ellis Island, a 17-year-old from Ireland who had traveled in steerage.
But the life of America is short: Many of those alive to see the statue's dedication would have remembered the island's other history, and thus remembered a different kind of symbol. To them, the place would stand for the lawless old New York, a settlement on the edge of an unknown continent.
That was another city, from another time, New York as it had been when pirates anchored off 14th Street. That wild, freewheeling town had to make way for the modern metropolis. None of which changes the fact: When you are looking at the Statue of Liberty, you are seeing the site of the last gallows to claim an American pirate.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump provocatively injected himself into a simmering Democratic dispute Sunday, tweeting that a group of progressives quarreling with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi—all but one of whom were born in the U.S.—came from corrupt and broken countries and should "go back" to "fix" what he called the "totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."
The president's broadside against the lawmakers, all of whom are minorities, was condemned as racist by Democrats across the spectrum. Mr. Trump's tweets came amid deepening tensions between Mrs. Pelosi and a group of freshman progressive lawmakers seeking to push Democratic policy further to the left, a dispute that also was playing out on social media over the weekend.
Mr. Trump continued in his tweets that after fixing the places they come from, the congresswomen should "come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"
The four apparent targets of the president's tweet were Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. Ms. Omar, the only one born outside the U.S., came to the country as a child from Somalia. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is of Puerto Rican heritage, while Ms. Tlaib is Palestinian-American and Ms. Pressley is African-American.
Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.) called the tweets "xenophobic" and said they showed that Mr. Trump's goal was "making America white again."
Share Your Thoughts
How do you think members of both parties should respond to Trump's tweets at House Democrats? Join the conversation below.
Rep. Ruben Gallego (D., Ariz.) wrote on Twitter: "Growing up I used to hear 'go back to Mexico' from many kids, though I was born in the USA. I thought then that it was just kids." He added: "To people like Trump I will never be American enough."
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, for her part, tweeted: "Mr. President, the country I 'come from,' and the country we all swear to, is the United States…You are angry because you can't conceive of an America that includes us."
On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for defending the lawmakers he had targeted earlier in the day.
"So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion. Whenever confronted, they call their adversaries, including Nancy Pelosi, 'RACIST.'"
"If the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior," he wrote, "then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020!"
Republicans offered little reaction. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) declined to comment. The office of Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the GOP House leader, didn't respond to a request for comment.
When Mr. Trump used a vulgarity last year to describe some African nations sending immigrants to the U.S.— calling them "shithole countries" —a number of Republican senators objected.
Some Republicans, including Mr. McConnell, also pushed back when Mr. Trump, as a candidate, asserted that a federal judge's Hispanic heritage amounted to a conflict of interest in overseeing a fraud case against Trump University, given Mr. Trump's campaign stance against illegal immigration. Many others protested his 2017 assertion that "both sides" were to blame for a confrontation involving white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va.
Doug Heye, a Republican strategist, called Mr. Trump's tweets about the Democratic House members racist but said that GOP lawmakers would find it hard to comment on them, given the president's enormous popularity among Republicans.
"If you were a Republican member of Congress for 10 years and didn't speak out on 'birtherism,' are you going to speak out now?" Mr. Heye said. That is a reference to Mr. Trump's repeated claims, which he retracted months before the 2016 election , that former President Obama wasn't born in the U.S.
Immigrants and children of immigrants account for at least 13% of all voting members of Congress, according to Pew Research, up a percentage point from the prior Congress.
A White House spokesman declined to comment. But another White House official pointed out that the president recently was briefed on the deadly attacks in Kismayo, a port city in Somalia, where more than two dozen people were killed during a 12-hour attack on a hotel. Somalia is one of the Muslim-majority countries from which Mr. Trump tried to ban immigration. Ms. Omar arrived in the U.S. from Somalia in 1992 and became a citizen in 2000 at age 17.
Mr. Trump was wading into a dispute among House Democrats that has lasted for weeks, since the four liberal women, all freshmen, criticized their fellow Democrats for supporting an emergency funding bill to send $4.6 billion to the southern border. The measure passed, but liberal House Democrats said it didn't have the restrictions necessary to protect migrant children held in poor conditions. Ms. Omar at the time said her colleagues who voted for it had chosen "to keep kids in cages."

While the women have had little success in affecting actual legislation, they hold significant sway on social media and among party activists, and their ideas, such as canceling student-loan debt and combating climate change, have won support from some candidates in the Democratic presidential primary. But inside their own caucus, they have repeatedly clashed with the party's more moderate members, many of whom come from swing districts.
On Friday, enough Democrats joined with Republicans to block an amendment from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to a defense bill that would have banned the president from sending U.S. troops to the border. After it failed, members said on the floor that the result was in part because of how the freshman lawmaker had treated her colleagues, according to an aide and a Democratic lawmaker.
"There's a struggle with people who have power with sharing that power," Ms. Omar said on Saturday at a gathering of progressive activists called Netroots Nation, in Philadelphia. "We aren't in the business of asking for power, we're in the business of grabbing power."
For a day at least, the president's tweets served as a unifying focus for Democrats. On Twitter, Mrs. Pelosi wrote, "When @realDonaldTrump tells four American Congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again."
But they also have the potential to amplify divisions. Some Democratic lawmakers said the comments offered another reason to impeach the Republican president, an effort that Mrs. Pelosi has been trying to quell.
Race was already a flash point in the dispute between the liberal women and Mrs. Pelosi, which escalated last week in starkly personal terms.
After Mrs. Pelosi told the New York Times last week that the four had limited influence in Congress, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez responded by saying the speaker was persistently singling out "newly elected women of color." The comments from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez caused several black lawmakers to defend Mrs. Pelosi as a woman who had elevated them.
There has been no outreach from either Ms. Ocasio-Cortez or the House leadership in the past week to settle differences with the other side, a Democratic aide said.
Justice Democrats, a group co-founded by Saikat Chakrabarti, chief of staff to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, has already started to support primary challengers to incumbent Democrats, a move many lawmakers see as threatening.

Texto completo: John Noble Wilford knew that he was writing one of the most important stories of the century: The first human landing on another world. His article -- for the front page of The New York Times on July 21, 1969, needed to begin with a sentence that conveyed the immensity of the moment. And so, after the launch on July 16, but before the landing, he spent a sleepless night trying to come up with an opening sentence, known in the journalism business as a lede:
It is deceptively simple. It has heft. As he recalled in a recent interview: "That word, the 'moon.' It was the code word for inaccessible, unreachable."
This opening sentence, he said, put the amazing shift in humanity's perception of the moon into terms of everyday life that any reader could relate to: "Not only have we reached it, but we walked on it!"
We all walk. It is, literally, a pedestrian thing. But this is walking made glorious: "Landed. And walked. On the moon."
This is the story behind that story, which even today can wow a reader with the excitement of the moment: how it was reported and how Mr. Wilford -- a giant of science writing and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner -- turned a technically challenging human achievement into a narrative suffused with drama, felicitous language and even humor.
The lede -- the word is an artifact of the days of Linotype machines, and is used to distinguish the leading sentence of an article from the metal used in those days to form type -- was also un-Timesian, especially in 1969. Mr. Wilford had been hired away from Time magazine in 1965 to take on the space beat.
The editor who hired him, Harrison Salisbury, told him that The Times did not "want someone to write a science story or a flight story or an engineering story." He recalls Mr. Salisbury saying that the moon landing should be "a story of a big adventure."
Mr. Salisbury was part of a faction of editors who were looking to "put some life into The Times," Mr. Wilford recalled. But the newsroom was also still filled with "old-fashioned shirt-sleeve editors who went by the old book."
So Mr. Wilford was not just worried about the first eight words of the article. He was also concerned about whether the old guard would require him to come up with something more stuffy and clunky.
"I was deathly afraid they were going to want me to do some kind of old-fashioned, 'who what when and where' lede, and I did not want that," he said.
Another thing he did not want was "to have 'historic' in the lede," he said. "It's a lame way to say something is important."
Mr. Wilford called his editor at the time in New York, Henry Lieberman, to clear the way for the unconventional line, with its ring of authority, of history, of a new age in human activity. "I told him what I wanted to do and why, and I said, 'Do you think that's going to be all right?"'
He said Mr. Lieberman replied, "Well, I'll run that by the editors."
"I guess that he did, I never heard anymore," Mr. Wilford added. "I took nothing as a positive answer."
He then went on to the kind of stylistic flourishes he has always been known for, as in his segue into one of Neil Armstrong's immortal quotes:
Mr. Wilford reported on the launch in Florida, arriving days before with other Times reporters, all working in a rusty trailer that the newspaper maintained at the Kennedy Space Center press site.
He wrote three versions of the article that night for successive editions of The Times. By deadline of the first edition, the astronauts had landed but not exited the lunar module; by the third edition, two astronauts' boots had touched the gritty soil of the moon. There was no email; to get his article to New York, Mr. Wilford banged it out on a typewriter and then read each word over the phone, making small changes on the fly as he read, to the "recording room," where transcriptionists quickly typed up pages and passed them to editors.
But after writing up the launch in Florida, there was the problem of how to cover the transition of management of the spacecraft to mission control in Houston. For earlier launches, Mr. Wilford often ended up on a late-night flight. This launch was different. So the publisher of The Times, Arthur O. Sulzberger, "let us use his private jet." After meeting the newspaper's deadlines, they traveled speedily and in luxury to Houston.
In Houston, the setup for reporters was different, but Mr. Wilford still had his desk, his background materials and his yellow pad with notes about what to expect from the mission -- elements of the day-by-day flight plan that he could track as things went along.
His preparation for this reporting was extensive; he had even "flown" a simulator of the lunar lander to get a feel for what Armstrong was up against in piloting the spidery craft. Mr. Wilford repeatedly crashed the vehicle.
Mr. Wilford's storytelling switched back and forth in time between the landing and the moon walk, to a congratulatory phone call from President Richard M. Nixon, then back to the details of stepping down to the surface. Then he deftly transitioned to a stirring paean to exploration:
"I started using 'spacefaring' even before the lunar landing," Mr. Wilford said; he was drawn to the word's historical echoes. "Seafaring, spacefaring -- it's part of the same thrust."
The structure of the article was determined in part by an editorial requirement to get the details of the landing and first steps on the moon, and the call from Mr. Nixon, "before the jump" -- that is, within the part of the article that can be read on the front page. And he found space for flashes of dry humor, as well:
And the astronauts' banter:
At mission control's press area, Mr. Wilford wore earphones to hear the public affairs officer's commentary, and watched closed-circuit television to see what the spaceship's cameras were showing.
He kept his ears attuned to whenever anything fresh and amusing occurred, such as that exchange between Armstrong and Michael Collins.
"If you hear a particularly good quote, if you have anything that helps to give some narrative connection to events, you make a quick, scribbly note that no one but me could decipher," he said. "I didn't tape the air-to-ground, and you didn't usually get a transcript of air-to-ground until several hours later."
The most dramatic element of the landing -- the need to fly farther than planned to find a safer landing place -- was overshadowed at the time, Mr. Wilford recalled, by a series of alarms from the lander's computers that mission controllers safely disregarded. The search for a landing spot was described in detail at a briefing later in the evening, and he worked it into the article's chronology of events.
Throughout the piece, Mr. Wilford alternated between lyrical passages and those rich in scientific information and data, framed in ways that could grip the reader. These lines about Armstrong's heartbeat speak volumes:
Stephen J. Dubner, co-author of the "Freakonomics" book series, has called this "one of the most elegant little uses of data I can recall seeing in a news article," adding, "Someday I would like to write two sentences as good as those."
Mr. Dubner, join the crowd.
Near the end of the article, Mr. Wilford returned to Mr. Collins, still orbiting the moon as Mr. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were on the surface.
Mr. Wilford recalled that the return to Mr. Collins was an attempt to bring some balance to the distribution of glory, an act of empathy for a man as alone as any human has ever been.
"I still think of what Collins must have been thinking," he said. "He's up there in orbit. And Armstrong and Aldrin are landing on the moon, walking on the moon, and you think if something happens that they can't come back, he has no choice. He can't rescue them. He has to make the flight back on his own. That would have been the hardest thing in the world, I think."

Resumen: Power in New York City has been restored following an outage that left a large portion of Manhattan without electricity.

Texto completo: New York City tried to regain its footing Sunday after the restoration of power from a massive blackout late Saturday amid questions about how the outage happened.
Utility company Con Edison said in a statement that the last of the customers who lost electricity – more than 72,000 customers along 30 blocks from Times Square to the Upper West Side lost power – saw their power restored just before midnight after blackouts that began at 6:47 p. m. Saturday.
"Over the next several days and weeks, our engineers and planners will carefully examine the data and equipment performance relating to this event, and will share our findings with regulators and the public," the company said in a statement on Sunday.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who deployed New York state troopers during the outage, said Sunday that he was going to inspect the transformer that caused the power failure with Con Edison Chairman John McAvoy to figure out exactly what happened.
"We have to have a system that is designed to handle disruptions and rather than domino, we have a redundancy in this system so this doesn't happen," Cuomo said. "And that's what we're going to work on, and I want to see with my own Queens eyes the transformer that started it all. "
Mayor Bill de Blasio said police confirmed that there was no foul play involved and that the outage was caused by a "mechanical issue. "
De Blasio was campaigning for his presidential bid in Iowa when the power outage struck New York, and he returned to his city several hours into the outage. At a news conference Sunday, De Blasio defended himself against criticism for not being in New York when the blackout hit.
"As someone who travels, and I traveled before this campaign, you have to be in charge wherever you are," de Blasio said. "And again with email, with cellphones, I’m in regular touch with my folks confirming the situation’s being handled properly. "
New York City power outage: Here's what we know about the widespread blackout
Power restored: Partial New York City blackout leaves thousands without electricity
The outage, which came 42 years to the day after The Great Blackout of 1977 dimmed most of Manhattan, shut down Broadway shows and a Jennifer Lopez concert at Madison Square Garden, gridlocked streets as drivers tried to navigate without traffic lights and left stunned tourists and residents wandering darkened sidewalks.
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N. Y. , called for the Department of Energy's Office of Electricity to investigate how Con Edison maintains the city's power grid. Schumer said federal agencies will be able to apply what they learn from New York City's power outage on a national scale.
Jay Apt, professor and co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center, told USA TODAY there will always be some unreliability in the power system.
"Power outages are a factor of our life in the power system," Apt said. "There’s no way to make the power system completely invulnerable. "
Apt said some cities especially prone to longer power outages, for example those in hurricanes zones, decide to have power backup for services like ATMs. New York City officials need to decide whether services such as traffic lights, which failed in the outage Saturday, are essential to back up, Apt said.
"Every city has to make an assessment about whether emergency preparedness requires backup, and things aren’t perfect," Apt said.
Some Broadway casts and Carnegie Hall performers declared the show must go on. One Twitter user tweeted a video of the cast of Hamilton singing out the windows of the Richard Rodgers Theatre after the show was canceled.
Another user tweeted a video of an impromptu Carnegie Hall concert on the street for patrons after being evacuated from the concert hall.
Many New Yorkers out and about on the West Side of Manhattan got caught in the chaos. Karen Janowsky, a vendor selling rain gear at a street fair in Rockefeller Center, said her setup equipment was stolen while she went to her car to pack her ponchos. The power went out just before she got to the car.
“I was alone and I couldn’t get to everything, so they stole my stuff,” she said. “It was chaos, with fire engines and people packing the streets. When the lights went out, I was one minute from getting my car in the garage. ”
May Martinez, an Inwood resident, told The New York Times she got stuck on an A train. during the power outage.
"It was scary,” she said. “We were just wondering – are we going to sleep here?”

Texto completo: Health care was a hot topic at June’s Democratic debates. Several candidates jawboned about “Medicare for All” – government-funded coverage eliminating private insurance.
Many investors are nervous, fearing fallout for health care stocks. But it’s too early to fear (or cheer) this – or any policy proposals that flash-forward this year. Slow down.
Setting aside all political views, if Medicare for All passed, health insurance and hospital stocks likely would suffer. Possibly drug and medical device makers would, too, although they are more insulated. Even if legislation doesn’t pass, a heated debate could hurt sentiment, sparking volatility in these stocks. But you shouldn’t think that way.
Here is why:
Nothing changes fast
Health care loomed large in President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, but The Affordable Care Act didn’t pass until 2010 and took effect in 2013. Markets barely blinked either time. Health care reform campaign talk and tweets scared investors in 2016, also, but little changed. Any post-2020 changes will be similarly slow.
Stocks don’t really react to this kind of thing, even though we commonly think they do. First, markets pre-price widely known information. That means stocks typically reflect all opinions about policy changes long before they take effect – like in 2010. But then, if the new law actually was watered down from initial proposals, it would be a positive surprise, potentially boosting health care stocks. Second, markets move most on probabilities, not possibilities. We’re at least a year away from being able to assess the probability of Medicare for All happening.
Uncertain outcomes
For single-payer health care to become reality, the Democrats need comfortable margins in both chambers of Congress – plus a president supporting it. Will that happen? I haven’t a clue – no one does, really. Who knows who the Democrats will nominate. It's way too early.
Then, too, candidates often moderate their views during the general election and while in office. Early big ideas aim to win over the party base in primaries. California Sen. Kamala Harris moderated on Medicare for All the very day after her debate. If you believe any Democratic victor would govern as they talked at the debates, there is some great Arizona oceanfront property you may like.
Congress’ post-2020 makeup is similarly unknowable.
If you are worried about stocks: capitalize on the fear and make a fortune
We can use our money to create jobs: I'm a billionaire with a better idea than a wealth tax.
You shouldn’t start weighing any election’s outcome and market impact until the summer before the vote. We need presumptive nominees and relatively defined, state-specific, head-to-head details. We need a clearer sense of how the economy will look. And will Democrats choose an appealing campaign strategy for Midwesterners who swung 2016 to President Donald Trump?
This logic extends to all big policy promises flying around, including tech company breakups, student loan debt cancellation, new taxes or whatever. The chatter can spiral anywhere now, making today’s big issues distant memories in 2021.
So don’t overthink them. While rising election uncertainty may slow U. S. stocks’ gains, the bull market grinds upward despite campaign promises.

Racially charged infighting escalates among House Democrats

Texto completo: An all-out racially charged fight within the House Democratic Caucus escalated Saturday when an African American freshman lawmaker said the party doesn't need "any more black voices that don't want to be a black voice."
Rep. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) made those comments during a speech at the liberal Netroots Nation conference where she, Rep. Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) appeared after a week-long clash with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and her allies.
The feud started last month, when the three freshman women of color and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) criticized Democrats who supported an emergency funding bill to send more money to the border. The measure passed, but liberal House Democrats said the bill didn't do enough to protect migrant children held in federal detention centers amid reports of poor conditions.
Omar said a vote for it amounted to a vote "to keep kids in cages."
In response, Pelosi tried to downplay the quartet's influence in an interview with the New York Times. "All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," she told columnist Maureen Dowd. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people, and that's how many votes they got."
Ocasio-Cortez then accused the Speaker of "singling out" the four women of color, calling it "outright disrespectful."
Things escalated further Friday night when the official Twitter account for the House Democratic Caucus highlighted a tweet Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, wrote June 27 criticizing Rep. Sharice Davids (Kan.), one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, for supporting the border bill.
"I don't think people have to be personally racist to enable a racist system," Chakrabarti wrote. "And the same could even be said of the Southern Democrats. I don't believe Sharice is a racist person, but her voters are showing her to enable a racist system."
The House Democratic Caucus shared that two-week-old tweet on Friday night and offered its own commentary.
"Who is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color? Her name is Congresswoman Davids, not Sharice. She is a phenomenal new member who flipped a red seat blue. Keep Her Name Out Of Your Mouth," the @HouseDemocrats account tweeted.
Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, retweeted it.
Earlier in the week, Pelosi scolded her members in a closed-door meeting, telling them not to tweet their grievances and instead to come to her if they have a problem. Pelosi's hold on her speakership runs through moderate districts such as Davids's, and Republicans will fight hard to win back those seats in 2020.
The speaker has beat back demands from liberals on everything from Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal to impeachment, warning that creating friction is not going to help Democrats beat President Trump and keep their House majority.
Hammill defended his retweet, saying he wasn't defying Pelosi's wishes because the speaker had been referring to public attacks on Democratic lawmakers, and this was about taking a fellow staffer to task. He said he retweeted the post from the House Democrats defending Davids, who is a lesbian, "in my personal capacity as a gay man who was bullied and beaten in high school."
Ocasio-Cortez famously beat high-ranking Democrat and Pelosi's heir apparent, Joseph Crowley, in a stunning Democratic primary upset in 2018 and has said she'd use her considerable star power to help others do the same. She has suggested Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), who chairs the House Democratic Caucus that went after her chief of staff, as a target.
Rahm Emanuel, formerly the chief of staff for President Barack Obama, chastised Chakrabarti in a follow-up column by Dowd on Saturday, calling him a "snot-nosed punk."
"What votes did you get?" Emanuel asked rhetorically. "You really think weakening the speaker is the right strategy to try to get rid of Donald Trump and everything he stands for?"
At the Netroots Nation conference, some of Ocasio-Cortez's core supporters were asked to weigh in on their fight with Pelosi and moderate Democrats.
"They're more than four votes. For millions of us, these women of color in Congress represent generations of blood, sweat and tears; of struggle for us to have representation," said Netroots moderator Aimee Allison. "They represent the best of American democracy. And yet, if you read the news, they've faced attacks all year from the right wing and from Democratic leadership."
Pressley said she didn't want to discuss "palace intrigue" but also said she's not interested in bringing "a chair to an old table."
"This is the time to shake that table. . . . We don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice," Pressley said, seemingly taking a stab at the Congressional Black Caucus, which is allied with Pelosi.
Pressley denied she was targeting those black leaders. Her spokeswoman, Lina Francis, said afterward that Pressley was trying to make the point that "diversity at the table doesn't matter if there's not real diversity in policy."
Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez have appeared at previous Netroots conferences, but neither attended this year.

After a vigil, Boston immigration advocates come together to plan

Texto completo: Hours after they attended a vigil to draw attention to migrants being housed in unsanitary camps at the US-Mexican border, immigration advocates and activists filled a sunlit Cathedral of Saint Paul in Boston on Saturday to strategize about how best to help the local immigrant community.
The diverse crowd learned about a range of national and state issues, including temporary protected status, or TPS, of immigrants to bills pending in the state Legislature, during the session organized by Boston Lights for Liberty, an advocacy group.
In small group settings, people learned how to organize demonstrations and other community actions to help immigrants cope with unyielding fear and grief about the prospect of seeing loved ones deported in raids scheduled to be carried out by federal authorities Sunday in 10 US cities.
“This is for after you light the candle," said Leah Bloom, an organizer with Boston Lights for Liberty.
Although Boston is not on the list of cities where raids are expected to be carried out, the fear of ICE raids has alarmed the immigrant communities of Massachusetts, with some choosing not to go to work and even refusing to go to the grocery store, the Globe reported Saturday.
The operation is expected to take place over multiple days in at least 10 major cities, according to The New York Times, which first reported the planned raids.
On Saturday, some shared their stories on immigrating to the United States from troubled homelands.
“I've had the opportunity to work, to drive, to live my American dream, said Doris Landaverde, a Salvadoran immigrant who arrived in 2000 and has TPS, which allows her to work and live in the United States.
In her nearly 20 years in the United States, Landaverde managed to save up enough money to buy her mother a house in their homeland, she got married, she had three daughters — who are all American citizens by birthright, and are underage. In other words, she built a life.
But when President Trump announced the end of TPS for Salvadorans in 2018, Landaverde feared for the worst, so she resolved to tell her story.
“That was a very hard process," she said in Spanish, detailing how she even went back to school to improve her English so she could “bring my story to the American community because they need to know what's happening to us."
“They need to know we're good people who come here to work, to build a family, a better future," she said. “We're not the people this government is saying — criminals."
Other speakers tried to reassure undocumented workers fearing deportation.
“Even if you're undocumented, you still have rights," said Natalícia Tracy, executive director of the Brazilian Worker Center.
Massachusetts has the second largest Brazilian population after Florida, according to a 2017 report from the Boston Planning and Development Agency, and a lot of them come from mixed-status families, Tracy said, meaning at least one member might be undocumented.
“That causes horrible fear that someone is going to get deported, family separation," she said.
“Children are afraid that their mother [or] father is going to get picked up by ICE."
Tracy, who has lived in the United States for the past 28 years, said there were a few years where she, too, was undocumented.
Having first arrived to work as a nanny, Tracy found herself in an untenable situation, making $25 a week for 90 hours of work, she said. The family let her paperwork expire, she said, and didn't inform her. But to Tracy, that she was unaware of her undocumented status is an example of how immigration in the United States has changed over the years.
“It was not the same as it is now," she said, later adding that “people were just people."
“We always have to deal with race in the US," Tracy said. “People always question where you're from and when you're going back, but they didn't treat you like you're a criminal."

REVIEW --- It's No Longer a 'Mad' World --- 'What, Me Irrelevant?' The magazine is ending, but its comic spirit lives on.

Texto completo: In the sixth grade, I received my first-ever bad report card, from Mr. Brown, who also had been my fourth-grade teacher. My mom and dad usually came home from parent-teacher conferences with glowing accounts; I had always been something of a teacher's pet, eager to please. But this time, the vibe was different. With solemn, shaming faces, they sat me down for a talk. What had happened? According to Mr. Brown, I'd gone from being a model boy to . . . a "smart aleck."
I swore I would do better, but I knew the truth: What had happened was Mad magazine, and there would be no turning back.
This was 1969, in Northern California. A few years later, I read an interview with an editor of the National Lampoon who said that Mad had saved his childhood. It saved mine too, I realized. Some kids had rock 'n' roll or rap or "Star Trek" or skateboard culture or Tolkien or, God help them, Ayn Rand. I had a magazine full of parodies, provocations and cartoons in which people burped and picked their noses.
That might not sound like much, but for me, it was a revelation, a transmission from some exotic, faraway place -- New York, as it happened -- that I instantly tuned into. It gave license to my unruliest impulses, freed my inner skeptic, validated my sneaking suspicions that I wasn't always getting the whole truth and nothing but the truth from grown-ups. Plus it made me laugh, which was most important of all.
Gratitude toward Mad is commonplace among smart alecks, professional and civilian alike, voiced over the years by notables such as Stephen Colbert, Judd Apatow, J.J. Abrams, Jerry Seinfeld, Roger Ebert, Mark Hamill and "Weird Al" Yankovic. Which is why the news last week confirming that Mad's parent company, DC Entertainment, was effectively shuttering it broke so many normally non-sentimental hearts. Though the magazine has gone through cycles of creative doldrums, just last year it was rebooted -- successfully, to my mind. Now it will only repackage its old material, sort of like the sad, vestigial Life. Blame not just DC but parent-parent company Time Warner and, perhaps especially, new parent-parent-parent company since last year, AT&T. (The fact that a vast telecommunications company is now the steward of a nose-thumbing children's humor magazine is a bizarre feature of the 21st-century economy worth a snarky line in Mad.)
Mad was ostensibly silly kid stuff, but it was silly kid stuff with a purpose -- a subversive counterpart to the "Fun with a Purpose" slogan of Highlights, on the far opposite end of the children's publishing spectrum. Mad launched in 1952 as a comic book, mostly spoofing other comics: "Superduperman," "Mickey Rodent," "Starchie." But when it adopted a magazine format in 1955, its palette and range of targets expanded. Advertising parodies, often quite dark, laid bare the era's Madison Avenue manipulations -- notably those in service of the cigarette industry and its contributions to American lifespans. ("Winsom tasted good as a cigarette should've," read a word balloon coming from a tombstone in a spoof of a 1960s Winston campaign.) Movie and TV parodies vivisected Hollywood cliches and mythmaking. Features like 1969's obscenely prescient "If the President Were Chosen Like 'Miss America'" undercut political pieties. "Spy vs. Spy," a regular cartoon created by a Cuban refugee, Antonio Prohias, reduced Cold War tensions to a cynical but slapstick essence: two secret agents, essentially interchangeable, one or the other of whom would end each encounter blown up, dismembered or otherwise clobbered, typically having outsmarted himself -- a running joke nearly as loaded in an era of nuclear anxiety and fallout drills as "Dr. Strangelove."
No alleged heroes or role models were spared in Mad's pages: businesspeople, religious leaders, newscasters, athletes, teachers, even parents possibly very much like one's own. The magazine ran less pointed features, like Don Martin's cartoons, with their cross-eyed, triple-jointed characters, outre sound effects -- FLIBADIB! THWIZZIT! -- and campfire-skit sense of humor. It made room for Dave Berg's "The Lighter Side of . . . ." feature, which turned a gently ironic eye on suburban civilization and its mild-mannered discontents. But even these had a way of poking instructive holes in every day rituals and civilities.
Mad wasn't born in a vacuum. Its sensibility owed something to Looney Tunes, the Marx Brothers, the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby "Road" movies, Krazy Kat and probably a lot of forgotten vaudeville acts. But if you were an American kid growing up in the 1950s or '60s or early '70s, when the nation's dominant culture remained largely conformist, when the world was still presented to many children as a mostly fair, just and sane place, and when not much if any satire would filter down to your level -- unless maybe you were lucky enough to come across a Stan Freberg or Tom Lehrer album or had parents who let you watch "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" -- discovering Mad, to use a 1990s reference, was like choosing the red pill in "The Matrix" and opening your eyes to hidden realities.
I still have the first issue I ever bought, in June 1968. The cover advertised a "Bonnie and Clyde" spoof, with the magazine's gap-toothed mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, alongside an aghast Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Inside, there was also a portfolio of mocked-up pictures of famous people wearing what were then referred to as "protest buttons." One showed Robert and Ethel Kennedy. The senator and presidential candidate was wearing a button with the Playboy rabbit logo, his wife one that read, "Pills, Please." I asked my mother to explain. I wish I could remember her likely awkward answer. All I knew was I had entered a classroom far more interesting than Mr. Brown's.
Social media last week was full of tributes to Mad's mind-altering power. One of my favorites was a tweet by the novelist John Colapinto: "I was 5. Leaving our corner store with my mom I saw a copy of MAD in a rack. Alfred E. Neuman grinning. 'What's that?' 'That's not for nice boys,' she said. Life changing moment." The 71-year-old cartoonist Art Spiegelman, who created the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic memoir Maus, put it this way to the New York Times: "Mad was, 'The entire adult world is lying to you, and we are part of the adult world. Good luck to you.' I think that shaped my entire generation."
Mine as well. In a way, that is a cause of Mad's downfall. It probably isn't a coincidence that the magazine's circulation peaked at 2.3 million in 1973, the year the Watergate scandal bloomed. (Its circulation is now below 150,000.) Mad did well with both Vietnam and Watergate. A 1968 "Great Moments in Politics" page doctored a famous photo of President Lyndon Johnson showing his appendicitis scar and substituted a map of Vietnam, while a 1974 cover featured President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew as the con men in "The Sting."
But at some point, even kids didn't need Mad to tell them that politicians play fast and loose with truth. As baby boomers and Gen Xers raised on Mad took the reins of American comedy, you could increasingly find its sensibility elsewhere, or everywhere: "Saturday Night Live," David Letterman and the subsequent profusion of late-night comedy shows, "The Simpsons," "Family Guy," "30 Rock," "Key & Peele," "Inside Amy Schumer," "Captain Underpants," "SpongeBob SquarePants." Put another way, Mad won the culture wars; nice boys lost.
So yes, let's mourn Mad, but let's not be so sentimental as to pretend its passing leaves a huge void in the culture; rather, you can't avoid its fingerprints.
Nor had the thing itself lost all relevance: Last fall, the magazine published one of its sharpest satires, taking off from Edward Gorey's morbid 1963 alphabet book, "The Gashlycrumb Tinies," which begins "A is for Amy who fell down the stairs." Mad parodied that as "The Ghastlygun Tinies," updated for our era of school shootings, with such entries as "T is for Tina who's texting her mom." As dark and cutting as that is, I hope that kids who have gone through lockdown drills -- perhaps this generation's equivalent of fallout drills -- have seen it, shared the bleak but bracing laugh that it's meant to bring, and passed it around.

Texto completo: PHOTO: Zohar Lazar
In the sixth grade, I received my first-ever bad report card, from Mr. Brown, who also had been my fourth-grade teacher. My mom and dad usually came home from parent-teacher conferences with glowing accounts; I had always been something of a teacher's pet, eager to please. But this time, the vibe was different. With solemn, shaming faces, they sat me down for a talk. What had happened? According to Mr. Brown, I'd gone from being a model boy to…a "smart aleck."
I swore I would do better, but I knew the truth: What had happened was Mad magazine, and there would be no turning back.
This was 1969, in Northern California. A few years later, I read an interview with an editor of the National Lampoon who said that Mad had saved his childhood. It saved mine too, I realized. Some kids had rock 'n' roll or rap or "Star Trek" or skateboard culture or Tolkien or, God help them, Ayn Rand. I had a magazine full of parodies, provocations and cartoons in which people burped and picked their noses.
That might not sound like much, but for me, it was a revelation, a transmission from some exotic, faraway place—New York, as it happened—that I instantly tuned into. It gave license to my unruliest impulses, freed my inner skeptic, validated my sneaking suspicions that I wasn't always getting the whole truth and nothing but the truth from grown-ups. Plus it made me laugh, which was most important of all.
Gratitude toward Mad is commonplace among smart alecks, professional and civilian alike, voiced over the years by notables such as Stephen Colbert, Judd Apatow, J.J. Abrams, Jerry Seinfeld, Roger Ebert, Mark Hamill and "Weird Al" Yankovic. Which is why the news last week confirming that Mad's parent company, DC Entertainment, was effectively shuttering it broke so many normally non-sentimental hearts. Though the magazine has gone through cycles of creative doldrums, just last year it was rebooted—successfully, to my mind. Now it will only repackage its old material, sort of like the sad, vestigial Life. Blame not just DC but parent-parent company Time Warner and, perhaps especially, new parent-parent-parent company since last year, AT&T. (The fact that a vast telecommunications company is now the steward of a nose-thumbing children's humor magazine is a bizarre feature of the 21st-century economy worth a snarky line in Mad.)
Mad was ostensibly silly kid stuff, but it was silly kid stuff with a purpose—a subversive counterpart to the "Fun with a Purpose" slogan of Highlights, on the far opposite end of the children's publishing spectrum. Mad launched in 1952 as a comic book, mostly spoofing other comics: "Superduperman," "Mickey Rodent," "Starchie." But when it adopted a magazine format in 1955, its palette and range of targets expanded. Advertising parodies, often quite dark, laid bare the era's Madison Avenue manipulations—notably those in service of the cigarette industry and its contributions to American lifespans. ("Winsom tasted good as a cigarette should've," read a word balloon coming from a tombstone in a spoof of a 1960s Winston campaign.)
Movie and TV parodies vivisected Hollywood clichés and mythmaking. Features like 1969's obscenely prescient "If the President Were Chosen Like 'Miss America'" undercut political pieties. "Spy vs. Spy," a regular cartoon created by a Cuban refugee, Antonio Prohias, reduced Cold War tensions to a cynical but slapstick essence: two secret agents, essentially interchangeable, one or the other of whom would end each encounter blown up, dismembered or otherwise clobbered, typically having outsmarted himself—a running joke nearly as loaded in an era of nuclear anxiety and fallout drills as "Dr. Strangelove."
No alleged heroes or role models were spared in Mad's pages: businesspeople, religious leaders, newscasters, athletes, teachers, even parents possibly very much like one's own. The magazine ran less pointed features, like Don Martin's cartoons, with their cross-eyed, triple-jointed characters, outré sound effects—FLIBADIB! THWIZZIT!—and campfire-skit sense of humor. It made room for Dave Berg's "The Lighter Side of…." feature, which turned a gently ironic eye on suburban civilization and its mild-mannered discontents. But even these had a way of poking instructive holes in every day rituals and civilities.
Mad wasn't born in a vacuum. Its sensibility owed something to Looney Tunes, the Marx Brothers, the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby "Road" movies, Krazy Kat and probably a lot of forgotten vaudeville acts. But if you were an American kid growing up in the 1950s or '60s or early '70s, when the nation's dominant culture remained largely conformist, when the world was still presented to many children as a mostly fair, just and sane place, and when not much if any satire would filter down to your level—unless maybe you were lucky enough to come across a Stan Freberg or Tom Lehrer album or had parents who let you watch "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"—discovering Mad, to use a 1990s reference, was like choosing the red pill in "The Matrix" and opening your eyes to hidden realities.
I still have the first issue I ever bought, in June 1968. The cover advertised a "Bonnie and Clyde" spoof, with the magazine's gap-toothed mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, alongside an aghast Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Inside, there was also a portfolio of mocked-up pictures of famous people wearing what were then referred to as "protest buttons." One showed Robert and Ethel Kennedy. The senator and presidential candidate was wearing a button with the Playboy rabbit logo, his wife one that read, "Pills, Please." I asked my mother to explain. I wish I could remember her likely awkward answer. All I knew was I had entered a classroom far more interesting than Mr. Brown's.
Social media last week was full of tributes to Mad's mind-altering power. One of my favorites was a tweet by the novelist John Colapinto: "I was 5. Leaving our corner store with my mom I saw a copy of MAD in a rack. Alfred E. Neuman grinning. 'What's that?' 'That's not for nice boys,' she said. Life changing moment." The 71-year-old cartoonist Art Spiegelman, who created the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic memoir Maus, put it this way to the New York Times: "Mad was, 'The entire adult world is lying to you, and we are part of the adult world. Good luck to you.' I think that shaped my entire generation."
Mine as well. In a way, that is a cause of Mad's downfall. It probably isn't a coincidence that the magazine's circulation peaked at 2.3 million in 1973, the year the Watergate scandal bloomed. (Its circulation is now below 150,000.) Mad did well with both Vietnam and Watergate. A 1968 "Great Moments in Politics" page doctored a famous photo of President Lyndon Johnson showing his appendicitis scar and substituted a map of Vietnam, while a 1974 cover featured President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew as the con men in "The Sting."

But at some point, even kids didn't need Mad to tell them that politicians play fast and loose with truth. As baby boomers and Gen Xers raised on Mad took the reins of American comedy, you could increasingly find its sensibility elsewhere, or everywhere: "Saturday Night Live," David Letterman and the subsequent profusion of late-night comedy shows, "The Simpsons," "Family Guy," "30 Rock," "Key & Peele," "Inside Amy Schumer," "Captain Underpants," "SpongeBob SquarePants." Put another way, Mad won the culture wars; nice boys lost.
So yes, let's mourn Mad, but let's not be so sentimental as to pretend its passing leaves a huge void in the culture; rather, you can't avoid its fingerprints.
Nor had the thing itself lost all relevance: Last fall, the magazine published one of its sharpest satires, taking off from Edward Gorey's morbid 1963 alphabet book, "The Gashlycrumb Tinies," which begins "A is for Amy who fell down the stairs."

French bosses on trial after 35 worker suicides

Texto completo: PARIS - In their blue blazers and tight haircuts, the aging men look uncomfortable in the courtroom dock. And for good reason: They are accused of harassing employees so relentlessly that workers ended up killing themselves.
The men, all former top executives at France's giant telecom company, wanted to downsize the business by thousands of workers a decade ago. But they couldn't fire most of them. The workers were state employees - employees for life - and therefore protected.
So the executives resolved to make life so unbearable that the workers would leave, prosecutors say. Instead, at least 35 employees - workers' advocates say nearly double that number - committed suicide, feeling trapped, betrayed and despairing of ever finding new work in France's immobile labor market.
Today the former top executives of France Telecom - once the national phone company, and now one of the nation's biggest private enterprises, Orange - are on trial for "moral harassment." It is the first time that French bosses, caught in the vise of France's strict labor protections, have been prosecuted for systemic harassment that led to worker deaths.
The trial has riveted a country deeply conflicted about capitalism and corporate culture, and may help answer a question that haunts the French as they fitfully modernize their economy: How far can a company go to streamline, shed debt and make money?
If convicted, the ex-executives face a year in jail and a $16,800 fine. But even before the trial wraps up Friday, with a verdict sometime later, it has become a landmark in the country's often hostile relations between labor and management.
As President Emmanuel Macron has sought to make France more business friendly, he has run into a buzz saw of strikes and faced a revolt among yellow vest protesters who accuse him of being the president of the rich.
While many workers complain they struggle to make ends meet, employers say a system of generous social benefits and worker protections makes hiring onerous and stifles job creation.
The trial has become a searing demonstration of those lingering tensions.
France Telecom was caught flat-footed by the digital revolution, as fixed-line subscribers dropped away by the thousands. The state ordered the company to go private in 2003, and by 2005, it was more than $50 million in debt.
Company executives thought they needed to get rid of 22,000 workers out of 130,000 - a necessity contested by the prosecution - to ensure survival.
"They were stuck, cornered," said Michel Ledoux, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers. "The only possibility was to make them leave, one way or another."
Weeks of wrenching testimony about despairing employees who hanged themselves, immolated themselves, or threw themselves out of windows, under trains, and off bridges and highway overpasses, have suggested that the former executives went very far in "pushing the company into the new century," as corporate strategy dictated.
The executives include Didier Lombard, the former chief executive officer; Louis-Pierre Wenes, his No. 2; Olivier Barberot, the former head of human resources; and four others.
A grim universe of underemployment, marginalization, miscasting and systematic harassment was established at the huge company, according to testimony at the trial.
The executives "sought the destabilization of the workers," prosecutor Francoise Benezech said in her summing up last Friday.
"People who had worked outside their whole career were suddenly put in front of a computer," Frédérique Guillon, a worker advocate who testified at the trial, said in an interview. "There were people whose work was simply taken away from them."
Among those victims, the youngest was Nicolas Grenouville, 28, who was wearing a company T-shirt when he put an internet cable around his neck and hanged himself in a garage, Ledoux told the court this week.

'New Jim Crow' discussion to explore race and the criminal justice system

Texto completo: After Michelle Alexander served as director of the Racial Justice Project for the ACLU of Northern California, she saw the criminal justice system in the United States, not as another institution merely affected by racial bias, but, in her words, "a different beast entirely."
The Palm Beach County Criminal Justice Commission and the Palm Beach County Library System are hosting a book discussion that is free and open to the public on Wednesday, July 24 from 6:30 to 8 p.m. to discuss Alexander's book, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness at the Lantana Road Branch of the Palm Beach County Library System, 4020 Lantana Road, in Lake Worth.
"I came to see that mass incarceration in the United States had, in fact, emerged as a stunningly comprehensive and well-disguised system of racialized social control that functions in a manner strikingly similar to Jim Crow," Alexander wrote in the book. The term "Jim Crow," refers to laws that upheld and enforced racial segregation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through 1965, mostly in southern, former Confederate states.
The book is available from the county library and can be reserved online or picked up at a local branch. Discussions will involve the public and a panel facilitated by the Criminal Justice Commission.
The event is open to anyone but is geared toward "people who are curious about criminal justice and those who already have opinions on the system," according to a statement from the Criminal Justice Commission.
This New York Times best seller is an account of "the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in millions of African-Americans being locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status," according to the author.
This program is part of the county library's series, Informed and Engaged: Criminal Justice, from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's Safety and Justice Challenge. The programs "provide special insight into criminal justice using books, movies and statistical analysis to help participants understand the many intricate nuances of criminal justice," according to the foundation.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Jeffrey Epstein, the financier facing sex-trafficking charges in New York, has been described by prosecutors as a man of enormous wealth: He owns a $ 77 million mansion on the Upper East Side, a $ 12 million estate in Palm Beach, Fla., a private island in the Caribbean and a private jet.
And on Thursday, Mr. Epstein, 66, asked a federal judge to allow him to use some of his wealth to stay out of jail while he awaits trial, filing a detailed bail proposal with the court.
Mr. Epstein asked the judge to release him on a substantial bond and pledged to put up his palatial Manhattan mansion and his private jet as collateral. He also proposed he be allowed to remain under house arrest in the mansion, and said he would agree to electronic monitoring of his location. He said he would surrender his passport and ground his jet.
In addition, his lawyers proposed that Mr. Epstein would hire private round-the-clock security guards who would "virtually guarantee" that he would not flee and would show up for court. They argued that he had lived a law-abiding life for the past 14 years.
A handful of superrich defendants have sought and occasionally obtained, over sharp objections from the government, similar bail provisions that allow them to finance a kind of personal jail rather than being held in a government lockup.
Such bail packages have prompted intense debate about their fairness. The judge in Mr. Epstein's case, Richard M. Berman, rejected a similar proposal in 2016 from a Turkish-Iranian gold trader in a money laundering case.
At the time, Judge Berman wrote that the proposal was "unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy."
Prosecutors said on Monday after the charges were announced that they would seek to have Mr. Epstein held in jail until his trial. They said in court that he posed "an extraordinary risk of flight and danger," and that he had "nearly infinite means" and "tremendous incentives to use those means to flee prosecution."
Judge Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan is scheduled to take up Mr. Epstein's bail proposal at a hearing on Monday.
Later Thursday, Mr. Epstein's lawyers asked the judge that any disclosures about Mr. Epstein's finances be kept secret under court seal. The New York Times has reported that his image as a math whiz who used his formidable skills to build a fortune may be exaggerated.
Mr. Epstein was arrested Saturday aboard a private jet at Teterboro Airport after arriving from Paris. He has been detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a high-security facility in Lower Manhattan where accused terrorists, mobsters and, most recently, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, have awaited trial.
If convicted, Mr. Epstein faces up to 45 years in prison on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. In the indictment unsealed on Monday, the office of Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said that between 2002 and 2005, Mr. Epstein recruited dozens of underage girls to engage in sex acts with him, after which he paid them hundreds of dollars in cash.
The indictment also accused Mr. Epstein of encouraging some of his victims to recruit other underage girls that he could then abuse, and paying his "victim-recruiters" hundreds of dollars for each girl that they brought to him. "In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit," the indictment said.
In the bail memorandum, Mr. Epstein's lawyers made it clear their client would fight the charges and gave a preview of what his defense might be. They argued that even though the government may have witnesses -- some younger than 18 at the time -- who said Mr. Epstein had paid them for sexual massages, prosecutors could not prove he had committed the federal crime of sex trafficking. They contended that Mr. Epstein should have been prosecuted in New York State court.
"There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr. Epstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody," the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, Marc Fernich and Martin G. Weinberg, wrote. "No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct, but it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses."
Mr. Epstein's team also argued an agreement that Mr. Epstein had reached with federal and state prosecutors in Florida more than a decade ago covered the crimes charged in the new indictment, even allegations that he sexually abused a minor in his Manhattan residence.
In Florida, the then-United States attorney in Miami, R. Alexander Acosta, agreed not to prosecute Mr. Epstein on federal sex trafficking charges if he pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges and registered as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein served 13 months in jail, but was allowed to leave six days a week, 12 hours each day, to work.
The lawyers said Mr. Epstein understood that agreement to be "a global resolution of any charges arising from the alleged conduct at issue here, including conduct in New York."
The lawyers accused federal officials in Florida of trying to circumvent that plea agreement by encouraging Mr. Epstein's victims to pursue prosecutions in other districts, including New York.
Mr. Berman said on Monday that his office was not bound by the promises prosecutors in Florida had made. The indictment unveiled on Monday mentions three victims without naming them -- one underaged woman who was abused at Mr. Epstein's mansion in Manhattan and two at his house in Palm Beach. It remains unclear if those victims were among the women involved in the 2008 Florida case.
Mr. Epstein's lawyers cited other cases in which federal judges had granted similar home detention with privately paid security guards. In one, Judge Jed S. Rakoff allowed a Manhattan lawyer charged in a fraud scheme to remain in his East Side apartment with electronic monitoring and armed security guards, paid for by his family.
Judge Rakoff acknowledged concerns that such an agreement gave people of means "an opportunity for release that poorer people could never obtain." But, he added, "it is not a reason to deny a constitutional right to someone who, for whatever reason, can provide reasonable assurances against flight."
Mr. Epstein's lawyers noted the objections Judge Berman had expressed in denying house arrest for the Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab. They argued that Mr. Epstein, as a United States citizen whose assets were mostly in the country, was a different case.
"This court's opinion in Zarrab stands only for the proposition that wealthy defendants should not be provided an unfair advantage," they wrote. "It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants should bear a special disadvantage."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Citlali Fabián's timeless portraits of her female friends and family members in Oaxaca explore the complexities of indigenous identity amid the effects of colonialism and racism in Mexico. She works slowly and collaboratively, discussing with the women how best to convey their feelings about their roots, while striving to avoid the visual clichés that are often associated with the region.
"Oaxaca is a visually rich place full of culture and folklore and many photographers come year after year to take photos of celebrations like the Day of the Dead," Ms. Fabián said. "I think the main difference is they just came to take photos like a hunter -- to just catch whatever crosses their lenses. I honestly find it rude."
Her powerful photos, made on glass with the 19th-century ambrotype process, are on display at the Bronx Documentary Center's second annual Latin American Foto Festival, from July 11 to 21. Some of the exhibits will be on the Melrose neighborhood streets where Spanish is often spoken by immigrants and their children, said Cynthia Rivera, who curated the festival with Michael Kamber, the founder of the Center.
"Our neighborhood is predominantly people from all different parts of Latin America," Ms. Rivera said, "and we are bringing photographers and photographs from these countries so people can easily see work from the places they are from, and those from outside the community can understand these stories."
The festival features 10 photographers from eight Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Many of the workshops, tours, and panel discussions will be conducted in Spanish.
Most of the artists are working on intimate stories about social issues using innovative visual approaches that stretch the boundaries of traditional documentary photography.
The Colombian photographer Andrés Cardona was orphaned as a young child when both of his parents were murdered by death squads. Two of Yael Martínez's brother-in-laws, Ignacio and David, disappeared in Iguala in southern Mexico, the same town where 43 students were kidnapped and disappeared in 2014. A third brother-in-law, Beto, died in what the authorities said was a jailhouse suicide.
"Surrounded by violence, poverty and the corruption of governments and institutions, we are trying to raise our voices and talk about the issues we are dealing with as communities and how we see life and how we want to represent life," Mr. Martínez said.
His poetic images are more about feelings than facts, and through them we experience his family's anguish as well as the love that binds them. Mr. Martínez strove to show his "fears, dreams and nightmares" in his project, he said, and a "straight documentary approach was not the best way to do that." Throughout his work he has used strategies that are as much of the art world as traditional documentary, including combining his photographs with drawings by his brother Orlando Velázquez.
In his story about the loss of his parents, Mr. Cardona mixes his own visceral photographs with family snapshots, and also recreates scenes including the discovery of the bodies of his father and uncle.
Mysterious images of Afro-Ecuadorian women by Johis Alarcón exemplify how many Latin-American photographers are finding ways to express inner emotional and spiritual lives that are not easily visualized.
When Fabiola Ferrero's parents fled their homes in Caracas, Venezuela, to live in safety in Colombia, she chose to stay to document the pervasive violence, inflation and food and medicine shortages for international publications like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.
In her personal project, "Blurred in Despair" Ms. Ferrero focused instead on the emotional toll of the ongoing crisis.
"There are a lot of images of Venezuela that portray what is going on and that's great, but I wanted to complement them by exploring how these events are affecting us as human beings," she said. "I want to leave a record for future generations of how this trauma is changing us as a society."
Ms. Ferrero created metaphoric images to represent the mental state of Venezuelans and turned to pairing photos to create a more visceral experience. In successful diptychs, she said, the images talk to each other, "making a smaller narrative within a bigger narrative."
These photographers live in countries with vastly different cultures but with a shared language and similar histories of Spanish colonialism and American influence. Their work in the festival suggests that many of them are exploring less conventional methods to create more nuanced views of their countries.
They are, Ms. Ferrero said, trying to find a way "to create a voice on our own instead of adopting the voices and narratives that we've seen in the media."
"What's happening today with Latin American photography will shape how we all will see the world in the next few decades -- and this is a good thing," she said.

ONLY IN THE AJC STUDENT WORK PERMITS: Foreign students get lesson in U.S. red tape: As wait grows for work permits, officials cite backlog of applications.

Texto completo: There's much to learn for international students, like Amanda Obando and Güldehan Durman, when they arrive in Atlanta for college.
The traffic. The slang. And recently for many of them, they're learning about government red tape.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has been slow in approving work permits to foreign-born students like the two recent Emory University graduates that are required primarily for internships in science, technology, engineering and math and other work opportunities. Many students also rely on the jobs and internships for health insurance.
In years past, the standard wait time was about 90 days; it's currently grown to as long as five months at some of its processing centers, the agency's website shows.
Durman, who applied for her permit in April, delayed a visit to her family in Turkey because she said she can't return to the United States without the permit. Obando did get her permit, albeit several weeks behind schedule, which allowed her to start an internship last week.
Several immigration rights advocates and attorneys say the delay is deliberate, citing the ongoing disputes between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats over issues such as border entry and visa policies. In addition to this delay, they blame White House immigration policies for a 7% enrollment decline of new international students during the 2017-18 school year, according to some news accounts.
The delays are associated with the federal Optional Practical Training program, temporary employment for some international students to work in various jobs and internships. It is an evolution of work programs for international students that began in the mid-1950s. The Obama administration in 2012 expanded the number of majors covered under the program, a move critics described as a backdoor attempt to circumvent the process for the H-1B visa, which is more difficult to receive and commonly used for high-skilled tech workers.
Eligible students can apply to receive up to 12 months of OPT employment authorization before or after completing their academic studies. The students, though, cannot apply for the program until three months before graduation.
Citizenship and Immigration Services officials declined an interview request, but said the delay is because it's recently experienced a surge in employment authorization requests.
"As a result, there is a small backlog of cases that are pending beyond the standard 90-day processing time," the department said via email. "USCIS has implemented a plan to address this and return to standard processing times soon."
The students, immigration policy critics say, followed the rules, filed the application paperwork on time, but are being penalized.
"This is intentionally designed to make legal immigration difficult in the United States," said Charles Kuck, a veteran Atlanta-based immigration attorney who said he met with about a dozen students last week from several Atlanta-area schools who've had delays getting their permits.
"It's a nightmare," he added. "An intentional nightmare."
An Oglethorpe University official said 11 students applied for the permits, but only one received it, after 124 days. The delays are the longest she's seen in more than 15 years, said Marisa Atencio, Oglethorpe's director of Global Education.
Students at several Ivy League universities submitted petitions and open letters to their universities pleading for help, The New York Times recently reported. In Georgia, many students affected by the wait are getting advice from the international student affairs offices at their schools or calling lawyers like Kuck.
Students interviewed did not take sides on the politics. They want to work. During a recent interview on Emory's campus, Obando used the word "stressful" several times to explain the emotions she and other international students have felt waiting for the permits to be processed.
"In a sense, it's like you are floating," said Obando, 22, a native of El Salvador who majored in interdisciplinary studies. "You are looking for opportunities and you just wait. It's stressful."
Obando enrolled at Emory on the recommendation of a counselor at her school in El Salvador who graduated from the Atlanta school. She received a full academic scholarshipandisconsidering attending graduate school in the United States.Obando last week began a 10-week paid internship doing social media, photography and writing for a company. She's worried, though, about what happens once the internship ends. Her health insurance, which Obando said came through Emory, expires at the end of July.
"It's nerve-wracking," she said.
Obando'ssituation, though, givesDurmanhope.Theymet during the Emory application process and are friends. Durman, 22, submitted her application two months ago and is still waiting for a work permit.
For now, Durman is volunteering in a campus psychology lab, continuing her undergraduate research on visual cognition. Durman booked a flight to Turkey later this month and hopes the permit program paperwork will be processed while she's visiting her family.
"I don't think I would handle it well without friends like Amanda around," Durman said of the wait.
"She is my resource."

Pelosi tries to mute Democrats on Twitter

Texto completo: The first time Rep. Nancy Pelosi served as House speaker in 2007, she had to tamp down occasional skirmishes between her moderate and liberal factions. Now in her second time as speaker more than a decade later, Pelosi is struggling to rein in intraparty fights that have expanded to Twitter.
The California Democrat, who turned 79 in March, is contending with the headaches of running a 235-member caucus that communicates not only in the hallways of Congress but in public on social media.
The new dynamic is a double-edged sword. It allows immediate messaging to millions of followers (and voters). Pelosi herself has 2.7 million Twitter followers and uses the platform regularly to promote the Democratic agenda.
But there’s a downside. It makes it much more difficult for Pelosi to keep a lid on fights within the party and to keep differences private within the caucus.
In a closed-door meeting last week, Pelosi urged Democrats to show more civility to one another, particularly in public, even when they disagree on key issues.
She ended her speech with a warning: Don’t attack each other on social media.
"You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it,” Pelosi said. “But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK."
The Twitter war among Democrats exploded in late June when House Democrats were backed into voting on a $4.6 billion border funding bill approved by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate.
House liberals wanted a bill with far more stringent safeguards for illegal immigrant children picked up along the border, but that bill had no chance of clearing the Senate or gaining President Trump’s signature.
Pelosi, in a move to protect her moderate faction, brought the Senate bill to the floor over liberals' objections. It passed with bipartisan support.
The party feud ahead of the vote spilled onto Twitter, with liberal Mark Pocan, a Democratic congressman from Wisconsin, accusing Democrats on the moderate Problem Solvers Caucus of not caring about illegal immigrants, and worse.
“Since when did the Problem Solvers Caucus become the Child Abuse Caucus?” Pocan said. “Wouldn't they want to at least fight against contractors who run deplorable facilities? Kids are the only ones who could lose today.”
The fight, which escalated on social media in the following weeks, had been simmering for months. Pelosi has made a string of comments this year dismissing the social media prowess of a small group of freshman liberal stars, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
The New York Democrat famously unseated moderate Joe Crowley from his 14th District seat in the Democratic primary and is a social media phenomenon with 4.7 million Twitter followers and 3.8 million followers on Instagram.
Democratic lawmakers admire her social media skills. She held a training session this year to teach less-savvy members how to use the platform more effectively.
But her Twitter celebrity has caused tensions with some lawmakers because Ocasio-Cortez and others in the party have used the platform to push an ultra-left-wing agenda that not every Democrat can support.
“While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what’s important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House,” Pelosi told USA Today in April.
During the border funding fight, Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, took to Twitter to criticize moderates.
“They certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s,” Chakrabarti tweeted.
A week later, he attacked Pelosi following media interviews in which she appeared again dismissive of Ocasio-Cortez. Pelosi told the New York Times that Ocasio-Cortez and her “squad” of ultra-left-wing fellow freshmen couldn’t get anyone to back their efforts to block a House version of the border funding bill.
Pelosi was referring to three other freshman Democrats, Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who voted against the House bill. All three are ultraliberal and active on social media. They opposed any border funding, arguing it could be used to deport illegal immigrants.
Chakrabarti fired back on Twitter.
“All these articles want to claim what a legislative mastermind Pelosi is, but I'm seeing way more strategic smarts from freshman members like @AOC, @IlhanMN, @RashidaTlaib and @AyannaPressley. Pelosi is just mad that she got outmaneuvered (again) by Republicans,” Chakrabarti tweeted on July 6.
Pelosi told reporters last week that Democratic lawmakers are unhappy about Chakrabarti’s social media commentary, which she referred to as “an offensive tweet that came out of one office.”
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, who describes herself as a progressive activist, said that lawmakers are grappling with how to reconcile the old way of conducting politics with the emergence of social media, but that Ocasio-Cortez and other young liberals should not be ignored.
“They are on the vanguard of people who are really reengaging a whole part of democracy that felt hopeless before,” Jayapal said. “To dismiss any members’ force, and particularly these four members who do have a tremendous following in the progressive base, is not the best for us.”Story URL

Texto completo: There’s a simple rule for controlling an unfavorable news cycle that President Trump is yet to learn: Don’t fan the flames.
When unfriendly cables by U.K. Ambassador Kim Darroch were leaked, White House officials responded calmly. No big deal, they suggested. But Trump went ballistic, attacking the ambassador as if he were an adversary of America. This ballooned the story and made matters a lot worse for the president.
The timing was especially bad — again for Trump. The president was coming off of his successful Fourth of July celebration. His speech at the Lincoln Memorial was terrific and his patriotic theme made his media critics look even more biased against him than usual.
So it goes, as Trump works his way into reelection form. He has one big task to carry out. It’s not to make his political base feel good. The base is unshakeable. It’s to win over soft Republicans, moderates, and independents who abandoned the GOP during the 2018 midterm election.
Amy Walter, the analyst for the Cook Political Report, has noted the weakening of support of former Obama backers who voted for Trump in 2016. She points to Yair Ghitza of the Democratic-leaning data firm Catalist, who found the jump in the popular vote for Democrats from a 2% lead in 2016 to 7% in 2018 came almost entirely from those who had voted for Trump three years ago.
That’s an alarming sign for Trump’s prospects. And I’m not sure whether Trump understands it. He’s hinted that he does. The July 4 speech is one indication. The fact that his tweeting has decreased a bit is another. But those are weak hints at best.
In contrast, look at what resulted from his pouncing on the British ambassador. It attracted far more attention to Darroch’s actual remarks in his leaked cables, though he hadn’t said anything the American media hasn’t already dwelled upon.
Darroch sounded as if he followed the practice often attributed to British journalists of echoing the American press. It wasn’t surprising that the Washington Post reported triumphantly that his “cables reveal savvy thoughts about Trump.”
The president makes no secret of his reflex to counterpunch. But he didn’t need to assault the ambassador, who wasn’t responsible for the public airing of his cables. And we’ll probably never know the identity of the real culprit: The leaker.
Trump’s problem is he takes the bait regardless. His notion is that by punching back harder than he was hit in the first place, it will keep the person who’s criticized him from doing it again. But it often doesn’t have that effect.

The president is thin-skinned. He takes political barbs personally. And since he’s under constant attack, this keeps him busy fighting back. He doesn’t adhere to Richard Nixon’s advice to not punch down, not to tangle with lesser figures, those lower on the ladder of fame or power.
He made a mistake in tangling with Megan Rapinoe, the star of the American women’s soccer team. Several weeks before the team won the World Cup championship she declared in highly disrespectful language that she wouldn’t go to the White House to be congratulated by the president.

Rapinoe is a hot dog. She is outspoken. She is a lesbian and a political leftie. She is very popular. She is also talented, tough, and very competitive — just the qualities one would want in an American athlete. She was the captain of the U.S. team. Not surprisingly, she was the most valuable layer in the World Cup.

What was in it for Trump in zinging her? Nothing at all. Maybe he learned something from this tiff. After the U.S. victory, he didn’t revive his criticism. He might have praised her publicly for leading the Americans to victory in one of the biggest sports events of the year. But that was a bridge too far.

Two points. Trump’s conduct, particularly his incensed tweets, are off-putting to millions of fragile Republicans and squishy independents. This is indisputable. They deserted Republican candidates in 2018 largely because of him. He can’t win reelection in 2020 unless he lures a big chunk of the turncoats back.

Liberals have noticed he’s not wooing moderates. A piece by Jamelle Bouie in the New York Times was headlined, “Why Isn’t Trump Trying to Win the Center?” Good question. He shouldn’t wait until next July 4 with his answer.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
LOS ANGELES - Rip Torn, the free-spirited Texan who overcame his quirky name to become a distinguished actor in theater, television and movies and win an Emmy in his 60s for his comedy turn on TV's "The Larry Sanders Show," has died. He was 88.
Torn died Tuesday afternoon at his home with his wife, Amy Wright, and daughters Katie Torn and Angelica Page by his side, according to his publicist Rick Miramontez. No cause of death was given.
His career on stage and screen spanned seven decades, ranging from an early career of dark, threatening roles to iconic comedic performances later in life.
After acclaimed performances in "Cross Creek," Sweet Bird of Youth" and other dramas, Torn turned to comedy to capture his Emmy as the bombastic, ethically challenged television producer in "The Larry Sanders Show." Created by and starring Garry Shandling, HBO's spoof of TV talk shows aired from 1992 to 1998 and is widely credited with inspiring such satirical programs as "30 Rock" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm."
Born Elmore Rual Torn, the actor adopted the name Rip in his boyhood, following the tradition of his father and uncle. It was the subject of endless ridicule during his early days as a stage actor in New York, and fellow drama students urged him to change it.
With customary stubbornness, he refused, eventually overcoming the jokes with a series of powerful performances that led to his being regarded, along with Marlon Brando, Paul Newman and James Dean, as actors of a postwar generation who brought tense realism to their craft. He was also a political activist who joined James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte and other cultural and civil rights leaders for a frank and emotional 1963 meeting with then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy about the country's treatment of blacks.
Torn made his film debut in 1956 in an adaptation of Tennessee Williams' "Baby Doll," and within a few years was a respected film and television actor, working on occasions with his second wife, Geraldine Page. At the Actors Studio, he gained the attention of Elia Kazan, who hired him as understudy to Alex Nicol, then playing Brick Pollitt in the Tennessee Williams classic, "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." Toward the end of the show's Broadway run, Torn took over the role of the alcoholic, emotionally troubled former football hero. He did so billed against his wishes as Elmore Torn.
Cast later in a "U.S. Steel Hour" production for television, he was told to either change his name or forfeit the role. He threatened to return to his native Texas, but finally agreed to be credited as Eric Torn. He was billed as Rip Torn thereafter. His success eventually inspired a younger cousin to take up acting, too - Oscar winner Sissy Spacek.
Other film credits included "Critics Choice" and "The Cincinnati Kid." In Albert Brooks' "Defending Your Life," he was featured as a gregarious attorney in the afterlife.
Brooks tweeted Tuesday night, "R.I.P Rip Torn. He was so great in Defending Your Life. I'll miss you Rip, you were a true original."
On television he played such figures as Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson and Walt Whitman.
His career hit a dry spell in the 1970s, and he blamed it on the buzz in Hollywood at the time that he was difficult to work with, a reputation sealed when tension on the set of "Easy Rider" led to his being replaced by Jack Nicholson for the 1969 release and missing out on one of the biggest hits of the era.
"I wouldn't say that I was blacklisted," he told The Associated Press in 1984, "but the word got around that I was difficult and unreliable. Unreliable! In all my years in the theater I have never missed a performance."
He managed to keep working in small projects in theater, films and TV, returning to the mainstream in 1983 with "Cross Creek," in which he played table-smashing backwoodsman Marsh Turner. The role brought him his only Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor.
Among his other films: "City Heat" and "Men in Black."
But he never entirely shook his rebellious reputation.
"What do they say about all the guys that are tremendous actors?" he told The New York Times in 2006. "Don't they say they have a volatile temper and emotions? Yeah, sure they do! They're not saying they like a nice, mild guy. Look at Sean Penn.
In 1994, actor-director Dennis Hopper said on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" that Torn once pulled a knife in a New York restaurant as he complained about being replaced in "Easy Rider." He sued Hopper for slander and won a $475,000 judgment.
He remained active in film and television in later years, including a recurring role in "30 Rock" and a voice acting gig in the 2007 animated "Bee Movie."
He weathered a couple of drunken driving arrests, including one in December 2008 near his home in Salisbury, Conn., that led to his placement in an alcohol education program.
Born in Temple, Texas, Torn initially studied agriculture at Texas A&M and acting at the University of Texas. After service as a military policeman during the Korean War, he hitchhiked to Hollywood. Landing only tiny roles in movies and TV dramas, and supporting himself as a fry cook and dishwasher, he decided to shift to New York and seek more training as an actor.
Torn and his first wife, actress Ann Wedgeworth, had a daughter, Danae, before divorcing. In 1963 he married Page, with whom he had co-starred in the touring production and movie version of "Sweet Bird of Youth." They had three children, a daughter, Angelica, and twins Jon and Tony, and appeared in productions together until her death in 1987. Torn also had two children, Katie and Claire, with actress Amy Wright.

America is still greater than ‘just OK’

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a “Salute to America” last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the “mythology” of American greatness. “America may once have been the greatest,” the Times video declares, “but today, America, we’re just OK.”
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America -- except it isn’t a caricature; it’s real. It’s a straw man come to life. As evidence we’re just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our “kick-ass democracy,” the Times says, it’s not that big a deal because “a lot of countries have freedoms.”
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that “a lot of countries have freedoms” today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea -- the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 -- just two decades ago -- that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn’t just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that “for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered ‘middle class’ or ‘rich.’”
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom’s frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let’s be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There’s a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world’s democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world.
Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than “just OK.”

The Hidden History of Liberty Island; Before the statue and long before the brand-new museum, there were pirates, real-estate ventures and public executions

Texto completo: As a rule, a museum tells more by what it leaves out than by what it includes. It's akin to framing a photo to show the patriarch and the favorite son but exclude the black sheep who's brought this family nothing but trouble.
Take, for example, the Statue of Liberty Museum on Liberty Island, the 15-acre rock at the mouth of New York harbor. Since 1886, the island has been home to the 305-foot statue, with gown, torch and tablet, standing amid broken chains—the first glimpse of America seen by generations of immigrants, symbolizing the nation's best sentiments.
The museum, which cost $100 million to build, opened in May in a celebrity-packed ceremony, featuring photos and films of the statue and the original copper torch, which was replaced by a gold-leafed replica in 1985 after it was damaged by leaks. But there is another story that the museum doesn't tell: the deep history of Liberty Island, what it meant to those who lived and died in eras before the statue arrived.
The saga is still there, of course, only papered over, forgotten: a site of military strategy, land speculation, piratical pursuits and, most notoriously, public executions. In this, Liberty Island epitomizes the telling of all history—each generation overwrites the past. You discover it with a thrill, as when at around age 10, you ask your mother, "Did someone live in this house before us?"
To Europeans who sailed through the Narrows in the 17th century, the island was a cork that stoppered the mouth of the greatest natural harbor in the New World, teeming with seagulls and shellfish when the tide ebbed. On Dutch maps, it was marked as Great Oyster Island, a Lenape hunting ground. With the coming of the British, it entered the only history that counts: commercial.
Its views of town and sea—they would call it a double exposure now—marked it as a choice piece of real estate. A Captain Robert Needham, given the island by the British governor of New York in the way of swag, sold it to a merchant named Isaac Bedloe (also recorded as Bedlow and Bedloo) on Dec. 23, 1667. Until being renamed for the statue in 1956, it was usually known as Bedloe's Island, awash in Manhattan's property churn, sold and resold, gussied up, sold again. At one point, it rented as a vacation property called Love Island. At another, it was a quarantine hospital where the stricken looked longingly at the bustling port across the bay.
It was turned into a military base in the run-up to the War of 1812 and became the site of a star-shaped fort, cannons facing the sea, whose distinctive walls would later support the statue. The fort was ultimately named for Lt. Col. Eleazer Derby Wood, killed in the 1814 British siege of Fort Erie.
All the while, the island was being put to a grisly use that still haunts it. For hundreds of years, Liberty Island was a place for hangings. Dozens of pirates met their fate there, including one Cornelius Wilhelms, a Dutch sailor who, along with confederates, killed the captain of his ship and its officers, killed the male passengers and then, according to a 1860 New York Times article, went after the women: "After a series of indignities, one lady was killed and thrown overboard, and the other was tossed overboard alive." Wilhelms was executed on Bedloe's Island on June 21, 1839. By then, the island had long been associated with buccaneers. According to some legends, Captain William Kidd, a famous New World pirate and an early resident of Manhattan, buried part of his lost treasure there.
New York's final public execution also took place on the island. Albert Hicks was an infamous killer, both the city's last pirate and its first gangster. He worked on whaling ships all over the world but lived on Cedar Street in Manhattan, lingering around the waterfront dives where the ships were so thick that their bowsprits came together to form a canopy above the East River docks. In March 1860, Hicks, a first mate on an oyster sloop, killed his entire crew in the lower bay, made off with money in a dinghy, landed on Staten Island and lighted out.
What followed was one of the most intense manhunts in city history. The trial became a sensation. More than 12,000 people gathered in ships in the harbor on July 13, 1860, to watch Hicks die.
From the gallows, he would see the upper bay, the lower bay and the red-brick front of the seaport, the entire theater of his crime. The execution became a carnival, a debauch, which is one of the reasons it was the last of its kind. Public executions, which had already been discontinued by the city—Hicks had been convicted of piracy, a federal crime—had become an embarrassment.
When the statue was dedicated on the same site just 26 years later, on Oct. 28, 1886, more than a million came out for a ceremony and New York's first-ever ticker-tape parade. That day, the statue stood for American greatness. Six years later, with the opening of the immigration inspection station on nearby Ellis Island—formerly Gibbet Island; pirates were hung there too—it also came to stand for human inflow and American promise. Annie Moore was the first of 12 million immigrants to land on Ellis Island, a 17-year-old from Ireland who had traveled in steerage.
But the life of America is short: Many of those alive to see the statue's dedication would have remembered the island's other history, and thus remembered a different kind of symbol. To them, the place would stand for the lawless old New York, a settlement on the edge of an unknown continent.
That was another city, from another time, New York as it had been when pirates anchored off 14th Street. That wild, freewheeling town had to make way for the modern metropolis. None of which changes the fact: When you are looking at the Statue of Liberty, you are seeing the site of the last gallows to claim an American pirate.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—A State Department intelligence analyst has resigned in protest after the White House blocked portions of his written testimony to a congressional panel to exclude data and evidence on climate change and its threat to national security, State Department officials said.
The analyst, Rod Schoonover, prepared a written report citing peer-reviewed scientific journal articles and intelligence reports, which conclude that climate change could have wide-ranging national security impacts by contributing to increased humanitarian crises, competition for resources and risk of political instability.
White House officials allowed him to speak to the panel in June, but prohibited him from including evidence and data supporting his assessments in written testimony to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence last month, according to one of the officials familiar with the matter. That cut his written testimony by half, the official said. Ultimately, he didn't submit a written statement to the panel, unlike two other government witnesses at the hearing.
"We do not comment on deliberative matters," according to a senior administration official. "This appears to be a clear example of some within the behemoth of the U.S. bureaucracy running around thinking their way is the only way and desperately trying to undermine this president and the American democratic process."
Mr. Schoonover declined to comment when reached last week, and again Wednesday through an intermediary. Friday will be his last day, one of the officials said. He has spent almost 10 years at the department, according to his LinkedIn page. A State Department spokesperson said, "We do not comment on personnel matters."
According to one of the officials, Mr. Schoonover's decision to leave came after a series of conflicts with Trump administration political appointees over department scientific reports.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman, wrote last month to the State Department intelligence bureau and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats requesting documents and interviews regarding Mr. Schoonover's written testimony. A committee official said the two agencies had yet to comply with the requests.
"The role of Intelligence Community is to speak truth to power—that's why we are investigating reports that the White House sought to muzzle science-based testimony on the national security impacts of climate change, including testimony by Dr. Schoonover to our committee last month," Mr. Schiff said Wednesday.

"We will be inviting Dr. Schoonover to return to our committee to shed light on alleged efforts to censor his written testimony, and are continuing to press for documents from the Intelligence Community related to the Committee's hearing, to ensure that this doesn't ever happen again," he said.
Mr. Schoonover's department, the Intelligence and Research Bureau, is among the smallest of U.S. intelligence agencies. In the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it was nearly alone among spy agencies in questioning whether Iraq had active weapons of mass destruction programs.
The Washington Post and the New York Times first reported that written testimony that Mr. Schoonover planned to give to the House Intelligence Committee was heavily edited by officials at the National Security Council and White House legal adviser's office, and ultimately withdrawn.
The Pentagon in recent years has identified climate change as a potential security threat.
"Among the future trends that will impact our national security is climate change," the Defense Department said in a 2014 report. "Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels, and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty, and conflict. They will likely lead to food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and destruction by natural disasters in regions across the globe."

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier accused of sexually abusing girls for more than a decade, has been linked in the past to celebrities, prominent businessmen, politicians and, at one point, Prince Andrew of Britain.
But it is Mr. Epstein's ties to two United States presidents, Bill Clinton and Donald J. Trump, that have drawn the most attention in recent days.
In 2002, Mr. Trump called Mr. Epstein a "terrific guy" in an interview with New York magazine. But on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters he "was not a fan" of Mr. Epstein and that the two had a "falling out" and had not spoken for some 15 years.
Mr. Clinton has denied having a close relationship with Mr. Epstein. On Monday, Mr. Clinton's office said in a statement that Mr. Clinton "knows nothing about the terrible crimes" that Mr. Epstein has been accused of, and that Mr. Clinton had not spoken to Mr. Epstein in more than a decade.
The former president has not been linked by prosecutors or officials to any of the current or previous accusations against Mr. Epstein.
Here's what we know about Mr. Clinton's ties to Mr. Epstein.
How did Mr. Epstein and Mr. Clinton know each other?
During his career in finance, both at Bear Stearns and when he struck out on his own, Mr. Epstein had a reputation for being intensely private.
But in 2002, the former president took a trip on Mr. Epstein's private jet, which brought a flurry of media attention.
At the time, Mr. Clinton had been out of the White House for two years and had started the nonprofit group, the Clinton Foundation. Through his work with the foundation, Mr. Clinton connected with Mr. Epstein.
The ride on the private jet was part of a visit to Africa that Mr. Clinton made in order to discuss economic development on the continent and the ongoing fight against H.I.V. and AIDS.
"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science," Mr. Clinton, through a spokesman, told New York magazine in 2002. "I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service and combating H.I.V./AIDS."
Mr. Epstein did not speak with New York magazine, but friends who were interviewed said that Mr. Epstein viewed his relationship with Mr. Clinton as an extension of his general networking philosophy.
"I invest in people -- be it politics or science," he told friends, according to the magazine. "It's what I do."
Was that the only trip?
In his statement on Monday, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, Angel Ureña, said that Mr. Clinton took "four trips" on Mr. Epstein's plane between 2002 and 2003 -- one each to Europe and Asia, and two to Africa.
The trips all "included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation," Mr. Ureña said, adding that Mr. Clinton's staff, supporters of the foundation and Mr. Clinton's Secret Service detail traveled with him on every leg of every trip.
Flight records published by Gawker in 2015 suggested that Mr. Clinton took at least a dozen separate flights on Mr. Epstein's plane. A year later, Fox News reported that flight records showed President Clinton had flown at least 26 times on Mr. Epstein's plane.
It was unclear how many individual flights were involved in each trip that Mr. Ureña mentioned and whether that may account for the discrepancy between the number he cited and what the flight logs show. Mr. Clinton's office did not immediately respond for a request for comment.
The flight logs, posted online by Gawker, also record Mr. Clinton as being present on a domestic flight from Miami to Westchester County Airport in West Harrison, N.Y., which is near Mr. Clinton's home in suburban Chappaqua.
Did Mr. Clinton visit Mr. Epstein's homes?
Mr. Clinton visited Mr. Epstein's New York apartment once around 2002, according to Mr. Ureña's statement. The former president was accompanied by a staff member and his security detail.
He never visited Mr. Epstein's palatial residence in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Ureña said, nor has he been to the financier's ranch in New Mexico or his private island in the Virgin Islands.
Mr. Clinton may not have been present at Mr. Epstein's Upper East Side home in more recent years, but his image apparently was. One person who visited Mr. Epstein's townhouse last year told The New York Times they saw a signed photograph of Mr. Clinton behind a large dining table. Mr. Epstein also had photos of Woody Allen and Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, on display at the house, according to the visitor.
Additionally, New York magazine reported in 2003 that Mr. Epstein once threw a dinner party at the house in Mr. Clinton's honor. The former president never showed, but the magazine reported that the other guests included Mr. Trump, the magician David Blaine and Doug Band, who was then an adviser to Mr. Clinton.
Are there any other ties?
Mr. Clinton had one other meeting with Mr. Epstein, in Mr. Clinton's office in Harlem in 2002, according to Mr. Ureña.
At one point, Mr. Epstein's personal phonebook, which was submitted as an exhibit in a court case against Mr. Epstein and was published by BuzzFeed in 2015, contained more than 20 numbers, emails and addresses to get in touch with Mr. Clinton, most of them listed under Mr. Band's name.
Earlier this year, The Daily Beast reported that a charity organization formerly run by Mr. Epstein, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation, donated $ 25,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2006. As of Tuesday, the foundation was named on a list of donors on the Clinton Foundation's website.

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds, adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog, known as an inspector general.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances. ") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
HOMELAND SECURITY: We've done all we could with limited resources
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing — to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for about 2,000 confined children.
Some of Trump's tough-guy policies for staunching the flow of migrants have only made matters worse. When he "meters" lawful asylum seeking at ports of entry down to a trickle, desperate migrants find other ways to enter the country. When he starts threatening deportation of U. S. residents willing to sponsor child migrants, sponsorship declines and children languish in holding cells. And when he cancels or limits programs that allow for release of migrants into the community wearing ankle bracelets or under successful community supervision programs, they're consigned to fetid, standing-room only cells.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents, raising the question of whether another new Trump policy, of using flawed evidence of gang affiliation to separate families, is making matters worse. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care since December.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4. 6 billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.
Going forward, Congress could help safeguard children by:
►Creating a multiagency, pilot program to compassionately process children and families.
►Allowing lawmakers to visit sites without advance notice.
►Establishing medical care standards for children and adults in custody.
►Providing best-practices training for border officers.
For now, there's lasting damage — to the children. Many already traumatized by violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U. S. immigration centers.
"Most kids will have lasting scars from what they have seen or are enduring," Harvard Medical School psychiatrist and bioethicist Wes Boyd, who has studied asylum seekers, told Axios.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Democrats Will Stop Raising their Hands; New polling and new concerns about the strange ideas endorsed in Miami.

Texto completo: In last month's Democratic debates, a remarkable number of presidential candidates raised their hands in support of unpopular ideas. Will voters punish them for it?
So far, Democratic donors seem to be showering them with rewards. On the stage in Miami, Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised her hand for the end of private health plans. Then this week she reported raising more than $19 million in the most recent quarter. Sen. Warren now self-identifies as a capitalist but even Democratic activists have trouble spotting differences between her platform and that of anti-capitalist Bernie Sanders, who raised $18 million and authored the plan to kill private insurance.
Mr. Sanders is the boyhood idol of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who topped them both with a quarterly haul of nearly $25 million. This stunning total was even more than the $21.5 million collected by former Vice President Joe Biden, who consistently leads the field in polls of Democratic voters.
Mr. Buttigieg doesn't endorse abolishing private insurance yet, but in Miami he did support another fringe idea that is suddenly popular among Democratic presidential candidates. The Huff Post recently explained :
All but two Democratic presidential hopefuls backed a proposal to decriminalize unauthorized border crossings on the second night of the first 2020 Democratic debate, reflecting the growing influence of former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro in driving the debate.
Now Mr. Castro reports that he too is enjoying a donor surge.
But not everyone on the left is convinced that voters are up for such radical policy shifts. The Journal's William A. Galston questions why Democrats are embracing "open borders" and warns :
Candidates for the Democratic nomination are espousing positions that would have been unthinkable not long ago and that are more likely to repel than attract the swing voters who gave them a House majority in 2018.
In the New York Times, columnist Frank Bruni finds the leftward lurch rather charming but suspects that this time around Democrats may opt for a seemingly safer choice:
Bernie Sanders, with his call for Democratic socialism; Kamala Harris, with her intensifying emphasis on racial disparities; Elizabeth Warren, with her encyclopedia of plans; Pete Buttigieg, with his husband and his mere 37 years on earth — the election of any one of them would be a bold statement, a milestone. Each is a figure exponentially more romantic than Biden, counting to some degree on the adage that while Republican voters fall in line, Democratic voters fall in love.
Biden, in contrast, is trying to get Democrats to do something that Republicans have more practice at: choose a nominee who's due over one who's new. He's the liberal iteration of Bob Dole, the looser version of Mitt Romney, John McCain without Lindsey Graham glued to his side.
Today pollster Scott Rasmussen shares results suggesting Democrats may not want to fall so hard for illegal immigration:
Twenty-one percent (21%) of voters nationwide believe the United States has no right to decide who is eligible to enter the country. They believe anyone who wants to live in the United States should be allowed entry.
However, 79% disagree and take the opposite view.
This is consistent with a vast collection of survey data showing that eight-out-of-ten voters believe illegal immigration is bad for the United States (eight-out-of-ten also believe that legal immigration is good for the country).
However, 95% believe it is important that potential immigrants be required to go through customs and fill out appropriate entry papers.
A number of Democratic candidates are not simply urging a decriminalization of illegal border crossings, but also promising new taxpayer-funded benefits for those who undertake them. Mark Barabak and Noam Levey write in the Los Angeles Times:
With a sharp left turn, Democrats are risking a backlash on an issue of raw emotional and political sensitivity: providing government healthcare to millions of people in the country illegally.
Ten of the party's nearly two dozen presidential candidates stood on a debate stage last month and, without hesitation, raised their hands pledging themselves to the policy shift. Most others in the field have also expressed their support.
The U.S. Census Bureau's global population clock reports more than 7.5 billion people on our planet. For those wondering about the potential financial impact of offering insurance coverage to all of humanity, this column should note that the population of the world is roughly 23 times as large as the population of the United States.
***
Speaking of another argument that has miraculously won over a number of politicians and even a leading manufacturer of athletic apparel, a separate poll today from Mr. Rasmussen finds :
Ten percent (10%) of voters nationwide believe the Betsy Ross flag is a symbol of racism. A ScottRasmussen.com national survey found that 68% disagree while 22% are not sure.
Among African-American voters, 25% believe that flag is a symbol of racism, 38% disagree and 36% are not sure. Just 11% of Hispanic voters and 6% of White voters see the Betsy Ross flag as a symbol of racism...
Thirty-three percent (33%) of voters at least somewhat agree with Nike's decision to stop distributing a sneaker featuring the flag. Sixty-eight percent (68%) disagree.
This column joined the Journal's William McGurn in hoping for a show of hands on this question at the next Democratic debate.
UPDATE: Unfortunately CNN, which is hosting the next round of Democratic debates in Detroit on July 30 and 31, has informed the various campaigns that, "There will be no show of hands or one-word, down-the-line questions." Now why would CNN want to remove some of the most interesting elements from their upcoming events?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—A State Department intelligence analyst has resigned in protest after the White House blocked portions of his written testimony to a congressional panel to exclude data and evidence on climate change and its threat to national security, State Department officials said.
The analyst, Rod Schoonover, prepared a written report citing peer-reviewed scientific journal articles and intelligence reports, which conclude that climate change could have wide-ranging national security impacts by contributing to increased humanitarian crises, competition for resources and risk of political instability.
White House officials allowed him to speak to the panel in June, but prohibited him from including evidence and data supporting his assessments in written testimony to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence last month, according to one of the officials familiar with the matter. That cut his written testimony by half, the official said. Ultimately, he didn't submit a written statement to the panel, unlike two other government witnesses at the hearing.
"We do not comment on deliberative matters," according to a senior administration official. "This appears to be a clear example of some within the behemoth of the U.S. bureaucracy running around thinking their way is the only way and desperately trying to undermine this president and the American democratic process."
Mr. Schoonover declined to comment when reached last week, and again Wednesday through an intermediary. Friday will be his last day, one of the officials said. He has spent almost 10 years at the department, according to his LinkedIn page. White House and State Department representatives didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to one of the officials, Mr. Schoonover's decision to leave came after a series of conflicts with Trump administration political appointees over department scientific reports.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman, wrote last month to the State Department intelligence bureau and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats requesting documents and interviews regarding Mr. Schoonover's written testimony. A committee official said the two agencies had yet to comply with the requests.
"The role of Intelligence Community is to speak truth to power—that's why we are investigating reports that the White House sought to muzzle science-based testimony on the national security impacts of climate change, including testimony by Dr. Schoonover to our committee last month," Mr. Schiff said Wednesday.

"We will be inviting Dr. Schoonover to return to our committee to shed light on alleged efforts to censor his written testimony, and are continuing to press for documents from the Intelligence Community related to the Committee's hearing, to ensure that this doesn't ever happen again," he said.
Mr. Schoonover's department, the Intelligence and Research Bureau, is among the smallest of U.S. intelligence agencies. In the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it was nearly alone among spy agencies in questioning whether Iraq had active weapons of mass destruction programs.
The Washington Post and the New York Times first reported that written testimony that Mr. Schoonover planned to give to the House Intelligence Committee was heavily edited by officials at the National Security Council and White House legal adviser's office, and ultimately withdrawn.
The Pentagon in recent years has identified climate change as a potential security threat.
"Among the future trends that will impact our national security is climate change," the Defense Department said in a 2014 report. "Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels, and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty, and conflict. They will likely lead to food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and destruction by natural disasters in regions across the globe."

Texto completo: If California Sen. Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance. Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care's complex 18% of America's economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost — if they ever had — an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed "Medicare for All" and was asked: So, people "who like their [private] insurance, they don't get to keep it?" She answered: "The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let's eliminate all of that." More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times — not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign — says, "waffled" regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand ("just as quickly as Mr. Sanders," the Times reported) when a moderator asked: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan?" Harris also raised her hand just as quickly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren had done the night before, who exclaimed "I'm with Bernie." Sen. Bernie Sanders is the purest advocate of a government-only health care system.
The next morning on MSNBC, Harris said "No, I do not" support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun "their" in the debate moderator's question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell and Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans — 80 million more than voted in 2016 — something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people's) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4% of whites and 9% of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools. Biden is becoming a conviction contortionist, as with his retreat from 40 years of support for the Hyde Amendment. Suddenly he favors federal funding of abortions — forcing many taxpayers to be complicit in a practice they abhor.
Many Democrats striving to replace Donald Trump are, while execrating him, paying him the sincerest form of flattery: imitation. He prepared to campaign for president by calling America a "hellhole" and he began his presidency with an inaugural address that his would-be replacements are mimicking with their versions of his trope about "American carnage."
The day the Supreme Court held that "partisan gerrymandering" is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: "Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering — modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia." Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Trump and the Sex Offender

Texto completo: Anybody who has read about Jeffrey Epstein in the past dozen years would come away with the same impression Mr. Epstein apparently had about himself. The guy will soon be back in jail.
In his luxurious Manhattan townhouse, he reportedly commissioned a mural of himself at the center of a prison yard. According to the New York Times, he told a recent visitor, "That's me, and I had this painted because there is always the possibility that could be me again."
Mr. Epstein is back in a holding cell, under indictment by a U.S. attorney in New York. He will have his day in court. Presumably we will find out whether the evidence against the hedge-fund impresario for sexually abusing numerous underage girls in the early 2000s is as strong as it seems.
But one element of the story should give us pause, and that's the seemingly concerted effort by the press to make a secondary villain out of the only prosecutor who succeeded in holding Mr. Epstein accountable till now because, 12 years later, that prosecutor is Donald Trump's labor secretary.
A much-cited story in the Miami Herald last November is headlined "How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime." The paper thereby invokes a previously unknown form of retroactive quantum action at a distance, since Alexander Acosta's actions as a U.S. attorney in Florida in 2007 could not have been premised on Mr. Trump being president a decade later.
The headline is also misleading. In fact, the Herald's 5,000-word expose tells us very little about the reasons and circumstances behind the 2008 plea deal in which Mr. Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two felonies, serve an 18-month jail sentence, pay restitution to certain victims, and accept designation for life as a registered sex offender.
Instead, the paper tells us what its own sources are willing to say now about Mr. Epstein more than a decade after the prosecution. What a newspaper can report in 2018 and what a prosecutor can prove in 2007 are two very different things. A fact the Herald also should have made plain: It was precisely Mr. Epstein's conviction at the hands of Mr. Acosta that helped fuel the filing of civil lawsuits and emergence of newly declared victims that became the basis for the Herald's own reporting.
Making an even bigger joke of the paper's positioning of Mr. Acosta as Mr. Epstein's protector is this glaring fact: It wasn't Mr. Acosta but New York County's district attorney -- a member of the city's ruling Democratic elite, with the illustrious name of Cyrus Vance Jr. -- who in 2011 sought to undo Mr. Acosta's work by relieving Mr. Epstein of his Level 3 sex offender status in New York state.
But then Mr. Vance is not a member of the Trump administration.
Maybe none of the prosecutors involved in this matter belong in the pantheon, but Mr. Acosta convicted Mr. Epstein and ended his depredations. Ninety-seven percent of federal prosecutions end in plea deals. The Herald tells us almost nothing about why this one did as well, except to note in passing that Mr. Vance later argued before a New York judge that Mr. Epstein's "underage victims failed to cooperate in the [Florida] case."
In fact, our best information right now comes from a three-page letter Mr. Acosta himself wrote to the Daily Beast in 2011. He described how his office was recruited into an already-existing prosecution by Palm Beach police who feared their state prosecutor intended to let Mr. Epstein off with probation. Mr. Acosta's role was hindered by the need to find a federal crime to charge. He also had to show deference to Florida. Mr. Epstein's well-connected legal team -- including Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr -- kept appealing over his head to Washington. It sought dirt on Mr. Acosta's staff in hopes of disqualifying key underlings from the case. He fretted about a drawn-out prosecution in which Mr. Epstein would walk free. He had no role in Florida's subsequent decision to let Mr. Epstein out of jail six days a week to continue his business. Mr. Acosta also says that with the witnesses who subsequently have come forward, he could have made a stronger case.
The outcome may not have been deeply satisfying, but Mr. Acosta persevered to a conviction despite Mr. Epstein's deep pockets and his constantly invoked list of powerful "friends," including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Donald Trump (though it was Mr. Trump who, in typically Trumpian fashion, raised an eyebrow as early as 2002 with a comment to New York magazine about the apparent youth of Mr. Epstein's girlfriends).
It also bears asking: Would the Herald even have invested in reporting the Epstein story if it couldn't also have flounced up an anti-Trump angle?
Yes, it's been rough couple of decades for the newspaper business. At the kindest, the Herald should have had the confidence to rest its claim to public attention on what it had to reveal about Mr. Epstein's behavior rather than trying so pathetically to annex its reporting to an au courant anti-Trump narrative.

Politics &amp; Ideas: Mirroring Trump Could Doom the Democrats

Texto completo: The only cure for bad politics is better politics. The only remedy for national division is national leadership that puts reconciliation first.
Many observers -- including some of my close friends -- believe that the better politics America needs will emerge from below. Local government will model cooperative problem-solving across the lines that divide us. Civil society will reconnect individuals whose isolation leads them toward extremism. Service to others will give new purpose to those now inclined to seek meaning in intense partisanship. Creative new programs will ameliorate what political scientists call "affective polarization" -- in plain English, the loathing with which too many partisans now regard those on the other side.
These approaches can help. But they will not get the job done. Unless Americans are given better political options, they cannot make better choices.
For the moment, no vision to bridge our divisions is likely to come from the Republican Party. President Trump's supporters prize him as a fighter, not a unifier. We do not see "Bring us together again" signs at his rallies. Moreover, every survey shows that he commands overwhelming support from members of his party. It is hardly surprising that no one of stature has come forth to challenge his renomination. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, we can expect more of the same.
As often happens, politics has mirrored physics: An action generated an equal and opposite reaction. Candidates for the Democratic nomination are espousing positions that would have been unthinkable not long ago and that are more likely to repel than attract the swing voters who gave them a House majority in 2018.
As the fight for their party's presidential nomination intensifies, Democrats will have to answer some tough questions. With conservative activists pushing to overturn Roe v. Wade, does it make sense to loosen the current limits on abortion, which are grounded in the architecture of the 1973 decision? As the Trump administration undermines the Affordable Care Act, is advocating a government takeover of the entire health-care system the wisest course?
The Trump administration's tactics on immigration are unacceptable, and the president's rhetoric is even worse. Does this mean Democrats should favor decriminalizing unauthorized entry into the country? Must the country choose between open borders and the administration's cruelty, as Julian Castro asserts?
As I've argued in this space, the comprehensive immigration-reform bill of 2013 enjoyed bipartisan support, and there's still widespread approval for its core elements: stronger border enforcement, a path to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants, and a shift to skills-based admission criteria. What these policies lack is the explicit support of a Democratic candidate who could make a case for them, which must include a defense on both the merits and the politics. Without a full-throated defense, this balanced approach to immigration would be dismissed by the left as a timid capitulation to President Trump. The same goes for every issue contested among Democrats.
As the front-runner and an avowed supporter of bipartisanship, Joe Biden has an opportunity to make this case in a way that gains public attention. So far, he has tried to stay out of intraparty battles, preferring to attack Mr. Trump. Although the short-term benefits of this stance are clear, it is not the best basis for waging an effective presidential campaign against an incumbent who is prepared to tar the Democratic nominee with a very broad brush.
If the former vice president is not willing to step forward, he will create an opening for others who are prepared to be bolder. For example, Sen. Michael Bennet was an author of the 2013 immigration bill and continues to defend it. He rejects Medicare for All in favor of expanding the Affordable Care Act with a public option, which he does not regard as a way station to a single-payer system. He is one of the few candidates to reject Mr. Castro's demand to decriminalize unauthorized entry.
Asked by the New York Times whether anyone deserves to have a billion dollars, Mr. Bennet responded, "People in a capitalist country are going to have a billion dollars." The real issue, he said, is the decline in economic mobility, without which democracy cannot survive. And he tartly dismisses the proposal, discussed by Pete Buttigieg and others, to expand the Supreme Court to 15 justices: "I think it would meet the same fate as when Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the court," he says.
Now Mr. Bennet has the chance to make the case for the kind of politics his positions reflect. Others -- including Amy Klobuchar, John Delaney, Steve Bullock and John Hickenlooper, if his campaign survives -- have a similar opportunity.
The positions the Democratic left is pushing would be a very hard sell in a general election. The 2020 Democratic platform could turn out to be the longest suicide note ever. And a chance to begin healing our fractured politics would be lost.

Texto completo: Fifteen-year-old Coco Gauff had a memorable run at Wimbledon this year, including defeating her idol, Venus Williams, in the opening round. She lost in the fourth round Monday to Simona Halep but is already turning her attention to the future.
"I'm going to go and practice and improve some things," Gauff told the Associated Press before smiling and adding, "so that next time, I can win the tournament."
Gauff was the youngest player to qualify to compete in Wimbledon in the professional era. Then she upset Williams. And then she became the youngest player to reach Week 2 at the All England Club since 1991.

She was ranked 313th when Wimbledon began and is projected to jump into the top 150 next week.
But what's truly next for Gauff? She is about two weeks away from finishing her freshman year of high school, via the internet-based Florida Virtual School.
"I don't even know what today is," Gauff said. "These past two weeks, I didn't know what day it was. All I knew is, 'Oh, I play tomorrow.' My mind has just been somewhere else. I already had respect for the people who win [Grand Slam titles]. But now, like, experiencing one and being to the second week, I have way more respect, because I can see how difficult it is to be able to stay focused for two weeks. It's just a lot. It's a lot. But I can see myself doing better in the future."

Our next one comes from David Weber of Avondale, Ariz.:
"I'm 66 and a lifelong Angeleno (until moving to Arizona in April). There are so many great sports moments I recall. But the one that was the most emotional for me was the Lakers' championship in 1972.
"I suffered, really suffered with them in the [1960s], particularly the devastating loss in the '69 Finals. I started college in the fall of 1971 (UCSB -- go Gauchos!), and my dormmates and I would watch or listen to all the Lakers games. During the 33-game winning streak (kids, ask your parents), we developed a ritual of playing Elton John's 'Burn Down the Mission' before every game. Great song; no idea what it had to do with basketball. That's rituals for you."
Bedtime story
Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman hit eight homers in 2016 and 19 in 2017 before making the leap to 31 last season. He already has 23 home runs at the All-Star break this year and is on pace for 41 this season. What caused the surge in power?
Bregman thanks teammate Justin Verlander. Bregman told the New York Times that the star pitcher approached him in May 2018 and said he looked fatigued. He asked him how many hours of sleep he gets per night, and Bregman said about six.
Verlander told him he should be sleeping at least 10 hours every night.
"I felt like that's overdoing it," Bregman recalled thinking. "You shouldn't sleep that much. Then I started sleeping that much and, next thing you know, I hit 30 homers after that."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A cache of powerful American missiles was sold to France before ending up in the hands of rebel fighters loyal to Gen. Khalifa Hifter, who is seeking to overthrow the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli.
The four Javelin anti-tank missiles, which cost more than $ 170,000 each and are usually sold only to close American allies, were recovered last month by Libyan government forces during a raid on a rebel camp in Gheryan, a town in the mountains south of Tripoli.
A French military adviser denied on Tuesday that the weapons were transferred to General Hifter, which would violate the sales agreement with the United States as well as a United Nations arms embargo. It would also put Washington at odds over Libya policy with France, a staunch NATO partner and ally in other hot spots like West Africa.
Over the past several days, the State Department investigated the origins of the missiles, using their serial numbers and other information, and concluded that they had originally been sold to France, which has been a strong supporter of General Hifter. France agreed to buy up to 260 Javelins from the United States in 2010, according to the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
Two United States officials said the State Department briefed House and Senate foreign relations panels on Monday about its conclusion that the missiles were sold to France. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the classified briefing. Spokesmen for the congressional committees and the State Department declined to comment.
On Tuesday, an adviser to the French armed forces minister confirmed that the Javelin missiles found in Gheryan belonged to French forces but said they were damaged and no longer usable. Responding to questions from The New York Times, he said the missiles were being temporarily stored in a warehouse awaiting destruction and were not transferred to local forces.
The French adviser, who under his government's policy was not authorized to be identified by name to discuss the issue, said the weapons were among those that were bought from the United States in 2010, and were intended to protect French troops deployed in Libya for intelligence and counterterrorism operations.
He said they did not violate arms embargoes in Libya, calling it out of the question that the missiles would be sold or otherwise transferred to "anybody" in Libya.
But that account left many questions unanswered about how the weapons ended up in a rebel compound near the front lines of a battle that the United Nations said on Tuesday has led to over 1,000 deaths since April, including 106 civilians.
French special forces troops deployed to Libya, including three killed in 2016, have largely been based in the east of the country, far from Tripoli where the fighting has been concentrated.
The issue could come up on Wednesday when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hears testimony from R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state in the bureau of political-military affairs. Mr. Cooper is scheduled to testify about the Trump administration's use of an emergency declaration to push through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a plan he defended last month to a House committee.
The Javelin missiles were discovered after forces loyal to the United Nations-backed national unity government carried out a successful surprise attack on June 26 on Gheryan, a mountain redoubt 40 miles south of Tripoli. Gheryan was the headquarters for General Hifter's military campaign to seize control of Tripoli.
After capturing Gheryan, pro-government fighters uncovered Chinese-made attack drones and the stack of four American-made Javelin missiles at an abandoned base. Known in the military as "fire and forget" weapons, the Javelins are guided by infrared technology and are capable of destroying all currently fielded main battle tanks.
Markings on the missiles' shipping containers at first appeared to indicate that they were originally sold to the United Arab Emirates, an important American partner, in 2008. Other crates at the captured base, containing 155 mm artillery shells, had markings of the Emirati military, but the Emirati government, one of General Hifter's most committed foreign backers, strongly denied providing the general's forces with the missiles.
The discovery of the Javelin missiles confirmed longstanding fears that foreign sponsorship on all sides of Libya's conflict is amplifying the fighting.
General Hifter, the aspiring strongman based in eastern Libya whose forces were storing the Javelins, relied on military assistance from the United Arab Emirates, France and Egypt in his fight to capture the eastern city of Benghazi, his current headquarters.
During the grinding battle for control of Benghazi between 2014 and 2017, the Emiratis supplied attack helicopters, warplanes and drones to General Hifter's air force. Egypt carried out airstrikes against the eastern city of Derna in support of his forces.
Then in July 2016, the then-president of France, François Hollande, said that three members of the French Special Forces had been killed in a helicopter crash in Libya during "dangerous intelligence operations." Days earlier, an Islamist militia fighting against General Hifter said it had shot down a helicopter 45 miles south of Benghazi.
A year later, France told a panel of United Nations investigators that its military activities in Libya conformed to international law.
Critics, though, said it was another example of how the United Nations arms embargo, in place since 2011, has been widely flouted by Middle Eastern and European powers seeking to influence the outcome of the war.
United Nations inspectors have documented numerous breaches of the embargo by the United Arab Emirates, which has stationed warplanes on an air base that it runs in eastern Libya, in territory controlled by General Hifter. More recently, experts say, the Emirates has stepped up its military assistance to General Hifter as he presses his assault on Tripoli, including armed Chinese drones and a Russian-made surface-to-air missile system.
On the other side of the war, Qatar and Turkey have funded Islamist factions in Libya since 2011. American officials say the Qataris have scaled back their involvement in recent years, but Turkey has ramped up its engagement.
As the fight for Tripoli intensified, the Turks sent armed drones and armored vehicles to the forces of the Government of National Unity, which is backed by the United Nations and was defending the capital against attack by General Hifter.

Texto completo: WOODSTOCK, N.H.
Hungry bears force camping area to close
A camping area in New Hampshire's White Mountain National Forest has been closed due to bears, officials said Sunday. The Tripoli Road camping area was closed due to increased black bear sightings caused by campers not storing food properly, White Mountain National Forest spokeswoman Colleen Mainville said. “The bears become used to seeing food in a campsite; they will go back to a campsite," Mainville said. “They remember how they got the food the last time." The site is located off Interstate 93 in Woodstock, N.H., and is usually a popular roadside camping site, District Ranger Brooke Brown said in a statement. The White Mountain National Forest advises campers to store food in a locked vehicle or bear container, keep campsites clean, and place trash in the bear-proof dumpsters.

State delays deadline for Medicaid terms
New Hampshire is delaying implementation of new work requirements for Medicaid recipients after fewer than a third of those subject to the rules were in compliance last month. In reauthorizing the state's expanded Medicaid program last year, lawmakers added rules requiring most recipients to spend at least 100 hours a month working, going to school, or participating in community service. June was the first month for which participants had to document their hours, but of the nearly 25,000 people subject to the requirements, only 8,000 complied. The state was scheduled to send letters to the other 17,000 people this week notifying them that they were in danger of losing coverage, but instead is delaying implementation until the end of September, Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeff Meyers said.

PORTLAND
LePage didn't disclose Montreal, D.C. trips
Maine's former Republican governor spent all or part of at least 80 days outside of the state during his last year in office, according to travel records that revealed trips that had not previously been disclosed. The information was contained in former governor Paul LePage's 2018 calendar and hundreds of pages of records related to his travel obtained by the Portland Press Herald through a public records request and published Monday. LePage was known for not making his daily schedule public ahead of time, unlike his Democratic predecessor, and the records also revealed some trips that had never been disclosed. His spokeswoman didn't respond to requests for comment. LePage took five trips to Washington, D.C., to visit Trump administration officials. That includes a previously undisclosed Sept. 23-24 stay at the Trump International Hotel for a meeting at the White House. LePage's last year in office also included a trade mission to the Balkan nation of Montenegro, which receives assistance from Maine's National Guard through a Defense Department program. (AP)

Governor says registry stopped ICE sharing
The Vermont governor's office says the state's Department of Motor Vehicles stopped sharing facial recognition information with federal immigration authorities in 2017. Reports in the Washington Post and New York Times say Vermont was one of three states across the country where Immigration and Customs Enforcement asked for drivers' license information of undocumented immigrants and one of two that shared that information with federal agents.

Russian cyberthreats a 'blinking red light'

Texto completo: National security adviser John Bolton recently declared that "we're now opening the aperture, broadening the areas we're prepared to act" in cyberspace to meet a Russian threat that extends far beyond the ballot box, costing American companies billions of dollars and posing unacceptable risks to our citizens' safety and the American way of life.
It's about time.
For years, the Russians have been preparing the digital battlefield, treating our critical infrastructure as if it were their own cyber weapons range.
Overseas they've gone even further. In 2015 and 2016, the Kremlin planted malware in Ukraine's electric grid, disrupting power for hundreds of thousands of residents in the middle of winter. Keenly aware of its capabilities and motivations, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has said that "the warning lights are blinking red again" — an allusion to CIA Director George Tenet's warning to Congress just months before Sept. 11.
The federal government has a fundamental responsibility to deter Russia and other state actors from holding civilian infrastructure at risk. This is precisely why reports from the New York Times that the United States is embedding "potentially crippling malware" in Russia's power grid should concern all Americans. Cyber weapons are horrible deterrents — and mimicking targeting civilian infrastructure sets a dangerous precedent for America.
Fear of punishment or retribution is a fundamental tenet of deterrence theory. And it's true, as the head of U.S. Cyber Command, Army Gen. Paul Nakasone told a Senate panel last year the Russians "don't fear us." But to think that Vladimir Putin fears cyber-induced power outages in Moscow is a naive and dangerous miscalculation. To the contrary, an American cyberattack against Russia's power grid would play right into the Kremlin's strategic playbook.
First, the costs to the Kremlin would pale in comparison with the benefits. The vast scale of Russia's power grids would render the military effects of any cyberattack relatively limited while granting the Kremlin its long-awaited case study of American cyber aggression, which it would use to consolidate domestic support for more censorship policies under the guise of cybersecurity.
Furthermore, an American cyberattack against civilian infrastructure — especially a preventative one aimed at deterring Russian hackers — would erode the United States' international credibility as a champion of a free and open internet governed by universal norms of acceptable behavior. And finally, what better way to justify an even more persistent cyber presence in American infrastructure than in the name of self-defense? Fighting cyber with cyber is inherently escalatory, and reports of American cyber operations targeting Russia's power grid — true or not — will inevitably trigger an equal and opposite response.
We cannot fall into the trap of applying nuclear rules of deterrence to today's Cold War of digital proportions. Cyber weapons can be a tremendous military asset, especially if used as a proportionate means of neutralizing conventional weapons — as took place last month when the Trump administration approved cyber strikes against the Iranian missile systems that took down a U.S. drone. But they are not conducive to threatening punishment.
President Donald Trump says it's "NOT TRUE" that the United States is increasing cyberattacks on Russia's power grid. I hope he's right. No nation should target civilian infrastructure via cyberspace. It's wrong and not in our long-term national interest.

Trump and the Sex Offender; Guess why the press makes a villain out of Jeffrey Epstein's only successful prosecutor?

Texto completo: Anybody who has read about Jeffrey Epstein in the past dozen years would come away with the same impression Mr. Epstein apparently had about himself. The guy will soon be back in jail.
In his luxurious Manhattan townhouse, he reportedly commissioned a mural of himself at the center of a prison yard. According to the New York Times, he told a recent visitor, "That's me, and I had this painted because there is always the possibility that could be me again.''
Mr. Epstein is back in a holding cell, under indictment by a U.S. attorney in New York. He will have his day in court. Presumably we will find out whether the evidence against the hedge-fund impresario for sexually abusing numerous underage girls in the early 2000s is as strong as it seems.
But one element of the story should give us pause, and that's the seemingly concerted effort by the press to make a secondary villain out of the only prosecutor who succeeded in holding Mr. Epstein accountable till now because, 12 years later, that prosecutor is Donald Trump's labor secretary.
A much-cited story in the Miami Herald last November is headlined "How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime." The paper thereby invokes a previously unknown form of retroactive quantum action at a distance, since Alexander Acosta's actions as a U.S. attorney in Florida in 2007 could not have been premised on Mr. Trump being president a decade later.
The headline is also misleading. In fact, the Herald's 5,000-word exposé tells us very little about the reasons and circumstances behind the 2008 plea deal in which Mr. Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two felonies, serve an 18-month jail sentence, pay restitution to certain victims, and accept designation for life as a registered sex offender.
Instead, the paper tells us what its own sources are willing to say now about Mr. Epstein more than a decade after the prosecution. What a newspaper can report in 2018 and what a prosecutor can prove in 2007 are two very different things. A fact the Herald also should have made plain: It was precisely Mr. Epstein's conviction at the hands of Mr. Acosta that helped fuel the filing of civil lawsuits and emergence of newly declared victims that became the basis for the Herald's own reporting.
Making an even bigger joke of the paper's positioning of Mr. Acosta as Mr. Epstein's protector is this glaring fact: It wasn't Mr. Acosta but New York County's district attorney—a member of the city's ruling Democratic elite, with the illustrious name of Cyrus Vance Jr.—who in 2011 sought to undo Mr. Acosta's work by relieving Mr. Epstein of his Level 3 sex offender status in New York state.
But then Mr. Vance is not a member of the Trump administration.
Maybe none of the prosecutors involved in this matter belong in the pantheon, but Mr. Acosta convicted Mr. Epstein and ended his depredations. Ninety-seven percent of federal prosecutions end in plea deals. The Herald tells us almost nothing about why this one did as well, except to note in passing that Mr. Vance later argued before a New York judge that Mr. Epstein's "underage victims failed to cooperate in the [Florida] case."
In fact, our best information right now comes from a three-page letter Mr. Acosta himself wrote to the Daily Beast in 2011. He described how his office was recruited into an already-existing prosecution by Palm Beach police who feared their state prosecutor intended to let Mr. Epstein off with probation. Mr. Acosta's role was hindered by the need to find a federal crime to charge. He also had to show deference to Florida. Mr. Epstein's well-connected legal team—including Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr—kept appealing over his head to Washington. It sought dirt on Mr. Acosta's staff in hopes of disqualifying key underlings from the case. He fretted about a drawn-out prosecution in which Mr. Epstein would walk free. He had no role in Florida's subsequent decision to let Mr. Epstein out of jail six days a week to continue his business. Mr. Acosta also says that with the witnesses who subsequently have come forward, he could have made a stronger case.
The outcome may not have been deeply satisfying, but Mr. Acosta persevered to a conviction despite Mr. Epstein's deep pockets and his constantly invoked list of powerful "friends," including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Donald Trump (though it was Mr. Trump who, in typically Trumpian fashion, raised an eyebrow as early as 2002 with a comment to New York magazine about the apparent youth of Mr. Epstein's girlfriends).
It also bears asking: Would the Herald even have invested in reporting the Epstein story if it couldn't also have flounced up an anti-Trump angle?
Yes, it's been rough couple of decades for the newspaper business. At the kindest, the Herald should have had the confidence to rest its claim to public attention on what it had to reveal about Mr. Epstein's behavior rather than trying so pathetically to annex its reporting to an au courant anti-Trump narrative.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended herself against criticism from liberals and activists in her party who saw her as dismissive of House Democrats' four freshman progressive stars.
"It wasn't dismissive, it was a statement of fact. . .nobody followed their lead," Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Monday, referencing the four first-term women lawmakers who opposed the House version of the border supplemental package that failed in the Senate.
Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York -- along with some other liberal lawmakers -- wanted the border supplemental to include stronger restrictions for how the Trump administration would spend the money Congress authorizes. Democratic leaders made the House version of the bill stricter, but the four still didn't support it.
Mrs. Pelosi then moved to put the Senate-passed $4.6 billion border supplemental package on the floor for a vote at the urging of moderate members who saw it as the only legislation that could pass before the recess. The bill passed.
The move led to acrimony and name-calling in the House and marked the first time this year that Mrs. Pelosi publicly failed to align the centrist and far-left flanks of her party in a vote on the floor.
That anger spilled over this weekend, when Mrs. Pelosi appeared to dismiss the quartet's influence in an interview with the New York Times. When asked about outrage from the party's left flank, she said: "All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. . .but they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got."
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez on her own has 4.68 million followers on Twitter. Mrs. Pelosi has 2.66 million. But the speaker, who is renowned by both Democrats and Republicans for her ability to count votes, is focused on who can actually get legislation passed.
"They have a following in the public, I'm just talking in the Congress," Mrs. Pelosi said.
Mrs. Pelosi has faced calls from the left to more aggressively confront President Trump on immigration policy, and roughly 80 members of her caucus have called for his impeachment.

U.S. Foreign News Agency Rocked by Faked Report And Financial Misconduct

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The United States Agency for Global Media, the government's foreign broadcast service, already struggling to clean house after a series of scandals last year at flagship operations like Voice of America and TV Martí, is now being rocked by two new cases that have raised further questions about its journalistic and financial management.
In one, Tomás Regalado Jr., a reporter for TV Martí, which broadcasts into Cuba, and a cameraman for the network, Rodolfo Hernandez, were suspended amid allegations that they faked a mortar attack on Mr. Regalado during a broadcast from Managua, Nicaragua, last year.
That incident surfaced only days after Haroon Ullah, the former chief strategy officer at the global media agency, which operates Martí and foreign-language networks around the world, pleaded guilty on June 27 in federal court in Alexandria, Va., to stealing government property.
A former deputy to the agency's chief executive, John Lansing, Mr. Ullah admitted to fleecing the government of $ 37,000 between February and October last year by claiming reimbursements for expensive hotels he did not book, double-billing the government for official travel and forging a doctor's note to allow him to fly business class. He faces up to 10 years in prison.
The new problems are unrelated to each other; in the case of Mr. Ullah, the agency said its internal controls flagged the expense fraud. But along with many others over the past two years, the scandals have brought intensified scrutiny and criticism to the agency, formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Created during World War II to be an objective, trusted source of information in nations where freedom of the press is under attack, the agency has 3,500 journalists who reach more than 345 million people in 100 countries each week.
The United States Agency for Global Media initiated an investigation into the allegedly faked segment at TV Martí "immediately after these concerns about the footage in question were raised," the agency said in a statement. "As the agency has made clear, we have zero tolerance for failing to honor clear and universally accepted standards of professional journalism. We also owe it to all involved to conduct a thorough and clear investigation to get all of the facts."
"I take seriously any breach of professional journalistic standards at any U.S.A.G.M. network. I have asked for a thorough and swift investigation," Mr. Lansing said in an emailed statement. "I expect all U.S.A.G.M. networks to adhere to truthfulness, fairness and accountability in their reporting."
Mr. Regalado is the son of Tomás Regalado Sr., the director of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which oversees Radio and TV Martí. The senior Mr. Regalado was hired last year and said he would help raise the outlet's professional standards after it came to light that Martí had previously aired multiple broadcasts calling the financier and Democratic donor George Soros, a longtime opponent of authoritarianism, "a nonbelieving Jew of flexible morals" and other slurs.
Results of an investigation into those broadcasts, released in May, found that "the video, radio and web content of Radio Televisión Martí falls far short" of the agency's ethical standards and stated mission and in a misguided way mixes propaganda with the foreign policy objectives of the United States. Several staff members and contractors were dismissed for their roles in the anti-Soros broadcast.
The younger Mr. Regalado did not immediately return phone calls or respond to a text message seeking comment. Mr. Hernandez declined to comment, citing the investigation. The allegedly faked broadcast from Nicaragua has been removed from Martí's website.
Rare for the Trump era, the agency is still run by Obama-era executives, including Mr. Lansing, a journalist and former president of Scripps Networks, and Amanda Bennett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter and editor who leads Voice of America. Mr. Trump has nominated his own choice to lead the agency -- Michael Pack, a conservative documentary filmmaker and associate of Stephen K. Bannon, the president's former strategist -- but the nomination awaits a vote in the Senate.
The Regalado family is active in Florida politics. The elder Mr. Regalado is a former Spanish-language journalist and mayor of Miami. He said in an interview last year that he was recommended for the job by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. The younger Mr. Regalado worked at Martí before his father took the job there.
In a brief telephone interview, the senior Mr. Regalado said that he had raised questions about the appearance of nepotism before taking the top job at Martí. "Legal counsel said there is no issue because he was there before, and I would not ever be his supervisor," he said.
Mr. Regalado declined to speak about the investigation, saying he had recused himself from it. He added that he planned to continue in his role at Martí.
The disputed report from Nicaragua showed the younger Mr. Regalado reporting from a mostly empty street when a small explosion occurred behind him. Mr. Regalado's Facebook page displays an Instagram photo that appears to be from the Martí broadcast, saying it was taken "in the streets of Managua near the university after a mortar landed less than 2 feet away from me, shot by the rebels from the back of a make shift wall."
Footage aired last week on the Spanish-language media outlet CiberCuba and others shows three young men, two of them with their faces obscured by a balaclava and a bandanna, placing a small explosive into a pipe and lighting its fuse. The camera follows the device as it arcs from the pipe and explodes with a small bang in an area behind Mr. Regalado, who then jogs forward. Laughter can be heard. Mr. Regalado's Facebook post and other materials were viewed by The New York Times.
In December, the Agency for Global Media awarded Mr. Hernandez, a cameraman with decades of experience, its David Burke Distinguished Journalism Award for "his intrepid determination and enthusiastic reporting from Colombia, Nicaragua" and other places. A videotaped tribute to Mr. Hernandez shows him traveling with Mr. Regalado, saying, "In Nicaragua, his reporting on the political demonstrations and government violence kept Cubans informed."
Mr. Ullah, an expert in South Asia diplomacy, joined the agency in 2017 from the State Department. He was hired by Mr. Lansing, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to lead the agency in 2015.
Under Mr. Lansing's leadership, the agency has introduced new coverage of Russia and Iran, while working to counter a string of ethical scandals.
Voice of America, the flagship of American government efforts to promote its values abroad, was shaken in October when 15 of its journalists were fired or disciplined after an internal investigation found they accepted "brown envelopes," or bribes, passed to them by a Nigerian official.
Weeks later, Voice of America fired the chief of its Mandarin-language section after a billionaire Chinese exile who is championed by some on the American right and is known for making unsubstantiated charges against Beijing was promised a three-hour live broadcast.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

America isn't perfect, but it is exceptional

Texto completo: Two foreign observers deserve credit for coining the notion of American exceptionalism. It was Alexis de Tocqueville, in his book "Democracy in America," which remains the greatest examination of American government ever written, who first connected the idea.
"The position of the Americans," he wrote, "is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."
It is easy, now that more than half of the world's nations are democracies, to think that this was always the standard, but in the 1830s when the first volume of the book was released, the American model remained quite abnormal. It would be an additional 100 years before the growth of democracy really began on a global scale. In America, Tocqueville recognized something uniquely forward-looking, separate from a mere inheritance of the European tradition, but a bold new direction that the rest of the world would have to learn from.
What for him was a defining American characteristic was for Karl Marx, decades later, a source of confusion.
The world became more like America Though Marx never visited America, he was enamored with it and the conundrum it created for his worldview. America was an industrial nation with the supposed prerequisites for communism, yet it never developed a class system or seriously entertained a proletariat uprising. This, he reasoned, could only be temporary. The United States might be an exception now, he reasoned, but as the population grew, land became less abundant and more time passed, it too would bend toward communism.
Tocqueville was right, and Marx was wrong. America's conditions never led to a communist revolution, yet Europe and the rest of the world did grow more democratic. Thinking more in line with Tocqueville's view, that America is not merely an exception but that it is exceptional, took root and has long been central to the national identity.
There is an evident effort by the postmodern left to change that today though, to reduce the notion not only of American exceptionalism but also American history as a whole to nothing more than a vile unsalvageable blip, relevant only as a study in institutionalized power structures.
A combination of this influence and the omnipresent fear of angering the "woke left," ready at their keyboards to unleash social media rage, has encouraged many Democratic politicians to refrain from patriotic gestures, or worse, to seek a pathway by undermining America's achievements.
Patriotism is not a dirty word Recently, New York Times columnist Bari Weiss, appearing on Bill Maher's television show, raised frustration with the reservation of Democratic presidential candidates to appear patriotic. They are "scared to touch" patriotism, she said.
This is most plainly understood as a rejection of American exceptionalism and one that has infected parts of the Democratic base. A Gallup poll this year, conducted annually near Independence Day, found that only 22% of Democrats are "extremely proud" to be American, a 10-point decrease since last year and a 34-point decline since just 2013.
There is any number of statistics that could demonstrate the contrast, displaying that America remains an exceptional nation, from donations to charity, to work ethic, to religiosity, to the nations that still look to us for inspiration. But it is even more so what the most liberal of critics willfully ignore. America is not exceptional because it is perfect; it is exceptional because it measures itself against, and strives for, perfection. We retain the greatest structure of self-government ever created.
For that reason and more, feel no shame in being extremely proud to be an American.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) defended herself against criticism from liberals and activists in her party who saw her as dismissive of House Democrats' four freshman progressive stars.
"It wasn't dismissive, it was a statement of fact…nobody followed their lead," Mrs. Pelosi said Monday, referencing the four first-term women lawmakers who opposed the House version of the border supplemental package that failed in the Senate.
Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York—along with some other liberal lawmakers—wanted the border supplemental to include stronger restrictions for how the administration would spend the money Congress authorizes.

Mrs. Pelosi then moved to put the Senate-passed $4.6 billion border supplemental package on the floor for a vote at the urging of moderate members who saw it as the only legislation that could pass before the recess. The bill passed, but Mrs. Pelosi picked up more Republicans than Democrats.
The move led to acrimony and name-calling in the House and marked the first time this year that Mrs. Pelosi publicly failed to align the centrist and far-left flanks of her party in a vote on the floor.

That anger spilled over this weekend, when Mrs. Pelosi appeared to dismiss the quartet's influence in an interview with the New York Times. When asked about outrage from the party's left flank, she said: "All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world…but they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got."
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez on her own has 4.68 million followers on Twitter. Mrs. Pelosi has 2.66 million. But the speaker, who is renowned by both Democrats and Republicans for her ability to count votes, is focused on who can actually get legislation passed.
"They have a following in the public, I'm just talking in the Congress," Mrs. Pelosi said on Monday.
Mrs. Pelosi has faced calls from the left to more aggressively confront President Trump on immigration policy, and roughly 80 members of her caucus have called for impeachment. Her determination to rely on the court process, as the White House defies numerous subpoenas, has infuriated Mr. Trump's opposition, who look to Mrs. Pelosi to block the president.
"Honor the fact that we are there," Ms. Tlaib said on Sunday when asked about her message to the speaker. "All of us have experiences that I think have been missing in the halls of Congress. Honor that. Respect that. Put us at the table."
The Democratic freshmen have also given a megaphone to liberal ideas that are shaping the party's presidential primary, such as how Congress should address climate change and how to expand government health care.
Mrs. Pelosi often says she espouses the party's liberal ideas. She was a co-founder of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which all four freshmen women are a part of. But when first asked about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal to combat climate change, Mrs. Pelosi called it the "green new dream, or whatever."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is hailing "America's environmental leadership" at the White House today and noting improvements in U.S. air and water quality. It's also an opportunity for the President to note his progress in eliminating rules which harm consumers and workers but provide few environmental benefits. Voters seem to like his approach, even if reporters don't.
"From 1970 to 2018, the combined emissions of the most common air pollutants fell 74 percent while the economy grew over 275 percent," says a White House press release. "While energy-related CO2 emissions increased slightly in 2018 due to weather and economic growth, emissions are projected to decline in 2019 and 2020," adds the white House.
Katie Rogers and Coral Davenport offer another view in the New York Times:
President Trump has withdrawn the United States from the international Paris climate change accord, sought to roll back or weaken over 80 environmental regulations and punted on global environmental leadership.
"On the issue of environmental stewardship," said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, "Trump is seen around the world as a Darth Vader-like figure."
Currently the whole world doesn't get to vote in U.S. elections, though perhaps this question should be put to candidates at the next Democratic presidential debate. As for the job Mr. Trump is doing on behalf of the Americans who elected him, the Times report does give the President some credit:
In an administration that has often had a muddled approach to policy, both Mr. Trump's allies and his enemies agree that in initiating the rollback of environmental rules he has clearly delivered on his campaign promises....
As part of that approach, Mr. Trump is expected to deliver a "center right" speech, according to one White House official, and criticize policy proposals put forth by Democrats — especially the Green New Deal proposed by Democrats in Congress — that he will try to paint as aggressive and unreasonable.
It's not clear how hard one has to try to paint the Green New Deal as aggressive and unreasonable, given that not a single senator was willing to vote for its consideration in March. What is clear is that Mr. Trump has a decent chance of re-election because of his deregulatory economic program.
Like many other polls, the latest ABC/Washington Post survey finds that the economy is the top issue for voters as they look ahead to the 2020 elections—and the one clear strength for the incumbent.
"The economy is the lone issue in the survey where Trump enjoys positive numbers," report Dan Balz and Emily Guskin of the Post. Specifically, 51% of respondents approve of the President's handling of economic issues, compared to 42% who disapprove. Also, the Posties report that voters are lately giving Mr. Trump more of the credit for our current prosperity.
And at least for now, voters seem to prefer Presidents who prefer markets over central planning. According to the Post report:
Asked a generic question about a matchup between Trump and a candidate regarded as a socialist, the president holds a slight edge of 49 percent to 43 percent among registered voters.
Also, when asked which issues are highly important, survey participants have a significant list of concerns they prioritize above climate change. Mr. Balz and Ms. Guskin write:
Overall, the top issues for Americans as the 2020 election nears are the economy, health care and immigration. Foreign policy, gun violence, taxes, issues of special concern to women and abortion follow behind.
Those voters who remain skeptical about forecasts of ecological doom may especially resent bureaucratic gestures which waste their time and money. For such voters, there's more good news emanating from the Trump deregulation project. Regular readers may recall last year's column on the burgeoning movement to make dishwashers great again—by restoring their ability to clean quickly and thoroughly. Consumers fed up with federal mandates requiring low-energy appliances may soon enjoy some relief.
The Competitive Enterprise Institute says in a press release that the Department of Energy has approved its petition to address "the problem of slow dishwasher cycle times." The think tank elaborates:
CEI's petition argues these regulations have harmed consumers, wasting huge amounts of people's time and making life miserable for families. The average dishwasher cycle today is more than 2 hours, while decades ago it was one hour.
Kudos to Secretary of Energy Rick Perry for prioritizing consumers in federal rule-making.
This column can only imagine how well the economy will perform once the Trump deregulation project makes its way to trade policy.

An envelope addressed to him had contained a letter that purported to be infused with ricin.
"By the time Collins finished her stressful two-hour drive from Portland, her street was blocked off with yellow crime-scene tape and her home taken over by the local police and fire department, the FBI and the army's weapons of mass destruction unit. The house was quarantined, including their black Lab puppy.

Disunity plagues Democrats as legislative tests loom

Texto completo: House Democrats are careening toward intraparty battles that will test Speaker Nancy Pelosi's authority over her caucus, as frustrated lawmakers embark on a legislative-heavy July filled with issues that divide their ranks.
Members return from the Fourth of July recess on Tuesday to deal with a defense policy bill that some worry won't pass because of disputes between moderates and liberals over the amount of money to give the Pentagon. Democrats are also increasingly divided over how - or even whether - they should try to pass a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security to restrict the Trump administration's proposed deportations and ensure migrants are treated humanely.
At the same time, Democratic leaders are hoping to pass a long-stalled minimum wage increase that has split the party. And some Jewish members want a resolution condemning an anti-Israel protest to receive a vote before the long August recess - yet another divisive issue that will anger liberals who feel they've been ignored by leadership lately.
Looming is a fear that, should Democrats fail to unite around these critical bills, the House could get jammed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) - just as it did the last week of June on an emergency border bill.
House Democrats are still seething that the legislation was entirely negotiated by the Senate and ignored their demands to include standards of care for migrants in federal custody. Liberals are vowing to put up an even tougher fight to secure their own wins in July - demands that could repel centrists whose support is needed for the passage of any bill.
"I was already thinking it was going to be difficult; it's going to be even more difficult after today," said Congressional Progressive Caucus leader Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) of the defense authorization bill in late June.
Time is of the essence. Leadership aides see July as one of their last major chances to pass policy priorities ahead of next year's elections. Once they return in September, they'll be overwhelmed with budget and debt ceiling negotiations. After that, the 2020 presidential race will kick into high gear, making legislating even more difficult as Democratic presidential candidates jockey for the nomination to take on President Trump.
The July schedule will create a serious math challenge for Pelosi, who suffered her first major defeat in the border talks before the recess, exposing a rift with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).
Pelosi must deal with unhappy lawmakers at both ends of her caucus, requiring that she strike a careful balance that can win approval from the left and the center.
Emotions were still raw as Pelosi told the New York Times's Maureen Dowd that liberals such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) made themselves irrelevant by opposing the border bill.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi said. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got."
Tlaib on Sunday pushed back on Pelosi's criticism. "It is very disappointing that the speaker would ever try to diminish our voices in so many ways," Tlaib told ABC's "This Week."
The stakes, Democrats know, couldn't be higher. Should they fail to unite, McConnell could have the upper hand in negotiations on spending. It's why, during a meeting this spring, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) advised the caucus: "When friends fight, foes feast."
"We have to try to figure out a road down which the Democratic caucus can walk arm in arm," Cleaver said. "If we can't work things out in the Democratic caucus, then Congress will never get anything worked out because we have Mitch McConnell, who will fight everything. . . . We've got to stress and strain to include everyone's consideration."
The first test may be the toughest. The House will consider the typically bipartisan and popular defense bill as soon as this week. The legislation authorizes $733 billion in 2020 for aircraft, ships, personnel and other military requirements - less than the Senate Republicans' proposed $750 billion but more than the $700 billion favored by liberals who want money for domestic programs.
While liberals have applauded House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) for including their priorities, they are pressing for more concessions. And because House Republicans are not expected to vote for the bill, frustrated by the amount and policy changes at odds with the Trump administration, members of the party's left flank know their votes are needed for passage, giving them leverage.
Senior Democrats are hoping to package the bill with amendments that could ease liberals' concerns. They expect a bipartisan amendment by Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) - barring federal funds for any military force against Iran without congressional authorization - to pass. So could an amendment offered by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) to prohibit the administration from using the 2001 authorization for the use of military force - passed to counter al-Qaeda - to justify U.S. involvement in other contemporary conflicts.
"I think [there is a] good chance many progressives will back the NDAA given it's our primary vehicle for checking the president on Iran and given the alternative is an unchecked Senate bill that will be much worse," said Khanna, a liberal who sits on the Armed Services panel and could be a critical ally for Pelosi in trying to win over the left.
But Jayapal said that after what happened with the border bill, liberals will fight harder to get what they want. Their biggest concern has been the overall spending level for the Pentagon and a perception that Democrats are funding unauthorized wars, making them complicit in the Trump administration's actions, she said.
Just weeks ago, when leaders tried to put a Democratic bill on the floor, with $733 billion for defense, Jayapal personally told leadership that such totals were "impossible" for liberals to support. Those concerns still stand, she said, and she'd want to see amendments reducing the bottom line for the Pentagon.
Lowering the number, however, would repel centrists such as freshman Rep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.), whose district is home to the largest U.S. naval base. Luria, who hails from a Republican-leaning area, said she's already preparing for the likelihood that the defense bill will not have support from liberals and has been talking to her Republican colleagues about what the bill needs to win their votes.
"My goal as a member of Armed Services is to work with my colleagues across the aisle so that when we finish the markup process on the floor, we have a bill that everybody can support," she said. "This really is in my mind our most critical job in Congress."
Democrats will also have to figure out how or whether to take a stand on homeland security funding. Pelosi and her leadership team do not think they should bring a Department of Homeland Security funding measure to the floor, knowing it could tank amid infighting and embarrass the party.
But Hispanic leaders who visited detention facilities at the border over the recess say something must be done. There's also a fear that should House Democrats fail to pass anything, Senate Republicans in the fall will have the upper hand in spending negotiations.
Leadership aides believe they'll finally pass a bill increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, legislation that's been stalled for months because of concerns from centrists and moderates about small businesses that could be affected.
Another major flash point that may surface this month involves a resolution that would condemn the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Jewish members have pushed leadership - namely their top ally on the issue, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) - to allow a vote. Liberals, who view BDS as a protest of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, say the measure is too divisive to vote on now - and worry it sends the wrong message about Democrats' valuing free speech.
"I've consistently heard from leadership that we will be voting before August recess, and I know we have the votes to pass it," said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), one of the members advocating for the resolution's consideration. "They understand how critical it is that we consider this bill, particularly given growing anti-Semitism at home and globally."

Democrats grapple with a sprawling primary field

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - John Deeth is the sort of Iowa activist who keeps up with every new twist in the Democratic presidential primary, but there was no way he was going to devote two evenings to watching the first round of debates last week.
Instead Deeth, a 55-year-old from Iowa City who has volunteered for every Democratic caucus since 1992, spent one debate night watching "Goodfellas" and the other at the grocery store.
"Until this field is narrowed down to serious people, I'm not going to spend four hours watching them," Deeth said. "I'm not going to suffer through Andrew Yang."
Deeth's frustration highlights a central challenge the Democratic Party faces as it tries to identify the strongest candidate to face President Donald Trump: The slate of 24 contenders is too unwieldy for a constructive debate, many activists and strategists say, and too large for most voters to follow. And with a leadership vacuum at the top of the party, there is no one to elevate candidates with an endorsement, or help steer third-tier candidates out of the race when they've reached their plausible expiration date.
Former President Barack Obama, an influential voice among many Democrats, is sitting out the primary. The Clintons, a once-dominant party presence, are largely unwelcome this time around. In Washington, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is focused on keeping the House in order, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, has failed to recruit presidential candidates like Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas into potentially winnable Senate races.
The only kingmaker willing to crown candidates so far has been Oprah Winfrey.
The media mogul did a glowing interview with O'Rourke when the Texan was at the near-peak of his popularity in February. Since then she has moved on to Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, telling the Hollywood Reporter that she instructed director Steven Spielberg to "look him up." (She hasn't yet touted Marianne Williamson, her onetime spiritual adviser.)
Of the party's living former presidential nominees, just Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis have weighed in on the race. Mondale endorsed a fellow Minnesotan, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and Dukakis backed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who like him hails from Massachusetts. The rest are keeping their distance from the messy primary, which post-debate polling shows has bifurcated between a top tier of five candidates and everyone else vying just to qualify for the party's fall debates.
Only Obama has the stature within the party to influence the primary scramble, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said.
"If Barack Obama stood up and said, 'You other Democrats, stop going after Joe Biden for his record from 30 years ago, I knew all this stuff and I picked him to be vice president of the United States/ that might do it," he said. "But I don't think the president feels it would be right for him."
Obama has held private conversations with most of the Democrats running and speaks regularly with Biden. Obama is not likely to engage in a public way until late in the primary process.
The Clintons' connection to the primary is more complicated. Former President Bill Clinton, his legacy tarnished by sexual indiscretions and allegations of sexual assault (which he denies), is persona non grata on the campaign trail in the #MeToo era.
Hillary Clinton is still popular with many Democrats, including women, but her Electoral College loss to Trump limits her influence over party politics and on shaping the 2020 Democratic field; she has met or talked with several of the candidates, but they generally do not see her as someone who could call shots in the race.
The debate format, created by the Democratic National Committee, has added to the sprawling nature of the primary. The relatively low thresholds for the first two debates have provided an incentive for low-polling candidates to stay in at least through the end of July.
While NBC's high ratings for the first set of debates suggest high interest in the presidential campaign, party leaders in early voting states like Iowa - which have had the most exposure to the 24 Democrats in the race - say the oversaturation is counterproductive.
Other Democrats rebutted the idea that candidates should be persuaded to end their campaigns.
Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor who considered a 2020 presidential run, said the decision to drop out can only belong to the candidate.
"In a successful democracy, the candidate or the voters, and only they, should determine when it's appropriate for a candidate to drop out," Patrick said. The field, he said, "is not too big."
Veterans of the bitter 2016 primary between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont recall Sanders' complaints that the Democratic machinery was rigged against him, and wince at the possibility that claims of favoritism or disputes over viability could again prove divisive.
For that crowd, the party's debate thresholds - due to rise to 130,000 unique donors and 2% in at least four polls by September, double the requirements for the first two debates - is a recipe for producing grievances from candidates who don't qualify.
"It is crazy dangerous for the DNC to take on the role of limiting the field," said Jennifer Palmieri, who was communications director for Clinton's campaign. "Even if you have good intentions, the unintended consequences of that could be pretty devastating."
Donna Brazile, who became chairwoman of the DNC after revelations that her predecessor, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had favored Clinton, said people should remind themselves the second-tier candidates won't be around much longer.
"The biggest part is going to be dominated by the top four or the top two," she said. "It's like the NFL, we don't complain about the number of teams we see during the season, we want to know who has the best players to get to the playoffs."
The Democratic Party chairman, Tom Perez, said he considered the debates a roaring success, marked by high TV ratings and a focus on policy issues, while avoiding the attack-driven fireworks that characterized the 2016 Republican debates.

Texto completo: A Gallup poll this year, conducted annually near Independence Day, found that only 22% of Democrats are "extremely proud" to be American, a 10-point decrease since last year and a 34-point decline since just 2013.
Two foreign observers deserve credit for coining the notion of American exceptionalism. It was Alexis de Tocqueville, in his book "Democracy in America," which remains the greatest examination of American government ever written, who first connected the idea.
"The position of the Americans," he wrote, "is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."
It is easy, now that more than half of the world's nations are democracies, to think that this was always the standard, but in the 1830s when the first volume of the book was released, the American model remained quite abnormal. It would be an additional 100 years before the growth of democracy really began on a global scale. In America, Tocqueville recognized something uniquely forward-looking, separate from a mere inheritance of the European tradition, but a bold new direction that the rest of the world would have to learn from.
What for him was a defining American characteristic was for Karl Marx, decades later, a source of confusion.
The world became more like America Though Marx never visited America, he was enamored with it and the conundrum it created for his worldview. America was an industrial nation with the supposed prerequisites for communism, yet it never developed a class system or seriously entertained a proletariat uprising. This, he reasoned, could only be temporary. The United States might be an exception now, he reasoned, but as the population grew, land became less abundant and more time passed, it too would bend toward communism. America's future, Marx reassured his followers, was to be more like Europe, the opposite of Tocqueville's proclamation.
Tocqueville was right, and Marx was wrong. America's conditions never led to a communist revolution, yet Europe and the rest of the world did grow more democratic. Thinking more in line with Tocqueville's view, that America is not merely an exception but that it is exceptional, took root and has long been central to the national identity.
There is an evident effort by the postmodern left to change that today though, to reduce the notion not only of American exceptionalism but also American history as a whole to nothing more than a vile unsalvageable blip, relevant only as a study in institutionalized power structures.
A combination of this influence and the omnipresent fear of angering the "woke left," ready at their keyboards to unleash social media rage, has encouraged many Democratic politicians to refrain from patriotic gestures, or worse, to seek a pathway by undermining America's achievements.
This trend was evident on this year's remembrance of Juneteenth, which was hijacked by a contingent of postmodern leftists who went through the preposterous public exercise of proclaiming that America had effectively made no progress, as if the nation's remarkable journey from Antietam to Bloody Sunday to Barack Obama did not occur.
Patriotism is not a dirty word Recently, New York Times columnist Bari Weiss, appearing on Bill Maher's television show, raised frustration with the reservation of Democratic presidential candidates to appear patriotic. They are "scared to touch" patriotism, she said. "They are scared to touch anything that will give them the whiff of xenophobia and bigotry and all the rest of the things that they are terrified of being accused of. And they need to come up with sensible answers to those things."
This is most plainly understood as a rejection of American exceptionalism and one that has infected parts of the Democratic base. A Gallup poll this year, conducted annually near Independence Day, found that only 22% of Democrats are "extremely proud" to be American, a 10-point decrease since last year and a 34-point decline since just 2013. Among self-identified liberals, only 21% say they are "extremely proud" to be American.
Which brings us to this week's celebration of Independence Day, where this ruinous exercise is likely to play out again.
There is any number of statistics that could demonstrate the contrast, displaying that America remains an exceptional nation, from donations to charity, to work ethic, to religiosity, to the nations that still look to us for inspiration. But it is even more so what the most liberal of critics willfully ignore. America is not exceptional because it is perfect; it is exceptional because it measures itself against, and strives for, perfection. We retain the greatest structure of self-government ever created and a people who strive constantly toward a more perfect union.
For that reason and more, feel no shame in being extremely proud to be an American.

Texto completo: Now we know why the Democrats were so upset about President Donald Trump speaking on the Fourth of July.
It was not because it was political or partisan. It was patriotic, and that is what annoys the left the most.
Several days before the speech, we heard that Trump was hijacking Independence Day and turning it into a campaign rally. But Trump never mentioned the 2020 campaign in his speech.
We heard that Trump’s desire to have tanks on the National Mall was an out-and-out authoritarian performance art. But that wasn’t really the issue. Neither was the fake outrage over the cost.
There was no mention of political opponents and no mention of the fake news media. And this wasn’t Trump co-opting the nation’s birthday to celebrate himself. In fact, for a man who loves to talk about his accomplishments, he never mentioned himself.
No, Trump did something far more dangerous to the left. He gave America a strong dose of patriotism. He gave Americans a history lesson on the great people, heroes and their great accomplishments over the past 243 years.
Earlier in the week, The New York Times ran a video arguing that America isn't the greatest nation on earth: "The U. S. is really just OK. "
Without mentioning The Times or the video, Trump proceeded to tell us about America’s greatness for nearly an hour interrupted only by applause, flyovers and military songs. At one point, I thought, “Who is this guy and what have they done with President Trump?”
“Today, we come together as one nation with this very special Salute To America,” Trump said. “We celebrate our history, our people and the heroes who proudly defend our flag — the brave men and women of the United States military!”
More from Gary Varvel: Face facts, America, Donald Trump is a success. Let's count the ways.
Donald Trump is the president I didn’t want, but now I know we need
And boy, did he. Starting with the story of America’s war for independence, Trump quoted the words and deeds of Americans that have long been forgotten but need to be remembered.
Trump told the story of Gen. George Washington as he readied his troops to fight the British invasion. Trump said, “Washington’s message to his troops laid bare the stakes. He wrote, ‘The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army. . . . We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or die. ’”
We are the millions who benefited from their sacrifice.
In reminding America of the great acts of past generations, Trump brought it to the present by honoring our first responders and all of the men and women of law enforcement. Trump also honored the Gold Star families who made the ultimate sacrifice.
Legends and icons
He introduced NASA legend Gene Kranz and told him that we’re going back to the moon, and that we’re going to plant our flag on Mars.
He also introduced and thanked civil rights icon Clarence Henderson, who was 18 in 1960 when he took part in a sit-in at a Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. “Almost six decades later, he sits tonight in a seat of honor,” Trump said. “Clarence, thank you for making this a much better place for all Americans. ”
I found it very unifying, but there were some triggers for the left.
Trump said, “This country (is) the most exceptional nation in the history of the world. . . . It is its strongest now. ” American exceptionalism annoys the left.
“We are one people, chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny,” Trump said. “We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty God. ” Mentioning God annoys the left.
I think this should become a tradition for every president from now on. With all of the partisan political fights, it was nice to be reminded of America’s amazing heritage. It was inspiring, and that’s what we need.
For one day, Trump put partisan politics aside and focused the eyes of America on our past, present and to our future.
Thanks, Mr. President.

Texto completo: Anna Quindlen, longtime New York City staple, has been a beloved novelist and journalist for decades. She has written nine novels as well as dozens and dozens of newspaper columns. For the latter she won a Pulitzer Prize. "Living out Loud" and "Thinking Out Loud" were two of her collections of New York Times columns. Her Newsweek column, "My Turn," was turned into a collection called "Loud and Clear." Her memoir, "Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake," was number 1 for many weeks on the bestseller lists.

Her children were often the focus of her columns. Now, In "Nanaville: Adventures in Grandparenting" she turns to her grandchildren.

The thing all grandparents love about their grandkids is no secret: You may spoil them and then send them home. So it is written by her and countless other writers on the subject of grandparenting.

Who is happier to see you than a grandchild? (Perhaps a puppy?) When her first grandson, Arthur, shouts "NANA! NANA!" Quindlen is ecstatic, until she realizes he is shouting for a banana. Oh well.

She says you have to bring your A game to grandparenting. It's never a good idea to lose your temper, but certainly not around a baby or young child.

And do not argue with the baby's parents! Quindlen's favorite saying in terms of grandparenting is "Did they ask you for advice?" If they didn't, she says, "BACK OFF!"

Today's grandparent is different from yesterday's. The average age of a new grandmother is about 50, she says. Fifty used to seem old, but today it seems young, given that people are living to be 90. Women are waiting longer to give birth. Our grandmothers were not into spinning classes, climbing rock mountains, working at a full-time job, discovering Botox, ziplining or wearing skinny jeans. Quindlen herself was 64 when her first grandchild was born, Her grandmother was 47.

This short and to-the-point book is perfect to give a friend who is smitten by her son or daughter's brand new, exquisite, tiny baby. At a self-help group I recently attended, many people had been perilously near death because of a difficult-to-manage disease. Some even wanted to end their life, but they found new hope and joy in the pleasure of their grandchild. And that made all the difference. (Even better than a warm puppy.)

When a Mob Leveled a Gay Cruising Spot

Texto completo: In 1969, Forest Hills was a long way from Christopher Street, and a bizarre incident of vigilante tree chopping showed just how far.
Only days before the Stonewall uprising in Greenwich Village, a mob of some 20 local men descended on the southern edge of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Using power saws and axes, they leveled a grove of trees that was known as a gay cruising spot.
According to a New York Times report at the time, "15 dogwood trees, 11 London planes, a number of wild-cherry trees and other greenery" were felled. The parks department estimated the trees would cost $ 15,000 to replace -- more than $ 100,000 today. All while police officers reportedly stood by.
By the morning of June 21, all that remained were heaps of severed trunks and tree stumps oozing sap.
A number of the "vigilantes," as they were referred to in the press, lived in an apartment complex near the park. A few weeks earlier they had formed a committee and started harassing men who met among the trees. The locals patrolled the area nightly, using walkie-talkies to communicate with one another. When they would find a couple, they shined flashlights on them and rousted the men -- who were often closeted, married or both -- from the park. Eventually, they razed the site.
An eyewitness to the destruction of the trees, Joan Luxenburg, told The New York Times some days later that she had reported the vandalism to the police in the area and offered to identify at least one of the men, but that the officers ignored her. According to her, the police said that the men "were doing a job which the police were not able to do to the satisfaction of the community."
Another man, who declined to give his name, said the police chatted with the men responsible and left without making an arrest. The police denied witnessing the crime.
One of the so-called vigilantes, a 26-year-old lawyer, told a reporter from The Times, "Admittedly it was against the law, but we had police consent," adding that his group was "concerned for the safety of the women and children."
A woman interviewed at the time, however, said: "They say they were protecting mothers and children? Nonsense. What mothers and children are out at 1 o'clock in the morning?"
A subsequent letter to the editor by a Brooklyn man named William J. Primavera argued: "The excuse of protecting their wives and children is absurd. Homosexuals are not in the park looking for wives and children. Besides, I'm sure that a woman would rather share a park with some homosexuals instead of 30 or 40 vigilantes, running around with walkie-talkies and flashlights, scaring people."
One gay rights group that brought attention to the incident was the Mattachine Society, which started a fund to replant the trees. Randy Wicker, 81, who is one of its last surviving members, recalled what happened in a recent phone interview. "People were always trying to destroy these areas where men would gather and frolic," he said. "But Queens was another world. There weren't even any gay bars there yet. And this case was unusual because it was an organized vigilante incident with the approval of local people. I'm sure those men just wanted to cut the trees that night, but what if it had gotten worse?
"The story is just so suburban," he added. "Chain saws? In Manhattan, you couldn't go into Central Park with chain saws to chop down a cruising spot like the Ramble. We don't do that here."
Queens was known as a fiercely conservative borough at the time, said Brendan Fay, a longtime gay activist in Queens, and public parks served as vital meeting places for gay men. "People think of sex when they think of cruising, but these were places we went to hold hands, to touch, to embrace. These men were usually married and closeted, and this vigilante group taunted and shamed these men who were meeting to fulfill a basic human need."
Today, the park is near a lonesome train yard near 78th Avenue and Grand Central Parkway. A sitting area near the site is dedicated to Ilse Metzger, an Austrian woman who escaped the Nazis in World War II and settled in Forest Hills. Last month, an Irish pub a couple of blocks away had hoisted a gay pride flag across its entrance, and a Black Lives Matter poster hung in the window of a nearby house. At the apartment building where members of the vigilante group lived, which is now known as the Forest Hills South complex, a doorman said he'd never heard of the incident. "I've been here for over 20 years and I talk to all the old-timers," he said. "I don't think anyone involved is still around anymore. Not once have I heard of anything like this."
After Stonewall, the Village became even more of a haven for gay life, but change came slower to Queens. In 1990, the borough experienced a turning point when Julio Rivera, a gay bartender, was beaten to death by three men in Jackson Heights, resulting in public demonstrations. In 1993, Queens held its first pride parade, and in 2009, it elected Daniel Dromm, who helped organize the parade and is openly gay, to City Council.
Mr. Dromm, 63, who has been an L.G.B.T.Q. activist in Queens since the 1980s, was accustomed to getting calls from men about harassment in cruising areas across the borough. "I'd always have to say, 'You need to get me somebody who is willing to let me use their real name.' But I could never get names so there wasn't much I could do," he said. "This was typical of cruising areas because these men were usually married, and no one wanted to challenge the police. But those cruise areas aren't really around anymore. Now everyone goes online or they cruise on Grindr or at the bar."
Mr. Dromm was familiar with the case of the trees being cut down in Forest Hills, however, and he remembered that he still occasionally got calls about late-night activity in the park years later -- despite the neighborhood vigilantes of 1969.
"Well," he pointed out, "the trees grew back."

Texto completo: Everyone loves the ladybug and for good reasons. Early cultures believed that ladybugs were sent from heaven to save crops and are a sign of good luck and big harvests. One ladybug can eat over 1,000 aphids daily. Ladybugs originally were brought in from Australia in the 1880s to save California’s orange trees. Ladybugs feast on soft-bodied bugs such as aphids, mealybugs and scale insects. – Courtesy Cheyenne Botanic Gardens, www.botanic.org

Texto completo: Megan Rapinoe considers Sunday to be the final insult.
Just a few hours after the United States and the Netherlands meet in the Women's World Cup final in France, Brazil or Peru will celebrate winning the Copa America, South America's men's championship. And then at night, the United States or Mexico will win the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the men's title of North and Central America and the Caribbean.
A TV triple of championships for some is yet another slight for others.
"It's ridiculous, and disappointing, to be honest," said Rapinoe, the star American midfielder.
FIFA said playing the three finals on the same day would boost attention for all
"The scheduling of the different events has gone through a comprehensive consultancy process, which has involved all key stakeholders and taken into account different aspects of the women's and men's international match calendars," the governing body said in a statement. "It is a rare and exciting occurrence."
CONCACAF President Victor Montagliani told The New York Times, however, the decision to schedule the Gold Cup final for Sunday was not deliberate and was due to a "clerical error."
"It's terrible," said former American midfielder Aly Wagner, now Fox's lead World Cup match analyst. "It is so disturbing to me that the Women's World Cup does not have its own day to stand on its own and have a final to highlight these tremendous athletes and their work and their accomplishment. They wouldn't dream of doing it to the men. Why would they do it to the women?"
FIFA announced the Women's World Cup dates at the emblem launch on Sept. 18, 2017 , then revealed the full schedule the following Feb. 9 .
CONCACAF did not announce the expansion of the Gold Cup from 12 teams to 16 until Feb. 26, 2018 , then said last Sept. 27 that the final would be held at Chicago's Soldier Field on July 7 . South America's governing body made the Copa America dates known since at least early 2018 and said last Dec. 18 the final would kick off at 4 p.m. EDT.
The Women's World Cup final will start at 11 a.m. EDT on Fox, followed by the Copa America final at 4 p.m. EDT on ESPN+ and the CONCACAF final at 9:15 p.m. EDT on FS1. Telemundo, a sister network of NBC, has Women's World Cup and Copa America Spanish-language U.S. rights, while Univision has the Gold Cup.
"I really am a believer in the rising tide lifts all ships," said David Neal, executive producer of Fox's World Cup coverage. "Because of the timing of them, it's probably not going to hurt anybody."
Advertisers don't seem to think the three finals will cannibalize each other.
"It doesn't alter in any way shape or form what we plan to do. I'm not sure whether it'll splinter viewership or not," said Chris Curtin, chief brand and innovation marketing officer of Visa, one of six FIFA partners.
Advertisers focus on their product's marketing and activation and pretty much ignore the other tournaments.
"The priority for Coca-Cola is the FIFA Women's World Cup and we're going to do everything we can to bring a lot of attention, a lot people in front of TVs, to watch the game, to watch the final," said Ricardo Fort, head of global sponsorships at The Coca-Cola Co., another FIFA partner. "Too bad for the other finals. I'm pretty sure the Women's World Cup final is going to be a big global event again."
For the U.S. women's team, vocal advocates for gender equity, the three finals are just another in a long parade of putdowns that include lower prize money and arrangements inferior to those provided for the men.
"I don't really understand why there's such a resistance against going all-in on women," Rapinoe said. "I think it's pretty clear women in sport have not been treated with the same care and financing and all of that that men's sports has."
"I don't really understand why there's such a resistance against going all-in on women," Megan Rapinoe says of how the World Cup Final is on the same day as two other international championships.

Texto completo: WHAT "Rock of Ages" WHERE New World Stages, 340 W. 50th St. INFO Tickets, from $59, at 212-239-6200, telecharge.com BOTTOM LINE Tenth anniversary production of the '80s jukebox musical is still a crowd pleaser.
Don't stop believin', indeed. For its 10th anniversary production at Off-Broadway's New World Stages, the musical "Rock of Ages" got something it never had before - the right to use the title song in the show.
Def Leppard had famously withheld permission to use its music until now, but it seems the unarguable success of the show - six years on Broadway followed by productions all over the world, including in Las Vegas and on an ocean liner, and a 2012 movie starring Tom Cruise - caused them to rethink. Band frontman Joe Elliott echoed words from the script when he told The New York Times, "there isn't a person alive that's never changed their mind." 
The show remains true to its '80s rock roots, a loud, raunchy parody of the decade (think big hair and plenty of spandex). It's more concert than musical, with a hit parade of Billboard toppers by the likes of Journey, Bon Jovi and a pair of Long Islanders, Pat Benatar and Dee Snider. The loose story holding it all together (emphasis on loose) involves The Bourbon Room, an L.A. nightclub facing the wrecking ball when a German developer persuades the mayor the city needs to clean up the Sunset Strip's reputation as a haven for "sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll." 
One of the joys of this reunion production is the ebullient, over-the-top performance of Mitchell Jarvis, who reprises Lonny, the role he originated on Broadway and, according to his Playbill bio, has performed more than 1,200 times. He's joined by a cast of powerful vocalists with standouts including CJ Eldred as wannabe rock star Drew; Kirsten Scott as Sherrie, the girl who doesn't get on the midnight train, and Tiffany Engen (playing city planner Regina) and Dane Biren (the developer's son, Franz). Engen and Biren really knock it out of the park with Benatar's "Hit Me With Your Best Shot," in full Richard Simmons regalia no less (costumes by Gregory Gale). The production, with just a few updates (Anthony Weiner's name has been dropped), also brings back most of the original Broadway production team, including director Kristin Hanggi and choreographer Kelly Devine.   
The show remains what it always has been - a crowd-pleaser with no serious theatrical ambitions. For many parents in the audience, it's a great chance to give their kids a taste of the stuff they'd listened to back in the day (you know, when we were cool, too). I loved watching two teens in front of me be suitably impressed when Mom and Dad knew all the words to the Journey anthem "Don't Stop Believin' " that brings the s

How the Media Corrupted Climate Policy; The administration is right: Worst-case scenarios shouldn't dominate the debate.

Texto completo: It's hard to credit people who say they care about climate change when they don't bother to know anything about the subject. Or when they applaud proposals that would be extraordinarily expensive yet have no effect on the alleged problem and can only teach the public to become cynical about those who come bearing climate-related proposals.
But that's the world we live in. Certainly politicians do not volunteer to deliver more truth than we are willing to hear.
Where fraudulence is the norm, Joe Biden's climate plan needs to be acknowledged for its slightly less fraudulent mien. It doesn't ignore the rest of the world, as the Green New Deal does. Limply, without a hint of conviction, Mr. Biden proposes tariffs to force our agenda on countries whose emissions will actually determine the fate of climate change regardless of anything the U.S. does. It may not be plausible. It may be an undiluted realization of fears that President Trump's penchant for tariffs is becoming the magic solvent for every problem. But at least it's a placeholder in Mr. Biden's plan for a recognition that efforts by the U.S., which accounts for less than 15% of global emissions, are an extravagant empty gesture if other countries don't go along.
Mr. Biden also opens the door to nuclear power, without which honest persons in the climate debate (few and far between) know curbing CO2 is implausible.
Other candidates, let's face it, have adopted the Green New Deal as a contentless virtue signal. Some opine that climate change is about to sink from sight in national politics thanks to various carbon-tax defeats around the world. It won't. It will only grow in potency as a lever for self-interested groups to advance every kind of irrelevant proposal, though these will have zero meaningful impact on climate itself
In the latest development, a New York Times headline accuses the Trump administration of wanting to "put science on trial." Why? Because it is trying to rein in agency shamanizing that uses centurylong, worst-case projections to mislead the public.
Not all administration efforts spring from the mind of Donald Trump. It's hard to see this one as anything but a logical response to the media's own disastrous bungling of last year's U.S. National Climate Assessment. Virtually every story punted on a key metric. None bothered to relate the estimated climate damage risk—$500 billion a year by 2090—to the expected size of the U.S. economy, which would have tended to dampen the panic talk.
Not a single news report mentioned that this outcome was associated with an extreme worst-case temperature increase of more than 11 degrees Fahrenheit. Not one mentioned that the assessment relied on an emissions scenario, known as RCP 8.5, so extreme that it implies much bigger problems for future humanity than just a warmer climate.
Instead, just about every U.S. news story satisfied itself with shrill adjectives suggesting the report promised a climate doom that it didn't.
It might interest you to know that, of the two-dozen-plus climate models consulted by scientific bodies, only one model, that of the Institute of Numerical Mathematics in Moscow, accurately simulates past climate changes. It also forecasts the least warming, about 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit, under realistic emissions assumptions.
If the Trump administration is guilty of anything in this instance, it's guilty of paying attention. All too routine has become the habit in official reports of piling up worst-case assumptions and extending them for a century, in hope of producing a headline number the media will misreport as it did in last November's fiasco over the National Climate Assessment.
I mean every word of the following: Ignore climate-science reporting in major U.S. news organs. The press has given up wrestling with the limits of knowledge or accurately relaying the caveats tied to highly abstract computer models. If a worst-case scenario materializes, humanity will have recourse to relatively cheap geoengineering solutions to attempt to mitigate warming. In the meantime, there is no reason to believe the world will forcibly wean itself off fossil fuels. At the same time, the relentless hunt for efficiency and progress of technology will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our industrial civilization. It's even possible to think of cost-effective, pro-growth policies that would accelerate this progress. Unfortunately these lack the faux-heroic scale and price tags that excite the virtuous left nowadays.
The media, for whatever reason, has chosen a role for itself as a cheerleader for climate boondoggles. And the more specialized the media—the website Inside Climate News is your example here—the more completely it will devote itself to misleading the public about the true nature of the climate challenge in our democracy.

Texto completo: "Pretty Woman," a musical adaptation of the 1990 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts, will close in August after a year on Broadway, the show announced Wednesday.
With music and lyrics by the pop songwriters Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, the production was the latest effort to retool a hit movie for the stage. The show was capitalized for up to $ 17 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but after a strong start, the box office fell off considerably; the musical grossed $ 538,552 for the week ending June 30 -- only 39 percent of its potential.
In a season that also included the adaptations of the movies "Beetlejuice" and "Tootsie," "Pretty Woman," which Jerry Mitchell directed, was harshly reviewed and didn't pick up any Tony Award nominations. At the time of its Aug. 18 closing it will have played 27 previews and 421 regular performances.
From the start, the musical faced an especially knotty challenge: how to modernize the movie's male-savior plot for a post-#MeToo audience. Could Vivian, the hooker with a heart of gold played by Ms. Roberts in the film, be the savior this time around? Despite the feminist gloss, the show still "hewed suffocatingly close to the film's story, gags and dialogue," Ben Brantley wrote in his review for The New York Times.
Samantha Barks made her Broadway debut as Vivian, opposite three-time Tony Award nominee Andy Karl as Edward, the chilly businessman played onscreen by Richard Gere. The Times review didn't fault Ms. Barks for the show's problems; costumes and lines that closely mirrored the film gave her "no chance to banish stardust memories of the woman who created her part," Mr. Brantley wrote.
Two new actors will take over the leading roles, albeit briefly, from late July through the show's final performance: Jillian Mueller, a member of the ensemble, will be Vivian, with Brennin Hunt (the broken-footed Roger from Fox's kind-of-live "Rent") as Edward.
A German production of "Pretty Woman" will open in Hamburg this September, the show announced Wednesday, and a West End production and United States national tour will follow in 2020.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The United States and North Korea are resuming negotiations in the wake of President Trump's impromptu meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last weekend. The fight over North Korea policy within the Trump administration is reviving, too.
In fact, though, the underlying dynamics are not new. What we're seeing now is a return to the idea of a step-by-step approach, known as the "small deal," which is the only diplomatic path with any chance of success.
We know that the Trump administration, led on this issue by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and special representative Stephen Biegun, is now returning to an incremental and phased approach to persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Primarily, we know this because Kim rejected Trump's offer for the "big deal" - complete denuclearization in return for economic normalization - at their summit in Hanoi in February. There's no sign Kim will accept that now. The logical consequence is that negotiations will focus on agreeing to something short of that, as an interim step.
We also know this because Biegun said so on the plane ride back from South Korea in off-the-record remarks reported Wednesday by Axios. Biegun said that "in the abstract we have no interest in sanctions relief before denuclearization," but there are "things we can do in the meantime," such as providing humanitarian aid and upgrading diplomatic ties, if North Korea shows some action toward denuclearization, according to notes that sources provided to Axios.
"Let's say they give us 20 nuclear weapons," the notes quoted Biegun as saying. "What can we get? I'm confident that I'd go to the secretary and he'd go to the president and he would consider that. What we want to do is take pieces off the board."
Biegun said the administration wanted a "complete freeze" of North Korea's nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs during negotiations, according to the notes. But that's a long-standing request, and Biegun emphasized that would not be enough for the United States to relieve sanctions on Pyongyang.
Many misinterpreted a New York Times story Sunday to mean the policy had changed and administration officials were now considering a freeze of North Korean nuclear programs as an end goal. Although the article explained this would be a "significant - but limited - first step," the headline (which claimed that the United States "may settle for a nuclear freeze by North Korea") led others to conclude the Trump administration was abandoning the objective of total denuclearization. Trump fueled that speculation by failing to mention denuclearization publicly during his visit to the demilitarized zone.
The article also kicked off a new round of infighting over the policy. National security adviser John Bolton tweeted on his way back from Mongolia that neither he nor anyone else on the National Security Council staff had discussed a desire to "settle for a nuclear freeze" by North Korea. He accused the leakers of trying to "box in" Trump, in a thinly veiled reference to the State Department.
Bolton's tweet wasn't meant to confirm or deny the Times story, just to say the NSC wasn't part of it. For Bolton, it's still big deal or bust. Also, Bolton was signaling that Trump hasn't endorsed the small-deal approach, which is true. But Trump said he's open to the idea after his meeting in April with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
But it's no secret - and it's certainly not news - that Biegun's team is working on an interim step. That's what he was working on just days before the Hanoi summit. Pompeo has talked publicly about leaving room to give Pyongyang some concessions if there is "substantial progress" in the diplomacy. The catch is that North Korea has offered unacceptable terms so far.
Can Pompeo and Biegun, working with new North Korean negotiators (from Pyongyang's foreign ministry this time), find an interim deal that makes our country safer without giving up too much leverage? That's exactly what the negotiations will be about. It would be irresponsible to block them from exploring what's possible.
The downsides of the phased approach are also well known - because it has been tried before. As happened in the Clinton administration, a freeze can lead to a stalemate, North Korean cheating and ultimately a collapse of the interim agreement. Also, if there's no next phase, North Korea keeps its nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future.
"It's always been the argument that if you go in phases, they will still have nuclear weapons, but you can't do it any other way," said former nuclear negotiator Joel Wit. "And going in phases can be a good thing because it allows you to check their performance each step of the way."
Of course, there's always the risk that Trump could end up taking the small deal and pretending it's a big victory. And as far as our own intelligence community is concerned, Kim has no intention of fully denuclearizing anyway, so a small deal might be all we can get.
But if it's really all at once or nothing, the result will be a quick end to the diplomacy and a return to the policy of maximum pressure, high tensions, heated rhetoric and potential conflict. If the negotiations fail, that's where we will end up anyway.
The chances are slim that Pompeo and Biegun can get a small deal good enough for Trump to publicly defend, but they should be allowed to try.

Texto completo: This is America, 2019.
The women on the U.S. national soccer team, tough and strong, are these forces playing their style uncompromisingly and incomparably -- winners winning. As a team, for the team, for their teammates, for their country.
This is America, 2019.
A response to everything this team does comes with a smidgen of smug judging. Like a know-it-all older sibling, so many onlookers -- in our lives and online -- believe they know precisely how this team of women should act, and they'll be the judges of whether the team fits within their parameters.
This is America, 2019.
Alex Morgan: Celebrity sports star. She's a sensation, a previous champion, a national hero. She's ubiquitous and glamorous but still plays her sport with gruff grit. She honors the legacy of the women who played before her. She knows her history and takes pride in making some, too. She has 3.7 million followers on Twitter and countless followers of younger soccer players, girls and boys, who watch and want to play soccer like Alex does.
This is America, 2019.
Alex Morgan: Offensive feather-ruffler. She scored a gorgeous goal in the World Cup semifinal against England -- the go-ahead goal and eventual winner -- and in a cunning, confident and so-it-seems controversial manner, made a tea-sipping gesture, pinkie out. Her creative celebration fit the times in which a younger generation of athletes flash flamboyance. They work hard, so they celebrate hard. This was an end-zone touchdown dance or some choreographed silliness done by the walk-ons on the end of a college basketball bench, following a big 3-pointer.
But the negative response to Morgan came in a virtual deluge, much from the other side of the ocean, who claimed she disrespected England.
Again, she pretended to sip a cuppa tea.
This is America, 2019.
The most dominant, elegant, highest-level of sport is played by our native daughters.
There was Becky Sauerbrunn, born and raised in St. Louis, extinguishing England's offensive attacks (except for, it's only fair to point out, her leg-clipping in the box that led to a penalty shot). Rose Lavelle, strategically toying with defenders, unleashing moves that take multiple buttons to make on a video game. Crystal Dunn, composed on defense, fearless on the occasional burst on offense. And Alyssa Naeher, hoping to someday have a sentence said about her without the words "Hope Solo," making her own mark as the U.S. goalie, stopping that penalty shot in the 84th minute.
This is America, 2019.
These same women have to fight for equal pay. They sued the United States Soccer Federation, claiming "purposeful gender discrimination." As Sauerbrunn said in a statement: "It is wrong for us to be paid and valued less for our work because of our gender."
This is America, 2019.
Our nation showing so much passion for women's sports. It's such an exciting time. The front page of last Sunday's New York Times Sports section featured only stories about female athletes: Serena Williams, Maya Moore and soccer star Megan Rapinoe. Across the country, there's inner-office talk about the soccer game -- even watching the soccer game at the office. There are boys wearing the jerseys of their favorite female players. There are sardine bars hosting watch parties.
This is America, 2019.
We're totally immersed and into women's soccer . . . until we're essentially not at all, once again. As summer cools into fall, so many sports fans forget about the players they once adored. There is such a jarring disproportion in popularity between international play and professional play. The women play in a league whose acronym you probably couldn't guess -- and for teams you probably didn't know exist. They're still the same stars from your beloved national team, but behind clouds.
This is America, 2019.
Rapinoe, the mesmerizing, polarizing goal-scorer, unabashedly proud of her teammates, her own hard work, her family, her girlfriend, her beliefs and her social-justice causes.
This is America, 2019.
Rapjnoe, the captain of the America's national soccer team, having to explain that she's "extremely American."
"I think that I'm particularly and uniquely and very deeply American," she told reporters in France on Wednesday. "If we want to talk about the ideals that we stand for -- the songs and the anthem, what we were founded on -- I think I'm extremely American.
"I think for detractors, I would have them look hard into what I'm saying and the actions that I'm doing. Maybe you don't agree with every single way that I do it, and that can be discussed. I know that I'm not perfect, but I think that I stand for honesty and for truth and for wanting to have the conversation and for looking at the country honestly and saying, 'Yes, we are a great country, and there's many things that are so amazing.' And I feel very fortunate to be in this country. I'd never be able to do this in a lot of other places. But also that doesn't mean we can't get better. And it doesn't mean that we shouldn't always strive to be better . . . for everyone."
This is America, 2019.
A sports column in a big city newspaper about women's soccer.
This is America, 2019.
It's the Fourth of July, yet you also can't wait until a similarly patriotic day – the Seventh of July, when your nation's women's soccer team plays for a chance to win the World Cup.

Italian airline Alitalia 'deeply apologizes' for Obama video showing an actor in blackface

Texto completo: An Italian airline has scuttled its promotional video featuring an actor in blackface as former President Barack Obama and apologized for the offensive clip.
The video, part of Alitalia’s social media campaign for a new Rome-to-Washington route, was met with stunned disbelief when the airline shared it across social channels.
“Alitalia deeply apologizes for the offense,” the airline tweeted Wednesday in an apology, saying it has since removed the video. “For our Company, respect for everyone is mandatory, it was never our intention to hurt anyone and we will learn from what has happened. ”
USA TODAY has reached out to Alitalia for additional comment.
The New York Times reports that an airline representative at first defended the controversial video when negative comments erupted on Facebook, noting that the actor wasn’t white and that “makeup was applied to highlight (his) features. ”
Twitter users were quick to react.
“Words fail me,” wrote Alberto Riva, managing editor of the travel news site The Points Guy.
“Alitalia dropped an ad featuring a white actor in blackface portraying President Obama. In 2019. Read that again,” tweeted activist April Reign, creator of the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag.
Numerous brands have courted controversy in recent months with design choices that customers complained resembled blackface, the racist practice of darkening one’s complexion with makeup.
In February, Gucci discontinued a black turtleneck sweater with a red-rimmed cutout for the mouth, and Katy Perry’s eponymous shoe collection dropped two pairs of black shoes embellished with eyes and exaggerated red lips. Burberry apologized that same month for sending a model down the runway at London Fashion Week in a hoodie featuring a drawstring knotted into a noose.
Last December, Prada stopped selling its Otto charm, a monkey-like figure with red lips.

Harry Reid defends UFO funding, convinced sightings are real

Texto completo: Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid defended the $22 million he earmarked to study UFOs when he was in the U.S. Senate, saying the nation must to keep up with similar programs by rivals on the world stage.
"We know that China is doing it," Reid said of UFO studies Tuesday on "Nevada Newsmakers." "We know that Russia, which is led by someone within the KGB, is doing it, too, so we better take a look at it, too."
Reid told host Sam Shad that he secured the $22 million to begin the secret Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) in 2007 and the program was funded and supervised by the Pentagon until 2012. The New York Post, however, reported the Pentagon's investigation into sightings of alien spacecraft continues today.
The AATIP program helped convinced Reid the sightings are real. Reid recently urged Congress to hold public hearings on the issue during an interview on KNPR radio.
"We got a volume of research that was done, $22 million worth of research," Reid said on "Newsmakers." "It showed that not two people, four people or six people or 20 people but hundreds and hundreds of people have seen these things, sometimes all at the same time."
"It is no longer just speculation that people see these unidentified flying objects," Reid said. "That's beyond question. And it has even become more transparent in recent months."
UFO research is a matter of national security, Reid said.
"We've had some (UFOs) seen near of our military installations in South Dakota, out that way," Reid said. "At our missile defense systems, where they come out (of the ground), there they (UFOs) are."
"So I don't know what all these things are but I do believe that we should take a look at them," he said.
Some of the most credible stories and sightings of UFOs have come from military pilots, Reid said. Pilots were once afraid to tell their superiors about UFO sightings but that has changed.
The U.S. Navy is drafting new guidelines for pilots who witness unidentified aircraft because of increases in sightings near sensitive military facilities and Navy strike groups at sea, according to news reports.
"Originally, pilots were afraid to tell their superiors because they were concerned that it would hurt their promotions, which it would have done," Reid said. "But now, pilots have an obligation to start reporting them and the reason for that is the work that we did."
Advances in military technology have given pilots better photos and video of the UFOs, Reid said. Pilots have reported the UFOs can do things that are impossible for U.S. military jets to duplicate.
"We do not have any type (craft with) the ability to do what they do," he said. "We have jet airplanes that fly 750 mph. These things, they estimate they go over 3,000 miles per hour. I think it is something we need to look at."
Reid's behind-the-scenes work to fund UFO research and the AATIP were revealed in December of 2017 when the New York Times and Politico both published stories on the subject.
"When I was contacted by the New York Times, they said they wanted to do a story on UFOs and the money you got, the $22 million," Reid said. "And I said I am happy to do that story, as long as we are not talking about little green men. If you want to talk about science, I'm all in. And that is how I looked at this. "
Getting the $22 million to fund the AATIP in 2007 was easy because former Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, held great influence over military spending in Congress, Reid recalled.
When Reid presented his classified UFO research idea to select leaders in Congress, Stevens sealed the deal.
"Just like that, Ted Stevens said, 'I've wanted to look into this since I was in the Army Air Corps.' He said, 'I was flying an airplane and there was a vehicle that was right with me and I could not get rid of it. I would go up, down, sideways, whatever. Then I went down to the ground and asked 'what was that up there?' And they said they saw nothing."
"So that was easy," Reid said. "That took me, maybe 10 minutes to get that money and I am glad I did it."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday promised military tanks along with "Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!" for the Fourth of July in Washington. But the District of Columbia says "Tanks, but no tanks" and complains that Trump is politicizing what traditionally has been a nonpartisan celebration.
White House and administration officials have tried to calm those concerns by stressing that Trump plans to deliver a patriotic speech at the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday during his "Salute to America" event that is billed as honoring the US armed forces.
But one of Trump's closest White House advisers strayed from that reasoning when asked to preview his remarks.
Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters Tuesday the speech would cover "how wonderful this country is, our troops and military, our great democracy and great call to patriotism, the success of this administration in opening up so many jobs for individuals, what we've done for veterans."
Trump also criticized Democrats after first saying he thinks he can give a speech for everyone.
"I think I've reached most Americans," Trump said Monday during an Oval Office appearance, adding that most Americans want no crime, a strong military, good education, and good health care.
Trump tweeted Tuesday: "Big 4th of July in D.C. 'Salute to America.' The Pentagon & our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this & showing to the American people, among other things, the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!"
But not everyone is on board.
The military appreciates national recognition, but some members worry that they will be seen as political props. This concern has been heightened during Trump's administration by his repeated focus on showcasing the military as the main symbol of US power and influence in the world.
The District of Columbia government previously had complained about damage that tanks would do to city streets and reissued its complaint on Monday after The Washington Post reported on Trump's plan to station military tanks in the city.
"We have said it before, and we'll say it again: Tanks, but no tanks," the City Council tweeted. The tweet included an image of a Defense Department memo from 2018 that suggested only wheeled vehicles be used to minimize damage to streets from 60-ton tanks.
Trump had wanted a military parade of tanks and other equipment in Washington after he watched a military parade on Bastille Day in Paris in 2017. That plan eventually was scuttled, partly because of cost, though Trump apparently held on to the idea. Local officials objected at that time, too.
Thursday's events are also expected to include military flyovers by the Navy's Blue Angels, F-22 fighter jets, and possibly other military aircraft.
The annual fireworks display will be held near the Lincoln Memorial instead of its usual location by the Washington Monument.
A ticket-only area in front of the memorial is being set aside for VIPs, including members of Trump's family, friends and members of the military, the White House said.

Trump, GOP report $105m in fund-raising
WASHINGTON — President Trump's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee on Tuesday said they had raised $105 million in the second quarter of this year, outraising former president Barack Obama in the equivalent period during his reelection campaign in 2012 and signaling that Trump will have vastly more resources than he did in 2016.
The campaign and the RNC said they had a combined $100 million in cash on hand, and that they had raised more money online in the second quarter than in the first half of 2018. Trump and his committees raised $54 million, they said, and the RNC raised $51 million. The staggering figure can be plowed into television and digital advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts and other activities related to the 2020 election.
Campaign officials said they received 725,000 individual donations online, with supporters giving an average of $48. In some cases, they said, people may have donated more than once.
An RNC official said the small-dollar enthusiasm for Trump was something unprecedented in Republican politics, and noted that for the first time ever, the RNC attracted a larger share of donations under $200 than the Democratic National Committee.
At the same time, as president, Trump also has command of the party's donor base in a way he never did in 2016. The official said the RNC also saw a large uptick in traditional party donors, which increased to more than one-third of the committee's total fund-raising since last cycle.
The RNC has taken the lead on fund-raising for Trump's reelection, overseeing the digital efforts and major donor events.
The official report on the Trump campaign's finances for the quarter, which will include spending, will be filed with the Federal Election Commission on July 15.
In 2011, during the same period, Obama's reelection campaign raised $47 million, and the Democratic National Committee brought in $38 million, Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager, said at the time. The comparisons are not perfect because a 2014 Supreme Court case and other legal changes allowed candidates and parties to form joint fund-raising committees that can accept single donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The main impact of his early fund-raising is the ability to stockpile large bundles of cash while Democrats are spending their money fighting each other.

Trump says NRA will move to Texas
President Trump predicted the National Rifle Association would soon move to Texas to flee “harassment" by the New York state government, although the organization is not based in the Empire State.
The NRA's headquarters is in Fairfax, Va.
The NRA is loved in Texas, Trump said in a series of tweets Tuesday, the second day in a row he has used Twitter to accuse New York officials of targeting political opponents, causing businesses and organizations to leave the state.
New York Attorney General Letitia James opened an investigation into the gun-rights group's nonprofit status in April. The NRA, which was first chartered in New York in 1871, is suing the state's financial regulator, claiming its investigation into the organization's insurance products is part of a vendetta led by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a frequent critic.
Cuomo “uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes," Trump said in a tweet Monday. “They sue on everything, always in search of a crime."

People said mean things on the internet, and Democrats think that should settle the immigration debate

Texto completo: You may want to sit down for this.
Did you know that a lot of people go online and say mean things?
That’s the thrust of a report on a “secret” Facebook group largely made up of current and former U.S. Border Patrol agents. The left-leaning ProPublica got access to the page and dug up some crude comments. Democrats are beside themselves.
ProPublica reported that there were postings on the group that contained degrading remarks about some of the Latino congresspeople who visited detention facilities on the border this week and other posts that were flippant about migrants who had died attempting to cross illegally in to the United States. There were also photo illustrations mocking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in sexually explicit ways.
The report identified a grand total of three current agents who “participated” in the posts. To put that into context, the Border Patrol employs nearly 20,000 agents.

This is the new thing that liberal reporters do: win political fights by spending hours searching online forums of their targets to find a whiff of racism. Admittedly, if you send enough time on obscure platforms like 4Chan, or even a group on Facebook, you will find a Nazi or, more likely, an immature ass who makes dumb jokes with his other goofy friends.
The goal is to call attention to that handful of random people who said mean things online and thereby claim victimhood, also known as victory — in this case in a debate about whether Democrats are right in opposing all border security and turning all illegal immigrants loose in the U.S.
ProPublica didn’t even identify any of the alleged agents in any way at all, not by name, gender, or race. That's interesting, would it make a difference to how we viewed these comments if any of these agents were Latino? More than half of Border Patrol agents are, so there’s a greater than 50% chance that the people posting those things on the Facebook group are, too.
When supposedly racist behavior is exhibited by a white man, we’re all immediately reminded over and over again by the news media about the growing threat of white supremacy in America (a lie). But the conclusions are a little murkier or simply left up to the reader with misleading hints when the white element doesn’t factor.
The New York Times editorial board, for example, said Monday that during the tour of the detention centers by some Latino House Democrats, they were “heckled and cursed at by demonstrators, including one man wearing a Make America Great Again hat.”
Everyone knows that “man wearing a Make America Great Again hat” is media code for “straight white male.” But the video of the incident that the New York Times itself linked to showed that the heckling man wearing the MAGA hat was clearly Latino. He even spoke with an accent typical of Mexican Americans living in the West.
Here's what ProPublica found: Three random people online made mean jokes. That's no reason to shame the U.S. Border Patrol out of doing its job. It's no reason to cede ground on the immigration debate to Democrats and their friends in the news media.Story URLPhoto Caption:U.S. Rep.

Federal wealth taxes and the incremental erosion of liberty

Texto completo: A federal wealth tax is seriously being considered in the current presidential campaign.
The concept has been embraced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Further adding to interest in the wealth tax is support announced last week by California philanthropist Eli Broad, and nineteen other American billionaires upon whom the tax would fall. Broad’s letter was published in the New York Times under the remarkable title, “I’m in the 1%. Please, Raise My Taxes.”
Sen. Warren estimates the tax will raise $2.75 trillion dollars in ten years. Economists have split over whether that is a realistic number, especially given the ability of the ultra-wealthy to devise evasion schemes for virtually any tax government ever proposes. However, at 50% compliance, the tax would still increase the annual revenue available for the federal government by almost 5%.
Whether this concept is wise should be analyzed under economic, constitutional, and liberty considerations.
The economics of this proposal depends on two factors. The first is the uses to which this money is put. Not surprisingly, the Democratic presidential candidates all propose spending the wealth tax on new programs; none proposes to pay back federal borrowing to reduce the debt. The economic benefit of each expenditure provides fair ground for debate. Preschool education for children whose parents cannot otherwise afford it may well generate long-term economic benefits. Giving the money to politically favored constituencies is less likely to do so.
The second factor is the dampening effect on economic activity from such a tax. Here, the wealth tax has an advantage over an income tax. People do less of that which is taxed. So, we can expect wealthy people to consume more and save less, given that every year the amount they have saved will be taxed anew. Sen. Warren estimates that only 75,000 families will be subject to her wealth tax. If they save less and consume more, it might actually stimulate economic growth. By contrast, an increase in income tax would, at the margin, depress the process of creating income—a much more damaging result.
A federal wealth tax might run into Constitutional trouble under Article I, section 9, which forbids the federal government from imposing a “direct” tax, except in proportion to each state’s population. A wealth tax is not proportional to population. In 1895, the Supreme Court held the federal income tax unconstitutional as a direct tax, not proportional to population. Proponents then passed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913, allowing federal taxes on income. However, in 1921, the court ruled the federal tax on inheritance was not a direct tax. One of these two opinions must be wrong.
My prediction is that the court will define a direct tax as one that is imposed without a person choosing to do anything. A sales tax, for instance, is indirect: it is triggered by the act of buying something; but a wealth tax is direct, it requires no action at all.
The most important concern is from the point of view of liberty. Sen. Warren was asked after the debate how the federal government could assess the value of individuals’ shares in private companies, fine art, or jewels. She lit up almost with delight to say that it would be easy to keep tabs on only 75,000 families. She appeared to relish the concept of government agents who would, year in and year out, make an inventory of all that some Americans possess. She evinced no concern at all for this invasion of privacy, the unfairness of taxing the same income multiple times (once when earned, then every year it was kept), or the evisceration of a notion that once we acquire property, we can depend on keeping it.
There may be little sympathy for the 75,000 wealthiest families in America; but that is how liberty is lost — incrementally.

Durant Strikes Blow for Brooklyn Even Though Return Is Uncertain

Texto completo: Kevin Durant shook the N.B.A. in the opening moments of free agency Sunday night, announcing his decision to leave the Golden State Warriors for the Nets on Instagram to the beat of a track from the Brooklyn rapper Notorious B.I.G.
For the Nets, who also struck a deal Sunday with Kyrie Irving, it was the splashiest combination of moves they could have made after spending years digging out from the depths of ill-advised personnel moves and searching for a slice of the spotlight in a city long dominated by the Knicks. For Durant, 30, it will be a fresh start with a new team -- a budding relationship that will require patience from both sides.
Durant, a 10-time All-Star, will likely miss the 2019-2020 season after rupturing his Achilles' tendon in the N.B.A. finals three weeks ago. Achilles' injuries are often debilitating for elite athletes, and there is no guarantee that Durant will make a full recovery. But he is a unique talent -- perhaps the most versatile scorer on the planet -- and the Nets are betting big.
The Nets had to beat out a deep field for Durant, who also strongly considered a pitch from the Los Angeles Clippers in addition to the Warriors' attempts to re-sign him and the Knicks' interest. The Warriors were offering a five-year maximum contract valued at $ 221 million -- the richest security Durant could have found in the wake of perhaps the most dreaded injury a basketball player could suffer -- but he opted for a new challenge with the Nets anyway.
As The New York Times reported, Nets officials had been aggressively pursuing deals with Durant and the veteran center DeAndre Jordan, one of Durant's closest friends, in addition to their long-planned quest to sign Irving. The Nets had verbal commitments from all three players by night's end Sunday, resulting in a dramatic turnaround just six years after the club had squandered three future first-round draft picks to Boston in a crippling and shortsighted trade in 2013 to acquire the veterans Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce from the Boston Celtics.
At the same time, it was a devastating start to free agency for the Knicks, who had figured to be in the running for Durant and Irving. After all, they had traded Kristaps Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks in January in large part to create the type of financial flexibility they would need to sign a pair of superstars like Durant and Irving. James L. Dolan, the team's owner, had vowed during a radio appearance in March that the Knicks were going to have a "very successful off-season when it comes to free agents."
By Sunday, though, it was looking like more of the same for the Knicks: false hope and searing disappointment. Kemba Walker, another premier free agent, appeared to be closing in on a deal with the Celtics. The Knicks, meanwhile, had money to spend. Some of it will go to Julius Randle, a 24-year-old power forward who spent last season with the New Orleans Pelicans. He agreed to a three-year deal worth $ 63 million, according to one person familiar with the details.
The Knicks are coming off a 17-65 season, which was the worst record in the league. They have some promising young players, including R.J. Barrett, whom the Knicks made the third overall pick in the draft on June 20, but they are eons from contending for anything, including a playoff berth.
Durant, the league's most valuable player with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2014, was considered one of the best -- if not the best -- players in the N.B.A. before he sustained his injury against the Raptors on June 10. He underwent surgery on June 12.
His departure from Golden State marks the end of an era. And while the Warriors will be keeping much of their core intact -- Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, who appeared set to sign a new deal with the team -- there is some uncertainty for the franchise moving forward. Thompson could miss the 2019-20 season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during the N.B.A. finals, and the Warriors were highly dependent on Durant, especially during their long postseason runs.
Durant joined the Warriors as a free agent in 2016 after nine seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder (including one season when the organization was still based in Seattle). The Warriors had already won a championship without Durant, and his decision to join a ready-made contender was met with a great deal of scrutiny -- scrutiny that persisted even as Durant excelled.
He was the N.B.A. finals' most valuable player in 2017 and 2018, as the Warriors won back-to-back championships. But the criticism of his decision to jump to Golden State irritated him. He clashed with Russell Westbrook, his former teammate on the Thunder, and he would also occasionally respond to various barbs on social media, cultivating a reputation -- fair or not -- as one of the league's most sensitive stars. But through it all, his extraordinary level of play never waned.
Last season, Durant averaged 26 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.9 assists a game while shooting 52.1 percent from the field. Still, the Warriors had a roller-coaster season, clouded in part by Durant's looming free agency. The weight of that decision manifested itself in November when Durant and Green squabbled during a game against the Clippers. Green questioned Durant's loyalty to the organization. Durant pushed back. The Warriors, recognizing Durant's value, sought to mitigate the damage by suspending Green for a game.
Durant and Green eventually appeared to repair their relationship, and Durant again seemed primed to help carry the Warriors through the playoffs. But he strained his right calf in a game against the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals, then missed 32 days before returning for Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals. He proceeded to rupture his right Achilles' tendon in the second quarter.
Bob Myers, the team's president of basketball operations, told reporters after the game that clearing Durant to play had been a collaborative decision, but the organization was heavily criticized in the wake of the injury.
On Sunday, Durant decided to move on.

Texto completo: The Clippers will have to woo Kawhi Leonard without offering him an opportunity to play with Kevin Durant, according to reports Sunday afternoon by a variety of NBA insiders indicating he will be signing with the Brooklyn Nets, where he will team up with fellow free agent Kyrie Irving.
Durant, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the NBA Finals, reportedly will sign with the Nets on a four-year $164 million deal while Irving will sign a four-year $141 million max deal, per multiple reports. Durant is scheduled to make an announcement via the Instagram of his sports-owned business channel The Boardroom.
NBA free agency is scheduled to open officially today at 3 p.m., PT.
A pair of players with Clippers connections – veteran center DeAndre Jordan, a pillar of the Lob City era, and guard Garrett Temple, who joined the team last season after the trade deadline – also reportedly are set to sign with the Nets.
The Clippers will wait to learn the truth of reports that Leonard was going to leave the Toronto Raptors only if he could be assured he’d be playing with a “top-flight free agent.”
The Clippers reportedly had their sights on Durant, for months. In Brian Windhorst’s report for ESPN in December, he broached the possibility of the duo teaming up and noted that the Clippers would be able to create two max slots to allow it to happen this summer.
Of course, even with the cap space, Windhorst equated pulling off the feat to “pulling the sword from the stone.”
Durant, a 30-year-old forward who won two titles with Golden State, went on the record earlier this month to make it clear that he would make his decision independent of any of his peers intentions: “I can’t be recruited.”
Not that the New York Knicks, Warriors and Clippers wouldn’t join the Nets in making their best cases.
Reports were that the Warriors were set to offer Kevin Durant a five-year, $221 max contract, $57 million more than any of his other suitors, and Stephen Curry was going to help deliver the pitch.
The Clippers’ pitch also will include people that Durant is known to admire, including Jerry West, whose 2016 call to Durant is said to have helped persuade him to join the Warriors, and owner Steve Ballmer, who appeared on the second episode of “The Boardroom with Kevin Durant,” an ESPN series that debuted in February.
Furthermore, Durant’s familiarity with the Clippers organization extends to general manager Michael Winger and assistant coach Rex Kalamian, whose tenures in Oklahoma City overlapped with Durant’s.
And Durant, remember, raved about several members of the Clippers this past season, including their then-rookie backcourt of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet.
But, according to reports, the Nets’ offer and the chance for Durant to play alongside his friend Irving proved most enticing.
On Saturday, the New York Times reported Leonard – who also is a target of the Lakers, who cleared cap space this week in order to offer him a chance to play beside LeBron James and Anthony Davis – wants to play with a “top-flight free agent” if he chooses to leave the Toronto Raptors.
The Clippers also are rumored to be among the teams vying for the 76ers’ Jimmy Butler — who also has been linked to the Houston Rockets and reportedly is most interested in playing for the Miami Heat. The 29-year-old wing was mentioned in various reports as another potential option. An excellent two-way player with a drive to win, on paper he seems like a fit for both Leonard and the Clippers.

Texto completo: David Carter, who chronicled a turning point in American civil rights with his book "Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution," was a teenager pursuing a science summer program at the University of Georgia in the summer of 1969.
He remembers hearing a news announcer, perhaps Walter Cronkite, give that day's riot in Greenwich Village a brief mention, but "at that time I didn't know I was gay, so it didn't mean much to me."
Yet the demonstrations that followed the uprising at the Stonewall Inn, the formation of the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activist Alliance, the first Gay Pride march that took place on the one-year anniversary of the uprising, all had a profound effect on the young man.
Fifty years later author Carter reminisced about how the reverberations from that event even rolled down to Jesup, Georgia, where he attended Wayne County High School.
"These people went against every idea I had of homosexuality. These people looked normal, young, happy, nice-looking," he said.
"And there was this militancy, but it was a beautiful militancy, not a hate-filled militancy. All that to me was very winning."
The same realization was happening to the rest of the country, Carter said. The American public was discovering that gay people looked just like them.
Carter, 66, spoke Friday at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, in a presentation organized by Bank of America and Cox Enterprises to commemorate the Stonewall anniversary.
The presentation, which was followed by a panel discussion, began with a short documentary film, with news footage from the time.
Among the scenes from the era was a much younger Mike Wallace reciting the findings from a survey on homosexuality. "Most Americans," he tells the camera, "look on homosexuals with disgust or fear."
The Stonewall Inn was a Mafia-run bar that catered to a gay community in Greenwich Village that had few choices of places to gather.
"It was dirty and sold questionable Mafia alcohol," said Carter.
It had no liquor license and was often raided, but because the owners paid protection money to the police, they were usually able to warn the patrons ahead of time.
Early in the morning on June 28, 1969, the police staged a raid with no warning. Instead of dispersing and heading home to avoid being recognized or photographed, this time the crowd stayed around.
At first they ridiculed the police, but when one of the female patrons was handled roughly, something clicked.
The crowd began pelting the police with bottles and bricks.The officers retreated to the interior of the bar, but the rioters pried up a parking meter and used it as a battering ram.
Unrest continued for six days. Gay patrons decided that they'd had enough harassment.
"Whose streets are these?These are our streets," John O'Brien, a participant in the riot, told The New York Times later.
"It inspired the creation of a new face for the movement," said Carter. "Progress happened in New York." he said. Police stopped using "decoys" to entrap gay New Yorkers. Gay bars became legal.
"We're very proud of David," said his older brother Bill Carter, who attended the speech.
Bill, who introduced his younger brother to the poetry of Rimbaud and the opera of Anna Moffo, was perhaps the ideal older brother for a gay kid from a little town in Georgia.
David came out to his brother Bill and Bill's wife, Lynn, during a trip to Paris, where they were safely distant from Jesup.
David Carter said the current era represents a threat to the freedoms of the LGBT community, but that gay people and their allies should remember the humor of the early Pride parades and temper their fervor.
"We have to be careful not to be self-righteous, not to be judgmental. We need to use a little more tact, a little more kindness, a little more sensitivity."

AJC CONTINUING COVERAGE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: Trump fires back at Carter's criticism: Russian interference 'a typical talking point' for Dems, says president.

Texto completo: A day after former President Jimmy Carter made international headlines questioning the legitimacy of the current holder of the office, President Donald Trump responded Saturday -- including with his own criticism of Carter's time at the White House.
Carter said Friday at a human rights forum in Leesburg, Virginia, he believes Trump would have lost the 2016 election without Russian help.
Trump, speaking at a news conference in Japan where he attended the Group of 20 summit, said such comments were nothing more than a Democrat's "typical talking point."
"Look, he was a nice man. He was a terrible president," Trump said of the 94-year-old from Plains.
"He's a Democrat. And it's a typical talking point. He's loyal to the Democrats. And I guess you should be," Trump told reporters.
As reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution from the Virginia event, Carter noted, "There's no doubt that the Russians did interfere in the election and I think the interference, although not yet quantified, if fully investigated, would show that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put in office because the Russians interfered on his behalf."
Carter's pointed comments came as Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit, just weeks after Special Counsel Robert Mueller detailed alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential vote in Trump's favor.
Asked by moderator-historian Jon Meacham at Friday's forum if Trump was "an illegitimate president," Carter paused and smiled.
"Based on what I just said, which I can't retract, I would say yes," Carter said.
Carter and former Vice President Walter Mondale, who ran the country from 1977 until 1981, sat side-by-side on stage during a panel discussion on human rights held as part of a five-day retreat for Carter Center supporters at the Lansdowne Resort and Spa in Leesburg.
T rump, h owe v e r , responded Saturday: "I won not because of Russia, not because of anybody but myself."
The Washington Post reported Trump also said Carter's efforts to deal with Iran, which held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, were "a disaster. They tied him up in knots. That's probably why Ronald Reagan became president."
Carter recently said Trump made the correct call by not taking military action against Iran. Last week, Trump said he had called off military strikes planned against Iran in retaliation for downing an American surveillance drone.
As for the 2016 presidential election, Carter's comments represented his most critical yet about Russia's role. In an October 2017 interview with The New York Times, Carter questioned whether Russia's attempts to interfere in the election changed "enough votes, or any votes" to matter.
In Japan on Friday, asked by a reporter if he would warn Putin not to interfere in the 2020 election, a grinning Trump pointed his finger at Putin and said, "Don't meddle in the election, president."
The U.S. intelligence community asserted in a 2017 report that Russia had worked to help Trump during the election and to undermine the candidacy of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. But the intelligence agencies did not assess whether that interference had affected the election or contributed to Trump's victory.
Trump insisted during his news conference marking the end of the G-20 gathering in Osaka that he had won because he'd worked harder and smarter than Clinton. Trump also said he "felt badly" for Carter because of the way he'd "been trashed within his own party."
"He's been badly trashed," said Trump. "He's like the forgotten president. And I understand why they say that. He was not a good president."
This story compiled with reporting by the Associated Press and AJC staff writer Ernie Suggs.

Texto completo: As we digitize The New York Times's vast photography archives, we often come across images that resonate in unusual and unexpected ways, even after a century. We wondered what novelists might make of some of them -- so we asked.
To be specific, we asked ten authors to write short stories inspired (in any way they chose) by our historical photos. These are the results, along with the images in question.
We were particularly interested in the themes of identity, belonging and empowerment that now dominate the national conversation. With that in mind, we reached out to authors working in the young-adult genre because they have been exploring those issues deeply for years. We focused on Asian-American novelists as part of our ongoing commitment to underrepresented voices, as well as to see what commonalties and differences rose to the surface.
Each author was sent 6-9 images to choose from. Some of the photos reflected the authors' ancestry. Others spoke to specific aspects of their life or work. After the authors picked the images that captivated them most, we asked that they disregard whoever the real people in the photographs were -- and even the true-life locations if they liked. We wanted their imagination to be the only engine here.
These stories are entirely fictional, even if they refer to historical events. We are grateful to the writers for giving these images new lives.

Texto completo: LEESBURG, VA. -- Jimmy Carter said Friday he believes President Donald Trump would have lost the 2016 election without Russian help.
Theformerpresidentalsosharply criticized Trump's policies on the U.S.-Mexico border, calling them "disgraceful" and accusing Trump of ordering the "torture" and "kidnapping" of children.
The pointed comments came as Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Japan at the Group of 20 summit, the first since special counsel Robert Mueller detailed alleged Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential vote in Trump's favor.
"There's no doubt that the Russians did interfere in the election, and I think the interference, although not yet quantified, if fully investigated, would show that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016," said Carter. "He lost the election, and he was put in office because the Russians interfered on his behalf."
Speaking in Leesburg, Virginia, at the Carter Center's annual retreat, the 39th president was then asked by moderator Jon Meacham, a historian, if Trump was "an illegitimate president."
Carter paused and smiled.
"Based on what I just said, which I can't retract, I would say yes," Carter said.
Trump repeatedly has disputed U.S. intelligence authorities' assessment that the Kremlin interfered in the U.S. election to help him and has called the Mueller probe a "witch hunt."
The intelligence agencies did not assess whether that interference had affected the election or contributed to Trump's victory, and no evidence has emerged that votes were changed improperly.
Carter, who ran the country from 1977 until 1981, and his vice president, Walter Mondale, sat side by side on stage during a panel discussion on humanrights.Neitherminced words.MondalecalledTrump "detestable."
Carter, a Democrat, blamed Trump for the worsening conditions at the border, including for detained migrant children from Mexico and Central America.
"Every day, we send a disgraceful signal around the world that this is what the president and the United States government stands for. And that is torture and kidnapping of little children. Separation from their parents and deprivation of those who are incarcerated," Carter said. "What ICE is doing under direct orders of the president is a disgrace to the United States, and I hope it will soon be ended. Maybe not until the 2020 election as we change presidents."
Trump has defended his crackdown on asylum seekers at the Mexican border, blaming Democrats for the growing humanitarian crisis.
Carter's comments Friday represent his most critical yet about Russia's role in the 2016 vote. In an October 2017 interview with The New York Times, Carter questioned whether Russia's attempts to interfere in the election changed "enough votes, or any votes" to matter.
InJapanonFriday, askedby a reporter if he would warn Putin not to interfere in the 2020 election, a grinning Trump pointed his finger at Putin andsaid, "Don't meddle in the election, president."
Earlier this month, Carter said Trump made the correct call by not taking military action against Iran. Carter also has praised Trump for meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to avoid war.
But he had harsh words for Trump's policies last September when he was asked at Emory University what he would do if he became president again. "I think the first thing I would do would be to change all of the policies that President Trump has initiated," Carter said.
Carter doubled down Friday when asked by Meacham what Democrats running for office in 2020 should do immediately if elected.
"I go with what the participants of the [Democratic candidate]debates have said. Almost all say they would immediately revoke orders on borders, reenter Paris Accords in preventing global warming and participate with other countries," Carter said. "Things you can do with an executive order."
Carter would not comment on whom he was backing for 2020. It was way too early, he said, but it has to be someone who could beat Trump.
Seated next to Carter, Mondale sharply criticized Trump's leadership.
"They see in the president a cheerleader in this right-wing surge that is occurring in the world.He openly loves authoritarian leaders. Has contempt for democratic leaders," said Mondale. "His rhetoric, harshness, divisiveness, all of this is a hateful thrust. And we are going to the right as a result. I have never seen a Republican president in my life act like this.He's got something deep in him that is detestable."
Carter didn't challenge Mondale's characterization. "I think [Mondale] just stole my headline," Carter said.

Texto completo: As President Trump weighs a possible resolution to his trade conflict with China, one factor may be pushing him toward a deal: His trade policies are broadly unpopular with American voters.
Large majorities of Democrats and independents say the tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed on Chinese goods -- and the retaliatory tariffs that China has imposed on American products -- will be bad for the United States, according to a survey this month for The New York Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey.
Republicans still mostly support Mr. Trump's trade policies, but there are cracks showing even there. A majority of Republicans said they expected tariffs to lead to higher prices for American consumers. Only among the president's strongest supporters do a plurality believe his policies will bring back manufacturing jobs without raising prices, as Mr. Trump has claimed.
Over all, 53 percent of Americans say the China tariffs will be bad for the United States, compared with 43 percent who say the tariffs will be a good thing. Other surveys have found similar results.
If Mr. Trump is concerned by such results, he isn't showing it. In an interview with Fox Business Network on Wednesday, he played down the importance of reaching a deal with China at this week's Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan. "I'm very happy either way," he said.
Jennifer Frandsen considers herself a political independent and has voted for candidates from both major parties. But she has little doubt that the trade war has hurt her personally. She recently lost her job in sales when Walmart cut back its contract with her employer, a move she attributes at least partly to the trade war. The retail giant said last month that it would raise some prices in response to the tariffs.
"We ultimately end up paying more because companies don't eat that cost, they end up passing that cost on to the customer," said Ms. Frandsen, a 50-year-old resident of Palm Bay, Fla.
It isn't clear how much Mr. Trump's trade policies will matter in next year's election. Trade hasn't historically been decisive in presidential races, and it ranks low among the issues that voters are focused on. It is also difficult for Democrats to capitalize on the issue because several of their leading presidential candidates, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, are also skeptical about trade agreements. The issue barely came up at the first Democratic presidential debates on Wednesday and Thursday evenings.
"People don't think about trade a lot," said Carroll Doherty, director of political research for the Pew Research Center. "It's a pretty low-priority issue."
That could change, Mr. Doherty said, if the trade war starts to damage the broader American economy, costing more people like Ms. Frandsen their jobs. There isn't much evidence of that so far -- economic growth was solid in the first three months of the year, and the unemployment rate is at a nearly 50-year low. But growth has been slowing, and businesses are increasingly warning that tariffs are taking a toll.
"A lot of it depends on events and what happens over the next six months," Mr. Doherty said.
There are signs that Americans are starting to pay more attention. More than two-thirds of those polled -- and more than half of Republicans -- said they believed that Mr. Trump's trade policies would cause prices to rise. That is a break from past surveys, in which fewer people drew a link between tariffs and prices, said Alexandra Guisinger, a Temple University political scientist who wrote a book about public opinion on trade. She said the shift could reflect increased media coverage of trade and efforts by business groups and others to influence sentiment.
"That recognition that tariffs are something that consumers would pay is something that's new," Ms. Guisinger said.
Republicans by and large see those higher prices as worth the sacrifice. Seventy-five percent of Republicans say companies will bring jobs back to the United States as a result of Mr. Trump's trade policies -- economists are skeptical -- and 83 percent say other countries often take unfair advantage of the United States.
David Markley, a moderate Republican in Alexandria, Va., said he believed economists when they said tariffs would raise prices, and he said the trade war would probably hurt the United States economy. But he said China had stolen American intellectual property and broken international trade rules, and he said some form of retaliation was overdue.
"Maybe they're not good in the short term, but what are we going to do long term about what China's doing to us?" Mr. Markley said. "Sometimes you have to take a short-term hit in order to make a long-term difference."
Mr. Markley, a financial adviser, said he wasn't sure whether the tariffs were the right response, but added, "Something needed to be done."
Trade didn't used to be a partisan issue. Before Mr. Trump made it central to his 2016 campaign, surveys showed little difference between Democrats and Republicans on trade policy. Now, as with many other issues, there is a big split.
But Ms. Guisinger said views on trade might not be as tightly locked into a partisan framework as some other issues. Longstanding Republicans are unlikely to break with the president, she said. But more recent converts, such as people who voted for former President Barack Obama and then backed Mr. Trump in 2016, might be more vulnerable, particularly if the economy weakens.
"Some of them were conservative Democrats who saw in Trump a promise of their jobs' being saved," she said. "That group we might see more likely to turn against the president if they decide these policies have not worked out."
Jenny Powell grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. She voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 because her family was struggling financially and she "thought that he would be a good businessman to take care of this country."
But Ms. Powell, 56, said that things hadn't improved since Mr. Trump took office, and that she didn't like the way he talked about immigrants. The trade war isn't a huge issue for her, she said, but she worries about rising prices, and she doesn't understand Mr. Trump's rationale for his policies.
"Is he doing it from a business perspective, or is he trying to punish?" she said. "I guess I just don't understand the full meaning of the tariffs."
Ms. Powell, who works in marketing for a travel company and now lives outside Atlanta, said she was open to voting for a Democrat next year.
"I put him there, so I can't really complain," she said. "It just feels like we're on the verge of collapse."

About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 2,579 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from June 3 to June 9. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus three percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.

Keyless Cars In Spotlight After Deaths

Texto completo: For Sherry H. Penney, a former university chancellor, and her husband, James D. Livingston, a retired physicist, the 2017 Toyota Avalon was a sensible purchase. It was a model she and her husband had owned before, but the new version had electronic sensors and other advanced features.
"The Avalon is very safe," Mr. Livingston's daughter Susan recalled hearing Ms. Penney say.
Last month, one of those features proved fatal.
Ms. Penney, 81, and Mr. Livingston, 88, were found dead at their home in Sarasota, Fla., poisoned by carbon monoxide, according to preliminary tests by the local medical examiner. Susan Livingston said that after the car -- which had a keyless ignition -- pulled into the garage attached to their house, the engine had continued to run.
The deaths highlight a hazard that regulatory and legislative efforts have yet to remedy: Without the motion of turning a physical key, some car owners, especially older ones, forget to turn off a vehicle.
Based on news reports, lawsuits, police and fire records, and research by advocacy groups, at least 36 people have been killed in the United States in such incidents since 2006, including seven in the past six months. Dozens of others have been injured, some left with brain damage.
The deaths of Ms. Penney and Mr. Livingston were all the more striking because of their accomplishments in academia and science. Before retiring to Florida, Ms. Penney was the first woman to serve permanently as chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Boston and held other leadership roles in the UMass and State University of New York systems. Mr. Livingston, an expert on magnets, spent decades as a researcher at General Electric and taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The couple collaborated on a book about Martha Wright, a women's rights figure in the 1800s who was Mr. Livingston's great-great-grandmother.
"These are very smart people," Ms. Livingston said. "This kind of situation can happen to anybody."
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees the auto industry, proposed a rule for keyless vehicles in 2011 mandating a one-second audible external warning to drivers to turn off the ignition. The rule would cost the auto industry $ 500,000 a year, according to an agency estimate. But after lobbying from the industry, the proposal has remained in limbo.
Asked recently for comment, the agency repeated earlier guidance, pointing consumers to a safety video about the use and potential dangers of keyless ignitions.
Some keyless models activate audible warnings or flashing lights inside or outside the car if the door is opened while the motor is running. The Toyota Avalon, for example, is designed to beep once internally and three times externally in such circumstances. But as the deaths of Ms. Penney and Mr. Livingston indicate, such alerts are not always adequate.
"I think if they bought a different car, they'd be alive," Ms. Livingston said.
Contacted for this article, the automaker said, "Toyota vehicles meet or exceed all regulatory safety standards."
An investigation by The New York Times last year highlighted the extent of the hazard with keyless ignitions and the regulatory inaction. Soon after, Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, demanded during a hearing that the highway safety agency adopt its proposed rule and require carmakers to make vehicles shut off automatically after a set period of idling. Earlier this year, Mr. Blumenthal introduced a bill to do just that.
The Senate legislation, the Park It Act, has yet to be scheduled for a committee hearing. But this month a group of House members -- three Democrats and a Republican -- introduced an identical bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee.
"This is something we clearly have the technology to prevent," Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat and the bill's lead House sponsor, said of the carbon-monoxide deaths.
Ford and General Motors have announced their support for the legislation.
Some automakers have added an automatic shut-off, including Ford on all its keyless vehicles since the 2015 model year. G.M. retrofitted some of its vehicles to add the automatic shut-off, at $ 5 apiece, the company told regulators.
Toyota, whose vehicles have been involved in half of the fatal incidents, has announced that its 2020 keyless models will come with an automatic shut-off function. It would not say whether it supported the congressional legislation.
Hyundai said that it backed the legislation and that it planned to install the auto-shut-off technology in new models, but did not offer a timeline for doing so.
A representative of Fiat Chrysler said the company was reviewing the legislation, but added that "statistics show no increase in such injuries when compared with vehicles featuring conventional rotary-key ignition systems," and that "automatic shut-off technology may have unintended consequences."
Nissan, Daimler, Mazda and Subaru declined to say whether they had a position on the legislation. Several automakers did not respond to inquiries.
While mandated safety features remain elusive, millions of cars with keyless ignitions are on the road. The feature is now standard in more than half of the vehicles made each year, according to the auto information website Edmunds.
"Those cars might be out there seven, eight, 10 years," Ms. Livingston said. "What about all those other people that might die?"

Texto completo: Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, Amy Klobuchar tells Jay Inslee that he actually isn’t the only candidate to pass laws protecting a woman’s reproductive health; Jared and Ivanka rent a house; legislation galore; and more.
But first, one final plug for MinnPost’s summer membership drive, which ends this Sunday. This newsletter, and all of our reporting, is absolutely not possible without your support. Anything helps, so please consider contributing. Your contributions mean we can keep reporting on the Minnesota congressional delegation, as well as what’s happening in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Greater Minnesota.
Now let’s get on with it.
The President Next Door?
There was a moment, during the debate Wednesday, when Sen. Amy Klobuchar pointed out that someone on the stage was being flippant.
“I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health in health insurance,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said, inviting very obvious criticism.
Klobuchar obliged. “I just want to say, there’s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman’s right to choose. I’ll start with that.”
Beyond swiping at Jay Inslee for a very out of touch comment, Klobuchar was notably absent from the night’s more heated exchanges. And it’s not that Klobuchar didn’t have time to speak. She was able to speak 8.5 minutes in total, more than Tim Ryan (D-OH), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), John Delaney, New York Mayor Bill De Blasio, and Washington Governor Jay Inslee. It’s that during the night, she didn’t find a foil or anyone to contrast her policy positions. Read More at MinnPost.
* Star Tribune : Trump was focus of Klobuchar’s critiques as she looked to break from pack
* New York Times: There Were 3 Women Onstage, and a Man Had a Lot to Say About His Work on Abortion
Some other news from the rest of the bunch.
Yesterday was the second night of two-hour debates, and that means we are one step further to no longer watching candidates trade barbs or land zingers on the national stage. If you didn’t have time to watch, the debates can still be streamed on the network’s digital services, including NBCNews.com and MSNBC.com.
The second night features:
* Michael Bennet, Colorado senator
* Joe Biden, former vice president
* Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind.
* Kirsten Gillibrand, New York senator
* Kamala Harris, California senator
* John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado
* Bernie Sanders, Vermont senator
* Eric Swalwell, California U.S. representative
* Marianne Williamson, self-help author
* Andrew Yang, former tech executive
Our house, in the middle of the (mining) lease
The New York Times this week published a major story about Antofagasta PLC, the majority stakeholders behind the Twin Metals mine in northern Minnesota. They primarily asked why President Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, Jared and Ivanka, are renting a house in DC from Andrónico Luksic Craig, whose family controls the Luksic Group and Antofagasta PLC.
Klobuchar, too, has an interesting stance on Twin Metals. Although it’s often unclear what that stance might be.

Every Child Deserves a Family Act
Second District Rep. Angie Craig, who is co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, penned a personal op-ed in The Hill this week in support of legislation that would help end foster care discrimination. You can read it here, but I’ll drop a few paragraphs below:
Pride month is a time when we reaffirm this commitment as a community, a time for us to celebrate the progress we have made toward equality. It’s also a time to focus on all of the work we have left to make sure every member of our community is safe, supported and has the opportunity to build a good life.
While many may assume the fight for LGBTQ equality ended with the marriage equality decision, many members of our community still experience discrimination when trying to find housing, searching for a job, and, in my own personal experience, trying to become a parent.
When I adopted my oldest son, Josh, now 21, I faced discrimination that launched me into a legal battle that went on for years. My ability to provide a loving home for my son was called into question simply because I was raising him with another woman. For three years, I didn’t know if the child I was raising every day would be there at the end of the day to tuck into bed.
The bill Craig is talking about, the Every Child Deserves a Family Act, was introduced by Rep. John Lewis earlier this month. The bill would prevent any child welfare agency from receiving federal funding if they discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.
A tale of two bills
On Monday morning, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota’s Fifth District unveiled a bill that would eliminate all student debt. Omar has been working on this bill for quite some time and decided to release it alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington), as a package. Jayapal’s House bill would establish free college, and Sanders’ Senate bill would contain both of their House bills.
And late last week, Rep. Angie Craig released her bill, the Halt Unchecked Member Benefits with Lobbying Elimination — or HUMBLE — Act. The bill is a grab bag of anti-corruption and accountability reforms: It would ban members from holding individual stock, ban them from purchasing first-class airline tickets with office travel expenses, ban former members of Congress from using congressional facilities, and perhaps most critically, ban members from becoming lobbyists.
The Lincoln Reagan (Cheney) Dinner
Minnesota Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan announced that Rep. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, will be headlining the Minnesota Republican Party’s annual Lincoln Reagan Dinner. Cheney is the House Republican Conference Chair, the third-highest position in Republican leadership.
Earlier this month, Cheney and Sixth District Congressman Tom Emmer had a behind the scenes clash over the direction of the party.
In other news
* Former Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III is set to testify on July 17, after weeks of uncertainty as to whether or not he’d speak to congress after releasing his report and closing down the Special Counsel’s Office.
* Prosecutors allege indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-50) used campaign funds for multiple affairs, which they referred to as “intimate personal activities unrelated to Hunter’s campaign.”
Quote of the week
“When they say Medicare for All, you just meditate.” — Presidential candidate Marrianne Williamson’s press team during the debate.
What I’m reading
Read Tara Golshan at Vox: “Bernie Sanders is using his massive email list to warn immigrants about ICE raids”
The Sanders’ campaign has been doing some unconventional things with their email list. First, they used it to mobilize supporters to attend to union protests. Now they’re using it to warn undocumented immigrants about Immigration and Customs enforcement raids.
Read Amanda Darrach at the Columbia Journalism Review: “It’s not a party for Sarah Huckabee Sanders”
A bunch of journalists in DC threw a party for outgoing Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who has refused to concede that journalists are not the enemy of the American people. As you can see, everything in Washington is just fine.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: gschneider@minnpost.com. Follow at @gabemschneider . And don’t forget to become a MinnPost member.
Correction: This story previously described Andrónico Luksic Craig as the CEO of Antofagasta PLC. He is actually a board member of Antofagasta PLC and chairman of Quiñenco, another of the Luksic Group’s holdings.

Jessica Walter plays mothers only their own mothers could love.
Consider Lucille Bluth, the devious, vodka-swilling matriarch of the dysfunctional family on the sitcom cult classic "Arrested Development." And ponder Malory, the bibulous spymaster and stunningly indifferent mother (she once "forgot" to give her new address to her son's boarding school) voiced by Ms. Walter on the animated series "Archer." The 10th season is currently running on the FXX network.
These roles aren't typecasting. In person, Ms. Walter is warm, accessible and seemingly grateful for every good thing that has come her way. When she says "darling," it sounds more affectionately maternal than tediously theatrical. "I think I once told someone, 'Ask my daughter. She'll tell you I'm nothing like Lucille,'" Ms. Walter says, settling herself on a couch in the apartment she shares with her husband, the actor Ron Leibman, on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Different as they are, Ms. Walter still loves Lucille Bluth. "She's been good to me," says Ms. Walter, 78. Her performance in "Arrested Development" created the template for Malory and made her a shoo-in for her role on "Archer." "I didn't see [Lucille] as an evil, manipulative person," Ms. Walter adds. "Comedy comes out of desperation, so I came at her seeing how desperate she was, how desperate to maintain her lifestyle. The trick is to find something in a bad character that the audience can relate to somehow."
Ms. Walter got her first acting job when she was 17. Since then, she has worked steadily onstage, on television (name a series, and she's probably been a guest star, from "The Love Boat" to "NCIS") and on the big screen. Her movies include "The Group" (1966), "Bye Bye Braverman," (1968), "The Flamingo Kid" (1984) and, perhaps most notably, Clint Eastwood's directorial debut "Play Misty for Me," with Ms. Walter cast as a radio host's deranged fan.
Whatever the quality of the material, she was good (she won an Emmy in 1974 for playing the title character on the police drama "Amy Prentiss"), and she was game. She willingly (albeit unsuccessfully) auditioned to be the voice of Elsie the cow on a dairy commercial. "Moooo. Moooo," she intones, to prove that she could have been a contender.
But not until the debut of "Arrested Development" in 2003 did Ms. Walter hit a jackpot. Here, finally, was a great, profile-raising role—a rare thing for an actress then about to celebrate her 63rd birthday. "I considered myself lucky to be working when I was young," she says. "I consider myself really lucky to be working now because you have fewer parts for people my age."
Ms. Walter insists that she isn't famous, but she knows that she is having a moment. "It's probably better that it happened when I was older and wiser," she says. "And I know how to deal with things in a better way for sure than when I was 20. I don't let things get to me the way I did then."
That ability to deal with things was tested last year, just before Netflix released a new season of "Arrested Development." During a May 2018 New York Times interview promoting the new episodes, Ms. Walter tearfully recounted how Jeffrey Tambor, her ex-husband on the show, had verbally abused her on the set. Several male cast members defended Mr. Tambor, sparking a controversy. "I profusely have apologized," Mr. Tambor told the Times.
"Oh, I knew you were going to ask about that," Ms. Walter says. "First of all, I never brought up the subject to anyone. I had so stifled it, so pushed it under the rug, as people of my generation were trained to do." The cause of Mr. Tambor's eruption: "I did what is called resetting a take. Instead of the director saying, 'Cut,' I stopped the scene. And I was wrong. You don't do that. It's unprofessional, but it did not warrant the verbal rage."
"I'm so sorry that it took focus from the show and from everybody's collaborative good work," Ms. Walter adds. "On the other hand, I was overwhelmed by the spark it lit in people. Not just women but men too. What more can I say?"
Ms. Walter was born in Brooklyn and raised in Astoria, Queens, the daughter of a teacher and a bass violinist in the NBC Symphony Orchestra. She can't remember a time when she wasn't bent on show business. There was never a Plan B. She took her first acting class at age 10. "Years later, someone interviewed the teacher about her past students, and she said, 'Jessie wanted to be an actress or die,'" recalls Ms. Walter.
She continued her training at New York's High School of Performing Arts and the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. At first, her focus was stage work and nothing but stage work. Ms. Walter won a prestigious Clarence Derwent Award in 1963 for her memorable Broadway debut in the Peter Ustinov play "Photo Finish." "When you are a theater actor, it serves you for the rest of your life," she says. "There is no training or experience that is anything like being live in front of an audience. It's the foundation for everything you do in television and movies."
She was sufficiently interested in broadening her résumé that she moved to Los Angeles for a time with her first husband, Ross Bowman, a stage manager turned director. He is the father of her only child, Brooke Bowman, an executive at Fox Broadcasting.
Hollywood was a mixed bag for Ms. Walter. Perhaps because she always had a husky, grown-up voice, she says she was never thought of as an ingénue. She was up for a John Wayne movie in her mid-20s, she recalls, "and the feedback was, 'We like Jessica, but we don't see her holding the horse while Mr. Wayne gallops off into the sunset.'"
"But that was OK," she continues. "I would never have wanted to be the one who held the horse. I didn't want to be Miss Vanilla Ice Cream. I wouldn't have been good at it. I did have a couple of leading lady roles in my youth, but I was always a character actor."
Ms. Walter attributes her longevity in the business to luck and sheer force of will. "I know that a lot of contemporaries who are more talented aren't getting parts," she says. "It's hanging in there. If you get rejected, you've just got to plow ahead. What keeps me going is that I still love it. I still have a passion for acting."

'Loudest Voice': Crowe plays a one-sided Ailes

Texto completo: 'The Loudest Voice' premieres Sunday 10 p.m. | Showtime
By
Former political media consultant Roger Ailes (Russell Crowe) has just been fired from CNBC, and is ready for a new challenge. Rupert Murdoch (veteran British actor, director and playwright Simon McBurney) has just the thing - a cable news channel to challenge CNN. Ailes' idea is to essentially counterprogram the rest of the mainstream media with a conservative-leaning network, and the Fox News Channel is born Oct. 7, 1996. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Ailes shifts FNC more sharply to the right, turning it into a bullhorn for George W. Bush's call for a war in Iraq, then later, a battering ram against candidate Barack Obama, whom he instructs his anchors to refer to as "Barack Hussein Obama." Meanwhile, his private life: Ailes' wife, Beth (Sienna Miller), who tends to their vast estate in Garrison, N.Y., wants another challenge and her husband buys her one, a local newspaper. Ailes has also employed Laurie Luhn (Annabelle Wallis)- whose only apparent job is to service his sexual desires. He later makes a fateful pass at Gretchen Carlson (Naomi Watts).
This short-run series is based on Gabriel Sherman's 2014 book, "The Loudest Voice in the Room: How the Brilliant, Bombastic Roger Ailes Built Fox News." It was adapted by Tom McCarthy, who won an Oscar for the screenplay of 2015's "Spotlight."
MY SAY In the opening seconds of the seven-parter "The Loudest Voice," RogerAiles (Russell Crowe)- presumably from the great beyond (he died in 2017 at 77) - declares that he knows "what people are gonna say about" him after he's gone.
Not to disappoint, Roger, but what most people probably said was "who?"
Long an object of curiosity and ultimately obsession in the media/ political worlds, none of this ever really translated to household name status, including the households of Fox News Channel. There's one obvious reason why: Ailes would never put someone on the air who looked like Roger Ailes, and in his case, he didn't. Like most TV executives, he believed viewers would be less inclined to flip the channel if the anchors they were watching were telegenic, preferably blonde- thin-female telegenic.
"The Loudest Voice" obviously doesn't have a choice in the matter. It's all about Ailes, all the time. Crowe gained weight for last fall's theatrical "Boy Erased," and kept some of that for this role, but not quite enough. He's wearing a fat suit here, while prosthetics have added the extra chin or two. His eyes are a pair of ice-blue marbles that stare out from that well-padded face. When he smiles, he can scarcely manage a rictus. When he walks, he shuffles. When he sits, he protrudes. The transformation is stunning but the effect - scene after scene, hour after hour - can be numbing.
People who knew Ailes, or competed against him, or worked for him, or (for that matter) wrote about him over the last thirty years were left no shortage of impressions beyond those physical ones. But Sherman's exhaustive reporting, and later the reporting of The New York Times, ensured one final impression, that of a sadist and serial sexual predator, who drove one of his victims (Luhn) to a breakdown.
This is the Ailes of "The Loudest Voice" and after four episodes (the ones made available for review) that can be numbing too - or worse. When he drags Luhn into a hotel room for another sordid assignation, you may be tempted to turn the channel. (My advice: Don't necessarily resist the urge.)
Because Crowe is on-screen for so much of the time, the effect is amplified. He's the miserable boss from hell who launched Fox on his own by collecting a bunch of nobodies to ape his self-styled GOP fifth column. In "The Loudest Voice," they're mostly actors playing real people - Sean Hannity, Steve Doocy, Glenn Beck, Rupert Murdoch - who look nothing like them. In a bewildering omission and missed opportunity, the series doesn't even bother to cast anyone to play Bill O'Reilly. (For some obscure reason, "Family Guy's" Seth MacFarlane plays Fox PR man Brian Lewis, but if therehad been an O'Reilly part, he just might have been perfect for it.)
You now know that "The Loudest Voice" is far from a fun series, but is it an important series? It has the beginnings of one, but the creation of Fox was far more complicated than this allows and, for that matter, so was its creator. Instead, we get the most obvious side to his story, along with the most repellent side. Perhaps that's ultimately - or grimly - fair, but it's not particularly balanced, or engaging.

'Fight or flight' reflex; Bullied teen feared for his life when he stabbed classmate: lawyer

Texto completo: A gay Bronx youth had to fight or flee, his defense lawyer said Thursday at a hearing that set the stage for the start of Abel Cedeno's manslaughter trial in the stabbing death of a high school classmate.
At a pretrial hearing in Bronx Criminal Court, Cedeno's lawyer Robert Feldman revealed "the whole defense is about [Cedeno's] state of mind" on Sept. 27, 2017, when he allegedly fatally stabbed Matthew McCree, 15, after being taunted and pelted with pens and other items as two teachers stood by.
"The defense is whether he thought he had to fight, or flight," Feldman said.
During the hearing, forensic psychiatrist Eric Goldsmith also shot down prosecutor Paul Anderson's claim that Cedeno's explanation of the rampage was inadmissible because it didn't match the police report or reflect his history of mental illness and anger issues. Goldsmith testified he "saw no evidence that [Cedeno] was untruthful."
Opening arguments are set to begin Friday. Cedeno has waived his right to a jury; the case will be heard before a Judge Michael Gross. If convicted, Cedeno faces carry from five to 25 years in jail.
During Thursday's hearing, Feldman - who has a history of courtroom clashes, including in 2016, when he was chastised for badmouthing a victim - was reprimanded for asking that a New York Times photographer be present because he's "never been in the Times before," for accusing prosecutors of being late for the hearing and for cheering under his breath in response to a witness's testimony.
Outside the courtroom, Feldman, who bragged he's a porn star and is a professional weight lifter, called Cedeno a "hero" for his response to alleged gay-bashing.
"If he didn't fight he could have been killed," Feldman said. "If you feel you may die, you better fight. ... He's a hero, I would have just run for the hills. I'm a coward."
McCree's mother, Louna Dennis, 36, lashed out at suggestions Cedeno was being targeted for his sexuality.
"Nothing here has to do with anyone being gay," she railed. "That is just bias. Matthew had gay friends and family members.
"Matthew was a loving kid, he made me breakfast the day he died. The last meal I had with my son was breakfast. ... He made friends whenever he went. He is nothing like what they paint him to be. ... You're supposed to be safe inside of a school. It's supposed to be a school, not a war zone."
Dennis has filed a civil case against the Department of Education for failing to take the required action against complaints of bullying, lacking metal detectors in the school when they were requested, and inadequate supervision by the classroom. It also brings claims against Cedeno for wrongful death. He's represented in that legal action by Sanford Rubenstein.
Cedeno filed a suit against the Education Department for failing to comply with the Dignity for all Students Act related to bullying he allegedly experienced for his sexuality.
"It's very, very difficult for me," Dennis said on Wednesday. "But I have to do it. ... I'm his voice."

Tillerson Says He Was Out of the Loop as Kushner Met With Foreign Leaders

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- In a meeting in Riyadh in 2017, Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and adviser, talked with Saudi and Emirati leaders about their secret plans to impose a blockade on a critical American ally, Qatar. On another night, in a quiet corner of a Washington restaurant, Mr. Kushner huddled with the foreign minister of Mexico.
Left out of the loop in both cases was Rex W. Tillerson, then secretary of state. When he stumbled into Mr. Kushner and the Mexican foreign minister at the restaurant in Washington, Mr. Tillerson said he saw "the color go out" of the minister's face.
Not until last month, in a closed-door interview before Congress, did Mr. Tillerson learn of Mr. Kushner's discussions on the blockade with Arab leaders.
[Read the transcript of the full interview with Mr. Tillerson.]
"It makes me angry," he told lawmakers and their aides. "I didn't have a say. The State Department's views were never expressed."
Those accounts highlight the extent to which Mr. Kushner was quietly seeking to manage some of the nation's most sensitive foreign policy issues, leaving Mr. Tillerson and other senior national security officials -- including Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary -- in the dark.
In some cases, as in the blockade of Qatar, where the United States has its main Middle East military air base, Mr. Kushner's moves forced Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis to scramble to contain the damage to American diplomacy, according to the accounts.
The details emerged in a seven-hour interview conducted on May 21 by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which had asked Mr. Tillerson to talk about the inner workings of the Trump administration.
Mr. Tillerson described the challenges of briefing the president, saying he had to be "very concise." He covered topics that have generated great controversy since Mr. Trump took office in January 2017: Mr. Trump's meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the administration's hard-line immigration policy and Mr. Kushner's dealings with leaders of Persian Gulf nations.
"You said that you raised concerns about this phenomenon with Mr. Kushner and he said he would try to do better," a committee aide said, referring to Mr. Kushner working with foreign officials independently of Mr. Tillerson. "Did you raise it with others, other key players in the administration or the president himself?"
Mr. Tillerson said he did.
A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said Thursday night that "Jared consistently follows proper protocols" with the National Security Council and State Department. He said the "alleged 'dinner' to supposedly discuss the blockade never happened," and no one in the White House was "involved in the blockade." (A transcript of the interview with Mr. Tillerson described the Riyadh meeting as a dinner.) He added that Mr. Kushner's work with Mexico had led to positive results on trade and other issues.
The New York Times and several other news organizations obtained a copy of the committee's interview transcript before its release on Thursday afternoon. Parts had been redacted at the request of Mr. Tillerson and the State Department.
Mr. Tillerson became secretary of state in February 2017, after being asked to meet with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and two other aides, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus, in Trump Tower. But Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump subsequently clashed over policy, the president's management style and his intellectual capacity -- Mr. Tillerson is said to have once called Mr. Trump a "moron" to other officials -- before Mr. Tillerson was fired in March 2018.
Mr. Tillerson also alienated State Department officials and career employees because he tried to cut the budget, left important posts open and, in their eyes, remained aloof -- all of which he was asked about in the committee interview.
The most telling anecdotes show Mr. Kushner and, to a degree, Mr. Bannon, making foreign policy in the shadows.
Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said that in the weeks leading up to a presidential summit in Riyadh in May 2017, Saudi officials did not give him any indication of their deepening political disputes with Qatar and their aim to join with the Emiratis and other Arab nations to impose a blockade.
One night around May 20, Saudi and Emirati leaders met with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bannon over dinner and told the Americans of their plans for the blockade, a Democratic counsel said during the committee interview. Mr. Tillerson said he had not heard of the dinner until the committee interview.
Mr. Kushner has close ties with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, two powerful rulers whose policies have roiled the Middle East and resulted in widespread human rights abuses, particularly in the Yemen war, critics say. The blockade of Qatar complicated the ability of the United States to manage delicate relationships in the Middle East.
Mr. Tillerson told the committee that he and Mr. Mattis were both taken by surprise when they first heard about the blockade, begun on June 5, while on a diplomatic trip to Australia. Mr. Tillerson said he and Mr. Mattis scrambled to make calls to the Middle East.
"At that point, the most productive thing that I felt I could do, given where I was at the time, was to just ask all the parties to not escalate this further," Mr. Tillerson said. "I didn't have enough information to know if something had really set this off or an event that hadn't been reported."
Mr. Tillerson was asked whether he had any suspicions that Mr. Kusher's support of the blockade was tied to failed business negotiations between the Qataris and the Kushner family, which develops property. Mr. Tillerson said he could not "opine" on it.
Mr. Tillerson also told the committee in detail about a meeting that Mr. Kushner had with the foreign minister of Mexico, Luis Videgaray, at a Washington restaurant without Mr. Tillerson's knowledge. The restaurant owner told Mr. Tillerson, who happened to be dining there the same night, about the presence of the other two men. Mr. Tillerson said he walked up to their table and watched the blood drain from Mr. Videgaray's face.
"I don't want to interrupt what y'all are doing," he said he told Mr. Videgaray while smiling broadly. "Give me a call next time you're coming to town."
Mr. Kushner would make frequent work trips overseas without telling the State Department and was "in charge of his own agenda," Mr. Tillerson said.
The committee pressed Mr. Tillerson on Mr. Trump's relationship with Mr. Putin. Lawmakers asked why no note-taker was present for a July 2017 meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin in Hamburg, Germany. The lack of any formal record of some of Mr. Trump's discussions with Mr. Putin has been a continuing controversy during his presidency.
Mr. Tillerson said "the Russians preferred" no note-taker be present at the session, which he attended along with Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister. The American side agreed, he said, because the meeting was expected to be a short, introductory exchange of pleasantries.
Instead, the meeting lasted well over two hours. Mr. Tillerson said that Mr. Putin came "very prepared" to discuss an issue that Mr. Tillerson did not describe. Mr. Trump was not as prepared "because we didn't expect that's the way it was going to go," he said.
Mr. Trump has said that in that conversation, Mr. Putin twice denied that the Russian government had interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
Asked about the president's style, Mr. Tillerson said that he disliked briefing reports and detailed policy discussions, often approached issues with his mind already made up, and routinely veered off into unexpected topics during meetings.
He declined to criticize the president's undisciplined approach, saying it was up to aides to adapt.
But he did not defend Mr. Trump's character. Asked if he could describe the president's value system, he replied, "No, I can't."

A trip to a carwash might seem like a water-wasting extravagance. But it's better than the driveway alternative.
The most efficient way to wash your car "is definitely taking it to a carwash," said Dean Minchillo, a water conservation program manager for Tarrant Regional Water District in North Texas. "Although most folks don't think that way."
Rinsing your car with a garden hose at home can quickly rack up 100 gallons of water or more, according to the Southwest Car Wash Alliance. The exact amount will vary, but just to give an example: a standard-diameter garden hose, 50 feet long, with average household water pressure will expel about 11 gallons per minute. If you have the hose running for 10 minutes while washing the car, you'll use about 110 gallons of water.
Self-service carwash stations limit you to around 17 or 18 gallons of water. And most full-service stations average 30 to 45 gallons of water per car, according to a 2018 study by the International Carwash Association.
Many machine carwashes recycle and reuse water, which helps their bottom line, Mr. Minchillo said. And at self-service washes, high-pressure nozzles and timers keep water use to a minimum.
But the biggest reason to go to a carwash is to prevent pollution, Mr. Minchillo said. When you wash your car at home, all the dirt, oil, engine fluids, soapy phosphates and chlorides from the soap can run with the water into a storm drain and into nearby rivers and lakes.
Carwash businesses are supposed to collect the water they use when it can no longer be recycled and send it to a wastewater treatment plant, where the pollutants can be filtered out before the water flows into the ecosystem.
State and local governments in places like Washington and New York encourage residents to take their dirty cars to a carwash to prevent this kind of runoff pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency also recommends washing your car less often and having it done by a professional when possible. If you have to wash your car yourself, the agency recommends using a bucket rather than a hose.
You might want to call around to see if a carwash in your area participates in a WaterSavers program or has similar efficiency measures in place. You'll be doing yourself, and your local waterways, a favor.

Pristine Wilderness, a Mine and a Trump Connection
By Hiroko Tabuchi
The world will need more copper, which is used extensively in wind and solar power systems, as it turns toward renewable sources of energy.
So, the United States must put all its copper deposits to good use -- or so goes the argument for mining on the edge of the Boundary Waters, a pristine wilderness area in Minnesota.
Environmental groups have vehemently opposed a plan to do just that. And the Obama administration had moved to block the mining project, citing the risk of contaminating the region's vast lakes and forests.
After all, activists say, tackling the climate crisis must go hand-in-hand with protecting vital ecosystems.
Groups that oppose the mine have also zeroed in on an unusual link between the family of President Trump and the Chilean family conglomerate that is planning the mine.
The billionaire patriarch of the family, Andrónico Luksic, also happens to be the landlord of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president's daughter and son-in-law.
Mr. Luksic's company, Antofagasta, categorically denies any connection between the mining project and his relationship with the Kushners. A spokesman for Mr. Kushner's lawyer said the rental and the Minnesota mine were "entirely unrelated" and that there was "no correlation in any way" between them.
My colleague Steve Eder and I tracked how, from the early weeks of the Trump administration, officials at the Interior Department worked to remove obstacles to the mining project. We examined government records and interviewed current and former officials. I also took a trip to Minnesota's Iron Range and into the Boundary Waters (by dog sled).

No more ‘poverty naps’ on campus

Texto completo: When college students return to their campuses in the fall, many will face a growing problem that threatens to undermine their chances for success. Hunger. Recent surveys agree that more than one-third of all college students suffer at times from bouts of food insecurity. The rate is far higher for students with an extra risk factor: belonging to a racial minority, having a single parent or being the first in their family to attend college, for example.
A New York Times report on local campuses told these stories: "A senior at Lehman College in the Bronx dreams of starting her day with breakfast. An undergraduate at New York University said he has been so delirious from hunger he’s caught himself walking down the street not realizing where he’s going. A health sciences student at Stony Brook University on Long Island describes ‘poverty naps,’ where she decides to go to sleep rather than deal with her hunger pangs."
In one sense, the problem reflects good news: the growing diversity of student bodies, from both racial and socioeconomic perspectives. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office says only 29% of those now in college are "traditional students," who enroll right out of high school and depend on their parents for support. The rest, especially in community colleges, can be older, and financially fragile — often with children of their own. But federal aid programs have not kept up with this changing profile and rising need. Forty years ago, Pell grants, the main source of public support for needy students, covered half the average cost at two-year colleges and 39% at public four-year colleges. Today, according to statistics from the Department of Education, those rates have dropped to 37% at community schools and 19% at bigger universities.
The result could be called the "hunger gap," which Steve sees firsthand at George Washington University, where he has taught for almost 30 years. The way the federal government calculates a student’s annual need is woefully inadequate, and even students with "full rides" can have trouble affording full meals.
One answer is a rapid expansion of campus-based food banks. Many campuses have tried other innovations. Programs called Share Meals and Swipe Out Hunger enable students to donate their unused dining hall credits to hungry classmates. There are more. One critical change would involve SNAP, the federal nutrition program once known as food stamps. Its rules regarding student eligibility remain highly restrictive and confusing, and the GAO reports that about 2 million students who could have qualified for aid in 2017 did not receive it.
Simplifying the rules and extending eligibility to more students makes total sense. But the Trump administration is actually trying to reduce the program and eliminate recipients, even as the need continues to grow. That’s both profoundly immoral and utterly counterproductive. Programs to combat hunger easily pay for themselves: Students who don’t have to worry about food do better in school, graduate at higher rates and are more likely to become productive, taxpaying citizens.
The public policy goal should be completely clear and compelling: No more growling stomachs in classrooms. No more "poverty naps" instead of lunch.

A Walkout at Wayfair. Is a Boycott Next?

Texto completo: Frustrated Americans, spurred on by social media campaigns, have been quick to cut off their spending on big brands as a form of political protest in the Trump era.
That makes an employee walkout at the online home furnishing company Wayfair particularly precarious, as some of the company's staff loudly objected to its involvement with the detention of migrant children near the United States' southwestern border.
Employees at the company's Boston headquarters left their offices Wednesday afternoon to protest Wayfair's sale of more than $ 200,000 of bedroom furniture to a government contractor that operates a network of the centers. The walkout followed reports of facilities that were overcrowded and filthy, where children and teenagers were lacking clean clothing and sufficient food.
The walkout has not led to a full-blown boycott yet, but the situation has drawn the attention of activist groups that have had some success using social media to rally consumers. Sleeping Giants, a Twitter account with 235,000 followers that was formed to choke off ad dollars to far-right groups after the 2016 election and has since become a consumer action organization, shared a tip on the Wayfair orders on Tuesday.
By the end of the day, the company's employees had organized their walkout using the newly formed @wayfairwalkout account on Twitter to garner support, and some people were already tweeting a #BoycottWayfair hashtag.
"We had gotten an anonymous tip from someone who worked there saying that the agency responsible for the detention centers placed a fairly large order and that there were people within the company that had a big problem with that, and we put that out there," Matt Rivitz, who created Sleeping Giants, said in an interview. "This next wave of protest is not just consumer-oriented, but it's also employee-oriented."
Wayfair declined to comment on the walkout.
Social media has helped fuel a host of boycotts in the nearly three years since President Trump's election. The online boycott campaign #GrabYourWallet pressured retailers like Nordstrom to stop carrying merchandise tied to the president's daughter Ivanka Trump. Calls to #DeleteUber followed accusations that the company tried to profit from a protest against the president's executive order barring refugees and immigrants from certain countries from entering the United States. L.L. Bean, New Balance, Kellogg's and more have all found themselves at risk of politically motivated boycotts in recent years.
Lately, the pressure has also been coming from employees. At big technology companies like Google and Microsoft, workers have turned to petitions and walkouts to seek change, including around who they do business with. At Microsoft and Amazon, workers have objected to working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
At Wayfair, more than 500 employees signed a letter to the company's leadership on Friday asking that the company cease doing business with the contractor, BCFS, and others involved in operating such facilities. The employees said that they were writing "from a place of concern and anger about the atrocities being committed at our Southern border," and wanted to ensure that Wayfair had "no part in enabling, supporting, or profiting from this practice."
Wayfair's leaders defended the contract in a letter on Monday evening and said it was the company's business to sell to any customer who was acting within the law. They added, "No matter how strongly any one of us feels about an issue, it is important to keep in mind that not all employees or customers agree."
Wayfair isn't alone in facing criticism.
Sleeping Giants has targeted Bank of America for providing financing to Caliburn International, the parent company of the Homestead facility for minors in Florida, saying it is "the only big bank profiting from family separation."
On Wednesday, Bank of America said that it would end its relationships with all private prison companies.
"The private sector is attempting to respond to public policy and government needs and demands in the absence of longstanding and widely recognized reforms needed in criminal justice and immigration policies," Jessica Oppenheim, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, said in an email to The New York Times. "We have been discussing this topic for some time."
Two other banks, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, said they would end their relationships with the private prison industry in March.
"As we're learning more about the horrific conditions in the Trump-era detention centers, things are ratcheting up, and people are looking for more ways to express that frustration," said Shannon Coulter, a founder of the #GrabYourWallet campaign.
"I got a lot of requests yesterday for information on any other companies that may be doing business with the detention centers," Ms. Coulter said on Wednesday. "We don't have perfect visibility into that, but as we learn more about the companies that do business there, we're adding them to the list," she said. "We're in touch with a lot of organizations that do work with immigrant communities."
Ms. Coulter that her group was not yet adding Wayfair to its boycott list because people at the border needed beds, and because it was waiting to see how the company's executives would respond after the walkout. For example, she said, the company could choose to fill the orders without profiting from them.
On Wednesday, Wayfair apparently told employees that it would donate $ 100,000 to the American Red Cross. The move was praised on the @wayfairwalkout account, but it also noted that the organization had nothing to do with the detention facilities.
Mr. Rivitz said his group was focused on questioning companies while informing consumers, who could make their own decisions about what companies they wanted to support. That's a particular risk for consumer-facing brands.
"Yes, there are big private prison groups and large nonprofits that are involved in this, and ultimately they're going to do business how they do business," Mr. Rivitz said. "But certainly, companies that we all use, consumers expect a little bit more."
"It's really hard for people to see shiny and happy people in ads, then know a company's profiting off incarcerated children," he added.

Analysis: Walmart's Spend-and-Tell Strategy Paid Off in Bribery Settlement; The retailer spent over $900 million on investigations and compliance enhancements during a probe into alleged Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations

Texto completo: Quarter after quarter, the figure grew. By the time Walmart Inc. reached a long-awaited settlement with U.S. authorities last week, the company had amassed more than $900 million in costs from compliance enhancements and internal investigations into foreign bribery law violations in Mexico, Brazil, China and India.
The size of that figure—and Walmart's publicity of it—may be among the reasons the retail giant received what some view as lenient treatment. Government officials in late 2016 had sought $1 billion from the company, but after several years of negotiation Walmart ultimately agreed to pay $282 million total in separate agreements with the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"It's a great result for the company," said Joan Meyer, a former government prosecutor and a white-collar defense lawyer at Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht LLP. "The fact that Walmart was out there and publicly making it known it had spent $900 million on compliance and investigations was smart. It was something that the department had to consider in forming a resolution."
"Compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws is a responsibility we take seriously," Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman, said. "That's why we've invested tremendous resources in our Global Ethics and Compliance Program, including our enhanced Global Anti-Corruption Compliance Program."
Companies don't receive reduced penalties simply by spending large sums, but they often do get discounts for cooperating with prosecutors and taking steps to address the root problems underlying a bribery violation, including by strengthening compliance programs.
As a result, it is common for companies to give presentations to prosecutors about what a company is doing to strengthen its compliance program. Walmart took the extra step of citing the costs in financial disclosures, which may have helped to improve its reputation with investors and regulators.
Fifteen months after alerting government authorities in 2011 to potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations, Walmart began issuing quarterly disclosures on expenditures on legal costs, including for compliance and internal investigations. It started with an expenditure of $157 million in the company's 2013 fiscal year, climbing to a peak of $282 million in 2014.
The majority of the $900 million Walmart paid in legal costs wasn't spent directly on compliance. The bulk of it went to an internal investigation led by lawyers at Jones Day and to responding to inquiries from government investigators. From early 2013 until its most recent annual disclosure, the retailer spent $509 million on investigations, according to a Walmart representative.
The size of Walmart's legal costs is testament to the length of the corruption probe , which was sparked by a series of articles by the New York Times in 2012 detailing how Walmart had brushed aside allegations by a whistleblower that centered on the company's operations in Mexico. As the years went by, the probe grew to cover misconduct in other countries where Walmart had undergone rapid expansion.
Expenses related to Walmart's compliance program cost $235 million during the same period. The company says it didn't track separate compliance and investigations expenses in financial disclosures for the first year of the probe, when it spent $157 million.
Walmart now employs about 1,000 people in its compliance department, including more than 100 monitors who have conducted at least 16,000 in-store compliance assessments in international markets since 2014, Walmart said in a statement.
The spend-and-tell strategy seems to have paid off. The Justice Department, in announcing the settlement, acknowledged Walmart's "significant remedial measures," highlighting the company's hiring of a global chief compliance officer.
Prosecutors also noted that the company was conducting monthly anticorruption monitoring and implementing enhanced controls around the use of third-party intermediaries. Such language in charging documents and government press releases is meant to broadcast to other companies how they also can receive lenient treatment from prosecutors.
The amount a company spends on compliance improvements isn't typically part of conversations taking place between prosecutors and company counsel—at least not directly, said Ephraim Wernick, a former assistant chief of the Justice Department's FCPA unit.
But Walmart's case was unique in terms of the length of the investigation and its impact on the company, said Mr. Wernick, now a lawyer at Vinson & Elkins LLP who said he didn't have any involvement in the Walmart investigation or its outcome.
"Behind the scenes, is that something that DOJ takes into account? I think you would have to," he said. "Because it at least shows an effort by the company to play by the rules."

Texto completo: Where politicians are concerned, especially aging and garrulous ones, it may be a mistake to attribute to strategy what can be chalked up to simple fecklessness. But amid the shambolic style of Joe Biden's front-running campaign to date, the flip-flops and apparent gaffes, it's possible to discern a certain method, a general plan for how the candidate hopes to run for president: by changing positions on issues when he needs to, but without betraying his own amour-propre, his sense of what - being Joe Biden - is supposed to mean.
This combination is an interesting response to the political dilemma Biden faces. The party's activists and enforcers hate his record and his style, while many of his core supporters like him precisely because he's out of step with the ideologists. This leaves him with a choice between consolidating his current support and risking a divisive conflict with the left, or potentially losing core supporters while pledging fealty to emerging liberal orthodoxies.
Or, alternatively, it requires him to weave and stagger between the two approaches, tilting left on litmus tests while reassuring moderates with his public style. So Biden will go along with the activists when they demand a specific shift, as they did with his long-held, now-repudiated opposition to public funding for abortion. But then he'll refuse to repudiate anything that falls into the broader zone of Biden-ness - the un-PC, he's-from-a-different-time stuff, encompassing everything from his handsiness with women to his recent lament for the lost days when you could smoke cigars with segregationist Democrats and cut deals with Rockefeller Republicans.
From a moral perspective, this approach should make you think less of Biden, since it suggests he regards his principles (religiously-informed ones, supposedly, in the case of his abortion votes) as ultimately dispensable, but his Irish-uncle shtick as too essential to repudiate.
But the approach has a certain strategic logic. It assumes that activists can be appeased with specific promises, while the moderation of many older Democrats manifests itself more in general cultural attitudes than detailed policy preferences. It assumes that absorbing a certain kind of attack from the left - Biden's too nostalgic for the bad old days, Biden's a chump if he thinks he can cut deals with Republicans - helps with voters who are nostalgic for the days of dealmaking themselves, without making it impossible to eventually unite the party in the way that staking out heretical positions might.
These assumptions are by no means crazy. But it is also very easy to see how they might fail. Biden is hardly the most formidable of front-runners, and if any piece of the current coalition breaks off, he'll be in deep trouble. And his rivals have obvious plays that might make that breakup happen.
The first play is to split off some of Biden's African-American support by linking his nostalgia for dealmaking to his less-than-progressive record on race. This is the play Cory Booker is trying to execute, and Booker's campaign probably depends on its success - which is by no means foreordained, since the African-American vote is more conservative and Biden-friendly than the median white liberal. But nobody before his years as Obama's VP would have regarded Biden as a natural destination for the black vote, and enough sustained tone-deafness in the present could make that past matter once again.
The second play is to make the broader "Uncle Joe" persona, not just its unwoke element, a liability for Biden's elect-me-to-beat-Trump case. This is probably the Pete Buttigieg play, though it's available to any younger candidate: Without saying so directly, establish contrasts that make Biden look old, confused, a man out of time, even Trump-y in his own right. Don't challenge his record, don't call him a troglodyte - just challenge the conceit that a likable but past-his-prime uncle makes the right contrast with Trump.
The third play is to attack Biden from the center when he flip-flops, and try to break off his more conservative supporters by arguing that the former VP isn't the moderate he used to be. This should be an obvious move for the legion of candidates (Amy Klobuchar, Tim Ryan, Seth Moulton, Michael Bennet, etc.) lining up to inherit the moderate torch if Biden's campaign fails. But I suspect it will be hard for them to execute, because none of them seem eager to fight the activist left either. Still, every time Biden decides to check an ideological box, he leaves this flank exposed.
And the fourth play - well, the fourth play doesn't actually require breaking up Biden's current coalition; it just requires uniting a slightly larger portion of the party against him.
We have an example of how not to do this in the failed attempts by Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio to unite Republican primary voters against Donald Trump. But in the rising line of Elizabeth Warren's polling support, and the flat or falling lines of all the other non-Biden candidates, you can see at least the beginning of how NeverBiden might unite, and win.

Texto completo: Large U.S. tech companies in the direct sights of the Trump administration's ban on exports to Huawei Technologies Co. are finding ways to resume some shipments to the blacklisted Chinese tech giant without running afoul of American regulations.
Micron Technology Inc., one of the world's largest makers of memory chips, on Tuesday said it restarted some shipments to Huawei after determining they were in compliance with U.S. law. Qualcomm Inc., the leading supplier of wireless chips, has also resumed shipments of certain radio-frequency components to Huawei, while Intel Corp. resumed shipments of some of its products, according to people familiar with the matter. Other American tech companies including ON Semiconductor Corp. are also examining ways that would allow them to resume shipments.
The moves are part of a wider effort by American companies to fulfill contracts and continue doing business with Huawei while remaining compliant with Commerce Department restrictions on exporting technology to the Chinese technology giant.
Huawei was a prolific buyer of American technology -- spending $11 billion last year -- until the Commerce Department put it on a blacklist in May. That required companies supplying Huawei with U.S.-sourced equipment to apply for licenses.
The blacklisting prompted an industrywide halt in shipments to Huawei, which had been stockpiling components in anticipation of the action, as companies assessed the new rules. It also led Alphabet Inc.'s Google to pull its Android operating system from future Huawei phone models, while many non-U.S. technology companies -- like U.K. chip-design firm ARM Holdings PLC -- cut off their business with the company.
The blacklisting means that exports from the U.S. to Huawei of any type of equipment or technology is prohibited. But the regulations don't prohibit shipments to Huawei of components made in foreign countries, as long as they don't contain more than 25% of U.S.-originated material that would be otherwise subject to U.S. export controls.
U.S.-sourced content includes physical components, but it also includes software and technical literature. For multinational technology companies like those supplying Huawei, it isn't uncommon that some exports meet the requirements and some don't.
Companies also need to decide whether they can classify products as foreign-made, potentially exempting them from Huawei restrictions. Regulations don't say precisely what criteria need to be met to qualify as being manufactured overseas, according to Kevin Wolf, a partner at law firm Akin Gump who was a Commerce Department official in the Obama administration.
John Neuffer, president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, said last week that some items could be supplied to Huawei in accordance with Commerce Department rules.
"Each company is impacted differently based on their specific products and supply chains and each company must evaluate how best to conduct its business and remain in compliance," he said in a statement.
Micron Technology, a leading memory and digital storage company, said Tuesday that some of its products that it supplied to Huawei weren't fully restricted.
"We have started shipping some orders of those products to Huawei in the last two weeks," Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra said in a call with analysts after the company reported its quarterly results.
He added that uncertainty surrounding the business with Huawei hadn't subsided and it isn't unclear how many products the company would be able to ship to Huawei and for how long.
Qualcomm, the San Diego smartphone chip giant, has resumed shipments to Huawei of radio-frequency components after the company discovered that it could do so under Commerce Department rules, according to a person familiar with the matter. Qualcomm's primary Huawei product -- broadband chips -- aren't being shipped and it isn't clear when shipments could resume, this person said.
Separately, Intel has also resumed shipments of some components after finding ways to do so while remaining compliant with Commerce Department rules, according to people familiar with the matter. The specific nature of the shipments wasn't immediately clear. The New York Times earlier reported that Intel had resumed shipments.
Many other companies are scrambling to find ways to resume shipments to Huawei. Flex Ltd., a San Jose-based technology manufacturer, said earlier this month it resumed 90% of its Huawei-related production after evaluating its business with the Chinese company. Bernard Gutmann, the chief financial officer of Phoenix-based chip maker ON Semiconductor, said earlier this month that it is working with internal and external auditors and was in talks with the Commerce Department about "all the different nuances of the law" and ways to "avail ourselves of in terms of improving" the situation.
A Commerce Department spokesman declined to comment and referred to regulations governing the entity list.
At least one company is publicly pushing back against the U.S. rules. FedEx Corp. on June 24 filed a lawsuit against the Commerce Department, saying the blacklisting of Huawei forces it to unreasonably police the contents of its deliveries. The company is under investigation in China after it acknowledged mishandling packages for Huawei.
Andy Purdy, Huawei's top U.S. cybersecurity executive, said earlier this month that the company is in close communication with its suppliers in the wake of the U.S. blacklisting.

The New York Times' long, embarrassing list of abortion fallacies

Texto completo: This weekend, the New York Times published a piece that attempts to paint anti-abortioners as hateful, oppressive, and evil people. It got a great deal of attention and was shared by major pro-abortion advocates, including Dr. Leana Wen of Planned Parenthood. However, the article is fundamentally inaccurate on many, many counts. It makes foolish arguments that educated pro-abortion advocates would be ashamed of.
The article, titled “The Long, Cruel History of the Anti-Abortion Crusade,” opens by asserting that the Founding Fathers were ideologically in line with the modern pro-abortion movement. “Our founding fathers got this right; the choice to have an abortion or a child belonged to the woman,” the New York Times says. Really?
Unlike author John Irving, the novelist who glorified abortion in The Cider House Rules, I will not make wild, unsubstantiated, and dubious claims about exactly what the Founders did or did not believe about abortion. But on the role of government, I will confidently say this: The Founders would have lamented the destruction of federalism and state powers in Roe v. Wade, and they’d despise the federal government repeatedly giving over $560 million in taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood, an independently wealthy abortion giant.
The article then notes that in the 1900s, abortion was very restricted in almost every state, and then asks, “Why was it prohibited for almost a century?"
Irving leaves this question unanswered, but the explanation is very simple: The American people democratically chose to prohibit abortion, like people in most of the civilized world at that time. That is exactly how this issue should work. There is no way on earth those ratifying the Constitution believed they were creating a right to abortion, and the 10th Amendment powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government belong to the states. Thus, state governments should have the power to regulate abortion as the voters see fit.
Next, the New York Times attempts to dress up the anti-abortion position. “I’m pro-choice — often called pro-abortion by the anti-abortion crusaders, although no one is pro-abortion ... the difference between pro-life and pro-choice is the choice.”
Sadly, this is not true either. With Joe Biden’s flip-flop on the Hyde Amendment, every major Democratic 2020 candidate now supports direct taxpayer funding for elective abortion. They support taking money out of your wallet and using it to pay for someone else’s abortion procedure, including late term and partial-birth abortion procedures. That is pro-abortion. One does not need to be “pro-life” to object to this coercive action, which involves no choice at all, least of all on the taxpayer's part. Pro-abortion is in fact the more accurate descriptor of such a policy.
The next argument is perhaps the most foolish of them all. In an attack aimed at the Catholic Church, Irving claims that abortion restrictions violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment — as if the only reason to oppose abortion would be to follow a state religion ... or something.
“I must remind the Roman Catholic Church of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution: ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’ In other words, we are free to practice the religion of our choice, and we are protected from having someone else’s religion practiced on us.”
This implies that all sorts of other activities frowned upon by both the church and the state — murder, robbery, perjury, etc. — should perhaps be legalized.
It is an incredibly fatuous and weak argument. And don’t take my word for it, take the word of the Supreme Court justices who decided Roe, not one of whom invoked the Establishment Clause. The 1973 Roe opinion cited the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, the Ninth Amendment as applied in Griswold v. Connecticut, and even the Fourth Amendment right of protection from search and seizure. But its authors were not so weak-minded as to think abortion restrictions are a violation of the Establishment Clause. Nor did they make that argument anywhere in Doe v. Bolton, Roe's sister case, which was decided on the same day.
Irving further attacks the Catholic Church (see a pattern here?) and its traditional values by making a nonsensical claim about the Catholic Church’s view of women. “The Roman Catholic Church, and many evangelical and fundamentalist churches, willfully subject women to mandatory childbirth and motherhood — procreation is deemed a woman’s primary purpose and function. I’m not overstating. In his 1951 ‘Address to Midwives,’ Pope Pius XII states that ‘the procreation and upbringing of a new life’ is the primary end of marriage.”
In case you failed to notice Irving's sleight of hand here, the statement that procreation is the primary end of marriage is remarkably different from his misrepresentation of it as a woman’s primary purpose. That's both ignorant and intentionally deceitful, and you wonder how it got past any half-competent editor. But one might say the same of Irving's entire piece.

Texto completo: Anyone with something to sell should by now have caught on to the new business model: claim to have been victimized by President Trump, and then ... profit!
Don’t think for one second that E. Jean Carroll is doing anything more than hocking her new book. The rollout for it this week followed the standard marketing procedure for the book publishing industry (in which I worked for a year): Take a newsworthy portion of the work and place it in a reputable news outlet. And in the Trump era, “newsworthy” is now defined as does it reinforce the media’s narrative that Trump is a racist pig?
There is not a shred of reliable evidence to suggest that Carroll is telling the truth about having been raped by Trump in the mid-1990s in the fitting room of a New York clothing store. New York magazine ran an excerpt from her book wherein she recounts the allegation, graphically describing Trump as having pulled down her tights and penetrated her with his penis. The violent and turbulent episode took place, she writes, after she laughed and teased Trump throughout the entire Bergdorf Goodman department store, even after the two were in the fitting room.
The spread in New York magazine came with glamour shots of Carroll looking undeterred in to the camera. The story and her book have been covered by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, USA Today, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News.
That certainly can’t be bad for presales. And (ha ha!) as described in my own forthcoming book “Privileged Victims: How America's Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People,” it’s the same marketing strategy deployed by Jussie Smollett and countless others.
Chicago police earlier this year accused the now-former Empire actor of staging a hate crime against himself by Trump supporters. Smollett, according to police, paid two gym rats to pretend to jump him on the street while shouting pro-Trump stuff. The purpose, police said, was for Smollett to raise his national profile and, in turn, get a boost in salary from the producers of his show.
It was an absurd ploy, but he knew that’s how things work now. Just make a bunch of noise about having been aggrieved by Trump on account of your skin color, gender, or sexuality, and watch the rewards pour in.
Smollett was, of course, found out, and although the corrupt state prosecutor’s office dropped the charges, a special counsel is now investigating what went wrong and may very well end up reinstating the charges. But his game follows the same formula we’ve seen time and time again.
Radio-based White House instigator April Ryan is nationally famous now after claiming to have been oppressed multiple times by Trump and his staff on account of her race. Since Trump has been president, the strategy has so far gotten her a book deal and a CNN contract.
Even before he was in office, professional victims in the media were cashing in on the Trump age. Now-former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields in 2016, ahead of the election, claimed that she was pulled to the ground at a press conference by Trump’s campaign manger at the time, Corey Lewandowski. She wasn’t pulled to the ground; that was a lie. But she was sure to tortuously detail the melodrama in an upcoming book she had published under her name.
The technique could withstand the scientific method and become a new natural law: If you assert victimhood while factoring in race, gender, and sexuality, then use Trump as the invariant, the outcome tends toward more money and fame.
E. Jean Carroll has a book to sell, and her story is like Smollett’s — which is to say, difficult to believe and probably motivated by money and fame. That might be disgusting, but we’ve seen how well it works.

5 ways to save money while traveling

Texto completo: I love to travel. I love trying out a new hotel, sleeping in a California king-sized bed and not having to worry about making my bed in the mornings.
The one thing that's always true about traveling is that it costs money. And I'm all about saving money. So, here are my best travel tips to help you keep more of your hard-earned dollars in your pocket:
1. Cheapest days to fly If you're flying, travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays
These are cheapest days to be in the air. If you can arrange your trip to accommodate, you'll save money!
2. Avoid baggage fees Don't forget that many airlines will charge you to check a bag. So, factor this in when you're shopping for low fares, or just pack more efficiently into a carry-on.
3. Be wary of travel points Don't open a credit card just for the travel points
Even if you think you're "working the system," and you'll pay if off before it's due, the facts say there's a real chance you won't. One in three Americans are behind on bills. Payments have a tendency to pile up, and they steal more than your paycheck. They steal your joy, too.
4. Look into Airbnb With Airbnb, you can rent someone's whole house, or even just one room in their house, and many times it's a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel. If you're a real go-getter, try reaching out to the owner directly and make them an offer. The worst they can do is say no!
5. First get debt-free Don't take a vacation if you have debt.
I know there's always one reason or another to spend money going somewhere. But if you're in debt, now isn't the time to take elaborate vacations. All your extra money should be going toward building up a starter emergency fund or paying off debt. Trust me, you'll enjoy that beach trip so much more when you have money in the bank, and you paid for it with cash.
For more tips on how to save money traveling, I've got two episodes of The Rachel Cruze Show that will help you: Travel Tips That Will Save You Money and How to Go to Disney World Without Debt.
As a No.1 New York Times best-selling author and host of The Rachel Cruze Show, Rachel helps people learn the proper ways to handle money and stay out of debt. You can follow Cruze on Twitter and Instagram at @RachelCruze and online at rachelcruze.com.

'Raise our taxes, please,' rich say; Eighteen wealthy Americans urge all presidential hopefuls to back a moderate levy on huge fortunes.

Texto completo: America's mega-rich have a message for the field of 2020 presidential hopefuls: Take our money, please.
A group of 18 wealthy Americans -- led by billionaire financier George Soros and including a Disney family member and the daughter of Warren Buffett's longtime partner -- sent an open letter to that effect Monday.
"We are writing to call on all candidates for President, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest 1/10 of the richest 1% of Americans -- on us," said the letter posted on the website Medium.com.

The document was released just days before the large field of Democratic presidential candidates will meet in Miami for the first debate.
It points to and could help draw attention to the proposal by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for a tax targeting the 75,000 wealthiest families in the country, those with assets worth more than $50 million.
"This revenue could substantially fund the cost of smart investments in our future, like clean energy innovation to mitigate climate change, universal child care, student loan debt relief, infrastructure modernization, tax credits for low-income families, public health solutions, and other vital needs," it states.
It also notes that such a tax could help mitigate the country's "growing concentration of wealth that undermines the stability and integrity of our republic."
Among the signatories, only Soros is a bona-fide member of the billionaires club as calculated by Forbes -- his net worth is estimated at $8 billion.
But several are members of such families, including Liesel Pritzker Simmons and other members of the Pritzker family, which draws its wealth from the Hyatt hotel chain and other enterprises.
Also signing was Facebook Inc. co-founder Chris Hughes; Molly Munger, an L.A. civil rights attorney who is the daughter of Charles Munger, the billionaire vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.; and Abigail Disney, the granddaughter of Walt Disney Co. co-founder Roy O. Disney.
Abigail Disney, a documentary filmmaker, has been outspoken about issues of wealth inequality, including earlier this year when she penned an op-ed and criticized Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger in a series of tweets over his $65.6-million 2018 pay package, which she labeled "insane."
Indeed, Monday's letter was far from the first time that the ultra-wealthy have called for higher taxes on themselves.
Buffett has long said that wealthy Americans pay too little in taxes, but the issue has gained more prevalence as inequality has grown amid the economic recovery. It also has been boosted by the passage of the Republican tax bill in 2017, which funneled the lion's share of cuts to the wealthy and corporations.
In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon said he had "no problem" paying higher taxes to solve some of the "fundamental challenges and inequities in our society," as long as the money was spent wisely.
And Ray Dalio, who manages what is reported to be the world's largest hedge fund, warned in April in a highly publicized LinkedIn post that unless capitalism is reformed there could be social unrest.
The billionaire brought that message to last month's Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, where at least one other speaker warned of "class warfare."
Among the Democratic presidential candidates, Warren is not the only one proposing to raise taxes on the wealthy. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont released his own plan shortly afterward. The letter noted that there is support among all Americans -- including the wealthy -- for such measures.
A poll taken on tax day found that most Americans don't feel that the GOP tax law benefited them, while other polls, including one released in January by Fox News, have shown a preference to tax the rich and funnel the revenue into domestic spending.
Veteran Democratic political strategist Mark Mellman said that although he doubts the letter will "fundamentally change the political dialogue," it is one more piece of evidence the candidates can use to argue that the current tax structure is unfair.
"The ultra-wealthy know they are not paying their fair share. It should be difficult for Republicans or anyone else to say they are paying their fair share," said Mellman, who expects more of the wealthy to join the debate as the presidential campaign heats up.
Simmons told the New York Times, which first reported on the letter Sunday, that the initiative got started after she and her husband, Ian Simmons, who are co-founders of the Blue Haven Initiative impact investment organization, decided it would be a "good idea" to publish the document.
They then reached out to the others who joined, including Soros, who is a longtime supporter of liberal causes, and his son Alexander.
In addition to the 18 name co-signers, there was one "Anonymous."
The Los Angeles Times reached out to Soros, Munger and Abigail Disney for comment, but they did not immediately respond.

Texto completo: For those who are blind or have compromised vision, hearing is fine but touching is even better. Words merely explain. But touch can get at the soul of a thing. And what can touch reveal about a Broadway play?
On Saturday some blind theatergoers attending "Ink," at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, got to find out in what was described as Broadway's first touch tour.
James Graham's 1960s-era play is about Rupert Murdoch's entry into the world of London tabloid newspapers. Rupert Goold's high-octane production -- which includes drinking and smoking, a conga line and a rumbling printing press -- plays out on Bunny Christie's Tony Award-nominated set, "a landscape of battered metal desks, stacked into rickety hills and valleys," as Ben Brantley described it in his New York Times review.
Thanks to the nonprofit Theater Development Fund, audience members got to explore that landscape in advance, enhancing the audio-described performance itself.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee reached a deal with a key source of information for Robert S. Mueller III's obstruction of justice investigation that will allow her to delay public testimony that had been scheduled for Monday but require her to answer written questions as the committee waits.
Democrats who control the committee said they were willing to take those steps because the witness, Annie Donaldson, is in her third trimester of pregnancy and lives in Alabama. They said she would still be required to testify in person in the coming months before the committee, which is investigating whether President Trump obstructed justice when he tried to thwart the special counsel's examination of his campaign's ties to Russia.
But like most everything between Congress and the Trump administration these days, what comes next is unlikely to be that simple.
The White House is expected to intervene to try to block Ms. Donaldson, a former White House lawyer, from answering any questions, in writing or in person, about her government service. The White House will most likely cite a Justice Department opinion that close aides to the president have "absolute immunity" from congressional subpoenas.
The House, in turn, is preparing to file a lawsuit as early as next week to try to get the federal courts to strike down the administration's immunity theory, which has been advanced by presidents of both parties but has never been fully tested in court. Even though the suit will probably take aim at Ms. Donaldson's former boss, the onetime White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II, a ruling in the Democrats' favor could effectively force Ms. Donaldson and other witnesses who have defied the Judiciary Committee to take the witness stand.
That court fight could take months, but without full access to relevant witnesses, Democratic efforts to investigate and air possible obstruction and other misdeeds documented by Mr. Mueller have all but ground to a halt.
Democrats are struggling to gain traction on other investigations as well. On Monday, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, wrote a follow-up letter to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, demanding answers about what happened to records of Mr. Trump's meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia after reports that Mr. Trump tried to conceal them.
Ms. Donaldson, as chief of staff to Mr. McGahn, witnessed or was privy to some of the most explosive moments detailed by Mr. Mueller's investigators, including the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director and attempts by Mr. Trump to gain control of the investigation. Ms. Donaldson kept detailed notes of those episodes and others, which are referenced frequently in Mr. Mueller's 448-page report.
"Ms. Donaldson had a front-row seat to many of the instances outlined in the Mueller report dealing with President Trump's alleged obstruction of justice and other abuses of power," Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, said in a statement on Monday, "which is why she is a key witness for the committee in our ongoing work to hold the president, his associates and members of his administration accountable."
Mr. Nadler said the committee was willing to reach a compromise on testimony because Ms. Donaldson's pregnancy "makes it difficult for her to travel and testify for long periods of time."
A lawyer for Ms. Donaldson, Sandra Moser, said she was pleased with the accommodation.
Under the terms of her accord with the Judiciary Committee, Ms. Donaldson agreed to appear in person to testify sometime after Nov. 1 and will provide written answers to lawmakers' questions in the meantime. The committee will most likely deliver those questions this week, a committee aide said. The White House, which declined to comment on Monday, could intervene thereafter.
The committee also said that as part of the agreement Ms. Donaldson would be required to tell lawmakers if the White House had previously shared internal documents with her and her lawyers -- a move that could undercut White House claims that the material could still be protected by executive privilege. Confirming that fact would most likely benefit the Democrats' case in court.
But a growing number of House Democratic lawmakers believe that going to court is not enough. On Monday, Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, became the 76th Democrat to support an impeachment inquiry, according to a tally by The New York Times. Mr. Himes, a moderate who had been urging a go-slow approach to an escalating conflict with Mr. Trump, said the moment had come for "clarity and conviction."
"The politics of impeachment are messy and uncertain, and might, in the short run, serve the president's narrow political interests," Mr. Himes said in a statement. But, he added, "unless we restore respect for the law, respect for truth and respect for common decency, we cannot hope to solve any of our other pressing problems."

Texto completo: A letter signed by nearly 20 of the "richest 1/10 of the richest 1% of Americans" calls for 2020 presidential candidates to create a wealth tax on them and their ultrarich peers.
The 18 names on the letter published Monday include investor George Soros, filmmaker Abigail Disney, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, philanthropist Agnes Gund and real estate developer Robert Bowditch, among other members of the ultrawealthy. A 19th simply signed as "Anonymous. " Many of them have been outspoken before on the issue of wealth taxes.
"America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more," they write in the letter, which was first reported by The New York Times. "A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms. "
The letter describes itself as "nonpartisan" and not "an endorsement of any presidential candidate," though it lists Democratic candidates Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg as candidates who have already supported a wealth tax.
It's about time: Make America’s top tax rates great again
Everyone gets hurt: Tax the wealthiest of the 0. 1 percent? Not so fast.
In particular, they cite Warren's proposed policy – which would tax 75,000 of the wealthiest families in the country at a 2% rate – as a model for a policy that they endorse.
"That a moderate tax on a minuscule number of Americans could raise so much revenue simply reflects historic levels of wealth among America’s richest," they add.
The letter arrives the same day as a student loan debt proposal announced by Bernie Sanders, which would eradicate $1. 6 trillion in debt from 45 million Americans.
Sanders said his plan would be funded by a "Robin Hood Tax" that would impose a 0. 5% tax on stock trades, a 0. 1% fee on bonds and a 0. 005% fee on derivatives.

Texto completo: "To $ 118 million, not beyond!"
That's not quite what Disney had wanted to hear after this weekend's release of "Toy Story 4." The studio had expected its latest animated blockbuster to debut with around $ 22 million more than that in domestic ticket sales -- but $ 118 million is what it got.
Even the expected sales of at least $ 140 million wouldn't have reached the $ 182.7 million that the previous Disney-Pixar movie, "Incredibles 2," opened with last year. But the gulf between the two movies' totals suggests that perhaps "Toy Story," Pixar's longest-running series, has limited power to convince families that they need to rush out for a fourth installment, which for many is a tougher sell than an initial sequel.
That being said, the franchise's name recognition still counts for something. "Toy Story 4" made well over double the $ 50.8 million that "Coco" earned during its first weekend in domestic theaters in 2017. And it had the third-best opening North American theaters have seen so far this year, behind two other Disney releases: "Captain Marvel" ( $ 153.4 million) and "Avengers: Endgame" ( $ 357.1 million).
The studio said "Toy Story 4" brought in an additional $ 120 million internationally this weekend.
The new "Toy Story" received the critical love that's expected of a Pixar film; it currently holds a 98 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In her review for The New York Times, though, Manohla Dargis showed limited enthusiasm. She wrote that much of "Toy Story 4" is "great-ish," noting that "the movie is exactly what you expect -- not more, not less -- from an estimably well-oiled machine like Pixar." It brings back Woody (the lanky toy cowboy voiced Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen's spaceman) and Bo Peep (Annie Potts), and also introduces Forky, an insecure toy made out of a spork and voiced by Tony Hale, of "Veep" and "Arrested Development."

There was only one other brand-new release in the top 10 this weekend, the horror movie "Child's Play," from Orion Pictures, which opened at No. 2 with $ 14 million in domestic ticket sales. The movie is a reimagining of the 1988 slasher film of the same name, which gave birth to the killer doll known as Chucky.
"Child's Play" is a bit like "Toy Story," but with less Randy Newman and more stabbing. It revolves around Andy (Gabriel Bateman), a boy who receives a robot version of Chucky, voiced in the new movie by Mark Hamill.
Third place went to Disney's "Aladdin," which made $ 12.2 million in its fifth weekend in American theaters, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data. "Men in Black: International" dropped to fourth in its second weekend, bringing in $ 10.8 million and continuing to be a disappointment for Sony. The animated "Secret Life of Pets 2," from Universal and Illumination, rounded out the top five with $ 10.3 million.

Texto completo: It's not every day you find a novel in which the grandparents can't keep their hands off each other.
Claire Lombardo's book debut, "The Most Fun We Ever Had," out on Tuesday from Doubleday, is narrated by seven members of the Sorenson family. It is anchored by the four-decade marriage between David and Marilyn, "two people who emanated more love than it seemed like the universe would sanction."
The story shifts backward and forward in time, following along as the couple raises four daughters, Wendy, Violet, Liza and Grace, in the Chicago suburbs. The return of Jonah, whom Violet put up for adoption after an unplanned pregnancy, unsettles the family, casting new light on decades of secrets and betrayals.
Lombardo, 30, spent about six years working for the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, then spent a year in a social-work master's program before dropping out to focus on writing. She graduated from the Iowa Writers' Workshop in 2017 and still lives in Iowa City, where she teaches creative writing at the University of Iowa. We spoke by phone, and our conversation has been edited and condensed.
Tell me about the genesis of the book.
It began as a short story, something to keep me occupied when I was in social-work school. It originally started with Violet at the center -- I wanted to explore a character with a perfect life that was upended by the arrival of someone she thought she'd never see again. But as I kept going, I was more interested by the satellite characters, especially her parents.
Did you draw on your own family life for inspiration?
I'm the youngest of five, and there's a big gap in age between me and my siblings. They practically had a different set of parents than I did. I had the role of the little Switzerland. I've always been an observer, since I was a kid, and I do walk through the world in that way.
[ Looking for more summer books ? Check out all our summer reading coverage . ]
I'm always curious about people who come to writing after another career. How did you make that shift?
I took a break from my undergraduate degree and worked for the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, first as an intern, then as a paralegal and the group's intake person. I spent about six years there, working primarily with homeless parents and kids in the public-school system. That work made me more open-minded and a lot more aware of how nuanced and weird the world is.
You have to approach people from a place of zero judgment and complete empathy. It taught me how to interact with any number of people: Here I was, this young kid in her 20s from the Chicago suburbs, and all of a sudden I'm thrown into trying to help a mother of three with three jobs who didn't know where her kids would sleep that night.
The transformative part about working with families at the coalition was that I had to separate my observation and writing brains, though I wasn't really thinking of myself as a writer at that time.
It was a truly immersive experience. I loved it. It gave me a sense of purpose. It's the same sense of purpose I feel as a writer.
How did social-work school figure into your development as a writer?
As I was finishing my undergraduate degree at University of Illinois at Chicago, I was pretty set on applying for my masters in social work. I did have a creative writing professor pull me aside and tell me not to go, encouraging me to pursue writing instead. At the time I thought the idea of becoming a writer sounded ludicrous -- actually, it still sounds ludicrous!
Once I got to social-work school, though, I was miserable. I lost my father very unexpectedly a few months in, and that really shifted my perspective and priorities. I became much more preoccupied with answering, "What am I doing and why?"
I have no memory of that year, to some degree. I got all As, I did my coursework, but working on the story in the evenings was therapeutic for me. Things were pretty dark, and it was an outlet for me, to immerse myself in a family that wasn't my own.
How did your time at the Iowa Writers' Workshop help?
I was lucky to find a community of supportive peers whose opinions I trusted. I arrived at Iowa with a very messy, 813-page draft, and my mentor, Ethan Canin, really helped with the structure of the book.
Having outside readers can show you how empathetically you're rendering your characters. You have to have love for your characters and give them their due. And it was important for me to have readers who were parents, since I don't have kids. I had to remind myself I'm allowed to write about things I don't know, like a 40-year marriage. I just had to do my emotional homework.
Maybe most important was the fact that someone was paying me to write for the first time in my life. I had never just written or even been a full-time student. It was remarkable to have that freedom and to be told, "We trust you, go write a book."
Now, as a creative writing teacher, what do you teach your students?
I work with both high-school students and undergraduates, and I love teaching, which I'm sort of surprised by! A lot of young people feel like they don't have stories to tell, or they're not allowed to tell stories beyond their own experience, and I try to dispel that as much as I can. As long as you know why you're doing it and are writing with as much empathy as you can give, then I try to get them to write outside their comfort zone and explore points of view that are far from their own. Many of my students are studying engineering or business, and that exercise can be very freeing.
A lot of the work I do now is similar to what I was doing when I was at the Coalition for the Homeless: I helped them work through their own narratives and reframe their stories with power and purpose. I thought deeply about the ethics of storytelling -- what's mine to tell and what's not. Perhaps I approached writing my own book with that sensibility.

Trump, Treason, the Times and a Free Press

Texto completo: Regarding New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger's plea for the president to de-escalate his dangerous rhetoric against journalists ("With Talk of 'Treason,' Trump Crosses a Line," op-ed, June 20): President Trump's use of the word "treason" to characterize the Times, and his attempts to misuse government authority to retaliate against journalists must end, full stop. However, organizations such as the Times are also guilty of misusing rhetoric to stoke fear and mistrust. Mr. Sulzberger says that because of Mr. Trump's rhetoric, 25% of the public believes the "'news media is the enemy of the American people'" -- an astounding and horrifying number. But how many Americans now doubt the virtues of democracy because they're being told it has already failed? Mr. Trump isn't the only one who needs to take a sabbatical from the ceaseless chatter of Twitter and the 24-hour news cycle.

A.G. Sulzberger is justly exercised over President Trump's inapt application of the word "treason" to his newspaper. In these hyperpartisan times the word is thrown about all too casually. One might have more sympathy for Mr. Sulzberger had his newspaper objected editorially with equal vehemence when the same charge was leveled against the president by the likes of former CIA Director John Brennan and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff during the "Russian collusion" investigation.

Perhaps Mr. Sulzberger, in his esteemed position, could help to mollify the contentious atmosphere in the country and model more civil discourse. The contrast between how the Times treats Democratic Party leaders and Republicans, especially conservatives, is self-evident. After Hillary Clinton's loss in 2016, which came as a shock to the New York Times, Mr. Sulzberger promised some soul searching to address the Times's apparent disconnect with the "deplorables'" anger at liberal condescension. I read the Times often and see little evidence that its editors have arrived at any new revelations.

Shut down the press? The president wasn't even able to revoke White House credentials from an obnoxious and disruptive reporter. In my view, the majority of the Times's news stories rightly belong on the opinion pages.

Will wonders ever cease? I certainly am not going to defend President Trump, but there was one sentence in Mr. Sulzberger's article that jumped out at me: "(T)he president's rhetorical attacks . . . foster a climate in which trust in journalists is eroding." Mr. Sulzberger, my trust in journalists eroded long before Mr. Trump. Since the New York Times refused to accept the election results of 2016 and became the propaganda organ for the resistance, my trust has eroded even more. May I respectfully suggest that whenever one has a problem, the first place to look is in the mirror.

While the New York Times may feel the president's rhetoric has crossed the line, could Mr. Sulzberger please tell me what journalists the president has imprisoned, what publications he has shut down, what broadcast licenses he has revoked or, for that matter, any actions he has taken to restrict a free and fair press?

Texto completo: This week, the Democratic presidential candidates will descend on Miami for the party's first debates.
Well, not all of them.
While 20 candidates will be on the stage either Wednesday or Thursday night, four contenders will not be behind a podium in the Adrienne Arsht Center because they did not meet the party's criteria to participate. And for those White House hopefuls, the question is: What do they do instead?
Montana Governor Steve Bullock , who swung through Boston last week, told the Globe he'll be thousands of miles away.
While his competition will be debating on NBC and MSNBC, Bullock will hold a town hall meeting with a local television station in Iowa one night and in New Hampshire on the other.
“Look, I am disappointed that I am not on there, but I will actually be talking to voters in the early states," he said over a cup of black coffee at the Omni Parker House on Friday morning.
Bullock entered the race in April — a relatively late start that could have affected his chances of meeting the criteria to participate in the debates.
Candidates needed to garner at least 1 percent support in three different polls or count 65,000 individual contributors across 20 or more states.
Representative Seth Moulton , of Salem, also didn't qualify for the debate stage, but he is taking a different approach from Bullock. According to an aide, he will attend a Washington Post event Wednesday in Washington and then head to Miami for more media interviews.
Former US Senator Mike Gravel , of Alaska, is recovering from surgery and declined an invitation to be in the debate audience, according to a campaign spokeswoman.
Instead, she said, Gravel will provide running commentary of the debate, most likely on Twitter.
Rounding out those not in the debates is Wayne Messam , the mayor of Miramar, Fla. The Messam campaign did not respond to an inquiry about his whereabouts during the debate (Miramar is just over 20 miles from Miami).
Bullock, in the interview, directed a lot of criticism toward the DNC for its debate criteria, especially the required number of financial contributors for participation. He argued meeting actual voters and campaigning should be more important, and he noted he's the only person in the field who was elected in a state that Trump won in 2016.
“The way the DNC rules are is to go out and get these one dollar donors, and people are spending more than one dollar to try to get the one dollar donors, so it may actually create a false set of incentives that you are investing more money into getting donors than you are actually talking to people," he said.
“We should be, instead of putting the premium into whether you can have a one dollar donors, (focusing on) how many voters have you or your field staff actually reached out to."
Bullock is certainly banking that early state activists will watch him on their local channels and not watch the debates on national television.
Then again, at this point, what other choice does he have?

Steyer keeps pressure on Neal to get Trump's returns
Tom Steyer isn't done pressuring US Representative Richard Neal to demand Donald Trump 's tax returns. The billionaire activist's group, Need to Impeach, put up two billboards earlier this month in the Springfield Democrat's district that read, “Rep. Neal, Get Trump's Taxes Now."
Wait — didn't Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, already ask for those tax returns? Indeed, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly declined to hand them over.
But this time, Steyer is hounding Neal for indicating he wouldn't use a bill passed by the New York Legislature to obtain them, according to a Need to Impeach spokesperson.
The bill — awaiting Governor Andrew Cuomo 's signature — would allow Congress to obtain Trump's tax returns upon request.
Daniel Rubin, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee, did not respond to a request for comment this week.
But he told The New York Times in May that the committee is focusing on Trump's federal returns. “Our request to the Internal Revenue Service was in furtherance of an investigation into the mandatory presidential audit program at the IRS," he said.
The billboards will run until Thursday and are part of a campaign targeting 11 districts — including Neal's — to urge representatives to support impeachment.
Steyer has spent more than $250,000 in Neal's district on television ads and billboards, and hosted an impeachment town hall in Springfield in March.

GATHERING OF JOURNALISM'S WATCHDOGS: Honing our investigative skills

Texto completo: Just over a week ago, I was hanging out in Houston with nearly 2,000 friends and family.
It wasn't a family reunion, but kin of a different kind -- attendees at a conference put on by Investigative Reporters and Editors, a legendary national and international journalism training organization that has been an essential part of my journalism life for nearly three decades.
The organization's annual conference pulls together journalists from all mediums, including print newspapers, television, radio and onlineonly operations, to hone our craft. Scores of panels and training sessions over four days cover a wide range of topics.
There's an odd thing about Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE). It's organized around the principle that journalists will share skills and tools, critique each others' work and tell others in their field how they get their stories. In some cases, reporters from head-to-head competitors like The New York Times and The Washington Post are on the same panel, sharing tips with the audience and each other. They put aside their competitive instincts for a few days each year in an effort to improve and advance the craft of investigative reporting.
Investigative journalism requires special skills and IRE is the best place to learn them. This year, besides the Houston conference, the organization offered 68 other training events, including 4 internationally, that reached more than 5,500 journalists, educators and students. The sessions often include essentials like interviewing story subjects, finding and cultivating story sources and learning to use public records. And then every year there are new techniques and tools in more arcane panels like the one this year on the Python programming language that data journalists use. Panels and training also cover areas of public policy that often result in investigative news stories, like campaign finance, business regulation and tax policy.
Many of the old-timers at the annual conference go back decades with the organization, which was founded in 1975. I owe much of the success of my career to tips I picked up at conferences over the decades.
You might think in a time of concern about the business of journalism, attendance at a conference like IRE would be declining. In fact, the opposite is true; attendance at Houston was a record high for the organization. Newsrooms have figured out that investigative journalism is a way to distinguish their work in a crowded media market when audiences are demanding more accountability coverage for government and public institutions. Especially among TV organizations, membership in IRE has been growing for years and stands at more than 6,000.
And it's not just the Washington-based journalists you hear from on Twitter and see on the Sunday morning news shows -- there are members from almost every state and Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
The influence of all this training can be felt in investigative reporting that creates change and improves lives across our nation and the world. Consider just a few of the outstanding investigative reports that were presented awards at this year's IRE conference:
|A collaborative investigation of New Jersey news organizations, NJ Advance Media, revealed New Jersey's broken system for tracking police use of force. Police have the legal right to use force on others, and it should be monitored and tracked. For nearly two decades, state and local officials in New Jersey failed to oversee this power, which allowed violence against citizens and cost millions of taxpayer dollars in settlements. The 16-month investigation produced a comprehensive statewide database of police use of force that allows people to search every incident by local officers and state troopers from 2012 through 2016. As a result, the state attorney general acknowledged the work and the state plans to use it as a model to build its own tracking system.
|A project by The Dallas Morning News examined Texas health care companies' denial of life-sustaining drugs and treatments to thousands of sick kids and elderly and disabled patients. The Pain & Profit series exposed how years of poor state regulation let corporations drive up their profits by denying or skimping on treatment for many of the 700,000 children and disabled adults who relied on the state for medical care. Texas officials hid these problems from the public; they would not have been known without the newspaper report. The results have been significant, from immediate treatment for individual patients profiled in the series to systematic reforms and improved oversight.
|A shocking story, developed by the Anchorage Daily News grew out of the rape and death of a teenage girl in a remote Alaska village. A village police officer was arrested and it turned out he was on probation for an earlier crime. The reporter on the case suspected this was not a unique situation. He found that local governments across Alaska regularly hire officers and other public safety workers with criminal records, sometimes with domestic violence or felony convictions.
Your AJC did not win an IRE award this year, but has won previously for reporting on Doctors & Sex Abuse, and, with news partner Channel 2 Action News, police shootings in Georgia. This year, we had six AJC journalists at the conference, beefing up their skills to bring you more and better investigative reporting.
I always find the conference inspiring. We hear so much about the demise of journalism, and it's true that we face a disruption in traditional business models that challenges the funding of many organizations. But readership is up and audiences are hungry for great work requiring the skills of trained, professional journalists. The work showcased at IRE is among the best journalism in the business.
I'm personally very proud of the success of IRE. I attended my first conference in Portland, Oregon, in 1992 when I was an editor for USA Today. I quickly got involved in helping IRE and served on the board of directors and as an officer from 1994 to 2006. During the time I was on the board, we expanded dramatically and brought a level of professionalism into the organization that has a big impact today.
In my early days with IRE, it was quite different. We didn't have much in the way of staff and so board members were often tapped to help set up for conferences. More than once I got the job of taping down the electrical cords in training rooms where computers were set up. My special qualification for that role? I'm short, and I could get under the desks without bumping my head.
This year, IRE had lots of professional help to set up the huge conference, which was terrifically managed by IRE Executive Director Doug Haddix and his incredible staff of 14, plus student helpers from the University of Missouri, where IRE is based.
The organization has come a long way over the years. It has had tremendous influence on investigative reporting and journalism at large, improving and spreading this essential kind of journalism that a democracy needs to succeed.

Texto completo: I am not the guy you'd expect to know a 1970s heroin kingpin, but I knew Nicky Barnes pretty well. While the notorious Harlem drug trafficker died in 2012, the public only learned of his death this week via a report in the New York Times.
When I met Nicky in 2004, he was in the U.S. Federal Witness Protection Program and going by the name Clayton "Clay" Williams. I wanted to publish his memoir, but getting to him took more than a year of pestering the U.S. Marshals Service. Finally, with marshals monitoring the call, I was allowed to speak to him on the phone. Not long after that I went out to meet him in Minneapolis.
A chiseled, compact man -- a bantam rooster with a strut to match -- Nicky was then 70. He still did push-ups and pull-ups to stay in shape, a habit he acquired at the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill. He ate healthy food, drank only beer, had a car, and liked to go ice fishing. His girlfriend had no idea about his past life.
Nicky was 44 when he was sent away, 48 when he decided to cooperate, and 66 when he finally walked out of prison a not-exactly-free man. He worked at Walmart, and it frustrated him. When it came to sales, distribution and product display, he felt he could do a much better job. He might have been right. But he was a damn good storyteller and had a lot of tales to tell. We started work on what would become his book, "Mr. Untouchable: The Rise, Fall and Resurrection of Heroin's Teflon Don."
The first problem was the contract. It couldn't be with Nicky Barnes, because he no longer existed. It could be with Clayton Williams, but then it'd be too dangerous to keep the executed contract in our office. Lots of bad guys still wanted Nicky dead, and he no longer had federal protection. Contrary to what the Times has reported, by 2005 Nicky had left the Witness Protection Program. The U.S. Marshals cut him loose when he decided to publish a book.
If anything surprised me about Nicky, it was the anger, decades later, that still ran hot regarding the betrayal by his protege, Guy Fisher. Nicky dedicated "Mr. Untouchable" to Mr. Fisher: "You disrespected me. You betrayed me. See where that got you? I want you to read every word of my story. And when you finish the last page, I want you to look up, see where I put you and ask yourself, was it worth it?" Mr. Fisher is still serving out a life sentence on racketeering, drug and murder convictions based in part on Nicky's testimony.
Nicky was a character out of Shakespeare. The man only wanted a family but ended up triggering a titanic and depraved tragedy. Nicky's childhood on the streets led him to crave the intimacy and trust of a family unit. So he tried to build one in the form of seven drug-dealing "brothers" known as "the Council," which by the mid-1970s ruled much of the East Coast heroin trade. When Nicky learned these "family" bonds were no more than a naive delusion, he retaliated against them all, putting dozens into prison, many for life.
The book came out in 2007, and I last spoke to him in 2011. He wanted to know when someone would make a Hollywood movie about him. It bothered him that he'd been portrayed as a minor character in "American Gangster," the 2007 biopic starring Denzel Washington as Nicky's competitor Frank Lucas. Nicky must have died not long after our phone call. He said nothing of his cancer.
I tried calling Nicky/Clay over the years, but his phone number was disconnected. I figured he might have finally made it to Arizona. He hated Minneapolis: "Much too cold most of the year and almost everyone is white." I figured if I really had to get in touch, I would go through the marshals again. It would be a chore, but I knew the drill.
Back in the day, Nicky wasn't a "good" guy, either personally or professionally. He required that all of his girlfriends learn to "stand and hold." This meant they had to learn to walk with his loaded pistol under their skirts so that the weapon wouldn't be found by the cops.
A former heroin addict himself, Nicky knew the horrors of addiction but rationalized away any remorse for destroying tens of thousands of lives. Indeed, he relied on his addict's knowledge to make his product the best on the street. No matter how generous he was with people in Harlem -- holiday turkeys and hospital bills -- the money he spread around was taken from other members of the community who'd poisoned and killed themselves with his product.
So why did his death attract so much attention? Supposedly, no minority makes it in America until they first make it in crime. In the 1970s, as blacks emerged as leaders in politics, society, and culture, Nicky Barnes did the same, only for African-American organized crime. Members of the Italian mafia -- whose methods Nicky studied while in Greenhaven Prison alongside "Crazy Joe" Gallo -- became both rivals and partners. Only now, under Nicky, the nation's first black godfather dictated to them.
With an unfinished grammar-school education, Nicky had few opportunities for legitimate business success. Instead, he played the hand he was dealt. If Nicky had grown up in a different place and at a different time, he'd likely have gone in an different direction as an entrepreneur. My guess is he'd have done OK.

Texto completo: SOTHEBY'S
BID +59%
Going once, going twice . . . sold, to art collector and media entrepreneur Patrick Drahi. Sotheby's agreed on Monday to be taken private by Mr. Drahi in a $2.66 billion deal, ending the global auction house's 31-year run as a public company. Mr. Drahi is buying Sotheby's shares outstanding for $57 apiece, a 61% premium to Sotheby's closing price the Friday before. "For my entire life, I have been passionate about this industry," Mr. Drahi said, "and I believe the opportunities and growth potential are significant for Sotheby's." Shares surged 59% Monday to close at $56.13.
MONEYGRAM INT'L INC.
MGI +168%
MoneyGram said late Monday that cryptocurrency startup Ripple has agreed to invest up to $50 million in the money-transfer company, in one of the first crypto-based company investments in a major U.S. publicly listed firm. The deal would give Ripple about a 10% stake in MoneyGram. MoneyGram said it would use Ripple's XRP technology to handle cross-border transfers of digital funds for at least two years. The two companies began working together in 2018 when MoneyGram agreed to run a pilot program testing XRP. MoneyGram shares soared 168% Tuesday.
TYSON FOODS INC.
TSN -4.1%
Tyson Foods and other meat producers fell Monday as flooding in the Midwest threatened crops used for livestock feed. Millions of U.S. farm acres are set to go unplanted, and the prospect of a planting shortage has driven up corn and soybean futures. The higher feed costs could weigh on meat producers' bottom lines. Tyson Foods fell 4.1% Monday, Sanderson Farms Inc. declined 7.4% and Pilgrim's Pride Corp. lost 3.8%.
BOEING CO.
BA +5.4%
Boeing shares gained 5.4% Tuesday after British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA said it had signed a letter of intent to buy as many as 200 Boeing 737 MAX planes, giving the jet maker its first such deal since the model was grounded months ago after two fatal crashes. The company has also gotten a vote of confidence for its other planes this week, as Qatar Airways said Wednesday it had signed an order to purchase five 777 freighters worth $1.8 billion and China Airlines said it planned to order as many as six of the freighters.
CARNIVAL CORP.
CCL -7.7%
Carnival, the world's biggest cruise operator, cut its full-year earnings outlook Thursday, citing a hit from voyage cancellations, weakening demand in Europe and the abrupt Cuba travel ban imposed by the U.S. Carnival shares fell 7.7% Thursday and extended their losses Friday, losing more than 12% for the week. The report weighed on other cruise-line operators as well. Earlier this month, new restrictions from the Trump administration barred American cruise ships from going to Cuba, forcing cruise lines to reroute already planned trips.
SLACK TECHNOLOGIES INC.
WORK +49%
Slack shares soared 49% in their first day of trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, the latest initial offering to pop in recent weeks. The workplace-messaging company, trading under the symbol "WORK," ended its first day at $38.62, beating its so-called reference price of $26 published by NYSE Wednesday. The company ended its first day with a valuation of about $23.2 billion. Slack went public via an unusual method called a direct listing, joining Spotify Technology SA among the biggest companies to take such an approach.
WALMART INC.
WMT +0.7%
Walmart agreed Thursday to pay $282 million to resolve investigations into whether it paid bribes around the world, acknowledging that it had lax policies in place to catch potential corruption. The deal requires Walmart to return $144 million in gains to regulators and pay a $138 million penalty to the Justice Department. The investigation began after the New York Times in 2012 described payments Walmart made in Mexico to obtain permits to build stores there, and later explored the company's business in other countries. Walmart shares gained 0.7% Friday.

Texto completo: Next weekend marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, when thousands of people poured into the streets of Greenwich Village in New York City to protest a police raid on a gay bar. State harassment of gay people had been commonplace for decades, but that night, the patrons at the Stonewall Inn had had enough—and finally decided to fight back.
Stonewall has long been credited as the event that sparked the modern gay rights movement. But while the riots that ensued over three days and nights in late June 1969 were undoubtedly transformative, they weren't the first time that gay people had resisted persecution. Stonewall was preceded by well over a decade of gay civil rights activism, much of it led by a man named Frank Kameny. The rhetoric and strategies that he employed were less confrontational than those adopted by the people at Stonewall, but they set the intellectual template for the gay movement's eventual success.
Share Your Thoughts
How has the gay rights movement affected your life? Join the conversation below.
Four years before Stonewall, on April 17, 1965, a group of 10 people formed a picket line outside the White House. It was the first of several protests meant to draw attention to the federal government's discrimination against gay people, thousands of whom had lost their jobs on the grounds that they represented security risks. Responding to a New York Times report the previous day that Cuba was herding gay people into forced labor camps, the picketers drew an explicit link between anti-gay oppression in the communist country and in the U.S. "Cuba's Government Persecutes Homosexuals. U.S. Government Beat Them To It," read one placard.
The pickets were organized by the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C., one of the earliest gay rights organizations in the U.S., whose name playfully invoked the masked jesters in a Renaissance court. To align themselves with the prevailing anticommunism of the day was shrewd, since the association of homosexuality with subversion had been a leading justification for purging gay people from sensitive government positions.
The "Lavender Scare" of the 1950s and '60s attracted less notice than the concurrent Red one, in large part due to the fact that none of its targets had been willing to fight back. There was no gay equivalent of the Hollywood Ten, no high-stakes gay version of the Army-McCarthy congressional hearings to enrapture the nation. People who were fired due to their sexual orientation were nameless and faceless, appearing only as statistics in occasional newspaper items detailing the latest cull of "sexual deviants" from government ranks.
That is, until Frank Kameny came along. He was an eloquent World War II veteran, a Harvard Ph.D. astronomer and a former employee of the Army Map Service who had been fired in 1957 because of his sexual orientation. Now, when Americans were told about the supposed homosexual menace, they would have to reconcile those hair-raising accounts with the reality of this impressive patriot.
As co-founder of Mattachine's Washington, D.C. chapter, Kameny was unafraid to put himself forward as an advocate for a nascent gay community. "Most of our members hide behind phoney names and stay so deep in the closet they are a pitiful joke to those who know them," one of Kameny's Mattachine colleagues once wrote. Simply by acknowledging himself publicly as gay, "A man like Frank is the most valuable single item the homophile movement possesses."
Kameny could claim many firsts. He was the first federal employee to challenge his dismissal on the grounds of sexual orientation, the first openly gay person to testify in front of (and run for) Congress and the first individual to petition the Supreme Court on the grounds of anti-gay discrimination.
Kameny was unabashedly patriotic, and he rooted the case for gay equality in the country's founding documents, constantly citing them in lectures, interviews and a steady stream of letters to bureaucrats, congressmen and presidents. In a 1961 statement of purpose, Mattachine committed itself "to secure for homosexuals the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as proclaimed for all men by the Declaration of Independence...and the basic rights and liberties established by the word and spirit of the Constitution of the United States."
Knowing what would erupt just four years later in New York, it is quaint to read Kameny describing his solemn pickets in the nation's capital as a "militant" escalation from Mattachine's earlier letter-writing and public education campaigns. Protests outside government buildings, he wrote, were "an avenue of last resort, to be adopted only when it is clear that all doors are closed to us and are likely to remain so."
After police unleashed horrific violence against peaceful African-American civil rights demonstrators in Selma, Ala., Kameny wrote with foreboding about what might erupt should government oppression of the country's gay minority persist. "The prediction can be ventured that continued official intransigence" toward the reasonable concerns of gay people "will result ultimately in popular demonstrations by the homosexual community at large, which will be far less responsible, controlled and orderly," he wrote for Eastern Mattachine magazine in 1965. "This way lies the Washington equivalent of Birmingham!"
Kameny was prescient, although the violence he dreaded would explode not in the nation's capital but in New York. In the years after Stonewall, "militant" would take on fresh meaning, as a rising generation of gay activists abjured the reformist techniques pioneered by Kameny in favor of confrontation with authority.
Still, whether consciously or not, the participants in the Stonewall uprising drew from the example set by Kameny. There is a clear line connecting the unprecedented refusal of a young Army astronomer to accept being fired by the government because of his sexual orientation to the angry declaration by patrons of a mob-controlled gay bar, more than a decade later, that they would no longer tolerate police harassment. What the two episodes share is the principle that has been at the core of the gay cause: an insistence on one's own fundamental dignity.
In the half century since Stonewall, it has been the personal, family and social experience of gay people "coming out"—and not some brilliant political strategy, abstruse legal wizardry or the economic power of the "pink dollar"—that has proven to be the gay movement's most effective asset. The more familiar Americans become with gay people, the less likely they are to support discrimination against them.
"You know, the guys there were so beautiful," an emotional Allen Ginsberg, touring the shambolic scene around Sheridan Square, told a Village Voice reporter the final night of the Stonewall riots. "They've lost that wounded look." They had emulated the personal courage of Frank Kameny.

Our View: The magic of sports: It can bring pure joy

Texto completo: For a moment, let us forget the bad news of the world, whether it be the endless pronouncements of the president, the angry responses of his critics or even the looming threat of war with Iran.
No, this is a moment -- a brief one, perhaps, given the state of the world -- to contemplate joy. And not all joy, but most specifically, the joy that comes through competition in sports. And not just competing, but winning, on stages small and large.
In Albuquerque this week, we have seen senior citizens take center stage to test their bodies against athletes of their own age. Whether walking, running, swimming or performing other feats of derring-do, competitors in the National Senior Games remind us that age is a state of mind. Senior status is no excuse, or reason, to retire to a rocking chair.
Not when you can be like 103-year-old Julia Hawkins, who just won gold medals in the 50- and 100-meter races at the Albuquerque games. She came late to running, starting at 100 after biking became too arduous. She practices, but not too much, since "I feel like I only have so many 100-yard dashes left, and I don't want to waste them in practice."
She told folks after the races that the key to longevity is to stay active and be passionate about your interests. "Look for magic moments," she said to the New York Times. "That is something I have done in my life -- think of the things that are magic moments that happen to you, like sunsets and sunrises, rainbows, beautiful birds, music and people's lovely comments to you."
Oh, and keep moving.
Similar advice came from other senior game competitors. Some 13,712 athletes participated in the games in Albuquerque, and fewer than 200 came from U.S. Native tribes, almost half from New Mexico.
Alberta Lente, 96, of Isleta Pueblo came to the games to play shuffleboard. She sat in her wheelchair between rounds, but the elder was determined to compete. "I'm 96 and that's just a number. If we show we can do it, why wouldn't [the kids] do it too."
Yes, be an example to the young ones.
And in sports in New Mexico today, there is no better example than our state soccer team, New Mexico United. That's not just because players are winning, and boy are they winning, but because the camaraderie of the team has embraced fans, city and state, truly making us feel united.
Watching the team defeat not one but two Major League Soccer teams in recent days has been energizing. Now, after winning in Colorado and Texas, the team will be going to Minnesota in July for further competition in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Fans chartered a bus to Dallas, but it's 20 on-the-road hours each way to St. Paul or an expensive plane ticket, so they are trying to figure out affordable transportation.
It's all part of what has been a magical first season for the Albuquerque-based team, whether winning matches, attracting thousands of spectators or creating a fan frenzy the likes of which haven't been seen in New Mexico since the Lobos men's basketball team dominated league play. Pure joy.
Outstanding performers in sports, whether individuals or teams, can inspire the rest of us. We can take up running in our golden years. We can compete despite long odds. And during a magical season, our team can beat the giants, uniting a state in celebration.

Iowa farmer pleads for USMCA trade deal passage

Texto completo: It's time to bring America together again — and that's why I'm asking Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate to lead in ratifying a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.
It's time for our lawmakers to join together and approve a deal that will begin to turn the page on the harmful trade wars of the last two-and-a-half years. Ongoing trade disputes have damaged our economy, threatened our global leadership and divided our country.
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) would replace NAFTA, the trade deal signed into law by President Clinton in 1993. In the USMCA, we have a fully negotiated and modernized agreement with our two most reliable and important trading partners. On May 30, the Trump administration notified Congress that it's ready to start the formal approval process for the USMCA.
It's time to take the high road. Let's rise above the latest obstacles, keep our focus and prove to our allies that we want to be a reliable trading partner. Together, elected leaders of both parties can show that we all can put the good of the nation in front of partisan political interests.
Although some members in the House of Representatives are skeptical of USMCA, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has signaled that she thinks she can navigate the deal through her chamber. "I can get to yes," she told a colleague, according to the New York Times. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, echoed Pelosi in an interview with Bloomberg: "We are trying to get to yes."
So let's get there. Let's approve a trade agreement that works for more Americans than its predecessor and move forward with expanding U.S. competitiveness in new, growing markets around the globe. Let's reestablish the stability and certainty that America needs.
We sure do need it here in Floyd County, Iowa, where my family grows corn and soybeans on our farm. We depend on export markets. One-third of what we grow ships to customers in other countries. Or at least it does when we're not getting entangled in trade conflicts. The tariffs are killing us and the trade wars are not easy to win.
That's why I recently hopped aboard the "Motorcade for Trade," which is traveling across the U.S. to spread our message about the importance of trade to politicians and the public. The Voice of America posted a video report on our road trip.
I am a past president of the National Corn Growers Association and a past president of Maizall, the international corn growers alliance. Like many other farmers, I have worked around the world to build relationships with the people who buy made-in-America farm goods. Several years ago, I visited Mexico to meet with customers and thank them for their purchases of U.S. grains. I'll never forget what one of them said later in 2017: "You don't need to convince us that our business is important to you. We know that. You need to convince your president."
So, I'm trying to convince everybody, from the man in the Oval Office to legislators in the U.S. House and the Senate, to ordinary citizens who don't think too hard about how their food moves from farms to forks.
The message is simple: We need USMCA.
We need it for our family farms. We need it for jobs in rural America. We need it for the whole nation.
We have a lot of work to do — and we must begin with a truly bipartisan effort that issues the first ceasefire in our disastrous trade wars.
Let's approve USMCA before it's too late.
Let's get to yes.

The Quiet Death of a Notorious Harlem Drug Kingpin; Like a character out of Shakespeare, Nicky Barnes lived a life of excess, betrayal and tragedy.

Texto completo: I am not the guy you'd expect to know a 1970s heroin kingpin, but I knew Nicky Barnes pretty well. While the notorious Harlem drug trafficker died in 2012, the public only learned of his death this week via a report in the New York Times.
When I met Nicky in 2004, he was in the U.S. Federal Witness Protection Program and going by the name Clayton "Clay" Williams. I wanted to publish his memoir, but getting to him took more than a year of pestering the U.S. Marshals Service. Finally, with marshals monitoring the call, I was allowed to speak to him on the phone. Not long after that I went out to meet him in Minneapolis.
A chiseled, compact man—a bantam rooster with a strut to match—Nicky was then 70. He still did push-ups and pull-ups to stay in shape, a habit he acquired at the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill. He ate healthy food, drank only beer, had a car, and liked to go ice fishing. His girlfriend had no idea about his past life.
Nicky was 44 when he was sent away, 48 when he decided to cooperate, and 66 when he finally walked out of prison a not-exactly-free man. He worked at Walmart, and it frustrated him. When it came to sales, distribution and product display, he felt he could do a much better job. He might have been right. But he was a damn good storyteller and had a lot of tales to tell. We started work on what would become his book, "Mr. Untouchable: The Rise, Fall and Resurrection of Heroin's Teflon Don."
The first problem was the contract. It couldn't be with Nicky Barnes, because he no longer existed. It could be with Clayton Williams, but then it'd be too dangerous to keep the executed contract in our office. Lots of bad guys still wanted Nicky dead, and he no longer had federal protection. Contrary to what the Times has reported, by 2005 Nicky had left the Witness Protection Program. The U.S. Marshals cut him loose when he decided to publish a book.
If anything surprised me about Nicky, it was the anger, decades later, that still ran hot regarding the betrayal by his protégé, Guy Fisher. Nicky dedicated "Mr. Untouchable" to Mr. Fisher: "You disrespected me. You betrayed me. See where that got you? I want you to read every word of my story. And when you finish the last page, I want you to look up, see where I put you and ask yourself, was it worth it?" Mr. Fisher is still serving out a life sentence on racketeering, drug and murder convictions based in part on Nicky's testimony.
Nicky was a character out of Shakespeare. The man only wanted a family but ended up triggering a titanic and depraved tragedy. Nicky's childhood on the streets led him to crave the intimacy and trust of a family unit. So he tried to build one in the form of seven drug-dealing "brothers" known as "the Council," which by the mid-1970s ruled much of the East Coast heroin trade. When Nicky learned these "family" bonds were no more than a naive delusion, he retaliated against them all, putting dozens into prison, many for life.
The book came out in 2007, and I last spoke to him in 2011. He wanted to know when someone would make a Hollywood movie about him. It bothered him that he'd been portrayed as a minor character in "American Gangster," the 2007 biopic starring Denzel Washington as Nicky's competitor Frank Lucas. Nicky must have died not long after our phone call. He said nothing of his cancer.
I tried calling Nicky/Clay over the years, but his phone number was disconnected. I figured he might have finally made it to Arizona. He hated Minneapolis: "Much too cold most of the year and almost everyone is white." I figured if I really had to get in touch, I would go through the marshals again. It would be a chore, but I knew the drill.
Back in the day, Nicky wasn't a "good" guy, either personally or professionally. He required that all of his girlfriends learn to "stand and hold." This meant they had to learn to walk with his loaded pistol under their skirts so that the weapon wouldn't be found by the cops.
A former heroin addict himself, Nicky knew the horrors of addiction but rationalized away any remorse for destroying tens of thousands of lives. Indeed, he relied on his addict's knowledge to make his product the best on the street. No matter how generous he was with people in Harlem—holiday turkeys and hospital bills—the money he spread around was taken from other members of the community who'd poisoned and killed themselves with his product.
So why did his death attract so much attention? Supposedly, no minority makes it in America until they first make it in crime. In the 1970s, as blacks emerged as leaders in politics, society, and culture, Nicky Barnes did the same, only for African-American organized crime. Members of the Italian mafia—whose methods Nicky studied while in Greenhaven Prison alongside "Crazy Joe" Gallo—became both rivals and partners. Only now, under Nicky, the nation's first black godfather dictated to them.
With an unfinished grammar-school education, Nicky had few opportunities for legitimate business success. Instead, he played the hand he was dealt. If Nicky had grown up in a different place and at a different time, he'd likely have gone in an different direction as an entrepreneur. My guess is he'd have done OK.

Texto completo: Another Middle East war is the last thing we need.
President Donald Trump and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, both say they don't want a war. But, feeding off each other, they are each behaving recklessly in ways that increase the risk of conflict.
So we're facing a very real crisis, without good face-saving exit ramps for either Trump or Khamenei. This could get scarier.
If the escalation continues, Iranian proxies could strike Americans in Iraq, Syria and other countries, and there is also a risk of Hezbollah firing rockets at Israel to trigger a new Israel-Lebanon war. Oil flows could be interrupted, and the global economy affected. This could get very messy.
American hard-liners have had a dangerous obsession with Iran for years, egged on by Saudi Arabia and Israel. In 2002, in the run-up to the Iraq War, Newsweek quoted a British official as saying: "Everyone wants to go to Baghdad. Real men want to go to Tehran."
Trump and his aides are right that Iran is repressive, destabilizing and untrustworthy, and it shouldn't be trusted with nuclear weapons. (Of course, the same is true of Saudi Arabia under Trump's buddy, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.)
In 2015, President Barack Obama achieved a nuclear deal that verifiably kept Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for 15 years or more. It was an imperfect compromise, but it made Iran less worrying for years to come.
Then along came Trump, blowing up the nuclear deal and starting a campaign of "maximum pressure" on Iran's economy.
Quite predictably, Iran responded in two ways.
First, Iran warned that it would violate terms of the nuclear deal. Alarmed and flailing about, Washington this week had the gall to call on Iran to adhere to the nuclear pact that Trump has savaged.
Second, Iran was probably behind attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. It's not impossible that Iran is being framed, but even knowledgeable Democrats believe the Trump administration is correct about Iran's responsibility.
Both the nuclear production and the attacks on tankers underscore the way Trump's retreat from diplomacy has made the world more perilous. But they both are measured provocations: If you want to damage a tanker, you put the limpet mine below the water line rather than above it, and Iran's violations of the Iran pact won't put it close to a bomb soon.
Trump described the damage to the tankers as "very minor," and he seems to recognize the danger of escalation. But he has sent an additional 2,500 U.S. troops to the region, and there have been calls for striking Iran. If the U.S. does, then of course Iran will respond.
Brett McGurk, a national security expert and former presidential envoy, warned that given the failure of the administration's Iran policy so far, "Trump may soon be boxed in: Either back down or resort to military tools."
It's troubling that the administration is also conflating Shiite Iran with the Sunni Taliban. Members of Congress fear that this is meant to give Trump legal cover to attack Iran under the 2001 authorization for the use of military force against al-Qaida and its offshoots.
Reflecting the administration's propensity to inhabit a fantasyland, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has offered a ridiculous 12-point plan that essentially called for Iran to roll over and surrender.
I was in Paris over the weekend for the annual meeting of the Trilateral Commission, and it's sad to see how distrustful our allies have become toward America. Instead of forcing Iran into submission, Washington's incompetent bullying of Europe and Asia to join Iran sanctions has managed to antagonize our oldest friends, push Iran back toward a nuclear path and increase the risk of war.
There are few good options now, but an international force to protect tankers might help, along with secret diplomacy to see if the nuclear deal can be patched up in a way that both sides can accept. I doubt it, but it's worth trying.
I've been to Iran, reported from Iran and been detained in Iran; I have no illusions about it. The American hard-liners are quite right that the regime is unpopular because of its corruption, incompetence and repression. But Iran also has a deep nationalist streak, and Trump already seems to be strengthening hard-liners in Tehran. In 2002, six months before the Iraq War, I reported from Baghdad that President George W. Bush and his aides were deluding themselves to think that Iraqis would welcome an invasion; Iraqis hated Saddam but hated even more the idea of Yankee imperialists attacking their nation. Iran is similar but more formidable.
Negotiations are frustrating, imperfect and uncertain, and they may seem less satisfying than dropping bombs. But America has suffered huge self-inflicted wounds because of its invasion of Iraq 16 years ago.
Haven't we learned lessons? Maybe "real men" should forget about going to Tehran and try multilateral diplomacy.

Business News: Walmart to Pay $282 Million in Settlement of Bribery Probe

Texto completo: Walmart Inc. agreed to pay $282 million to resolve yearslong criminal and regulatory investigations into whether it paid bribes around the world, agreeing that it had lax policies in place to catch potential corruption.
The resolution comes after more than six years of settlement talks between Walmart and the U.S. government.
The deal requires Walmart to return $144 million in gains to the Securities and Exchange Commission and pay a $138 million penalty to the Justice Department. The SEC said the company's actions violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which effectively forbids U.S.-listed companies from paying bribes to win business abroad.
The Justice Department began its investigation as a result of a series of 2012 New York Times articles that described payments Walmart made in Mexico to obtain permits to build stores there. The probe later examined Walmart's business across the globe, including in Brazil, China and India.
"We're pleased to resolve this matter," Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in a written statement. "We've enhanced our policies, procedures and systems and invested tremendous resources globally into ethics and compliance."
Two years ago Walmart said that it would record a $283 million charge related to the settlement.
The SEC's civil order alleged that Walmart targeted global growth during the 1990s without immediately ramping up its systems to account for corruption risks. Walmart has spent more than $900 million since 2012 on an internal investigation of the allegations and related compliance improvements, the company said.
Walmart's Brazilian subsidiary pleaded guilty to one count of violating the foreign-corruption law. The Justice Department agreed not to prosecute Walmart Inc. as long as it pays its penalty, maintains its anticorruption compliance program and retains an outside compliance monitor for two years.
The company sold a majority stake in its Brazilian operations last year to a private-equity firm.
Walmart sought to wrap up the probe during the final weeks of the Obama administration. The company and U.S. officials weren't able to agree on a deal, clashing over issues including Walmart's eligibility to continue accepting food stamps in its around 5,300 U.S. stores.
A company that pleads guilty to a federal crime can lose its right to win government contracts. Walmart will continue to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits after reaching an agreement with the government, said Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman.
Monitors will observe corporate anticorruption compliance efforts at Walmart headquarters, as well as in other countries including Argentina, Chile, Japan and South Africa, Mr. Hargrove said.
U.S. authorities in May 2017, shortly after the beginning of the Trump administration, sought a fine of $300 million to settle the probe, a penalty far less than the $1 billion sought by government enforcers toward the end of the Obama administration.
The SEC's settlement order with Walmart said the company's "low-cost philosophy" contributed to its insufficient policies to combat corruption risks in Brazil, India, Mexico and China.
Walmart operated in countries where intermediaries were allegedly paid to speed up store permits and licenses, according to the SEC.
"Walmart valued international growth and cost-cutting over compliance," said Charles Cain, chief of the SEC's foreign corruption unit. "Walmart repeatedly failed to take red flags seriously."

Texto completo: Let's get this straight: Joe Biden is leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination because he's the most "electable" candidate in the field? A guy who doesn't realize that "I worked with segregationists" isn't a winning message with Democrats in 2020?
This is what you get from a candidate who's been in Washington for 46 years. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, when the Democratic Party was very different from what it is today. As a freshman senator, he had to get along with the senior leadership of his party - which included segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of living Americans had either forgotten Eastland's and Talmadge's names or never heard of them in the first place, until Biden decided to dredge them up from the fever swamps of the Democratic Party's sordid racial past.
Why, you ask, would he do such a thing? Because he is a walking, talking gaffe machine. His point didn't even make sense. He was trying to argue that he can work across the aisle with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. But Eastland and Talmadge sat on the same side of the aisle as Biden in the Senate; they were Democrats.
So now his opponents are pouncing on Biden's mistake. Kamala Harris (averaging 7.1 percent in the polls) said that for Biden "to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it's just misinformed and it's wrong." Cory Booker (2.3 percent) declared, "Vice President Biden's relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place." Bill de Blasio (0.3 percent) tweeted, "@JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland. Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal."
No reasonable person thinks that Biden was defending or even sympathetic to segregation. What Biden was trying to do was to defend not segregation but civility and compromise. But sadly, in today's Democratic Party, those ideas are just as controversial.
In February, Biden was forced to apologize for declaring - brace yourself - that Vice President Mike Pence was a "decent guy." Then, a few months later, Biden had to backtrack on his effort to craft a middle-ground approach to climate change that would be embraced by both environmentalists and blue-collar voters. After Bernie Sanders thundered, "There is no 'middle ground' when it comes to climate policy," Biden soon embraced the Green New Deal.
And this month, Biden was forced to abandon his four-decade-long support for the Hyde amendment - bipartisan legislation that bars public funding for abortions - after his Democratic opponents attacked him for reaffirming what he once proudly called his "middle-of-the-road" policy on abortion. Biden has also been forced to apologize for his support for the bipartisan 1994 crime bill, which was signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton but which Democrats now blame for the mass incarceration of African Americans.
In today's Democratic Party, "compromise" is a dirty word. Biden's problem is not that he is a closet racist; it's that he does not hate Republicans and other political opponents. As he put it Tuesday: "Today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore."
In January, Biden said, "I read in The New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans. OK, well, bless me, Father, for I have sinned." Apparently, for many on the left, that sin is unforgivable.

AJC DIGGING DEEPER GEORGIA COAST: How much could it cost to protect our coastline?: Study sees $15 billion price tag for state to cope with rising seas.

Texto completo: The cost of climate change is difficult to calculate, but a new study by an environmental advocacy group proposes a base-line figure.
The Center for Climate Integrity conducted a study that looked at protecting coastal communities from the expected rise in sea levels over the next 20 years.
In Georgia, that price tag will be more than $15 billion, according to the study, which predicted that the state faces a sea level rise of 2-3 feet by the year 2100.
Nationwide, the cost could top $400 billion, said executive director Richard Wiles.
"That is approaching the money we spent on the entire interstate highway system," he said, "and we would have to do it in half the time."
Partnering with the engineering firm Resilient Analytics and geographic information system specialists at the University of Colorado, the center calculated the cost of constructing sea walls to contain the rising water, using "conservative" estimates of sea level increases.
"We looked at a short-term, modest sea level rise by the year 2040, not a worst-case scenario, not far in the future," said Wiles. "We did this to determine what needs to be done now, not in the future."
Wiles and his colleagues discussed the results of the study in a teleconference this week.
The "bare minimum" solution proposed by the center would build sea walls in areas of any infrastructure--generally, any area that includes a road.
In Georgia that would mean 2,460 miles of sea walls, or essentially the whole coast, plus walls in some estuaries and other areas.
Some coastal geologists questioned the idea of building sea walls along an entire coastline.
"Sea walls are not the environmentally preferred option for protecting the shoreline," said Clark
--NEW YORK TIMES
Alexander, director of the University of Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography. He added that in some Georgia counties, "the cost to protect them is going to outstrip the value of what you're protecting."
The answer for some of these counties, he said, will be "managed retreat," in which communities will fall back and let the sea gobble up whatever is there.
"Honestly, managed retreat is the only way to deal with this issue in the long term."
On the other hand, he said, using sea wall construction as a common measure for all coastal communities is a "first step to trying to get some sort of unambiguous level playing field to look at what it's going to cost around the U.S."
Many cities, especially small ones, will not be able to meet those costs.
Those that can't will depend on federal funding;the Trump administration is expected to soon unveil the details of two new large spending programs to fund disaster mitigation. The design of those programs could help determine which places are best able to withstand the force of climate change.
The administration is working on rules governing $16 billion in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help cities and states protect themselves against the effects of future natural disasters, the largest such award ever made by the department. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is also currently preparing rules for grants to pay for climate-resilient infrastructure.
A FEMA spokeswoman, Abigail Dennis, told The New York Times that the agency is asking governments, businesses, academics and "vulnerable and at-risk populations" to provide input on the design of its new grant program, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities.
"The increasing frequency, impact and cost of disasters demands that we invest in mitigation and reduce disaster suffering," Dennis said. The program "will support measures to reduce the vulnerability of communities and public infrastructure before a disaster strikes."
But Skip Stiles, executive director of the Norfolk, Va.-based Wetlands Watch, said those efforts can only go so far.
"Everyone points to the federal government, but the federal government may not be able to build the life raft that we hope to see," said Stiles. "The U.S.Corps of Engineers has $90 billion in projects lined up, but only gets about $3 billion a year in appropriations."
The Center for Climate Integrity thinks that oil and gas companies should pay a significant percentage, and supports "meritorious" court cases against fossil fuel companies.
"They were well aware that climate change was occurring," said Wiles. "Fifty years ago scientists were warning them of catastrophic outcomes right around this time in the future. Instead of diversifying, they ran a 30-year campaign of denial."

WHAT SOME COMMUNITIES ARE DOING
New York City In March, Mayor Bill de Blasio
proposed a$10 billion project to protect a slice ofLower Manhattan from flooding, asking
the federal government to pay for it.
New Orleans In April, the Army Corps of Engineers said the city's levee system, upgraded after Hurricane Katrina at a cost of$14 billion, is sinking, and could become inadequate in as little as four years.
Charleston In May, officials held a public meeting on where to find the estimated$2 billion the city needs to prepare its drainage
and water infrastructure.

Texto completo: Come Pride Month, few are prouder, or louder, than the people of New York's theater community. This year, with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, stories of struggle and salvation are on offer, alongside frothier fare celebrating and representing the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and its allies. Here we consider some of what's onstage now.
'A Strange Loop'
A tireless Larry Owens plays a theater usher named Usher in Michael R. Jackson's dizzying musical, which wrestles with blackness, queerness and black queerness with gleeful abandon. Beyoncé, Tyler Perry and "The Lion King" are involved. Stephen Brackett directed, and Raja Feather Kelly choreographed, this "self-portrait in an endless hall of mirrors that dares to forbid closure, escape or redemption to the artistically thwarted being at its center," Ben Brantley wrote in his review for The New York Times. Through July 28 at Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; playwrightshorizons.org.
'The Rolling Stone'
Family ties, in particular the bond between two brothers -- one an Anglican pastor, the other a closeted gay man -- are tested by conflicting loyalties in this work by the English playwright Chris Urch. The play, in previews now and opening July 15, was inspired by a 2010 incident in which a newspaper in Kampala, Uganda, outed local gay men and incited homophobic violence. Through Aug. 25 at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center Theater; lct.org.
'Contradict This! A Birthday Funeral for Heroes'
On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of his birth, Walt Whitman stands accused of multitudes of sins, including racism, nationalism, sexism and "poetic man-spreading." With the audience in the jury box (and armed with a giant red cancel button), Whitman and other disgraced luminaries face judgment, in a musical mock trial by the Bearded Ladies Cabaret company. Through June 29 at Ellen Stewart Theater, 66 East Fourth Street, Manhattan; lamama.org.
'Stonewall'
As part of New York City Opera's annual Pride Initiative -- whose past installments have offered productions of "Angels in America" and the United States premiere of "Brokeback Mountain" -- a new opera by Iain Bell and Mark Campbell tells the story of the events at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village on June 28, 1969. Liz Bouk will play what the company has called the first transgender role specially created for a transgender performer in an opera. June 21-28 at Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan; nycopera.com.

'We're Only Alive for a Short Amount of Time'
In soul-baring spoken word and song, the consummate monologuist David Cale traces the scars of his deeply dysfunctional upbringing in Luton, England -- portraying and confronting his own family members along the way -- and shares his incredible true story of survival. This new piece is currently in previews, and is scheduled to open on June 27. Through July 14 at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, Manhattan; publictheater.org.
'Pride Plays'
A festival of play readings, culminating in a reading of Terrence McNally's "Some Men" featuring a cast of more than 50 actors. The program includes, on Sunday, an evening of musicals, and on Monday, original works from the Trans Lab fellowship of trans and gender nonconforming playwrights. Through June 24 at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Manhattan; rattlestick.org.
'Quilt, a Musical Celebration'
This multihued and multi-textured patchwork of stories and songs honors the lives of people who have died of AIDS-related causes and acknowledges those left behind. Proceeds of the special community-led professional presentation of the piece, inspired by the AIDS Memorial Quilt, will benefit the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center and Frontline AIDS. June 21-23 at Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Manhattan; quiltmusical.org.
'Julio Down by the Schoolyard'
A new play by J. Julian Christopher tackles the importance of regaining pride, even in the wake of tragedy. It explores the aftermath of the 1990 murder of Julio Rivera, a 29-year-old gay man, in Queens, and how the hate crime galvanized the Jackson Heights gay community to seek change and claim its identity. June 27-29 at 500 West 52nd Street, Manhattan; intartheatre.org.
Queerly Festival
The fifth annual festival presents music, drama, poetry and comedy by queer artists, plus its first short film festival with work by local filmmakers on June 24. Among the works is "Dear Diary," a series of dramatic readings of several queer comedians' childhood journals. Laughter inevitable. Discomfort guaranteed. Various dates at the Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, Manhattan; horsetrade.info.
'Love! Valour! Compassion!'
The Gay Fellowship at Blessed Sacrament Church presents a staged reading of Terrence McNally's Tony Award-winning play, about eight gay friends vacationing in upstate New York, to benefit the anti-bullying organization the Tyler Clementi Foundation. June 23 at Theater 71, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan; abingdontheatre.org.
______
Broadway
'The Cher Show'
The glittering jukebox musical charts Cherilyn Sarkisian's rise from backup singer to global phenomenon (and queer icon), with three Chers -- including Stephanie J. Block -- for the price of one, and costumes designed by Bob Mackie. Open run at Neil Simon Theater; thechershowbroadway.com.
'The Prom'
In this exuberant musical comedy, directed by Casey Nicholaw ("The Book of Mormon," "Something Rotten"), four actors seeking positive publicity head to rural Indiana, where a teenager has been barred from bringing her girlfriend to the high school dance. Through Aug. 11 at the Longacre Theater; theprommusical.com.

'Naked Boys Singing!'
The boys are still belting out tunes in their birthday suits in the accurately titled long-running musical revue. Theater Row Theaters, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; nakedboyssinging.com.

Chaos at the NRA

Texto completo: The National Rifle Association has ousted its president and first vice president, watched an open revolt from some members on the floor of its annual meeting, sued and been sued by its top contractor, suspended its top lobbyist, and had its leadership publicly hurl accusations of financial impropriety at one another, while facing congressional inquiries and an investigation by an exceedingly hostile attorney general.
All in 2019. And the turmoil, unlike any the powerful gun rights lobby has faced in its nearly 150-year history, isn’t over.
It all appears to have started in January when, according to the Wall Street Journal, the NRA’s top outside counsel, William Brewer, gave a presentation to board members about concerns that newly-elected New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, would investigate and try to break up the gun rights group. James was openly hostile toward it during her campaign and referred to it as a “terrorist organization” in an interview with Ebony magazine.
With a looming threat of investigation by the NRA’s charter state, some in its leadership began to scrutinize its business relationship with Ackerman McQueen, its largest contractor, that accounted for $40 million of NRA spending in 2017. Ackerman and the NRA had enjoyed a decadeslong relationship. Ackerman was reportedly responsible for not only creating and running NRATV but also developing its most iconic commercials and messaging. Top executives Angus and Revan McQueen are Brewer’s father-in-law and brother-in-law, respectively.
The group was behind everything from the “I am the NRA" ads, NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre’s declaration that “the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” and Charlton Heston’s famous ultimatum that the only way anyone would take his guns would be “from my cold, dead hands.” It also runs one of the NRA’s magazines, America's 1st Freedom, and provides logistics for its massive annual meetings and leadership forum.
Much of what the average person knows about the NRA was created by Ackerman.
Yet Ackerman had been a point of internal controversy for years. The last major leadership fight at the NRA, in the 1990s, involved complaints about the company’s influence over strategy and also about its billing practices. Its messaging has also clashed with efforts by the group’s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. According to the New Yorker, Ackerman’s aggressive ad campaign against President Barack Obama in 2012 after a school shooting nearly ruptured the NRA’s relationship with key congressional Democrats.
The new scrutiny precipitated a legal fight. The NRA, through Brewer’s law firm, filed suit against Ackerman, seeking details of its billing practices and, in particular, information on its contract with the man who was NRA president at the time, Oliver North. The NRA accused Ackerman of hiding crucial details about North’s pay and demanded the company turn over documents. Ackerman claimed it gave the NRA’s auditors full access to its records.
In April, with North and Ackerman McQueen on one side of this fight and LaPierre and Brewer on the other, everyone headed to Indianapolis for the NRA’s annual meeting. That’s when the internal struggle blew past the point of no return. As the massive meeting was underway, news broke that North and LaPierre had traded dueling letters to the NRA’s board of directors, accusing one another of various forms of financial impropriety and unethical behavior.
LaPierre accused North of attempting to extort him into resigning by threatening to release damaging information. North countered by announcing the formation of a crisis committee tasked with investigating accusations of mismanagement and self-dealing by LaPierre and others that had begun being reported in newspapers and magazines. It all came to a head when LaPierre refused to resign and North flew home the night before he was set to preside over the members’ meeting.
As a few thousand NRA members with voting privileges gathered to receive reports on the state of the organization from leadership and vote on their own resolutions to the board, usually a rah-rah sort of affair, North’s seat was empty, and the session began with ally and NRA First Vice President Richard Childress reading a scathing letter from the former Marine colonel to the membership, repeating accusations against LaPierre, but also effectively announcing his resignation. After stirring speeches from a number of NRA officials, the meeting devolved into a shouting match as some members, including firearms instructor and gun rights activist Rob Pincus, attempted to forward what was effectively a motion of no confidence in LaPierre, audit committee members, and other leaders. Board members meanwhile attempted to end debate and adjourn the meeting. The no-confidence resolution was eventually referred to the board for further consideration.
When the board convened at the end of the annual meeting, it referred the no-confidence resolution to the audit committee and ethics committee, which will effectively decide whether audit committee members and others should be forced to resign at the next board meeting, Sept. 13. Most of the board’s 9 1/2-hour meeting was spent behind closed doors in an executive session. It’s not clear what, if any, decisions were made about the accusations of impropriety exchanged by North and LaPierre.
One act that did seem to take place in private session — it certainly didn’t occur in public — was the election of NRA leadership. Results were leaked to the New York Times: LaPierre was reelected. North and Childress were removed from their leadership positions.
"National Rifle Association Executive Vice President/CEO Wayne LaPierre was re-elected unanimously and unopposed by the NRA Board of Directors at their meeting in Indianapolis, Ind., April 29, 2019," NRA leadership later said in a post on American Rifleman’s website. "Carolyn Meadows was elected NRA President."
This was disputed by board member Allen West. "The new slate of officers for the National Rifle Association was decided upon, and nominated by, the NRA Board of Directors nominating committee," West said in a post on his personal website. "There were no nominations from the floor when these names were put forth. With no opposing nominations, the vote was done by acclamation, not roll call vote. This is similar to passing a piece of legislation by voice vote."
Two weeks later, West publicly said he does not support LaPierre’s continued leadership, and he called on him to resign. He had already urged this in private.
"Prior to the NRAAM in Indianapolis I sent an email to Wayne LaPierre's managing director, Millie Hallow, expressing my sentiment that Wayne LaPierre resign immediately," he said in another statement on his website. "I also drafted a memo entitled ‘Resolution of Concerns.' Both of these statements are known to the NRA board.
"I do not support Wayne LaPierre continuing as the EVP/CEO of the NRA. The vote in Indianapolis was by acclamation, not roll call vote. There is a cabal of cronyism operating within the NRA and that exists within the Board of Directors. It must cease, and I do not care if I draw their angst. My duty and responsibility is to the Members of the National Rifle Association, and my oath, since July 31, 1982, has been to the Constitution of the United States, not to any political party, person, or cabal."
Meadows, First Vice President Charles Cotton, and Second Vice President retired Lt. Col. Willes Lee responded in a statement to the Washington Free Beacon, defending LaPierre and accusing West of lying.
"It is unfortunate that certain board members have resorted to making false and misleading public statements about proceedings of the NRA board of directors," the joint statement said. "As those board members know, we are not at liberty to discuss the particulars of the board of directors meeting that occurred in executive session on April 29. However, every board member was afforded the opportunity to speak openly about any issues of concern to them. To suggest otherwise is dishonorable."
West further accused leadership of "maliciously, recklessly and purposefully put[ting] me, and uninformed board members, in legal jeopardy” by not informing them of accusations of financial mismanagement.
"The recent statements by Charles Cotton and Carolyn Meadows that are appearing in the Wall Street Journal, and now other news outlets, are outright lies,” West said. “I have never been told, advised, informed or consulted about any of these details mentioned in the WSJ, and who knows how much more despicable spending of members' money."
Fellow NRA board member Timothy Knight echoed West’s comments about being kept in the dark on his Facebook page. "I certainly did not know all those things being leaked nor do I believe that the whole Board was aware," he said. He later also called for LaPierre to resign.
Meadows, Cotton, and Lee responded by reiterating that LaPierre was “unanimously” reelected and board members were briefed on the controversies and have access to further resources to keep themselves apprised of the legal situation. They further accused board members who have criticized leadership of being part of an anti-LaPierre putsch.
“It occurs to us that board members ‘voicing' concern may have been part of a failed attempt to oust Wayne LaPierre as CEO and Executive Vice President of the NRA prior to the board meeting in Indianapolis," the three NRA officials said. "In fact, we were all warned that a scorched earth campaign would ensue unless Wayne moved to withdraw the NRA's lawsuit against Ackerman McQueen and walked away from the NRA. Wayne chose the principled path — and did neither. He will continue to press for full transparency from all vendors, even the ones that employ Col. North and others."
As the fight between West and NRA leadership unfolded, the letter North sent to the board detailing accusations of excessive personal spending by LaPierre as well as another detailing his concerns over legal fees paid to Brewer’s law firm leaked online. It included memos from Ackerman McQueen outlining some of the spending the company said it had been directed to do on LaPierre’s travel and clothing over the years.
In one memo, Ackerman said it paid out nearly $275,000 over a 13-year period at Ermenegildo Zegna in Beverly Hills, a high-end suit store, on behalf of LaPierre. That includes a $39,435 trip on May 11, 2004, and a $39,000 trip on Sept. 22, 2015.
In the other memo, the company alleged it spent over $265,000 on airfare and limo rentals for LaPierre and was later reimbursed by the NRA. It claimed to have spent $17,600 on airfare for a trip between Washington, D.C., and New York; $47,025 on a trip between South Africa, Los Angeles, and Reno, Nev.; $7,075 on a second leg between Reno and Los Angeles; plus $40,345 for airfare from Reno back to Washington. Those four visits were all part of a 10-day, $112,045 trip between Jan. 17 and Jan. 27, 2013, according to the letter.
The second Ackerman memo also lists $13,804.84 worth of rent for May through August 2016 for Megan Allen, who was an intern at the NRA during that time and is now a gift planning associate. The letter lists rent for the apartment at $5,346 per month. It also asks LaPierre to explain his "business relationship with Ms. Allen."
Another letter from North and Childress to the NRA’s general counsel and audit committee requested that an "independent, outside expert" review fees paid to Brewer’s law firm. They said the NRA had already spent $24 million on legal fees at the firm in the previous 13 months, nearly $100,000 per day at some points.
The pair described Brewer’s fees as excessive and "draining NRA cash at mindboggling speeds." They went on to say the fees were a "fiscal emergency" that could "pose an existential threat to the financial stability of the NRA."
Cotton responded to complaints about Brewer’s fees with a statement saying, "The memo on the Brewer firm's legal fees is inaccurate — it reflects a misinformed view of the firm, its billings, and its advocacy for the NRA." Brewer’s firm has said its fees, which appear well beyond what the NRA has paid for past legal representation, are justified by the firm’s expertise.
The leak of the memos set off a new round of lawsuits. In late May, the Daily Beast reported NRA leadership doubled down on its previous suit against Ackerman by having Brewer file a second one, this time over the leaks themselves and asking for $50 million in damages instead of mere document production. Ackerman hit back with its own $50 million counterclaim. The company then moved to end its decadeslong relationship with the NRA.
For now, NRATV and other Ackerman projects continue to operate as normal, but the future of some of NRA’s best-known personalities, hosts such as Cam Edwards, Grant Stinchfield, and Dana Loesch, remains unclear.
It hasn’t all been bad news for the NRA. More than 80,000 people attended the annual meeting, which featured speeches from leading Republican representatives, and President Trump spoke there for the third year in a row. Additionally, membership dues and donations reportedly rebounded in 2018. Dues grew over $42 million, or 33%, while donations climbed by over $32 million, which is a 24% increase. Dues in 2018 were even above the levels seen during the 2016 election.
The NRA also announced at the annual meeting that it now has 5.5 million dues-paying members, which was described as an all-time record. NRA support remained broad in 2018, and its supporters continued giving. But the NRA remained in the red and saw a 374% jump in administrative legal fees, while cutting training and education by 23% and dramatically curtailing election spending.
Brewer’s law firm is now working through depositions in the second suit against Ackerman, after issuing subpoenas for North, two of its board members, and Rob Pincus.
As the legal battle with Ackerman plays out, it’s sure to inform a legal battle with New York’s hostile attorney general, which poses an existential threat to the NRA and unknown consequences for gun rights supporters. An increasingly hostile Democratic Party is not only passing sweeping gun control bills out of the statehouses and the federal chamber it controls, but it's now fielding serious primary contenders pushing some of the strictest gun control proposals in a race to challenge the NRA’s top ally, Trump. It's also facing a battle over Trump’s call to ban firearms suppressors.
And, for now at least, it seems it’ll have to face those challenges without the man who has headed its lobbying efforts for the last 17 years: Chris Cox. He and his chief of staff, Scott Christman, were suspended by NRA leadership after being accused of participating in the effort to oust LaPierre, according to reports from the New York Times and Bloomberg News. Cox has denied any involvement, but his future with the organization and where the group’s Institute for Legislative Action will go from here is unclear.
Some, including Pincus, argue that the NRA won’t be able to take on these challenges unless it dumps both Ackerman and LaPierre. “Wayne has now become the front man for a dysfunctional, dare I say ‘corrupt’ (at least in the moral sense, if not legally), regime,” he wrote in AmmoLand. “They enriched themselves and their friends at great expense to the gun community and the cause of gun rights. They stopped lobbying and became professional panderers … fundraisers focused on the most potentially lucrative segment of American Gun Owners. Nothing more."
He continued, “Now, that the alliance between Wayne LaPierre & Ackerman McQueen is falling apart, they are at each other’s throats, and Wayne is desperately trying to appear to be on the high ground while AM tries to manipulate the outcome to protect their cash cow.”
He has called on members to stop donating unless changes are made in leadership and the way the board works.
On the opposite side, NRA President Carolyn Meadows and a group of former presidents insisted in a recent letter that the organization is on sound financial footing, prepared to deal with legal challenges, and united behind LaPierre.
“Perhaps looking for a way to counter the narrative about a stronger, more unified NRA, questions have now conveniently surfaced about our financial situation and our standing in the regulatory arena. There also have been frequent attacks on Wayne’s personal character,” they said. “Our financial house is in order — we aren’t going away. We have full confidence in the NRA’s accounting practices and commitment to good governance.”
The NRA officials said all of the attention on the recent chaos is overblown and is being used by the group’s opponents to put them in a bad light.
“Our adversaries will not divide us and any further discussion about the so-called ‘demise of the NRA’ is only meant to distract us from our mission,” they said.
Unfortunately for all involved, and gun rights supporters at large, it will be months before we know what will come of the Ackerman lawsuits, the New York investigation, and how those ordeals will affect the NRA’s ability to spend money in elections or on lobbying. What is clear, however, is just how much is at stake.

Texto completo: Former FBI agent Peter Strzok snapped at colleague Lisa Page in a spat over not being included in an email distribution list.
The exchange between Strzok and Page, an FBI lawyer who reportedly carried on an extramarital affair with Strzok, was revealed in emails obtained by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch.
On April 27, 2017, Page reacted to a Judicial Watch release that found former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was targeted the prior year by a federal grand jury in an effort to obtain further information about her private email server.
Page sent a reply email to an official in the Office of General Counsel saying, “I didn’t realize that we had said this publicly.”
She then appeared to get into an argument with Strzok. "Are you serious, dude? I sent to [redacted]. So I’ve committed some grave sin for not including you on this? My apologies, DAD Strzok, sir," Page said, referring to his role as deputy assistant director.
Strzok shot back, "You know what? Take a step back and look at this… And stop with the DAD Sir bullsh*t. That’s not the point and you know it."
Page called on Strzok to calm down.
"I think you think you should take your own advice. I didn’t look to see who was on the distribution when I sent it. Sorry, that’s on me. But this is distinctly not a big deal. And I definitely didn’t err in not including you on a two-line email to [redacted]. Get a grip," she said.
Both Strzok and Page, who are no longer with the FBI, have been a focus of GOP investigators concerned about potential bias within the Justice Department and FBI.
Strzok was the lead investigator of the Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.
Text messages between Strzok and Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the Justice Department and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server. Upon the discovery of these texts, Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and was later fired from the bureau.
The emails obtained by Judicial Watch were released in response to a May 21 court order by U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton to the FBI to process 13,000 pages of records, stemming from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking access to communications between Strzok and Page.
Other emails unveiled by Judicial Watch show FBI officials scrambling to correct the record after then-Director James Comey provided inaccurate testimony about a top aide to Clinton and a New York Times reporter feeding information about Jared Kushner meeting with Russians to the FBI.
“These new Page-Strzok emails show the Obama FBI to be a mess both professionally and ethically,” Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement. “The best example of the ethical morass at the FBI are the emails showing how a report on Judicial Watch’s disclosure that a grand jury had been used in the Clinton email investigation set off a spat between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.”

Texto completo: There was a time when calling someone a hypocrite could stain their reputation. No more. Like the overused and often misapplied word “racism,” hypocrisy has lost the power to cause harm.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://i2.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color.jpg?resize=300%2C190&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="190" data-recalc-dims="1" />
The media and Democrats are agog over President Trump’s comment to former Bill Clinton adviser and current “Good Morning America” host, George Stephanopoulos. Trump said if a foreign power had “dirt” on one of his political opponents he’d “listen” and would not necessarily inform the FBI.
On Friday, he backtracked somewhat, telling “Fox and Friends” he might tell the FBI if he received such information from a foreign government.
Unsatisfied, congressional Democrats say the first remark provided more grounds for impeachment. Opposition research is what Democrats (and Republicans) have long done, said the president.
Washington Times reporter Rowan Scarborough writes that Hillary Clinton was once fine with obtaining dirt on her opponents from foreign sources. Recall the Steele dossier, which falsely claimed bad behavior by Donald Trump when he stayed in a Moscow hotel, allegedly cavorting with prostitutes and urinating on a bed in which the Obamas had slept.
Clinton excused the dossier, which was initially paid for by her campaign and the Democratic National Committee, saying it was “part of what happens in a campaign.” The Daily Caller even reported that Christopher Steele told a State Department official that “a former Russian spy chief and a top adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin” were sources for the dossier.
No problem for the media or Democrats now campaigning openly for President Trump’s impeachment because they loved Hillary and hate Trump. This attitude colors all media reporting. Consider The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN and MSNBC, which appear to be anti-Trump, all the time.
Another example of hypocrisy is coming from Democrats, the Left and the media (do I repeat myself?) at the announcement that White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will resign at the end of the month and return to Arkansas.
Reporters are honing in on a statement Sanders made alleging that “the rank and file of the FBI had lost support” for its former director, James Comey. She later said she “misspoke.” Critics called her a liar.
From PolitiFact: “Jay Carney, Barack Obama’s press secretary, echoed Obama’s claim that Americans could keep their current health care plans under the Affordable Care Act. As Obama’s plan moved from idea to legislative reality, the statement became inaccurate. Ultimately, the statement was repeated dozens of times with insufficient context, earning PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year for 2013.” Carney never said he misspoke.
Many press secretaries for Republican and Democratic presidents have lied or “spun” on behalf of their bosses, but those working for Democrats mostly get a pass or were treated better than Sanders. In 1971, when asked if American and South Vietnamese forces were preparing to invade Laos, President Nixon’s press secretary, Ron Ziegler, replied, “The president is aware of what is going on in Southeast Asia. … That is not to say anything is going on in Southeast Asia.”
In 2009, Michael Collier of the San Francisco Chronicle compiled a list of some of the lies associated with modern presidents. They include John F. Kennedy’s aides who claimed Kennedy had to cut short a visit to Chicago and return to Washington because he had a cold. It was 1962 and the truth was the Cuban missile crisis demanded his attention.
Pentagon spokesman Arthur Sylvester said at the time the government had a “right” to lie in such instances.
Lyndon Johnson lied about “guns and butter,” claiming the Vietnam War could be fought without damaging the economy.
A funny one Collier discovered might be apocryphal, but it makes a point: “Franklin D. Roosevelt went to Pittsburgh before the start of World War II and promised that the United States would not go to war. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor — when war became inevitable — he asked his aides what he should say to the American people. They told him: ‘Say you were never in Pittsburgh.'”

National Rifle Association Suspends Second-Highest Executive; In lawsuit, group accuses Chris W. Cox of taking part in conspiracy to oust CEO Wayne LaPierre

Texto completo: The infighting at the National Rifle Association intensified Thursday, as the gun-rights group suspended its second-highest official and accused him of participating in an alleged coup attempt in April against Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre.
The accusation against Chris W. Cox came in a lawsuit filed by the NRA late Wednesday in state court in New York City against former NRA President Oliver North. Mr. North left that post in late April following a power struggle with Mr. LaPierre.
In the lawsuit, the NRA said recently disclosed text messages indicate that Mr. Cox allegedly participated with Mr. North and the NRA's ad agency in what the group called a conspiracy to oust Mr. LaPierre, who has led the NRA for nearly 30 years.
Mr. Cox, in a statement, called the allegations "offensive and patently false," saying he had been "a loyal and effective leader" of the NRA for more than 24 years.
The text messages included in the court filing are fragmentary, but they purportedly show Mr. Cox communicating with an NRA board member about an "ultimatum" given to Mr. LaPierre at the time of the supposed coup attempt. The filing of the lawsuit was first reported by the New York Times.

* Leaked Letters Reveal Details of NRA Chief's Alleged Spending (May 11)
* New York Attorney General Probes NRA as Oliver North Exits as President (April 27)
Mr. LaPierre has said Mr. North tried to get him to resign in April by threatening to publicly expose clothing and travel expenses he charged to the ad firm —later revealed to total more than $500,000. The NRA has said those were legitimate business costs.
Mr. North hasn't commented, but those defending him have said he was carrying out his fiduciary duty as an officer of a nonprofit to examine the expenses.
Meanwhile, the NRA and the ad firm, Ackerman McQueen—which have worked together for decades—have fallen out and are embroiled in separate litigation.
In the New York lawsuit filed Wednesday, the NRA is seeking a court order to avoid paying Mr. North's legal fees in connection with various matters, including inquiries into the NRA by Democratic members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. The NRA said it generally covers legal fees for its officers and directors but doesn't want to do so for Mr. North because of his alleged "corrupt conduct."
Mr. North had no comment, his assistant said.

No, they're not selfish: UMaine professor's new book busts myths about adults who choose not to be parents

Texto completo: Since University of Maine sociology professor Amy Blackstone began researching people who choose not to have children -- as she and her husband, Lance, have chosen -- she's heard just about every type of criticism or belief regarding whether or not to procreate.
That child-free people are selfish and shallow. That they will regret their decision when they are old. That women have a natural maternal instinct that cannot be suppressed. That parental love is a rarefied experience to which nothing else could possibly compare.
"Society has always assumed that all women innately want to have children," said Blackstone. "That's simply not true. And if it's selfish, well, if choosing not to do something because you don't want to is selfish, then many, many things are selfish."
Blackstone, a Bangor resident, has spent the past decade on a mission to bust most of those myths. In her new book, "Childfree By Choice: The Movement Redefining Family & Creating a New Age of Independence," published this month by Penguin Random House, she puts her findings to paper.
It's a book that's equal parts rigorous academic research and memoir, with often-humorous personal anecdotes interlaced with information gleaned from Blackstone's more than 10 years of study.
According to the Pew Research Center, the share of child-free women aged 40 to 44 doubled between 1976 and 2006, to an all-time high of about 20 percent. Today, the share hovers somewhere between 15 and 16 percent, a slight decrease researchers attribute to improved fertility treatments and better family leave policies.
Aside from raw numbers, however, there was little other research to look at when Blackstone began studying child-free people.
"I found that there was very little research that had been done, anywhere," Blackstone said. "Despite the fact that there have always been people that have chosen not to have children. And as it turns out, it's a choice more and more women are making today."
Blackstone, now 47, grew up assuming she'd eventually get pregnant and have children -- she babysat in her church's nursery, and she later worked as a nanny. But by the time she hit her thirties, she realized that both she and her husband had never gotten around to seriously considering actually doing it.
[image id="2831010" size="half" pos="right" /]
On "We're {not} Having a Baby," the blog she and her husband started in 2013, and now in "Childfree By Choice," Blackstone never suggests that her choice is the right choice for everyone. Rather, she suggests that the choice to do so is one that anyone should be allowed to make. It's not wrong, it's not selfish, and it's not guaranteeing anyone an old age filled with loneliness and without someone to care for them.
"If one of the reasons someone wants to have kids is to make sure someone will take care of them when they are old, how is that not equally selfish?" she said. "And there's no guarantee any child will take care of their aging parents."
Blackstone has become a national expert on being child-free -- she's talked about it on "The Today Show" and "The Katie Show" with Katie Couric, and her writing has appeared in publications including USA Today, Time, the Washington Post, the Atlantic and, most recently, in a New York Times op-ed about people both with and without children choosing to live in shared, "Golden Girls"-style living arrangements as they get older.
Though her research on child-free people is what she's most known for, it's not the only topic that takes up her busy schedule at the University of Maine, where she's taught since 2003. She is a former director of the Rising Tide Center at UMaine, which works toward advancing gender equity in higher education, and she also studies harassment in the workplace. Blackstone also teaches a class in the sociology of food -- a course popular with students that studies how the production and consumption of food influences the development of society.
Though her decision to remain child-free has meant Blackstone and her husband have had time to focus on their careers and their own relationship, and to pursue an array of interests, from roller derby to scuba diving to learning Italian cooking, it doesn't mean she doesn't wonder what life might have been like had they chosen differently.
"You can choose to be a parent. You can choose not to be a parent. Both choices come with pros and cons. The whole point is that you get to choose," said Blackstone.

Census question could cost city schools $10M

New York City students would be among the nation's biggest losers if the Trump administration succeeds in adding a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. census.
Arguing that the country needs additional data to enforce the Voting Rights Act, the Trump administration plans to ask for the first time whether census-takers are U.S. citizens. The question is widely seen as likely to - and possibly be intended to - dissuade immigrants from completing the survey. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on a broad legal challenge to the change.
Census data influences representation in Congress and funding for schools and other services, so an undercount of immigrants would have wide-ranging consequences.
Among them: New York City would lose more than $10 million in federal school funding for low-income students if the question does appear on the census, according to an estimate from the Council of Great City Schools, a coalition of school districts that has joined the lawsuit against the question. Only Los Angeles, which has a large share of immigrant and Hispanic students, would lose more, the group estimated.
An analysis by the Urban Institute projects that black and Hispanic residents are most likely to be undercounted in New York, as well as very young children.
A $10 million reduction in Title I funding represents only a tiny fraction of New York City's annual education budget; the city is allocating more than twice as much for new guidance counselors this year.
Still, for schools that see their funding go down, the impact could be acute. Schools use Title I funds to pay for counseling services, academic assistance, and after-school programs - crucial resources to help students who are learning English or live in poverty.
"This goes to the heart of what we do to support our most fragile students," Chancellor Richard Carranza told the New York Times this week. "Hope is not a strategy, but we're really hoping the courts will do the right things here."

Will the trade war slow Chinese tourists?

Texto completo: Boston's tourism industry works hard to accommodate Chinese tourists, and with good reason:They're the largest source of overseas visitors to the city.
For instance, some businesses have adopted WeChat Pay and Alipay, payment apps that are ubiquitous in China; Boston Duck Tours offers tours translated into Chinese languages; and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel hired Mandarin-speaking employees and rearranged its floor plan according to the principles of feng shui.
But as trade tensions between China and the United States remain unresolved, some people who count on Chinese spending here are starting to worry.
The festering dispute is “kind of . . . the elephant in the room," said David O'Donnell, a spokesman for the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau. “We're all concerned that if it continues to escalate, it will hit the travel trade."
In the past, visitors from the United Kingdom ranked number one in Boston. But in 2016, ­Chinese tourists topped the list for the first time — an estimated 249,000 came that year. By 2017, the latest year for which numbers specific to ­Boston are available, the number had swelled to 301,000.
Among the factors that have contributed to the growth is the emergence of a robust middle class in China. According to a report by the analytics firm Oxford Economics, the number of Chinese households making enough to comfortably afford international travel ballooned from about 6 million in 2003 to 27 million in 2013. That figure is expected to grow by an additional 61 million by 2023.
According to federal data, roughly 3 million Chinese tourists visited the United States in 2018, and an estimated 3.2 million visited in 2017.
“The volume is something that's unparalleled and unprecedented in the history of the travel trade," O'Donnell said.
In addition, Boston has become increasingly accessible, thanks to a new 10-year tourist visa and nonstop flights to China from Logan International Airport.
China's Hainan Airlines began offering direct flights to Beijing in June 2014, and a year later, it launched a route between Boston and Shanghai. That May, Cathay Pacific Airways began offering direct flights to Hong Kong.
The Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan, estimates those flights contribute about $600 million to the local economy every year.
O'Donnell said the Convention & Visitors Bureau had launched a Chinese-language website and a marketing campaign on the Chinese social media platform Weibo in 2014, and prior to that created a committee focused on increasing travel from China.
But now, with the United States and China at odds over trade policy, some businesses say the feud already is affecting the economy.
Daniel Andrew, the chief executive of Trademark Tours — which offers student-led tours of Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Boston, as well as college campus summer programs that are popular with Chinese students — said in an e-mail that the company is “seeing a slowdown in Chinese visits."
Andrew estimated that Chinese tourists account for 5 percent of the company's customers, but 15 percent of its revenue.
Andrew didn't say how much business Trademark Tours has lost, but offered that the decline was “likely due to the political tensions between the two countries."
“America still has great appeal to the Chinese visitor," he said, “but the so-called trade war is making our marketing efforts in China more difficult than in previous years."
Bob Schwartz, a spokesman for Boston Duck Tours, said that an advisory issued last year by China about travel to the United States hasn't helped. In that statement, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., described the United States as unsafe.
“Public security in the United States is not good," it said. “Cases of shootings, robberies, and theft are frequent."
“I've never heard of another country trying to dissuade people from coming here, but I wouldn't put it past the Chinese government to double-down on their messaging to not come here if things heated up," Schwartz said.
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that several Chinese agencies had issued additional advisories cautioning its citizens on travel to the United States, and last week The New York Times reported that tourism industry officials fear a nationwide decline in the number of Chinese visitors resulting from the trade dispute.
President Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese goods on top of tariffs already imposed on that country. Meanwhile, China has raised tariffs on $60 billion worth of US goods.
But O'Donnell said that a decrease in the number of visitors from China wouldn't be catastrophic for the Boston-area tourism industry.
“I don't think anyone has become so dependent [on Chinese tourism] that they would have to drastically revisit their entire business plan if this fell off," he said.
“It definitely would hurt, but I don't think it would necessitate a complete overhaul of how these people are marketing themselves."

Texto completo: Federal immigration authorities said Wednesday they will ramp up enforcement, though they offered few specifics, sowing fear and confusion among Atlanta-area immigrants and drawing sharp criticism from Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan declined to say how many and which people would be targeted, or where and when ICE's efforts would begin.
But he highlighted Central American families who have been ordered deported in absentia after failing to win asylum here and then skipping their immigration proceedings. Their presence in the U.S., he said in a conference call with reporters, "is evidence that the system has failed and our removal efforts need to increase."
Morgan spoke two days after President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that ICE next week would "begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the U.S. They will be removed as fast as they come in." Trump fired off his tweet a day before he announced his re-election campaign in Orlando, where he continued to sound off about immigration.
There were an estimated 375,000 immigrants living illegally in Georgia in 2017,down from a high of 425,000 a decade ago, according to the Pew Research Center.
Five county sheriffs in Georgia -- including those in Cobb and Gwinnett counties -- have teamed up with ICE to help identify unauthorized immigrants in their jails and help deport them. In contrast, Bottoms decided last year to bar the city jail from holding ICE's detainees, prompting a rebuke from Vice President Mike Pence during his visit to Atlanta in March. Bottoms has said her move was prompted by the Trump administration's "zero-tolerance" immigration policy on the southwest border, which led to the separation of many immigrant families last year.
"Rather than reforming a broken system, their plan is to detain and deport men, women and children," the mayor said in a prepared statement Wednesday. "This president is placing our country's humanity in peril, creating a nightmare for families just wanting a fair shot at the American dream."
Immigration attorney Arturo Corso said his law office in Gainesville began fielding anxious phone calls soon after Trump's Monday tweet.
"Of course, just like when Trump was first elected, my clients that are noncitizens are very scared, very nervous,"Corso said. "They don't know exactly what to make of it."
The tension was palpable Wednesday at Plaza Fiesta, a cavernous and bustling shopping center in DeKalb County that features homemade wooden vases, clay pots and traditional Mexican-style dresses. Among the shoppers were Carlos, his wife and young son. A Mexican family without legal status in the U.S., they declined to give their last name.
"Many people are starting to be afraid about going into the streets or to work," said Carlos as his wife asked him about buying a Jesus figurine pinned to a gold-embossed cross.
Ashley Portillo, 17, said her Mexican mother is similarly worried.
"She's always been cautious, but she's more cautious now, especially since (Trump) has been posting about the ICE raids," said Portillo, who was born in the U.S. "I feel like everybody is more cautious now."
But Christopher Decca, a native of Venezuela who obtained asylum in the U.S., sympathizes with the president.
"Trump has to deal with a lot of problems he didn't create," said Decca, 49. "Maybe if he has another four years he can do something about it."
Immigration laws prevent the Trump administration from immediately deporting asylum-seeking Central American families, who make up a majority of the migrants arrested at the border. The operation planned by ICE officials would instead target those in the interior of the country who have been issued a final removal order or missed their court date.
An operation targeting families also would not immediately result in the deportation of millions of unauthorized immigrants, according to The New York Times, citing unnamed government officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about the details of the coming operation or Trump's tweet.
ICE charters planes that carry only a couple of hundred migrants back to Central America daily. While roughly 1 million unauthorized immigrants have been issued removal orders, many of them may be appealing their cases and cannot be deported. The roughly 6,000 deportation officers in ICE also do not know the locations of many of the migrants.
Juan Patino, who sells snacks in a small booth in Plaza Fiesta, said he is not afraid.He came here from Mexico in 1987 looking for work and says he is now a U.S. citizen. So is his wife and three of his children, while four children are in Mexico. The majority of Hispanics who come to the U.S., he said, come here for work, like him.
"There are bad immigrants who do bad things," said Patino, 83. "But the majority are good people who come here to work."
Yaslin Turruviates, a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, said her godmother doesn't have legal papers, which makes it hard for her to travel in America.
"Any day they can stop her, and she can be deported," said Turruviates, 20. "There are little kids who rely on their parents who are immigrants. And if they get deported, who are they going to be going to? Many immigrants have their lives here and don't have anything over there."
Corso, the Gainesville immigration attorney, is offering callers some simple advice: Don't panic, limit what you tell any federal immigration authorities you encounter and quickly adjust your legal status, if possible. He added he is skeptical of the president's claim, pointing out federal immigration authorities have limited resources, including officers and detention beds.

International NY Times ends publication of political cartoons

Texto completo: The New York Times announced that it will no longer publish daily political cartoons in its international edition, in the wake of backlash over a cartoon of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu considered anti-Semitic.
In the announcement, the Times ended its relationship with two contract cartoonists.
The international edition stopped running syndicated political cartoons two months ago.
In late April, the New York Times international edition published a political cartoon that showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog (a dachshund) wearing a Star of David collar and leading President Donald Trump, who is wearing a black kippah.
The newspaper later acknowledged that the cartoon "included anti-Semitic tropes" and that it was "an error of judgment to publish it."
James Bennet, editorial page editor, in a statement said that "for well over a year we have been considering bringing that edition into line with the domestic paper by ending daily political cartoons and will do so beginning July 1."
One of the fired cartoonists, Patrick Chappatte, wrote on his personal blog: "I'm putting down my pen, with a sigh: that's a lot of years of work undone by a single cartoon - not even mine - that should never have run in the best newspaper of the world."
He added: "I'm afraid this is not just about cartoons, but about journalism and opinion in general. We are in a world where moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm, falling upon newsrooms in an overwhelming blow. This requires immediate counter-measures by publishers, leaving no room for ponderation or meaningful discussions."
The New York Times won its first Pulitzer Prize for political cartooning last year, for a series that told the story of a Syrian refugee family.

Schumer Challenges Explanation for Delay in $20 Bill Redesign; Treasury has shelved plans to swap in Harriet Tubman for Andrew Jackson

Texto completo: The Senate's top Democrat asked the Treasury Department watchdog to investigate how the agency decided to shelve plans to put Harriet Tubman's image on the $20 bill.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Wednesday said he doubted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's explanation that complex security features were holding up a redesign until late next decade and asked the Treasury's inspector general to review whether political considerations played a role.
"Any unnecessary delays, especially for political reasons, in redesigning the $20 note in her honor are improper and unacceptable," Mr. Schumer said in a letter to the inspector general .
A Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment on the letter. Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley said last week the scheduled release of the $20 bill is "on a timetable consistent with the previous administration."
As a 2016 candidate for president, President Trump called the plan for Ms. Tubman, the 19th-century escaped-slave-turned-abolitionist, to replace President Andrew Jackson on the front of the $20 bill "pure political correctness" and suggested her image be placed on a different bill. Mr. Trump has expressed admiration for Mr. Jackson, a slave owner who served in the White House from 1829 to 1837, and had a portrait of him hung in the Oval Office.
The redesign, which would put a woman on U.S. paper currency for the first time in more than a century, was unveiled in April 2016 by former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who said at the time that the concept designs for the bill were already underway. Final concept designs would be released in 2020, Mr. Lew said then, though the bill wasn't scheduled to go into circulation until after a redesigned $10 note.
But Mr. Mnuchin told a House panel last month he didn't plan to implement the image redesign, and instead was focused on new security features for the bill to fight counterfeiting. A decision on the images "will most likely be another secretary's down the road," he said, adding that the new $20 bill likely won't come into circulation until 2028.
"We will meet the security feature redesign in 2020," Mr. Mnuchin said. "The imagery feature will not be an issue that comes up until most likely 2026," with the bill then being released to the public two years later.
The New York Times reported last week that the Treasury had completed extensive work on the new $20 bill, including a preliminary design produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the Tubman $20 bill that was completed in late 2016.
Len Olijar, the bureau's director, said in a statement last week that the bureau never intended to unveil the design in 2020.
"No Bureau or Department official has 'scrapped' anything; it is too early to develop an integrated concept or design until security features are finalized," he said. "The aesthetics or look of the note has always come after and been driven by the security features."
Reps. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) and John Katko (R., N.Y.) reintroduced legislation this year that would require the agency to place Ms. Tubman's image on the $20 bill.

Facebook's Libra: Money on its mind

Texto completo: Would you trust Facebook with your money?
On Tuesday, Facebook confirmed it would launch a digital global currency similar to Bitcoin, called Libra, aimed at users around the world who don't have bank accounts.
But there's another reason Facebook is introducing Libra, said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter: It's an opportunity to get some of its more than 2 billion users to shop through the platform.
"Facebook is merely trying to facilitate commercial activity for its customers, and the endgame is to offer links to brands they care about," he said.
The currency is managed by the Libra network, co-founded by several companies in both the payments and tech industries, including Facebook, eBay, Uber, Lyft, PayPal and Visa.
"Moving money around the world should be as easy and cheap as sending a text message," reads a description on Libra's website, noting more than 1.7 billion people worldwide don't have a bank account.
With Facebook's massive user base, even a small portion of that audience jumping to cryptocurrency gives Libra a boost, said Pachter. "Even 1% is 20 million people. That's enough," he said.
Facebook also introduced a digital wallet called Calibra, which is expected to launch on Messenger, WhatsApp and as a stand-alone app next year.
The wallet will initially allow users to send money to each other before eventually adding services such as "paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass," said Facebook in a statement.
Screenshots of the app provided by Facebook show balances both in the Libra currency and converted to U.S. dollars. Facebook said the value of Libra will be pegged to a basket of established currencies such as the U.S. dollar, the euro and the yen.
Easier to buy?
Avivah Litan, distinguished research vice president for Gartner, says Libra could offer a more attractive option for Facebook users who want to shop but don't want to enter a credit card number. "Basically, it's going to be a lot easier to buy things within ads now, as long as you sign up for it," she said.
In its statement, Facebook said it will use "strong protections" to keep users' information and money safe. "We'll be using all the same verification and anti-fraud processes that banks and credit cards use, and we'll have automated systems that will proactively monitor activity to detect and prevent fraudulent behavior," said the company.
Privacy concerns
However, Libra could magnify privacy issues such as its stewardship over user data that have landed Facebook in hot water. Last month, a co-founder of Facebook wrote a New York Times op-ed calling for a breakup of the tech giant, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said would make its effort to resolve privacy issues more difficult.
Meanwhile, Litan said people concerned with Facebook's response to privacy issues likely have left the platform, while the users who stay and decide to use Libra will give up even more data.
Trust
Another concern, according to Litan: fake ads. Lawmakers have grilled Facebook over fake Russian ads used to sow discord during the 2016 presidential elections. Litan says Facebook still has work to do to clean up bad ads on its platform. "The cryptocurrency will just magnify that issue," said Litan. "But now you could lose your money."

Texto completo: The good news for Elizabeth Warren, judging from the latest polls, is that she's closed the gap with Bernie Sanders and gained ground on Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential race. The bad news is that she could become 2020's Adlai Stevenson.
Stevenson was the Illinois governor and future diplomat who became the Democratic nominee for president in 1952 and 1956, only to lose both elections to Dwight Eisenhower. The story goes that a supporter once approached him at a campaign rally and gushed, "Governor, every thinking person would be voting for you."
Stevenson replied, "Madam, that is not enough. I need a majority."
Ms. Warren, the Harvard law professor turned U.S. senator, is shaping up to be the liberal smart set's candidate, at least in the early going. Not long ago, Democrats were fussing over the wisdom of even nominating another woman to face Donald Trump given Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016. Neera Tanden, a left-wing activist and former Clinton policy adviser, told the New York Times in January that there was "real tension" among Democrats who believe that sexism cost Mrs. Clinton the election. "On one hand, women are leading the resistance and deserve representation. But on the other side, there's a fear that if misogyny beat Clinton, it can beat other women."
The Warren boomlet might mean those concerns have ebbed, particularly among liberal elites. Left-wing publications like the New Yorker, Slate and Vox have run glowing profiles in recent weeks. The senator is invariably described as a well-spoken, energetic campaigner who has done her homework and knows her stuff. She has released detailed policy proposals on everything from tackling the opioid crisis to easing student debt to breaking up big tech. Her prescriptions overlap heavily with those of Mr. Sanders and other progressive candidates, but she has rejected the socialist label that Mr. Sanders embraces.
Like Adlai Stevenson, however, Elizabeth Warren still needs a majority, and for a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, that likely means winning a sizable share of minorities and working-class whites. During an interview on a nationally syndicated radio show with a large black audience, Ms. Warren learned the hard way that extending her appeal to minorities in particular will be a challenge.
The candidate showed up ready to talk about reparations, housing discrimination and more funding for historically black colleges. Her host wanted to talk about why she spent her adult life passing for Native American and whether selectively claiming Cherokee ancestry helped advance her career. "You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal," said the interviewer, referring to the Washington state woman who claimed to be black but was outed as white by her parents a few years ago and forced to resign as head of the Spokane NAACP chapter. Apparently, Mr. Trump isn't the only person who doesn't buy Ms. Warren's explanations and won't let the matter go.
An even more pressing question for Ms. Warren and the other progressives in the race concerns the efficacy of their strategy. Will mobilizing minorities and college-educated whites be enough to win back the White House? Writing in the Atlantic earlier this month, Ron Brownstein cited census data showing that the "long-term erosion of blue-collar whites as a share of the national vote is unmistakable and irreversible." Nevertheless, "those white voters are disproportionately represented in the pivotal Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin."
Joe Biden seems to understand that blue-collar white voters are a diminishing demographic, but like the president he also apparently believes they could decide the next election. Judging from his lead in the polls, which remains substantial, Mr. Biden's strategy is still winning the day among a critical mass of Democratic voters who are more interested in defeating Mr. Trump than in nominating a politically correct candidate.
Mr. Biden also seems to have a better read than his rivals on public sentiment toward Mr. Trump. He appears to understand that the president's relatively low job-approval numbers don't necessarily translate into public support for pie-in-the-sky progressivism. Just because most Americans disapprove of how the president comports himself doesn't mean they've signed on to free college, 70% marginal tax rates, felon voting, phasing out gas-powered cars, and impeachment.
Some of those now warming to Elizabeth Warren like her economic populism. Others have tired of Mr. Sanders's socialist shtick or won't forgive him for not dropping out sooner in 2016 to clear the path for Mrs. Clinton. Either way, if Democrats are counting on elites to get them across the finish line next year, they're likely to be disappointed.

Texto completo: What's on TV
YELLOWSTONE 10 p.m. on Paramount Network. Kevin Costner plays the patriarch of a wealthy family that lives on a chunk of sought-after land in this series, a modern-day western from the writer-director Taylor Sheridan. The first season was marked by great, sweeping shots of Montana and Utah, where the show is filmed -- not that there was much time to admire the scenery. The series is full of backstabbing and conflict, as competing interests vie for the land, and disputes erupt in the family itself. In his review of Season 1 in The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that the show "has a few interesting things buried within." "But," he continued, "you need to dig through a lot of drab, hard-packed filler to get to them." Perhaps the second season will shift that balance.
RIVERS OF LIFE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). If "Yellowstone" has too much interpersonal conflict and not enough serene natural beauty for you, try this three-part documentary series from PBS and the BBC. Each episode focuses on a different river. Tonight's is about the Nile; others are about the Mississippi and the Amazon. The series discusses both the rivers themselves and the people and animals who live in various levels of harmony (or dissonance) with them.
What's Streaming
KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF (1991) Stream on Le Cinéma Club. The free, arty streaming website Le Cinéma Club is back with this rare, early short from the director Claire Denis. Sophie Simon plays a Frenchwoman who travels to New York to meet her lover, only to find that he's skipped town. It's an early example not only of Denis's filmmaking but also of her collaborations with the cinematographer Agnès Godard, who shot this film in black and white. The critic Richard Brody wrote in a recent article in The New Yorker that the movie "is no mere rarity but also a major cinematic treasure rescued from oblivion and now available to all."
SHAFT (1971) Stream on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The new "Shaft" sequel, currently in theaters, might not be driving audiences to buy as many tickets as Warner Bros. would like. But this original film became a defining '70s movie -- and a box office titan -- when it hit theaters. The wah-wah of Isaac Hayes's classic "Theme From Shaft" can be heard in its natural habitat here, as the detective John Shaft (Richard Roundtree) traipses down the streets of New York and into the American cultural consciousness. "Not a day goes by that I'm not somewhere when someone recites the lines from the theme song, or lines from the film, as if I've never heard them before," Roundtree said in a recent interview with The Times. "I'm like, 'Yeah, man. Cool. O.K."'

Texto completo: Weighing short-term rental effect on
Santa Fe housing crunch, June 15
" Airbnb units should be owned by Santa Fe residents, not out-of-state people who bought property specifically to use for short-term rentals. The owners should be limited to one home only. A routine follow up should be done, making it easier to check on tax payment, and also to reconfirm with neighbors if an Airbnb is wanted in the neighborhood. The increase number of short-term rentals has definitely resulted in the shortage of long-term housing rental availability." B.D-O.
" I read the story more thoroughly and really there is nothing new here. To say that short-term rentals only occur near downtown is not true. And to think that only tourists stayed in these neighborhoods is also not true. Workers in the hospitality industry used to be able to live in downtown and in these neighborhoods." S.B.
" There's an [article] in today's New York Times on the Minneapolis experiment to replace single-family zoning with multiunit housing. It's made the city much more attractive and affordable to young professionals and revitalized a number of neighborhoods. Worth a read." S.M.
Fort Sill: A holding place then and now, June 13
" There is no good place for young illegal immigrants. Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, California. ... They should not be here." J.T.
" As good a place as any. Enjoy!" C.F.
" Beyond troubling us, it should inspire us to massive action. Not in my name." A.L.V.
" Don't come to the U.S. illegally." B.C.
" In a 'companion' story, in your own publication, is a statement to the effect that Fort Sill was utilized as a detention facility for unaccompanied minors during the Obama administration. Would you please reprint your editorial of 'outrage' over that incident? Or, perhaps there is no editorial to reprint." S.A.C.
" Any military installation has limited access: That is the reason behind using military sites. This administration hates having inspectors, politicians and faith NGOs having their inhumane treatment publicly revealed." V.Y.C.

'Modern Love Live' brings reflections on mortality, platonic love, and emergency room visits

Texto completo: PROVINCETOWN — When actor-director Hannah Pearl Utt first read  Katherine Friedman Holland 's 2006 essay “Live Without Me. I'll Understand," she started to cry.
Holland recounts a near-death experience on a plane to Mexico with her husband of six months, and the trauma that lingered for weeks after Holland survived.
So Utt kept tissues at hand when she got up onstage in the Provincetown Town Hall on Friday evening to read the essay out loud in front of nearly 100 guests as part of “Modern Love Live," a joint production of WBUR and The New York Times.
It was a reflective pause in a sunny weekend of celebrity mingling, open bars, and film screenings at the 21st annual Provincetown International Film Festival, which opened June 12 and closed Sunday.
Host Meghna Chakrabarti moderated the hourlong event, which featured Utt, actor-turned-director Matt Kane, and John Cameron Mitchell performing live readings of reader-submitted essays from the Times's popular column Modern Love. Audience members sitting on wooden seats laughed, and some dabbed away tears.
Friday marked the second time “Modern Love Live" partnered with the Provincetown festival to bring the live podcast to the Cape. Last year, actor Chloë Grace Moretz performed.
Kane read Brian Gittis's 2014 essay “At the Hospital, an Interlude of Clarity," the comical, poignant tale of a first date that ends in an overnight emergency room visit.
Mitchell (“Hedwig and the Angry Inch," “Shortbus") read Ephi Stempler's 2016 essay “Platonic, Until Death Do Us Part," about a gay man and his live-in, straight best female friend — a PLP, or “platonic life partner."
Sound designer Matt Reed mixed the actors' voices with sounds that evoked the narratives, like the tinkle of a wine glass on a first date, or the mechanical creaks of a plane in a deep dive to the ground.
Two Provincetown natives, guitarist Peter Ciluzzi and singer and tenor recorder player Roxanne Layton , provided live music between readings to set the mood, including a soulful cover of George Gershwin's “Summertime."
At a garden party the next day, Utt said that her essay selection spoke to her. “The proximity of death is something [the essay] captures really well," Utt said. “And I felt like it was kind of a beautiful metaphor for depression — living in that in between place, where you're like, 'I'm not dead, but I'm not alive.' "
Utt also attended the festival this year with her directorial debut film, “Before You Know It," starring herself, Jen Tullock, and Judith Light . The film closed the festival on Sunday night.
Kane's first feature film “Auggie" (2018) made its New England premiere at the festival. The movie tells the fictional story of a lonely retiree who discovers companionship in Auggie, a virtual-reality character similar to Siri.
Mitchell was awarded the 2019 Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the festival on Saturday.

Riviera’s computer crippling a hack heard ’round the world

Texto completo: The malware attack that has paralyzed the city government of Riviera Beach may have its roots in international espionage.
On May 29, somebody in the city’s police department opened an email that initiated a virus that shut down the city’s computer network. Since then, the city has had to function with handwritten documents and pre-internet communications, as it looks to the purchase of 310 new desktop and 90 laptop computers as the best fix for its computer-bug infestation.
The source of this $1 million cyberattack on Riviera Beach hasn’t been disclosed by tight-lipped city officials.
“We have not discussed the details of what’s going on,” said city spokeswoman Rose Anne Brown. “We feel it’s expedient not to do that until we worked our way through this.”
What’s happening with Riviera Beach isn’t an isolated incident. Other American cities have experienced similar system-wide and mysterious cyberattacks during the last two years.
It cost the city of Allentown, Pa., more than $1.2 million to recover from a similar malware attack. The government of San Antonio, Texas, was attacked through a breach in a single computer in the basement of its county jail.
And more recently, the
FBI took over the investigation of a cyberattack on the city government of Greenville, N.C., that began on April 10. Three weeks later, a cyberattack on Baltimore’s city government took down its computers and disabled its 911 automatic dispatch system. That attack has already cost that city more than $18 million.
The recent attacks in those cities have been linked to a ransomware virus called “RobinHood.”
The attackers in Baltimore posted a bit-coin ransom demand that the city didn’t meet. The ransom message, obtained by The Baltimore Sun, was as follows:
“We’ve ( sic ) watching you for days and we’ve worked on your systems to gain full access to your company and bypass all your protections.”
“We won’t talk more, all we know is MONEY!. Hurry up! Tik Tak, Tik Tak, Tik Tak!”
Brown, the spokeswoman for Riviera Beach, declined to say whether city officials have had any contact with the attackers.
“I can’t confirm or deny that there has been a ransom demand,” Brown said.
These attacks trace back to a bit of reckless spycraft practiced by the National Security Agency (NSA), a national intelligence agency so secretive that the joke is its initials really stand for No Such Agency.
Years ago, NSA programmers discovered a flaw in Microsoft’s operating system, and they developed code that would allow their hackers to shut down any computer using this operating system.
Rather than inform Microsoft of this flaw, which could have been fixed by the company with a simple software update, the NSA decided to secretly exploit the system flaw for its own purposes.
The agency called the hacking code “EternalBlue,” which was short for “eternal blue screen”, which was what happened when a computer network was infected with the malware.
The NSA had sole use of EternalBlue for a few years, but then a shadowy online organization that calls itself “The Shadow Brokers” disclosed in 2017 what the NSA had done, and published online the hacking code for EternalBlue for anyone to see and use.
Microsoft issued software patches to close the exploit, but computers that continued to operate on the older, non-updated systems were still vulnerable.
Shortly after the public disclosure of EternalBlue, North Korea used the code to launch a worldwide cyberattack, which became known as WannaCry. It infected about 200,000 computers in 150 countries.
It temporarily crippled the National Health Service hospital computers in Great Britain, brought a temporary stop to European auto manufacturers assembly lines, and temporarily disabled state governments in India, Russian railways, and the Saudi Telecom Company.
The next EternalBlue attack was launched from Russia. And although it was aimed at Ukraine, the attack, which became known as NotPetya, spread globally. Among its victims was FedEx, with more than $400 million in costs, and the giant pharmaceutical company, Merck, with an estimated $670 million in costs.
This year’s RobinHood attacks are the latest iteration of the EternalBlue breach, The New York Times reported.
Cybersecurity expert Thomas Rid told the newspaper that NSA’s role in these breaches ought to be examined.
“The government has refused to take responsibility, or even to answer the most basic questions,” Rid told The New York Times. “Congressional oversight appears to be failing. The American people deserve an answer.”
Others have defended the NSA and focused the blame on local governments that haven’t taken the available safeguards to protect their data systems against breaches such as EternalBlue.
“Focusing on a single exploit, especially one that has a solution through a patch that was issued years ago, is really shortsighted,” the NSA’s top policy adviser Rob Joyce said at a cybersecurity conference last month. “Vulnerabilities will continue to be found. Doing the basics is required for responsible network administration.”

Texto completo: The good news for Elizabeth Warren, judging from the latest polls, is that she's closed the gap with Bernie Sanders and gained ground on Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential race. The bad news is that she could become 2020's Adlai Stevenson.
Stevenson was the Illinois governor and future diplomat who became the Democratic nominee for president in 1952 and 1956, only to lose both elections to Dwight Eisenhower. The story goes that a supporter once approached him at a campaign rally and gushed, "Governor, every thinking person would be voting for you."
Stevenson replied, "Madam, that is not enough. I need a majority."
Ms. Warren, the Harvard law professor turned U.S. senator, is shaping up to be the liberal smart set's candidate, at least in the early going. Not long ago, Democrats were fussing over the wisdom of even nominating another woman to face Donald Trump given Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016. Neera Tanden, a left-wing activist and former Clinton policy adviser, told the New York Times in January that there was "real tension" among Democrats who believe that sexism cost Mrs. Clinton the election. "On one hand, women are leading the resistance and deserve representation. But on the other side, there's a fear that if misogyny beat Clinton, it can beat other women."
The Warren boomlet might mean those concerns have ebbed, particularly among liberal elites. Left-wing publications like the New Yorker, Slate and Vox have run glowing profiles in recent weeks. The senator is invariably described as a well-spoken, energetic campaigner who has done her homework and knows her stuff. She has released detailed policy proposals on everything from tackling the opioid crisis to easing student debt to breaking up big tech. Her prescriptions overlap heavily with those of Mr. Sanders and other progressive candidates, but she has rejected the socialist label that Mr. Sanders embraces.
Like Adlai Stevenson, however, Elizabeth Warren still needs a majority, and for a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, that likely means winning a sizable share of minorities and working-class whites. During an interview on a nationally syndicated radio show with a large black audience, Ms. Warren learned the hard way that extending her appeal to minorities in particular will be a challenge.
The candidate showed up ready to talk about reparations, housing discrimination and more funding for historically black colleges. Her host wanted to talk about why she spent her adult life passing for Native American and whether selectively claiming Cherokee ancestry helped advance her career. "You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal," said the interviewer, referring to the Washington state woman who claimed to be black but was outed as white by her parents a few years ago and forced to resign as head of the Spokane NAACP chapter. Apparently, Mr. Trump isn't the only person who doesn't buy Ms. Warren's explanations and won't let the matter go.
An even more pressing question for Ms. Warren and the other progressives in the race concerns the efficacy of their strategy. Will mobilizing minorities and college-educated whites be enough to win back the White House? Writing in the Atlantic earlier this month, Ron Brownstein cited census data showing that the "long-term erosion of blue-collar whites as a share of the national vote is unmistakable and irreversible." Nevertheless, "those white voters are disproportionately represented in the pivotal Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin."
Joe Biden seems to understand that blue-collar white voters are a diminishing demographic, but like the president he also apparently believes they could decide the next election. Judging from his lead in the polls, which remains substantial, Mr. Biden's strategy is still winning the day among a critical mass of Democratic voters who are more interested in defeating Mr. Trump than in nominating a politically correct candidate.
Mr. Biden also seems to have a better read than his rivals on public sentiment toward Mr. Trump. He appears to understand that the president's relatively low job-approval numbers don't necessarily translate into public support for pie-in-the-sky progressivism. Just because most Americans disapprove of how the president comports himself doesn't mean they've signed on to free college, 70% marginal tax rates, felon voting, phasing out gas-powered cars, and impeachment.
Some of those now warming to Elizabeth Warren like her economic populism. Others have tired of Mr. Sanders's socialist shtick or won't forgive him for not dropping out sooner in 2016 to clear the path for Mrs. Clinton. Either way, if Democrats are counting on elites to get them across the finish line next year, they're likely to be disappointed.

Texto completo: ASPEN, Colorado — Aperol spritzes are most definitely back on the menu, because if Martha Stewart says it, it must be so.
Speaking to hundreds of eager fans who paid nearly $2,000 per ticket at the world's fanciest food festival this weekend, Stewart shared her favorite Aperol spritz recipe and took issue with a May 9 New York Times article calling it "not a good drink. "
Said Stewart, in a way that declared the matter closed: “I like it. ” The audience erupted into applause as she took another sip of the sparkling orange cocktail that's a favorite of Instagrammers everywhere.
In between shout-outs for her ice-ball maker, her wine club and her most recent cookbook, Stewart headlined a sprawling cast of celebrity chefs, winemakers, distillers and celebrities who descended on this picturesque mountain town for the annual Food & Wine Classic.
After telling a series of stories that had the audience roaring with laughter, and accidentally advising guests to use a Cuisinart food processor instead of event-sponsor KitchenAid, Stewart wondered aloud if her first festival would be her last: "I hope they invite me back," she said with a smile.
Other high-profile guests included "Top Chef" Season 16 hosts and contestants, including winner Kelsey Barnard Clark of the restaurant Eat KBC in Dothan, Alabama; and chefs from Ming Tsai to Rick Bayless to Andrew Zimmern.
Instagram-famous people were everywhere, eating sustainable seafood lunches with Zimmern, posing with a keg-size bottle of wine or sweating off their excesses with yoga classes. Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom were spotted several times, and invites to late-night parties with unlimited drinks and food were the currency of the weekend.
Capping off the extravagance was wine educator and author Mark Oldman, who hosted a pair of tastings in which participants each tried the equivalent of $14,000 in wine, had they bought the bottles themselves. Dubbed "Wines for Quadrillionaires," Oldman drew inspiration from wines served aboard the Concorde and showed up in a custom-made pilot's uniform, holding court with a champagne saber.
And while guests at Oldman's tasting tried a variety of once-in-a-lifetime wines, it was his 300-glass bottle of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2014 CASK 23 cabernet sauvignon (worth $13,000) that stole the show – and had guests posing for photos.
The Heritage Fire festival, also held annually the same weekend in nearby Snowmass, had chefs grilling meats, fish and veggies over open flames. The festival is separate from the Aspen events but draws many of the same guests.

Texto completo: Constable: Teen advocates for others as she waits for new lungs By Burt Constable Nineteen-year-old Maddi Bertrand of Glen Ellyn is a leading voice in a somber new video by The New York Times, which notes that 11,000 Americans will die this year while waiting for organ transplants. Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital will give Maddi a Hope and Courage award Wednesday for her wide range of contributions, including her advocacy efforts that helped lead to a change in the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21 in Illinois as of July 1.
She’s been raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation since she staged Maddi’s Marvelous Mayfair fundraiser at the age of 7. She’s successfully lobbied for smoke-free bike paths and parks. She never turns down a chance as a speaker to raise funds and awareness on behalf of people with cystic fibrosis.
"And I will for the rest of my life until a cure is found," Maddi says. Then she coughs a dozen times into a paper towel, grimaces, removes the oxygen tubes from her nose to blow into a tissue, and pauses for nearly a minute to give her body time to catch up. CF is a life-shortening, progressive, genetic disease that affects the pancreas and causes a thick mucus to form in the lungs.
"I’m definitely sicker than I was a month ago," she says. The attention and awards are nice, but what she really wants is a new set of lungs.
Born in Pennsylvania, one of the few states at the time that tested newborns for cystic fibrosis, Maddi got diagnosed and started treatment earlier than many CF patients, says her mother, Linda Bertrand.
"When I was in elementary school and middle school, I could do sports," Maddi says, noting that she even played the rough game of lacrosse. "Whenever I’d join a team, I’d get sick, end up in the hospital, and then the season would wind down."
She plays the flute and piano, did martial arts with her brother, and was healthy enough to be a section leader in the marching band and take on roles in a couple of plays during high school.
"I’ve gone from this tiny backpack to a tank because I’ve been needing more oxygen," says Maddi, whose senior photos featured one with the oxygen tubes and one without. She takes a couple dozen pills each day, and undergoes three or four daily lung treatments. In spite of missing weeks of school, she made it to prom and graduated from Glenbard West High School in 2018 with the rest of her class. On Feb. 2, 2018, she went on the lung transplant waiting list.
"She’s a very smart, determined and wonderful young woman," says Lisa Mulvaney, coordinator of the creative arts program at Lurie Children’s, and the person who recruited Maddi for the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board in 2013. "From Day One, she was really invested in this group of kids and about making the hospital even better. She never wants to miss a meeting."
Maddi dragged her oxygen tank onto a Metra train and ordered a ride service once she got into Chicago to make one board meeting. Because CF patients can get sick when near other CF patients, Maddi is the only representative of that disease on the board, which has members from age 12 to 19.
"She really displays such hope and such courage," Mulvaney says. "She wants to give as much as she can."
As a freshman in high school, Maddie became the first CF patient to complete the Xtreme Hike: a one-day, 21-mile hike with her mom through the hills of the Manistee National Forest in Michigan. Maddi has helped host three proms for the inpatients at Lurie Children’s. She attended the first International Children’s Advisory Network summit in Washington, D.C. Her mother recalls how Maddi didn’t get a chance to meet with then-U. S. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. "But I recognized his wheelchair at the airport," says Maddi, who walked up, introduced herself, and had a nice chat about the importance of funding research for CF and other diseases that affect children.
The New York Times video featuring Maddi was produced by Kendall Ciesemier, an original member of the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board from Wheaton, and a member of the 2010-11 Daily Herald Leadership Team. At age 11, Ciesemier founded Kids Caring 4 Kids, which helps children in Africa impacted by AIDS. Her work was recognized by then-President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. Born with a rare liver disorder, Ciesemier was the recipient of two liver transplants.
"I want people to know that donating organs is so important and that I wouldn’t be alive without the generosity of a stranger," Ciesemier says via email. "I take the gift that someone gave me very seriously and I focus a lot on paying it forward. … I like to believe that I can give people hope."
Maddi says she maintains her hope.
"Of course, I want new lungs, but I’ll wait as long as it takes. I’m happy," says Maddi, who notes the transplant wait is tricky. "I have to be really sick to be at the top of the list, but I have to be healthy enough for the surgery. This is so crazy."
She gets support from her brother Zach, 16, and sisters Grace, 13, and Gabbi, 11, but Maddi says her strength comes from her Christian faith. "God’s in control," she says. "Whenever I’m down and don’t know if I can do this, I lean on God. I know He will get me the right pair of lungs."
She’s learning to play a new religious song on the piano, with the lyric, "I will fight for you." Transplanted lungs would be free of CF, but recovery from the surgery can be grueling, and requires lifelong medications and care. Imagining her life with new lungs and the ability to breathe, Maddi sees herself going to college and becoming a trainer who works with dolphins at Clearwater Marine Aquarium, the Florida not-for-profit whose care of sick and injured marine animals was made into two "Dolphin Tale" movies. Anchored close to home while she waits for her transplant, Maddi also dreams of traveling to Florida, New York, Hawaii and California, and doing some of those things that CF denied her.
"When I get these new lungs," Maddi says, breaking into a sly grin, "I want to live a little first."

America squandering its power through foreign policy abuses

Texto completo: Last week we watched an unusual spectacle. The foreign minister of Germany, one of the United States’ closest allies, went to Tehran and announced that a European payment system, designed as an alternative to the dollar-based one, would soon be ready. This visit was made in coordination with Britain and France, both of which helped create the new payment mechanism, called INSTEX.
INSTEX will probably fail or prove to be wholly inadequate in the short term. The dollar’s dominance in global transactions — which has been a huge benefit for America — will be hard to displace, but INSTEX is a warning sign, the canary in the coal mine. America’s closest allies are working hard to chip away at a crucial underpinning of U.S. global power.
Why? It’s simple: the Trump administration’s abuse of this power. The United States sits atop the world for now, but there are forces eroding that lofty status. Some of these are deep structural shifts, like the rise of China. But as The Economist points out, others are reactions to a pattern of hegemonic abuse.
Consider the trigger for this search for an alternative to the dollar. Britain, France and Germany are all signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. When the Trump administration unilaterally reneged on the pact last year — even though Iran had abided by it — the U.S. reimposed sanctions, using its dollar power to prevent other countries from doing business with Iran (since most international transactions use the dollar for convenience). Furious at this misuse of authority, the Europeans have set about trying to create a new payment system.
They are not the only ones. The Chinese, Russian and Indians have also been trying to create mechanisms that would allow them to escape the hegemony of the dollar. So far, these efforts have been largely ineffective. But if so many major trading nations, including key European ones, set out to subvert the dollar, they will eventually have some impact. Once upon a time, the British pound was the dominant international currency, but it was supplanted by the dollar. There is no iron law that says the dollar will be king forever.
Or look at the way the Trump administration has been wielding the threat of tariffs. In many cases, the administration has invoked a "national security" concerns. The law that allows the president to levy such tariffs was passed during the Cold War to enable the country to preserve critical industries that might be needed to sustain the geopolitical contest with the Soviet Union. Canadian aluminum and Japanese-made SUVs don’t fit the bill, even if Trump thinks otherwise. As Jennifer Hillman, the former general counsel to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, wrote recently in The New York Times: "If the United States can justify tariffs on cars as a threat to national security, then every country in the world can most likely justify restrictions on almost any product under a similar claim."
The United States has legitimate complaints about China’s trade practices. Beijing will often follow the letter of the law but find clever ways to undermine its spirit through loopholes and exceptions. But that is precisely what the Trump administration is itself doing. By misusing the national security exemption, it is weakening the very trade rules and international laws that it is asking China to follow. If I were a Chinese negotiator, I would simply explain that I would follow trade rules just as much as Donald Trump does.
Or consider Trump’s efforts to crush Chinese tech behemoth Huawei. So far, very few countries have followed America’s ban, but almost all are surely noting that if they remain reliant on crucial American technologies, Washington could suddenly cripple them on a whim. The result will be a greater desire for technological self-reliance and a shift away from American companies.
America still occupies a unique position in the world. But it is clear that we are moving into an era in which more players will have more power. Twenty years ago, China accounted for 3% of global GDP; today its share is 15% and rising. In such a period, it is all the more important that Washington act with restraint, use international institutions and try to establish consensus.
The administration is acting to achieve some short-term gains in limited transactions with other countries. But by abusing its power to do so, it is putting at risk the structure of the international system in which American power is so deeply embedded. It is a bad trade and one for which all Americans will pay the price in decades to come.

Texto completo: Emelia Preston Dillon and Harry Stone Fishbein were married June 15 at Ohana Family Camp in Post Mills, Vt. Jonathan E. Bos, a Universal Life minister who is a cousin of the bride, led a ceremony incorporating Jewish traditions.
Ms. Dillon, 29, who goes by Emma, is a senior strategist at Mission Control, a Democratic political consulting firm in Washington. She graduated magna cum laude from Tufts.
She is the daughter of Julia D. Preston and Sam Dillon, both of Hoboken, N.J. The bride's father is an immigration lawyer practicing in Jersey City. Her mother is a journalist and contributing writer covering immigration at the Marshall Project in Manhattan, a nonprofit news organization covering issues concerning the United States criminal justice system. Her parents were also members of the New York Times staff -- her mother until 2016 and her father until 2011. From 1995 to 2001 they were correspondents in Mexico, and part of the team that won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for a series on drug corruption in Mexico. They are the authors of "Opening Mexico: The Making of a Democracy" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2004).
Mr. Fishbein, also 29, is the construction quality control manager on the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge Project in Washington. He graduated from Lafayette College.

Texto completo: This simple wisdom — “Fans don’t boo nobodies” — is courtesy the pinstriped philosopher Reggie Jackson, and it resonates for anyone who has ever been in the public sphere.
Put yourself out there and the cranks crank it up. In the end, they’re still cranks.
When you are being noticed, it’s because you have become a cause for concern, for somebody.
So that’s how I realized early this month that the formerly minor character known as Mayor Pete has become a serious cause for concern for the Republican National Committee as it continues its unethical quest to re-elect the president.
How did I realize this? Because the RNC told me so.
On June 3, its Christiana Purves sent me an email: “Good evening — With less than a month to go before the first 2020 Democrat Presidential debate, we’re still only scratching the surface of truly learning about lesser-vetted candidates like Pete Buttigieg. Unfortunately for Mayor Pete, the more we learn, Californians are more likely to see that he was a lousy Mayor who’s struggling to keep up with the pace of presidential politics.”
Then Purves goes on to cite an odd selection of stories from what the Grand Old Party on a normal day, when it didn’t suit its needs, would term the lamestream media.
“‘I ain’t ever seen the dude’ — Residents of South Bend’s poor neighborhoods say Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg left them behind,” the RNC quotes CNBC as saying. Oh, how the GOP is in touch with America’s troubled urban youth. And then: “Buttigieg is only top 2020 presidential candidate not offering staffers health care yet.” Ha ha ha. The former deputy press secretary for Trump buddy Sen. Lindsey Graham concerned a Democratic longshot is not yet being able to afford benefits for his ragtag staff? Ha ha ha.
But with the RNC concerned enough about the guy to start doing a lot of opposition research and sending it out to members of the press, maybe he’s not such a longshot, what?
I have by no means figured out who stands the best chance of preventing the global disaster that would be a second term for this president. No one has stood out in particular from the clearly too many candidates clogging the opposition field. Too bad a gutsy moderate Republican won’t come forward to take advantage of the ridiculously tainted incumbent.
The latest poll of California Democratic voters goes: Biden 22, Sanders 17, Harris 13, Warren 18, Buttigieg 10, O’Rourke 3.
So, only 10 percent of California’s Democratic voters right now say Buttigieg is their main man. Or, to look at it another way, a guy who otherwise just leads the fourth-largest city in Indiana is in fifth place among voters in the nation’s largest state. And this sudden GOP attention would lead us to believe that’s fifth place with a bullet. Harvard and Oxford graduate, former Navy Reserve lieutenant who served in Afghanistan — nice resume. Oh, and he’s gay. And he’s getting noticed — pollsters say awareness of Buttigieg shot up from 4% to 48% in the last six months.
Still actually a stretch, though. The problematical guy who is for some reason not a longshot, Joe Biden, is the frontrunner who is really giving the incumbent conniption fits. The president’s own campaign pollster came to him with numbers from a 17-state survey showing Trump losing to Biden in states that he needs to win, including Texas (sweet!), Michigan and Pennsylvania. After seeing the polls, the president told aides to deny them, Annie Karmin reports in The New York Times.
Biden is “Sleepy Joe” to Trump.
What’s he gonna call Buttigieg when the going gets rough on down the road?

Texto completo: The two New Jersey tax incentive programs at the heart of multiple investigations may be extended before their June 30 deadlines, as two Assembly committees voted Thursday to keep the programs alive until some point in 2020.
Meanwhile, thousands of union members and activists rallied outside the Statehouse in favor of a millionaire tax and against Senate President Stephen Sweeney's proposed changes to public pensions and health care.
Two tax credits meant to spur development and create and keep jobs in the state, GrowNJ and the Economic Redevelopment & Growth (ERG) programs, are set to end at the end of the month, around the same time when the Legislature and governor must agree on a budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
The Assembly Commerce and Economic Development committee and the Appropriations committee considered a bill that would push the deadline from June 30, 2019 to Jan. 31, 2020, proposed by Budget Chair Eliana Pintor Marin, D-Essex. The commerce committee also discussed a bill to change GrowNJ requirements.
Only invited individuals from unions, trade associations and nonprofits were allowed to speak at the commerce hearing in order to make sure the bill can be handed off on time for the appropriations committee to consider. If members of the public want to weigh in, they have to submit comments in writing, said Kevin McArdle, spokesman for the Assembly Democrats.
Activists with the group Working Families, a group critical of the tax incentives, interrupted the start of the hearing by placing seven cardboard boxes on the witness desk to submit as public testimony in protest.
The boxes contained more than 50,000 pages of emails between a lawyers at Parker McCay and officials at the Economic Development Authority. The New York Times, ProPublica and WNYC reported that an attorney with Parker McCay named Kevin Sheehan suggested language into late drafts of the legislation that created the tax incentives and frequently communicated with members of the Economic Development Authority, which issues the credits, as the bill was being written.
"These emails are a representation of unregistered lobbying between a politically connected corporation and until every single one of these emails have been reviewed by this committee, this law should not be extended," said Sue Altman, head of Working Families. "It is unprecedented that today there is no public testimony."
The invited speakers included Brandon McKoy, the president of the left-leaning NJ Policy Perspective, Megan Chambers of the union SEIU 32BJ, and members of the business community, including Michael McGuinness and Anthony Pizzutillo of the real estate nonprofit NAIOP-NJ, Andrew Musick of the NJ Business & Industry Association, Michael Egenton of the NJ State Chamber of Commerce and Christina Renna of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey.
Gov. Phil Murphy has introduced his own set of five new incentives late last year that would cap awards for job creation and development, and said last week he would not "simply renew a set of incentive programs when serious questions exist about whether they have been successful."
"Extending bad legislation is not the way to attract business to our state. While the deadline is fast approaching, we believe there is still time to work with the Legislature to pass comprehensive tax incentive reform before the current programs expire," Murphy said in a statement.
Members of the New Jersey business community said it would be unwise to make hasty changes or let the programs timing run out.
"Recognizing that the current programs took approximately 18 months to effectuate, we cannot create a new, more effective, functioning program within the next two weeks," said Michael Egenton, executive vice president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. "Nor can we allow for the current ones to expire. A state that lets its economic growth incentives lapse signals that it is 'out of business.'"
The commerce committee members unanimously voted the tax credit extension deadline out of committee, but many said they were doing so because they had no other option.
"Even though my name is on the extension bill, I'm disappointed that we're here," said Assemblyman Roy Freiman, D-Somerset, a sponsor of the bill. "We should have vetted through the governor's proposal. That said, [extending the programs] is the lesser of all evils."
The bill now heads to Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin to consider.
The Economic Development Authority tax break programs are the subject of multiple investigations, including by a state grand jury, both Assembly houses, and an independent task force hired by the governor. Murphy ordered the inquiry after a blistering comptroller's report suggested the agency didn't have processes in place to confirm companies were creating the jobs they promised in exchange for credits.
The task force raised questions about whether companies provided misleading information on applications to the state. Insurance broker George Norcross and companies connected to him that received tax breaks sued Murphy and the task force, claiming they had been falsely accused of misconduct and not given the opportunity to respond. In the midst of the suit, the task force postponed its final public meeting and the release of its findings.
Unions rally for millionaire tax As lawmakers moved forward legislation to keep the business tax incentives alive, union members rallied to pass a millionaire tax in this year's budget, a policy Murphy is pushing but Legislative leaders refuse to include. The protest was organized by the largest public workers union in the state, the Communication Workers of America, which also criticizes Sweeney's "Path to Progress" plan, a set of 27 bills that would change public health benefits and pension plans.
In a sea of protesters, most wearing red, 4-year-old Eva Slovinski stood out. Donning a red tutu, she hefted a sign reading: "I'd rather be playing but mommy can't afford a babysitter."
Her mother, Niki Slovinski, has taught high school in Franklin Lakes for 17 years. "When I started teaching we paid nothing into health benefits," Niki Slovinski said. Over time that's increased to more than $500 a paycheck, she said, a burden for her as the sole income-earner in her family.
"Teaching is turning into a dead end profession," she added. She worries pension reform proposed by Sweeney would dip even further into her earnings. "I worry about my pension," she said. "Since my pension is already underfunded, I worry by the time I retire maybe there won't be people paying into it so I can retire."

Texto completo: FAIRFIELD — Bestselling author Jennifer Weiner will return to her home state Friday to promote her new book, “Mrs. Everything,” at the Fairfield Public library.
The novel — her 13th — travels back to the 1950s to tell the story of two sisters and their very different journeys into adult and womanhood.
Though growing up Jo was the rebel tomboy and Bethie the traditional good girl, their roles ultimately switch. Bethie becomes an adventure-loving city girl in Detroit while Jo settles down in Connecticut to raise a family.
The Connecticut setting has everything to do with the author’s upbringing in Simsbury.
“I felt out of place and wished I lived in a city,” she said. “I was desperately unhappy in the way that all teens are desperately unhappy.”
This might have had something to do with the turmoil she endured in her home life. When Weiner was 15 years old, her parents got divorced.
Looking back, though, the adversity which she faced in the town was something that she said she needed.
“You need to see the world as it is to see what you want it to be; that’s Simsbury,” the author said.
Though “Mrs. Everything” explores the lives of two sisters both searching for meaning and happiness, it is written as a tribute to all women, especially Weiner’s mother, whose own life and love story served as inspiration for one of the characters.
“Over the years, as I’ve become a mother myself, I thought more about women in America of my mother’s generation and what it must have been like to come of age at a totally different time,” she said.
Weiner had been thinking for a while about writing a novel that required a large amount of historical research, she said, but after the 2016 presidential election and the development of the #MeToo movement, the topic of women in society started to feel more urgent to her.
“Given the times, I want readers to think about choices women make and choices they can’t make and the freedoms they have and the freedoms they don’t have ... I want readers to ask ‘Have we come far enough?’” Weiner said.
As someone who portrays the female narrative in her books and in op-eds for the New York Times, Weiner has always used her platform as an author to promote feminism, both in the book world and the real world.
Although she joked about finally crossing the divide from “chick lit” to women’s fiction, Weiner said she hopes that, one day, coming-of-age stories about women will not have to be distinguished from those about men.
“Someday I hope women’s fiction is just going to be fiction,” she said
But she knows that progress is neither linear nor certain. With her work, she said she hopes to continue to move the needle forward.
“There are a lot of stories to be told and there are a lot of women who don’t see themselves in stories,” she said. “I hope, as my career goes on, I can find more of those stories and tell them.”
Jennifer Weiner will be on hand for the release of “Mrs. Everything” from noon to 2 p.m. Friday at the Fairfield Public library. Tickets are $40 per person and reservations are required. For more information, visit the library’s website.

Texto completo: A picture, we all know, is worth a thousand words. But which thousand is often up to the individual viewer.
This can be especially true when it comes to editorial cartoons. As a form of expression, a single cartoon panel can have a unique power to make a viewer laugh in agreement or growl with displeasure. Interestingly, the reaction is immediate — a chuckle, a guffaw, a pounding of the fist on the table — but the effect, at least in the best of cases, is long-lasting, as the viewer naturally is induced to reflect on the meaning and intent of a particular issue’s visual portrayal.
Unfortunately, though, nuance is not usually the editorial cartoonist’s stock in trade, so in many, if not most, cases, an individual cartoon must be examined very narrowly, and in some cases, a lack of depth can leave a cartoon open to vastly different interpretations.
All this makes selecting editorial cartoons for publication an imprecise art, no pun intended, for newspapers like the Daily Herald that value presentation of diverse points of view on their Opinion pages. And it can lead to considerable controversy when readers are stung by an artist’s portrayal that they find offensive, wildly exaggerated or simply wrong.
We at the Daily Herald address this challenge by striving to present a wide range of points of view in the editorial cartoons we publish from day to day. The New York Times has decided to deal with it by ending publication of editorial cartoons altogether in its international editions.
The Times’ decision followed an outcry over an April cartoon that lampooned President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Many critics found the image overtly anti-Semitic. The Times later agreed and apologized.
The artist, it’s worth noting, insisted that he did not mean to promote anti-Semitism but just wanted to make a statement about what he saw as President Trump’s blind loyalty to the Israeli leader. He is finding — as legions of Twitter and social media commentators also learn from time to time — that the inherent power of an arresting image or clever phrase can be abused by clumsy presentation.
The Times has never been particularly fond of editorial cartoons and had already ceased publication of them in its domestic editions. In a blog reacting to his newspaper’s decision to cease publishing traditional editorial cartoons in all its editions, Times cartoonist Patrick Chappatte, who did not draw the offending panel, described cartoons as "visual shortcut(s) with an unmatched capacity to touch the mind" and said that quality is both "their strength, and their vulnerability." He lamented that we live in an age when "moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm" to intimidate publishers and commentators.
In short, combine a moralistic mob and a visual shortcut and you have a formula for trouble. Chappatte thinks the solution is "to stop being afraid of the angry mob," and I’m willing to side with him to a point. But I’ve also found that the degree of people’s objection to the "angry mob" often depends on which angry mob they’re a part of. So, I place my hope and faith in the willingness — even as grudging as it sometimes is — for citizens of a country that values free speech and a free press to, within certain broad boundaries, tolerate views and images they abhor as long as their own views can get a fair hearing.
Or, in the case of editorial cartoons, a fair viewing.
For our part at the Daily Herald, we’re constantly evaluating how we use editorial cartoons and how we select the ones we publish. Like Chappatte, we still think they have a unique capacity to compact a complex idea into an instantaneous picture, as long as we respect the sentiments and diversity of the readers transforming each image into those thousand words.

Texto completo: Editor's note: On Monday, the New York Times announced that it would no longer run editorial cartoons in its international edition. In a statement, editorial page editor James Bennet said the decision brings the international edition in line with the domestic one, which has not featured cartoons on its editorial page for decades and ceased printing them in its Sunday Review section a few years ago. But it also comes in the wake of a public apology by the Times in April for a cartoon that ran in the international edition that was widely condemned as being anti-Semitic. We cannot speak for the intentions of the cartoonist, António Moreira Antunes of Portugal, or for the thinking of the Hong Kong-based Times editor who chose to print it, but the image was clearly inappropriate and employed age-old anti-Semitic tropes.
Not many cartoonists are quibbling with the Times' decision to apologize for using that image, but they are highly critical of the paper's decision to do away with cartoons altogether.
"I'm afraid this is not just about cartoons, but about journalism and opinion in general," Patrick Chapatte, who until this week penned twice-weekly cartoons for the Times' international edition, wrote in a blog post. "We are in a world where moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm, falling upon newsrooms in an overwhelming blow. This requires immediate counter-measures by publishers, leaving no room for ponderation or meaningful discussions. Twitter is a place for furor, not debate. The most outraged voices tend to define the conversation, and the angry crowd follows in."
Editorial cartoons are live grenades. They are a powerful form of visual satire that can easily lead to outrage and backlash against those who publish them - but that is also what makes them such a potent form of journalism. When done well, they reduce issues to their essence and deliver a punch that other types of commentary can't match. It's no coincidence that editorial cartoonists are often persecuted for their work - or even killed, as was the case at Charlie Hebdo in 2015.
More important than the message of any individual cartoon, though, is what our embrace of this indigenous American art form says about us.
"When I travel around the world addressing audiences about satire and freedom of expression, nothing impresses listeners more than America's embrace of cartoons," says KAL, the longtime editorial cartoonist for The Sun and The Economist. "We can savage our leaders in caricature without danger of official reprisals. Unfortunately today in America the danger to cartooning comes not from angry tyrants before us but from our very own newspapers cutting our knees out from behind."

The Trump-Biden Smackdown; Trump's slurs pushed Cruz, Rubio and Bush off their games. Don't expect Biden to crack.

Texto completo: Standing on the White House lawn Tuesday on his way to Iowa, Donald Trump took questions from the press. Someone mentioned Joe Biden. Mr. Trump went zero to 60 in about 4.2 seconds: "He's a different guy," Mr. Trump said about the Democratic front-runner. "He looks different than he used to. He acts different than he used to. He's even slower than he used to be." Then came the punch line: "Joe Biden is a dummy."
Mr. Biden this week unveiled his own version of "dummy." It's one word: "Trump."
Most of his 20-odd Democratic opponents have more or less ignored Mr. Trump, as in Nancy Pelosi's "I'm done with him." Speaking in Iowa hours before the president's rally, Mr. Biden mentioned "Trump" more than 40 times. "He's got his tail between his legs," Mr. Biden said.
Ready for the Trump-Biden Smackdown? You'd better be, because U.S. politics' latest installment of mud wrestling could run nonstop the next 16 months if, as looks likely, Mr. Biden survives the Democratic presidential stampede.
When Mr. Trump developed his now-infamous tactic of name-calling and personal insult during the Republican primary debates in 2016, it rattled Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, pushing experienced politicians off their games. Don't expect Mr. Biden to crack, no matter how ugly the Trump barrage gets. In fact, it looks as if the Biden counterstrategy will be to invite Mr. Trump's ad hominem assaults.
Mr. Biden intends to turn Mr. Trump's signature pugnaciousness into a liability for the incumbent president. The former vice president's repeatedly made point is that Mr. Trump has diminished the presidential office in the public's eye. He'll goad Mr. Trump into hitting below the belt. Mr. Trump, a born brawler, will oblige.
The Biden camp assumes that every over-the-top Trump slur will drive a deeper wedge between the president and suburban women, the bloc of voters that defeated many incumbent House Republicans in the midterm elections. Sleepy Joe Biden plans to outfox the raging lion.
Deploying judo against an always-on-offense opponent like Donald Trump is a plausible strategy. But there's a problem, and it's a big one. The problem is Mr. Biden's party.
The rationale for Mr. Biden's late-septuagenarian candidacy is that he's the one who can win back the Trump base of blue-collar voters who abandoned Hillary Clinton. He represents the just-beat-Trump wing of the Democratic Party.
Opinion polls, though impossibly far from November 2020, have Mr. Biden ahead in the three states that put Mr. Trump in the White House—Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. One reality, though, isn't going to change in those states or anywhere else.
Conventional wisdom holds that Mrs. Clinton's candidacy was a personal failure. That's only part of it. It was also a cultural failure.
The "deplorables" weren't merely overlooked blue-collar families but in fact included millions of Americans of every class who saw themselves as alienated from a relentless progressive ethos of mandated political and cultural beliefs.
Joe Biden in his Iowa speech accused Mr. Trump of violating "our core values." Mr. Biden is trying to deflect attention from his own party's core values.
What, ultimately, does the rapid ascent of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez represent in the life of the modern Democratic Party? It represents something certain to rub millions the wrong way: an alliance of latte liberalism and the radical left.
Cosmopolitan elites aggregated in large urban Democratic strongholds have transformed policy issues like "the climate" into secular religious movements—what the New York Times this week called "environmental crises as a human-rights issue."
They're blandly oblivious to the burden these policies would impose in lost jobs and income on workers in deplorable carbon-related industries. Despite the startling working-class protests of France's "yellow vests" against Emmanuel Macron's gasoline taxes, most of the Democratic Party's presidential candidates couldn't sign up fast enough to the Green New Deal's sky-high costs and mandates.
As recently as the first Obama term, one could say that a core Democratic value was tolerance or "inclusion." That's gone. In just the two years of the party's progressive rise and demand for what it calls "transformational change," a dominant value has become aggressive intolerance of dissent, especially on controversial matters relating to identity, gender and, just this past week, abortion.
Mr. Biden's sudden reversal of his career-long support of the Hyde Amendment's ban on federal funding for abortions wasn't just a pander. It was a forced bow to the reality that there is no Democratic "center" or even an Obama party. Mr. Biden will spend the next year inexorably caving to the unforgiving alliance of upscale Google liberals and professional left-wing activists.
The Trumpian persona? That will persist. Less noticed is that Donald Trump has a catlike sense for the deep cultural unease this post-Obama coalition creates among many millions of voters. It is the one variable Mr. Biden won't be able to fix from now until Election Day.

Opinion: Any embarrassment over USWNT's lopsided win over Thailand belongs to FIFA

Texto completo: REIMS, France -- The U. S. women’s 13-0 rout of Thailand was a debacle.
FIFA, and the Thai federation, should be ashamed.
Never before has the women’s game been so competitive, with six or seven teams able to make a legitimate claim at winning this World Cup title. Ten of the the first 14 games were decided by two goals or less.
Yet the gap between the haves and the have-nots remains glaring, and there seems to be little incentive from the sport’s power brokers to change that.
Oh, they’ll talk a good game. Before the World Cup began last week, FIFA president Gianni Infantino crowed about the money FIFA is investing in the women’s game: $500 million!
When you read the fine print, however, you see that that money will be spread over four years. Between the senior level and youth programs. To support coaches, referees, leaderships and clubs. Do the math, and it’s actually a pittance for an organization that had revenues of $6. 4 billion from 2015-18.
And if FIFA doesn’t care, then why should the federations, particularly those in countries that don’t exactly prize women’s sports?
“I think expanding the last World Cup to 24 teams was great. Soon enough, I hope we expand to 32 and keep it at that number,” Alex Morgan said Tuesday night, after tying Michelle Akers’ World Cup record with five goals against Thailand.
“I hope that will incentivize federations to put more efforts into their women’s programs,” she added. “And I hope we continue to see the development of women’s programs within their respective federations around the world. ”
This has to be more than wishful thinking, though.
While no one expected Thailand to beat the Americans – the U. S. women are the No. 1-ranked team in the world and defending World Cup champions while Thailand is No. 34 – it should not be too much to ask for, if not a competitive then at least a respectable game.
The 13-0 drubbing was as far from that as it gets.
MORE WORLD CUP:
DEATH THREATS: Former USWNT player, announcer targeted for criticism
WAMBACH: Defends USWNT's 13 goals against Thailand
ARMOUR: Calling for (ridiculous) new rules in World Cup
EQUAL PAY: USWNT doesn't need President Trump's help
In addition to the lopsided score, the United States had a 75-25 edge in possession. The Americans took 39 shots compared with Thailand’s two, and had 10 corner kicks while Thailand had none.
“Playing the United States is not easy and we know that we have to improve in every aspect and improve in our mentality. We know that all the players’ experience cannot be compared with them,” Thailand coach Nuengrutai Srathongvian said.
“We have limited resources in terms of the players and the selection,” Srathongvian said. “We have a limited number of players available. And we are small in the build. We have to improve in this aspect. ”
But they cannot do it on their own.
Developing programs like Thailand will go nowhere without investment in training facilities, coaching and youth programs. They also need to play exhibitions against better competition, both to raise the level of their game and see up close what they’re aspiring to become. In some countries, changing the public’s perception is as important as increased funding.
When The New York Times asked players on each World Cup team what sacrifices they’ve had to make, some of the answers were heartbreaking.
“I would throw my shorts and (cleats) out of the window so that my mom musn’t see that I was going to play,” one woman wrote.
“Running away from home to another state just to pursue my dream by playing soccer,” wrote another.
Public support from federation officials, and high-profile male players, can go a long way in changing the narrative for a women’s team.
Story continues below video:
Lastly, there needs to be a lasting commitment to grow the women’s game. It’s not enough to invest and support a team in the months leading up to the World Cup, only to ignore it the moment the tournament ends. Building a program is a process, a long one, and fledgling teams will never go anywhere if they’re always starting over.
Thailand qualified for the 2015 World Cup, and only missed making the knockout rounds because of goal differential. Yet it played only 55 games between that tournament and this one, and once went nine months without a game.
The U. S. women, meanwhile, have played 80 games since winning the title in 2015.
“That’s part of growing the pool and growing the game,” Megan Rapinoe said of what, if anything, Thailand could take out of the lopsided game. “They’ll improve from here on out. ”
It’s on FIFA and the Thai federation to make sure it does.

Kudos to Magic for bold decision

Texto completo: So long, Magic Dancers.
You did your job and you did it well, but your time has passed.
Which is why the Orlando Magic announced earlier this week that they are having open tryouts for a new hip-hop dance team that will be made up of both women - and men.
Why?
Because the Magic and a few other progressive teams are starting to realize that having all-women dance teams shaking, shimmying and gyrating for the entertainment of a mostly male fan base seems a bit sexist.
It's the same reason that most colleges have done away with their groups of attractive female recruiting hostesses which used to actually have names like the Bama Belles, the Bengal Babes, the Gator Getters and the Hurricane Honeys.
We are finally and thankfully reaching a point in today's "Me Too" world when it is becoming unfashionable for both college and professional teams to objectify women for the viewing pleasure of male audiences.
That said, the thing I always loved about the Magic Dancers is they weren't just talented dancers, but they were hard-working and valuable to the organization. They didn't just entertain fans during timeouts, they visited hospitals, went overseas and visited the troops and did loads of charity work. This community outreach will still continue with the new coed hip-hop dance team that will be called "The 407."
"The new performance team will build on the 30-year tradition of the Magic Dancers and execute professional routines at Orlando Magic games, while making appearances and continuing our tradition of community service," said Magic Entertainment Teams Manager Jeanine Klem-Thomas.
It's no secret that all-female dance teams became popular at professional sporting events mainly because of the scantily clad Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, who didn't lead cheers so much as they aroused male fans. These all-female "cheerleading" squads and dance teams at professional sporting events essentially were started to provide eye candy for guys at games.
Several NFL cheerleaders and NBA dance team members have gone public about the sexual harassment they are expected to endure from fans. As the New York Times reported last year, these women are often classically trained dancers in ballet, jazz, modern, hip-hop and tap, but "they quickly learn that performing at sporting events is only a small part of their job description. They are also required to fulfill what often is the unsavory side of the job: interacting with fans at games and other promotional events, where groping and sexual harassment are common."
Don't kid yourself, the Magic and other sports teams are reacting to some of this negative publicity. Just last season, for instance, the Spurs did away with their all-female dance team and replaced it with a "35-member co-ed Spurs hype team" featuring "unique family-friendly talents, including tumbling, acrobatics, dance and stunts."
Good for the Spurs, the Magic and many other teams for reacting and realizing it's time to modernize and move away from the archaic idea of provocative all-women dance teams. Let's face it, there are a lot of men who are great dancers, too, and deserve to be showcased at sporting events.
One of the things I absolutely love about college sporting events is how the male and female cheerleaders work in unison to provide an aesthetic combination of strength, grace, artistic and acrobatic ability.
So long, Magic Dancers.
You were great in your day, but your day has passed.
It's time for a new, enlightened dance number that starts with "The 407."

Texto completo: As George Stephanopoulos tells the story in his memoir of Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential race, strategist James Carville was just trying to keep the campaign on message. He scribbled a few lines on a whiteboard and stuck it to a pillar in the middle of the room at campaign headquarters. One of the lines read: "The economy, stupid."
The White House would do well to remember that phrase as President Trump's re-election campaign revs up. If the president "indefinitely suspended" his threat of placing tariffs on Mexican imports in part due to pressure from fellow Republicans in Congress, they did him a favor. Like everyone else, economic migrants are in search of a higher return on their labor. To the extent that a worker from Mexico can find satisfactory employment at home, he is less likely to head here. A trade war with Mexico would undermine the Mexican economy and create another incentive for workers to head north. Rather than stemming illegal border crossings, tariffs could well exacerbate them.
Mr. Trump's frustration with Democratic inaction in the face of an obvious humanitarian crisis at the border is both understandable and justified. Democrats well know that our asylum system is being gamed, but won't work with the White House to address the problem because they believe the chaos helps them politically. Meanwhile, migrant families from Central America are showing up with young children who will be detained for no more than 20 days and then released into society along with their parents.
And as Julia Preston of the Marshall Project has reported, most of them won't show up for hearings to adjudicate their claims. "Of nearly 100,000 parents and children who have come before the courts since 2014, most asking for refuge, judges have issued rulings in at least 32,500 cases, court records show," wrote Ms. Preston, a former immigration reporter for the New York Times. "The majority -- 70 percent -- ended with deportation orders in absentia, pronounced by judges to empty courtrooms."
Because the U.S. shares such a long boundary with a significantly poorer country, some amount of illicit immigration is inevitable. We could and should do a much better job of managing the illegal flow, but ending it outright anytime soon is a pipe dream. The Journal reported this week that "the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by the largest margin on record in April, signaling difficulty for employers to find workers in a historically tight market." In raw numbers, there were 7.5 million unfilled jobs but only 5.8 million people seeking work, and the worker shortage has been growing, not shrinking. Labor shortages in the U.S. serve as a powerful magnet for foreign nationals, and history demonstrates that when they can't come through the front door, they'll try the back way. Guest-worker programs would do far more to address this problem than imposing tariffs.
Trade wars also mean higher prices for U.S. consumers and uncertainty for businesses. Companies become more hesitant to bring on new employees or invest in additional equipment. Tariffs adversely affect the flow of goods, services and capital, which can translate into a drag on economic growth.
It's a scenario that ought to be of particular concern to Mr. Trump, because his oversight of the economy has long been a strong suit of his presidency. Surveys consistently have his overall approval rating muddled in the low to mid-40s, but his stewardship of the economy -- which includes historically low unemployment across racial and ethnic groups -- has generally polled much better. In a CNN poll released last month, 56% of respondents said he was doing a good job on the economy, a new high for the president.
This record gives Mr. Trump a golden opportunity to expand his message to voters beyond his base, which is Joe Biden & Co.'s worst nightmare. Citing a national SurveyMonkey poll from May, the Times reported last week that black Democrats "are significantly more likely than whites to call jobs and the economy the most important issue facing the nation." One black woman told the paper that Democrats running for president hadn't focused enough on jobs and other core economic issues, adding that if the candidates were really listening to black voters, "you'd be hearing more about economic opportunities. . . . It's almost like they don't get it." Ouch!
Mr. Trump has spent a fair amount of time in front of mostly white audiences boasting about what he's done for black people on the jobs front, and it's not a good look. A more fruitful approach might be for the president to visit some low-income minority communities in places like Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia, listen to their concerns, engage them in a way that Democrats are not, and talk about what strong economic growth has enabled blacks and others to do for themselves. If there was ever a time for Donald Trump to be channeling James Carville, it's now.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: How death in N.C. might impact Georgia

Texto completo: When 75-year-old Thomas Hofeller died in August at his home in Raleigh, N.C., he was hailed as the Republican gerrymandering genius who understood that control of Congress was rooted in the 50 state legislatures responsible for drawing the boundaries for the nation's 435 congressional districts.
Those state lawmakers determined which voters would vote for which members of Congress.
In state after state, Hofeller advised Republicans who drew the local maps to strengthen their numbers in state capitols, then helped those same lawmakers draw the maps that sent more Republicans to Washington.
Often called into court to defend his cartography, Hofeller was a careful man who continually advised his GOP clients to put as little as possible in writing. Emails, he said, were a tool of the devil. When he succumbed to cancer, Hofeller's business partner came to the dead man's apartment to collect his laptop and desktop computer.
Evidently, Hofeller's family life was something other than perfect. Hofeller had an estranged daughter, Stephanie, who hadn't spoken to him in four years. And didn't learn of her father's death until a month after the fact, when she came across The New York Times obituary.
When Stephanie Hofeller visited her
mother a few weeks later, the daughter found that the sweep of her father's work documents had been woefully incomplete. Still in the apartment were four external hard drives and 18 thumb drives containing some 75,000 documents generated by her gerrymandering father.
Two weeks ago, Hofeller's overlooked cache of redistricting documents made their debut in a federal court filing, part of an attempt by the American Civil Liberties Union to block the Trump administration's plan to include a U.S. citizenship question in the constitutionally required 2020 census. A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is expected by the end of this month.
Opponents have said including the question, last used in 1950, would lead to undercounts of minority populations. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said the question is necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act -- an explanation that has drawn nothing but smirks from Democrats.
A memo written by Hofeller before he died, and introduced as evidence in late May, offers a more compelling reason for the citizenship question.
I will let Emmet Bondurant explain.
Bondurant is an Atlanta attorney whose defense of voting rights stretches back to the 1960s. He currently sits on the national governing board of Common Cause and is the lead counsel in a challenge to North Carolina's congressional district map.
That case was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in March. North Carolina's GOP-controlled state Legislature drew the congressional map with the expressed intent of producing as many Republican members of Congress as possible.
And so a state that is split 50-50 between Republican and Democratic voters elected 10 GOP candidates to Congress in 2018 and only three Democrats. Hofeller drew that map for the North Carolina Legislature. Bondurant deposed him.
There's no need to go further into the North Carolina case -- which the high court is also expected to decide later this month. Suffice it to say that Bondurant was familiar with Hofeller and was one of a tight circle of Common Cause lawyers who soon learned of the trove of documents the Republican map designer had left behind.
Shift your attention instead to Texas.
In 2015, a pair of voters there challenged a state Senate map drawn by a panel of federal judges -- after the jurists had found a previous map unconstitutional. This map, too, was illegitimate, claimed plaintiffs Sue Evenwel and Edward Pfenniger, because the judges had used Texas' total population to draw the state Senate districts rather than registered voter population. (Texas has a substantial noncitizen population.)
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Texas maps in 2016, but two conservative jurists, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, noted that Texas wasn't obliged to use a state's total population to apportion its legislative districts. Other means could be used, they said.
Enter Hofeller. His calculations indicated that if states drew political boundaries according to the number of U.S. citizens in each district, parties that depended on non-His-panic white voters would benefit.
But he needed more data to be sure. Hence the citizenship question on the U.S. census. The Trump administration has called the citation of the Hofeller memo "an unfortunate last-ditch effort" to avoid a legal defeat.
Bondurant said the Hofeller memo is a glimpse of the future.
"This whole effort of putting citizenship data in the census is a political ploy to provide the factual basis for some states with Republican majorities to amend their reapportionment statutes -- to try to mandate that their state legislative districts, school districts, county commission districts be apportioned not based on total population, but based on citizenship," he said. "That's exactly where it's headed."
Congressional districts wouldn't be affected -- the U.S. Constitution makes clear that total population is the standard for reapportionment, Bondurant said. States are another matter -- particularly those with constitutions that don't dictate how populations are to be tallied. Texas is one. Georgia is another.
"We don't have a required, population-based apportionment requirement," said state Sen. Jen Jordan, D-Atlanta, who sits on the Senate Reapportionment Committee.
Majority votes in the Legislature's two chambers and a governor's signature are all that would be required.
Where might apportionment according to U.S. citizenship make a difference? In counties with high immigrant populations. Think Hall and Gwinnett counties in metro Atlanta, and Whitfield County outside Chattanooga.
"It's definitely an open question," Jordan said.

Texto completo: Late last month, Penguin Classics released a new edition of John Okada's "No-No Boy," a once-overlooked 1957 novel about a Japanese-American draft resister in World War II. It hailed the release as groundbreaking, noting that "No-No Boy" is "the first ever Japanese-American novel and Okada is the first Japanese-American writer published in Penguin Classics."
The publication came as a surprise to Shawn Wong, an English professor at the University of Washington. In 1971, shortly after Okada's death, Wong and several friends found a copy of the novel in a used bookstore and later had it copyrighted and republished with the permission of Dorothy Okada, the author's widow.
"No-No Boy" became an Asian-American literary classic and has sold more than 157,000 copies. "It became a publishing success story," Wong said.
Now, Wong feels his efforts to rescue the book from obscurity, and the wishes of the Okada estate, are being ignored by Penguin. On Facebook, he posted an image of the copyright form he filed and called Penguin's decision to release a rival edition a "moral outrage."
Penguin said that the novel is in the public domain and was never copyrighted in the United States, and that the copyright registration Wong filed covers only the introduction to the 1976 edition, not the underlying work.
"We acted in good faith to pursue 'No-No Boy' for publication," Penguin said in a statement. "Our intent is to continue important conversations around 'No-No Boy' through its inclusion in the Penguin Classics series."
The copyright question has overshadowed what should have been a moment of celebration for Okada's literary legacy. The novel's uncertain copyright status is further complicated by the fact that it was first published in Japan, by an English-language publisher, but the author is American.
Some Asian-American organizations, as well as artists and writers, have thrown their support behind Wong. "I am very disappointed in Penguin for appropriating John Okada's 'No-No Boy,"' the novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen tweeted on Wednesday.
Densho, an organization that collects the testimonies of Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II, also took aim at Penguin in a Facebook post: "Extremely upsetting news regarding Penguin's 'new' edition of 'No-No Boy."'
Dorothea Okada, John Okada's daughter, said her family was unaware of any issues with their claim to the copyright, and that the family wasn't contacted by Penguin before the new edition was published. The Okadas have been receiving royalties from the University of Washington Press for several decades, and it's unclear whether they will get any compensation from the Penguin edition. (Penguin declined to say whether the Okadas will receive royalties, saying the company would contact the family directly.)
"The university press has done a really good job guiding the book, so we were really happy with what they've been doing, and I don't think a bigger press would do anything for it," Dorothea Okada said. "We would never change publishers."
Wong added that the Penguin edition contains an error: John Okada's name appears at the end of the book's preface, incorrectly suggesting that the preface is a purely autobiographical author's note rather than a part of the novel itself, a mistake that appeared in an earlier University of Washington edition but was later removed.
Karen Tei Yamashita, a novelist who wrote the introduction to the Penguin edition, said the earlier publication of the novel marked a critical turning point for Asian-American literature.
"You can't talk about that book without talking about what these guys did, and the impact that the book had on another generation of writers," she said. "I feel disappointed that this should be a controversy at this time that should be more of a celebration of Okada's work."
Born in 1923 in Seattle, John Okada was a student at the University of Washington when he and his family were sent to an internment center in Minidoka, Idaho. Okada voluntarily enlisted, becoming a radio signal interceptor for reconnaissance missions over the Japanese coast and eventually serving among United States occupation forces in Japan.
He later earned a master's degree from Teachers College at Columbia University. He and his wife settled in Detroit, where he found work as a librarian and worked on "No-No Boy."
The novel centers on Ichiro Yamada, who is sent to an internment camp and then to prison after he refuses to be drafted into the United States military during World War II. According to Okada's biographer, Frank Abe, Okada based the character on a friend who was sent to prison for refusing the draft. The novel explores the experiences of Japanese-Americans accused of being traitors to America, and the divisions that occurred in communities and families when young Japanese-American men were asked to fight for a home country that had treated them as the enemy.
"No-No Boy" was rejected by several American publishers before Okada sold it to a Japanese publisher for a $ 150 advance. The publisher, Charles Tuttle, printed 1,500 English-language hardcover copies in Japan, which were shipped to the United States. "I've sat out the urge to turn cartwheels, to shout the news to the world and to dash off a letter of resignation to the library where I am employed," Okada wrote to the publisher, according to "John Okada: The Life & Rediscovered Work of the Author of 'No-No Boy."'
"He wrote the great Japanese-American novel," Abe said.
But when the book first came out in 1957, it wasn't a subject that American readers wanted to engage with, and it languished in obscurity. Okada went on to work in advertising. When he died in 1971 of a heart attack at the age of 47, the novel seemed like a failure.
After Okada's death, Wong and three of his friends, Jeffery Paul Chan, Frank Chin and Lawson Fusao Inada, rediscovered "No-No Boy" and made it their mission to republish it. For a second time, around half a dozen American publishers rejected the novel, so the group decided to raise the money to publish it themselves. They got word out through The Pacific Citizen, a Japanese-American newspaper, and offered readers a $ 2 discount if they preordered the book. Wong mailed the books himself, selling out of the first print run.
The book, about a subject that was too painful for many Japanese-Americans when it was first published, resonated with a younger generation of readers. A few years later, in 1979, Wong and Dorothy Okada transferred publication rights to the University of Washington Press. It remains one of the press's best-selling titles.
The rights manager for the press said it hired an intellectual property lawyer to look into the novel's copyright status, and the lawyer, Nancy Wolff, determined that in the United States, the novel is in the public domain.
Other copyright experts say the case isn't so clear cut and that the Okada estate might have a basis for asserting continued ownership over the novel. "This is really twisted, and reasonable minds could disagree," said Jordan Greenberger, an intellectual property lawyer.
Wong said he hopes readers and educators continue to support the edition he helped to create, noting that it remains the only one with the approval and support of the Okada estate.
"I worked harder at getting this book published than getting my own books published," Wong said. "The publishing history of the book is almost as important as the book itself."

Texto completo: On Sunday evening, Mary Max, the wife of the pop artist Peter Max, left a lengthy voice mail message for a friend in London with instructions for what to do after she passed away.
For the past several years, Ms. Max had been embroiled in a vitriolic legal dispute over her husband's art, wealth and legacy, as he has struggled with increasing dementia. A stepson and household staff had made accusations that she had been abusive to her husband, and even attempted to kill him, while she countered with accusations that the stepson had "kidnapped" his father.
But in her final voice message to her friend, said her lawyer, John Markham, she did not rehash that dispute. Instead, he said, she left farewell messages for people she loved: her husband; her closest friends; her brother, Daniel; and her 94-year-old mother, Ruth.
The police said Ms. Max was found dead of an apparent suicide in her Upper West Side apartment at Riverside Drive and 84th Street at about 8:30 p.m. on Sunday. The exact cause of death is under investigation by the office of the chief medical examiner.
The death of Ms. Max, 52, in the home she shared with Mr. Max, 81, comes in the midst of continued infighting in recent years regarding her husband's legacy.
In May, The New York Times wrote about how business associates and his son, Adam, had taken control of Mr. Max's studio, with the intention of increasing production using assistant artists even though Mr. Max himself had not painted seriously in four years, according to nine people with direct knowledge of his condition.
Mr. Max's psychedelic renderings helped define the hippie aesthetic of the 1960s and 1970s. In recent years, his brightly colored works regularly sold for five figures in auctions, The Times reported.
Mary Max, nee Balkin, was born on Oct. 20, 1966, and raised in Buffalo, N.Y. In 1996, she was walking on a Manhattan sidewalk, when Mr. Max, already an internationally renowned artist and 30 years her senior, walked up and said, "Hi, I'm Peter Max, and I've been painting your profile my entire life."
They married a year later.
Mr. Max had two children from a first marriage, Adam Cosmo and Libra Astro. The children had significant shares in Mr. Max's studio, which is named ALP after his and their first names. He and Mary Max had no children together.
By 2012, The Times reported, Mr. Max's mental faculties were beginning to wane and he struggled to create art. Adam, The Times reported, began to take a more active role in the studio.
Ms. Max became concerned and in 2015, she asked the Supreme Court of the State of New York to appoint a guardian to oversee her husband's business. She told the court she was being followed by private investigators and once was stopped on the street by men warning her to stop interfering in the studio.
Ms. Max also told the court that Adam had taken custody of his father and concealed his whereabouts from friends and family, according to court filings.
But Adam said in court filings that he was protecting his father from his stepmother's abuse. In a transcript of a recorded conversation with her driver that was entered into evidence, Ms. Max asked about hiring a goon to intimidate her husband and damage his painting hand.
A judge ultimately ordered Mr. Max to be returned to his wife's care, and appointed a guardian to oversee both his business and personal matters.
Mr. Markham said on Tuesday that any accusations of abuse against Ms. Max had been false and were deeply hurtful.
"It's very sad that she could not convince some others that she was as dedicated as she was," Mr. Markham said. "She finally gave up."

Texto completo: Asked whether she supports impeaching the President, Toledo Rep. Marcy Kaptur says, Impeaching one man is not enough.

But that doesn't mean she joins the 59 House Democrats and one Michigan Republican calling for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump in the wake of the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice.

Congress must continue to work to find the truth and hold President Trump and his campaign and business associates accountable. Only through thorough investigations by all the committees of jurisdiction will we get at the full truth and the full extent to which America's interests have been compromised through Russian meddling and people at the highest levels dealing in their own self-interest, she said in a statement.

Miss Kaptur isn't known for holding back about the President. But some Democrats are walking a fine line between their more progressive wing calling for immediate action and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is publicly urging her caucus to be patient and proceed first with congressional inquiries. Democrats fear making the wrong call in either direction will hurt them in 2020.

Many Republicans have said they believe the report exonerates the President, while Democrats point to Mr. Mueller's statement that he could not clear Mr. Trump of obstruction and the report itself as evidence of impeachable conduct.

Only one of Ohio's four House Democrats has explicitly said their chamber should begin impeachment proceedings. Rep. Tim Ryan, of northeast Ohio, a long-shot presidential candidate vying to stand out in a crowded field, discussed it during his recent CNN town hall.

While I do not come to this decision lightly, after much thought and consideration and after both reading the Mueller Report and hearing directly from the special counsel, I believe that the House of Representatives must begin impeachment proceedings, he said afterward in a statement. We must fully expose the lawlessness which has already occurred and prevent future lawlessness from occurring.

The Constitution allows Congress to remove a president for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. More than half of the U.S. House of Representatives has to approve one or more articles of impeachment - essentially an indictment. Then the Senate holds a trial overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. At least two-thirds of senators must find the President guilty to remove him from office.

Columbus Democrat Joyce Beatty echoed Miss Kaptur's calls for congressional oversight.

Special counsel Mueller made it crystal clear that Trump was not exonerated - in fact, his report concluded the exact opposite, she said in a statement. That is why I support Congress continuing to use our oversight and investigative tools to get to the bottom of any wrongdoing. I ultimately believe this process will lead to an impeachment inquiry, which I would support for the people and to keep America great.

Cleveland Democrat Marcia Fudge did not respond to a request for comment.

A survey by The New York Times tallied 60 House members who support immediate impeachment following Mr. Mueller's report. It found 108 members so far do not support impeachment now or ever, or are undecided. The rest have not responded.

Champaign County Rep. Jim Jordan has been a leading GOP figure against impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee member blasted Democrats for already engaging in impeachment with their actions - they're just not calling it that, he said.

They were out to get the President but they couldn't prove it. They found no collusion, he said recently on Fox News. The Democrats don't want to leave this alone. They're going to keep pushing because their focus is on getting the President and not helping the country.

Other Ohio Republicans, such as Bowling Green Rep. Bob Latta, have not waded directly into the impeachment discussion. In April Mr. Latta said, It's clear that there was no collusion. Those wishing to re-litigate the 2016 election will continue to keep searching for evidence that doesn't exist.

Michigan Rep. Justin Amash of Grand Rapids is the lone House Republican calling for impeachment.

Texto completo: Standing a few feet from a pool of water in his field, on a strip of now-crusted mud where no corn plants are shooting up, Scott VanderWal contemplates a question: Which makes farming more uncertain these days: the weather or White House policy?
“That’s a hard question,” says Mr. VanderWal, a farmer and president of the South Dakota Farm Bureau, an advocacy group. “I would say they are both about the same.”
Hit with wet weather that has delayed spring planting on a scale not seen in decades, many farmers from here in Volga, South Dakota, to Ohio are making the difficult decision not to plant certain fields this year – to settle for insurance payments worth about half what they would normally receive per acre, rather than plant and risk an early frost.
At the same time, federal policy added a new layer of uncertainty and even alarm among agricultural producers. Slowly, these issues are being resolved – from disaster aid to trade talks – but not before exposing waning patience among many in farm country with the administration’s unpredictability.
“Farmers are grumpy,” says Norman Brugger, a rancher and seed salesman in Albion, Nebraska. “I have listened to people talk, coffee-shop talk ... and I have heard some guys who are changing their minds” about President Donald Trump.
Part of rural dissatisfaction stems from the difficult spring. Normally, this time of year, Corn Belt states like Indiana and Ohio would have all but finished corn planting. Instead, they’ve got two-thirds or less planted, according to the crop progress report the U.S. Department of Agriculture released Monday. South Dakota is in the same boat – 64% planted – but because the risk of frost comes a little earlier here, the window is closing fast.
The silver lining is that, in the quirky economics of agriculture, a poor corn crop could be good for farmers. Already, corn prices have surged to three-year highs. Farm income is likely to rise this year, after several years of decline, says Scott Gerlt, an agricultural economist with the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri. Even farmers with poor yields may do better, because crop insurance provides payments for those who don’t plant at all as well as those who have a reduced yield.
How well they fare will depend in part on a long-delayed $19.1 billion disaster aid package that the president signed Thursday, after trying for months to limit how much would flow to Puerto Rico for recovery from Hurricane Maria. The measure, which includes $3 billion in aid for agriculture, should be of special help to Georgia and Florida farmers who have waited since last October to find out if federal aid would help ease their severe losses from Hurricane Michael. But economists say the money is too little to provide much help for Midwestern farmers who can’t plant. The regulations for distributing the money still haven’t been written.
Farmers breathed another sigh of relief Friday after Mr. Trump announced an immigration deal with Mexico, forestalling his threat of imposing 5% tariffs on imports from America’s largest trading partner. The tariffs would have hit the auto industry hardest, but also would have raised consumer prices on a range of goods from Mexico, including fruits and vegetables.
Farmers also feared U.S. tariffs would trigger Mexican retaliation on imports from the United States. Mexico is the second-biggest export market for U.S. agricultural goods after Canada. But other trade actions are still raising concerns in farm country.
For example, Mr. Trump’s aggressive negotiations with China, which include tariffs on Chinese goods and countertariffs from China, have hurt soybean exports and swelled U.S. stockpiles, which have caused prices to fall. In the short term, most of those soybeans will get sold to other nations if the Chinese market disappears. But the longer the U.S.-China standoff continues, the more other nations will expand production and displace U.S. sales around the world. 
By standing firm against unfair Chinese trade practices, Mr. Trump has gotten a pass from many farmers, says Mr. VanderWal, who is also vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, a conservative farm advocacy group in Washington with strong lines of communication with the administration. “They understand what he’s trying to do. ... Farmers are the best patriots in the country. But there comes a time when we all have to keep our businesses and farm operations together. ... Farmers are getting impatient.”
If the China trade impasse gets grudging acceptance, the president’s sudden shifts on Mexico have not. The U.S. and Mexico had been moving toward ratifying a new North American trade pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), when Mr. Trump suddenly tweeted late last month that he would impose 5% tariffs on Mexican imports – which would eventually rise to 25% – if its government didn’t strengthen border security against migrants making their way to the U.S. Then on Friday Mr. Trump tweeted that the two nations had signed a last-minute deal to avert the tariffs, which he had threatened to impose on Monday.
Subsequent reporting from The New York Times suggests that much of the deal had already been reached in secret negotiations earlier this year, while the administration contends that stronger provisions and an important and unnamed new provision were not reached until the threat of levies had been imposed. He also tweeted Sunday that if there is not cooperation on the border from Mexico “we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs.”
It is this uncertainty – which the president appears to thrive on – that exposes growing concern over some of the president’s tactics. This does not signal a political break with Mr. Trump. Many rural Republicans applaud his whatever-it-takes approach to handling problems, including immigration.
When a country like Mexico isn’t budging on an issue, “we need to get their attention,” says Verlin Janssen, a city councilman for Gothenburg, Nebraska, and a retired businessman.
Others quietly chafe at the uncertainty created by Mr. Trump’s negotiating style. Threatening Mexico with tariffs was “not helpful,” says Mr. VanderWal. “Get USMCA passed. It would give the Trump administration more credibility when negotiating with other countries.”

Conservationists, Commercial At Odds Over What To Do About Shorebirds

Texto completo: REEDS BEACH, N.J. - On a recent spring day at this remote beach, hundreds of shorebirds flapped frantically beneath a net trapping them on the sand. Dozens of volunteers rushed to disentangle the birds and place them gently in covered crates.
On a nearby sand dune, teams of scientists and volunteers attached metal leg bands, plastic tags and tiny radio transmitters to birds of three species. They were weighed and measured, and then released.
The operation is part of an annual “catch” of migratory shorebirds that stop on the beaches of the Delaware Bay, a globally important bird habitat, to gorge on the eggs of spawning horseshoe crabs. The stopover strengthens the birds for the long-distance migration to the Canadian Arctic, their breeding grounds, from as far away as southern Chile.
With fresh information on the birds’ weight and health, the scientists will be able to judge whether these species are getting enough food to reach their breeding grounds, and whether their populations are stable.
One of them, the red knot, has been listed as a threatened species. Since 2000, red knot numbers have plunged as low as 10,000 in some years, around one-ninth of the level in the 1980s. At the moment, the population hovers at about 30,000, still too low to be sustainable, conservationists claim.
Additional challenges like severe Arctic weather during breeding, or coastal development along the migration route, could lead to the bird’s extinction. Populations of other migratory shorebirds, like semipalmated sandpipers and ruddy turnstones, have also declined.
Competition for crabs
The problem, conservationists say, is the overfishing of horseshoe crabs for commercial fishery bait and the harvesting of the animals for their blood, which contains an extract called LAL, used by the biomedical industry to detect certain bacteria.
Now, conservationists are renewing calls to halt the harvest for bait altogether, and to persuade the biomedical industry to switch to recombinant Factor C (rFC), a synthetic alternative to LAL, to ease pressure on the horseshoe crab population.
“The only responsible thing to do here is a moratorium,” said Eric Stiles, president of New Jersey Audubon, an environmental group leading the initiative.
Recognizing the threat to the birds, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate regulator, banned the harvest of female horseshoe crabs for bait starting in 2013, in the hope that a recovering population of females would lay more eggs and allow the birds to rebound.
While the commission maintains there has been an increase in the number of crabs since the ban, neither the crabs nor the red knot have recovered to the levels seen before the fishing industry’s unprecedented removal of the crabs from the bay in the 1990s.
The commission’s critics blame poor enforcement of the ban and the continued harvest of thousands of crabs for bleeding, which is estimated to kill at least 15% of them and may prevent the survivors from reproducing.
Crabs taken for bleeding are not included in the commission’s quotas, and their numbers and mortality rates are not published because the companies that collect the blood want the figures kept confidential.
Conservation groups are urging officials in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia - three bay states that use crab quotas - to ban the horseshoe crab harvest until there’s a full recovery of both crabs and birds. (New Jersey, the other state bordering the bay, imposed a moratorium in 2008.)
Banning the harvest, advocates argue, would rebuild a crab population that is essential not only to the birds but also to depleted marine species, such as weakfish, that feed on the crabs and in turn support commercial and recreational fishing on the bay.
“It’s not just about the birds,” said David Mizrahi, vice president for research and monitoring at New Jersey Audubon. “It’s about the whole ecosystem.”
Within the knot population, the biggest decline has been seen in long-distance migrants that spend the northern winter in Tierra del Fuego, in southern Chile. That population numbered only 9,840 in 2018, down 25% in the last year and less than a fifth of the number in 2000.
Scientists say those birds are especially sensitive to a shortage of horseshoe crab eggs on Delaware Bay beaches, as they are emaciated when they arrive from South America.
In the biomedical industry, the switch to rFC is being led by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, which began using the substance to test new products in 2016 and plans to have 90% of the changeover completed by the end of 2020, according to Jay Bolden, a senior consultant biologist for the company.
The synthetic alternative is comparable in cost and efficacy to LAL, he added.
Missing the goal
For now, conservationists say a sharp decline in crab eggs shows that quotas have failed to restore the female crab population. Average egg densities on five New Jersey beaches dropped to between 2,000 and 7,000 eggs per square meter in 2017 from as much as 100,000 per square meter in 1991, according to New Jersey Audubon.
But the fisheries commission argues that its quotas for the crab bait harvest have stabilized the populations of red knots and other shorebirds, and are beginning to result in increasing numbers of female crabs in the bay.
The number of mature female crabs rose to 7.8 million in 2017 from 5.4 million in 2011 before the quota system began, according to commission data.
The tally is not close to the 11.2 million females - or 80% of the bay’s carrying capacity - that might lead the commission to permit the female crab harvest to resume. But officials say it shows the current quota is working.
“I’m not sure what more the commission could do in terms of restricting harvest beyond there being zero females” allowed under the quota, said Mike Schmidtke, the commission’s fishery management plan coordinator.
The commission estimates the red knot population to have been in the 43,000 to 49,000 range since 2011, based on a statistical method that differs from one used by conservationists.
That number, too, is well below the 81,900 that would allow the commission to lift its ban on harvesting female crabs, but is at least broadly stable, Schmidtke said.
Larry Niles, an independent biologist who has led the annual shorebird catch on the New Jersey side of the bay for the last 23 years, dismissed as “utter nonsense” Schmidtke’s assertion that there was nothing more the commission could do to boost the number of crab eggs on the beaches.
And the commission’s claim that the number of female horseshoe crabs is increasing is not supported by the number of horseshoe crab eggs, he added.

Despite being the largest island on the planet, three times the size of Texas, hardly anyone lives there: fewer than 60,000 people. And precious few visit, mostly scientists trying to fathom the secrets of its forbidding environment. Temperatures of minus 89 degrees Fahrenheit have been recorded there.
When humanity thought of Greenland at all, it was because of the explorers who challenged its vast ice sheet – roughly 80% of its land mass is covered with ice, 2 miles thick in spots. Early in the Cold War, America established an air base there and later tried to purchase Greenland from Denmark.
In his new book “The Ice at the End of the World: An Epic Journey into Greenland’s Buried Past and Our Perilous Future” (Random House, 448 pp. , ★★★½ out of four), Jon Gertner makes a compelling case that it’s time to start thinking seriously about Greenland and its growing relevance to our lives, and those of our descendants.
The scientists who have braved Greenland’s environs with ever-more-sophisticated measuring tools are united in their belief that Greenland is changing faster than anyone had thought possible. As goes Greenland, so goes the planet.
Gertner, a journalist for The New York Times, does not wax polemic. That would be overkill when the facts on the ground (or on the ice) largely speak for themselves. Most of his book consists of engaging accounts of the explorers and scientists who have been drawn to Greenland’s hinterlands, among them the Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen and the American Robert Peary.
These sojourners came to conquer the elements but also to understand this strangely beautiful place. Scientists have probed and taken Greenland’s measure for more than a century, and the data they have accumulated has them concerned. The island is shedding massive amounts of ice and water each year – 300 billion tons, and the pace of loss is accelerating.
Most of Greenland lies within the Arctic Circle, and its fearsome weather has been getting less and less terrifying of late. In February 2018, scientists at the northern tip of the island, a mere 400 miles from the North Pole, recorded average daily temperatures 45 degrees above normal. To put that in perspective, if such a phenomena were recorded in February in New York City, the average temperature would hover around 80 degrees for 28 days straight.
As Earth warms, northerly places like Greenland are warming faster, as climatologists have predicted for decades now. Gertner writes that its average summer temperature is now 7 to 9 degrees warmer than normal.
Such disturbing tidbits are woven into the author’s compelling narrative about the intrepid human beings whose curiosity about the world lures them to forbidding places. Gertner makes clear that science is not augury and that there are many possible eventualities for our shared future, albeit most quite troublesome and some downright apocalyptic.
One of the most concerning findings, discovered by drilling deep into Greenland's core and unlocking the secrets of its frozen past, is that climate change has not always been gradual, as scientists had long believed. There have been points of no return in the past when a telltale threshold was crossed, when ice sheets collapsed quickly and temperatures spiked dramatically.
What if the worst happened? Gertner writes that the scientists who have taken the measure of Greenland and its melting ice calculate that if it all melted away – a distinct possibility – this island alone would account for a worldwide sea rise of nearly 25 feet.

Texto completo: With summer on the horizon (and Instagram stories calling), I begrudgingly pulled myself out of bed early one morning in May to get some exercise before work.
I stood before a stark white, freestanding boxing bag weighed down by hundreds of pounds of sand as Andre Huseman, a high-spirited personal trainer, greeted me. "Welcome back to FightCamp," the jacked fitness professional said, and within seconds he was counting down, "3…2…1."
Perplexed as I navigated the workout for my first time, I (along with a room full of boxing enthusiasts) followed Huseman's two-minute warm-up involving jump ropes and torso twists to an uptempo soundtrack by the rapper Rich Homie Quan.
Only I wasn't at a kickboxing facility. I was trying out FightCamp's interactive home workout system, and the trainer and other boxers were built into the app.
Exhausted after using real-time punching metrics to reach ambitious intermediate-level goals, my first thought was, "Gee, how convenient."
In a world where $36 spinning classes have become commonplace and boutique fitness gyms curate specialized experiences for millennials, a new wave of technology is penetrating the deluxe workout market so you don't even have to leave your bedroom, let alone your home.
Connected fitness, which began with apps and leveled up with wearables, is pedaling toward a new phase with smart home-workout equipment and membership packages that bridge the gap between attending instructor-led classes and flying completely solo.
Imagine being in bed one moment, and the next you're going for the burn up a hill trail in the stunningly picturesque Hidden Valley Trail in Utah as artificial intelligence pushes you to your limits. Picture yourself standing before a 40-inch mirror one second, and then you're launched into a live fitness class the next.
Welcome to the future of at-home workouts, where virtual trainers, AI and apps take you further than the recreational gym in your neighborhood, for a premium cost.
"There's this massive innovation happening. You're no longer just watching a Jane Fonda workout through a TV, or a trainer on an app. You're interacting and engaging with devices," said tech entrepreneur Ian McCaig, who is a co-founder of Fiit, a mobile app that connects to your TV.
"Whether you're seeing your metrics or interacting with the instructors, you're gamifying the experience. You're getting the real-time feedback and having social experiences, working out with your friends even if you're not in the same room with each other."
FightCamp
After raising about $3.7 million in seed funding, FightCamp began taking orders for its interactive kickboxing system in 2018.
The $1,095 home gym comes with a freestanding bag, monogrammed gloves, quick wraps and access to on-demand instructional classes. The system is elevated by punch-tracking technology housed in the wraps. The tech provides on-demand strike data and real-time performance stats.
The two motion trackers sync with your smartphone through the FightCamp app to capture how many punches are thrown, and you can watch counters go up on your phone or television as you throw punch combinations.
The company says it recently developed motion recognition algorithms that track other training motions, including kicks, pushups, jump rope.
FightCamp, previously called Kykso, offers a library of boxing workouts via subscriptions for $39 a month, and since launching, several thousand users have signed up across the U.S. and Canada, the company says.
The connected boxing system is designed for people who want boxing-oriented videos at a more affordable rate than most in-person kickboxing classes over time. The workout also is cheaper than those offered by Peloton, an industry leader in the home fitness technology.
Peloton
Peloton, which is perhaps best known for combining its premium stationary bikes and treadmills with a screen that shows fitness courses, has a million users and has sold over 400,000 bikes, according to CNBC.
The company confirmed with USA TODAY that it submitted papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June with plans to go public.
Some of the company's internet-connected exercise devices sell for around $2,500.
A recent study by Second Measure found that the $4 billion fitness brand's ridership eclipsed SoulCycle's over the holiday season, and its membership retention rates are higher than the American luxury fitness company Equinox.
SoulCycle backpedaled away from plans to go public in May citing "market conditions."
Mirror
Last year, Mirror, an interactive monitor that is disguised as a typical mirror when not in use, completely disrupted the home fitness space. Similar to Peloton, Mirror's subscription service and on-demand content come at an additional cost to members.
Mirror declined to tell USA TODAY how many consumers have purchased the product since its launch. However, The New York Times reported in February that Mirror was selling $1 million worth of the digital screens per month, which equates to about 650 units.
"We're vying to be the next screen in your life, not the next treadmill in your home," Mirror founder and CEO Brynn Putnam said in a statement. " You have your phone for communication, your computer for information, your TV for entertainment and now the Mirror for experiences."
In-home delivery of the system, which includes resistance bands, and a heart rate monitor costs $250. You'll have to pay $39 a month to access live and prerecorded workouts like resistance training, yoga, cardio and Pilates. The mirror itself is around $1,500.
Tonal also offers a wall-mounted fitness system with on-demand coaching and adaptive resistance training baked in. However, it's even more expensive at $2,995 plus $49 a month for the subscription.
While they work on iOS, neither FightCamp nor Mirror work with Android. Peloton Digital became available for Android in December.
Bowflex
Also taking advantage of the connected home-fitness boom, Bowflex launched an AI platform in 2018 to train customers using artificial intelligence.
Called Max Intelligence, the platform generates custom programs based on how the user is feeling, how much time they have and their fitness capabilities based on a 14-minute performance test.
The platform also offers a library of trainer-led videos and educational content based on the user's workout history and preferences. Embedded in the app is access to RunSocial, a range of HD video running routes from around the world. As you use a Bowflex machine, you'll travel through video routes on the screen. Your motion rate controls the video speed.
Available routes include a run through Death Valley National Park in California, a 10K race around the Swiss Alps and a 5K trek through rice fields and villages in the countryside of Japan.
Prices for the Bowflex exerciser start at $2,299.
With ubiquitous 4G connectivity and the mass adoption of 5G on the horizon, experts say manufacturers of smart gym equipment soon will have the bandwidth to take immersive workouts to the next level. "We're seeing how wearable technology can disrupt the home fitness experience, and there's no reason why VR and AR won't take things even further," McCaig said.
Smart gyms could become an extension of smart homes, and apps might one day be able to make workout suggestions based on how tired your body feels, thanks to data gathered from wearables, McCaig said.
In a blog post on LinkedIn, the investor and former personal trainer said that connected home fitness is poised to overtake the recreational gym market within the next 10 years.
"The reality is, the one thing we're all running out of is time. That's what makes being able to log on to a hyper-interactive class with other people from home appealing," McCaig said.

Texto completo: David Ortiz was not planning on going out Sunday night in the Dominican Republic. But a call from a friend, Jhoel López, a local television host, persuaded Ortiz to change his mind.
Soon after Ortiz's arrival at a regular hangout, the Dial Bar & Lounge, in the eastern part of Santo Domingo, an assailant crept up behind him and fired a gunshot from close range. The bullet entered Ortiz's back and exited his abdomen, seriously wounding the former Boston Red Sox star known as Big Papi, who became one of baseball's most respected athletes while playing a key role ending the club's 86-year World Series drought in 2004.
"We were just hanging out and going about our way," Ortiz's brother, Eloy, said in Spanish. "This doesn't make sense."
While news of the shooting spread late Sunday, sending shock waves through the baseball community, Ortiz, 43, was rushed to a clinic in Santo Domingo. After spending six hours in surgery, until after 3 a.m. Monday, he was in stable enough condition to be transported to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston via an air ambulance provided by the Red Sox, club officials said on Monday afternoon.
"It's a family decision, because the last 20 years of his life have revolved around the Boston Red Sox," Leo López, Ortiz's longtime assistant, said in a phone interview.
Ortiz's gallbladder and part of his intestines were removed during the operation, said Abel Gonzalez, one of the doctors who operated on Ortiz at his clinic. Ortiz's liver was also damaged.
As he was wheeled into the clinic, Ortiz said, "Please don't let me die, I'm a good man," according to an emergency room doctor who was present.
Ortiz was sedated but woke up late Monday morning and spoke briefly to his father and sister, who offered him words of support, Leo López said.
"The events of last night shook our Red Sox family to its core," Sam Kennedy, the Red Sox's president, said at a news conference on Monday. "David Ortiz is one of the most celebrated and beloved members of the Red Sox family."
Many current and former players, including Pedro Martinez, the former Red Sox ace from the Dominican Republic, offered support on social media. On Monday, former President Barack Obama also posted a message for Ortiz on Twitter.
Ortiz, who lives in Miami but spends some of the year in the Dominican Republic, had been back in his native country for about a week, promoting a new cigar brand and working with a new foundation to supply sports equipment to kids. He was also training with his 15-year-old son D'Angelo, who is hoping to follow his father's footsteps to the major leagues. He has a wife, Tiffany, and three children.
The motive for the attack remained unclear and was still under investigation, the authorities said, but they ruled out an attempted robbery. Security footage obtained from the bar by police showed Ortiz falling over and out of his chair after the shooter approached him and fired.
Police detained Eddy Feliz García, 25, who was believed to be the driver of the motorcycle that fled the scene after the shooting, according to Ney Aldrin Bautista Almonte, the director of the national police. An angry mob beat the driver after the motorcycle sputtered. A second suspect has not been identified or arrested.

Jhoel López, Ortiz's friend, was also injured, possibly by the same bullet, in the leg and is in stable condition, said Leo López, Ortiz's assistant.
The shooting occurred in an area filled with high-end clubs and bars where Ortiz has been known to frequent. Leo López said Ortiz is well known at Dial. He said he did not know why Ortiz was targeted.
"You know how the world is right now," he said. "In reality, there is no respect for life by a lot of people. People can take others' life for any difference. And it's a difference we don't know right now. David is a guy that is beloved, not just here but around the world."
Ortiz's big bat and big personality earned him that affection over a 20-year major league career. The left-handed slugger spent 14 seasons with the Red Sox, where he was a 10-time All-Star and three-time World Series Champion. He famously became an outspoken voice for the city following the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013.
Ortiz is much-loved in Boston for helping the Red Sox win the 2004 World Series, their first since 1918. That year, he buried the rival Yankees in the American League Championship Series with a home run to end Game 4, a single to win Game 5 and another home run in Game 7.
In 2009, The New York Times reported that Ortiz had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs six years prior, before penalties were in place and when results were supposed to remain anonymous. Ortiz acknowledged then the report was accurate and later said he had been careless in his use of over-the-counter vitamins and supplements. He said he had never used or bought steroids.
He retired in 2016 with 541 home runs, 17th-most in major league history. He has raised millions of dollars through his foundation to help children's medical needs in New England and the Dominican Republic.
"It's really sad when stuff like that happens, especially for ones that you care and you love, that are kind of part of your family," Robinson Cano, the Mets second baseman who is also from the Dominican Republic, said on Monday. "This is really sad. So hopefully they find the guy, then find out what was really the whole situation. Hopefully this doesn't happen to not only baseball players, but anyone."

Warren's nonstop ideas shape race for 2020, give her new momentum

Texto completo: Six months after launching her candidacy amid blundering apologies for her longtime claims of Native American ancestry and nagging questions about whether she could compete on a national stage, Elizabeth Warren is experiencing something unusual in the crowded Democratic field: momentum.
It is not showing up in national polls, which have remained largely steady with the Democratic senator from Massachusetts in the single digits, far behind former vice president Joe Biden.
But energized crowds have been flocking to her events in early voting states. Her nonstop stream of policy positions, which add up to what would be a restructuring of American capitalism, has helped shape the broader debate.
Some state-level surveys show Warren near Biden at the top of the field. A poll by the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom, which published over the weekend, combined probable caucusgoers' first choice, second choice, and candidates they are "actively considering" to show that Biden and Warren are evenly matched by this measure, with 61 percent each.
Biden has the edge in the "first choice" category, with 24 percent. But Warren's performance on that front — 15 percent described Warren as their first choice, compared with 16 percent for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and 14 percent for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — reflected a stronger position for Warren than she held in previous Iowa polling.
Washington Post
Sunday marks moment for 2020 prospects in Iowa
In five-minute chunks of speaking time, nearly 20 Democratic presidential candidates got the chance to make their case before hundreds of party leaders at an important testing ground in early-voting Iowa.
Absent from Sunday's event was Joe Biden, who leads in early polling, and that gave the gathering the look of an audition for the former vice president's would-be top challengers heading into the summer campaign season in the leadoff 2020 caucus state.
Expected to take the stage for their strictly-enforced time-limited speeches were 19 of 24 Democrats who have joined the race to unseat President Trump.
The high-profile campaign stop event comes in the wake of Biden's reversal Thursday on a key abortion policy position. Biden now supports federal funding for abortion services after opposing it for decades.
That, and other parts of the former Delaware senator's long record, created an opportunity for many abortion-rights supporters to step up their criticism of Biden to an influential audience.
Associated Press
Democrats begin public airing of Mueller report
House Democrats have scheduled a series of hearings this week on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report as they intensify their focus on the Russia probe and pick up the pace on an investigative "path" — in the words of Speaker Nancy Pelosi — that some of them hope leads to impeachment of the president.
In doing so, they are trying to draw the public's attention on the allegations that Trump sought to obstruct a federal investigation and they want to highlight his campaign's contacts with Russia in the 2016 election. And they will lay the groundwork for an appearance from Mueller, despite his stated desire to avoid the spotlight.
The hearings will focus on the two main topics of Mueller's report, obstruction of justice and Russian election interference.
The House Judiciary Committee plans to cover the first topic at a Monday hearing on "presidential obstruction and other crimes." The House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday intends to review the counterintelligence implications of the Russian meddling. Mueller said there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but he said he could not exonerate Trump on obstruction.
On Tuesday, the House has scheduled a vote to authorize contempt cases against Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn for failing to comply with subpoenas from the Democratic-controlled House.
Associated Press
China blocks same US media firms that Trump denounces
Two more major international media companies — the London-based Guardian and The Washington Post — were added to China's Great Firewall, blocked on the Internet to the country's 1.4 billion citizens as part of a crackdown on dissent by President Xi Jinping.
In Washington, meanwhile, President Trump had a message: The Washington Post, CNN, and NBC were, he wrote on Twitter Saturday, "Fake and Corrupt News Media." The New York Times and CNN are "truly The Enemy of the People!" MSNBC, which he called "the opposition," was broadcasting "such lies, almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth."
Trump's tweetstorm against the press corps over the past three days was nothing new.

Texto completo: The Tony Awards telecast Sunday might be the only chance for most of America to see original Broadway cast members performing live. And they got to see a few Pittsburghers strut their stuff, too.
Amid the razzle-dazzle musical spectacles at Radio City Music Hall on Sunday, viewers of CBS' broadcast also got a chance to witness Squirrel Hill native and Carnegie Mellon University alumna Jamie deRoy rack up a win as co-producer of best play "The Ferryman" and bring the university to 48 statues awarded to alumni during 73 years of the Tonys.
The musical "Hadestown," which finished with eight of a possible 14 Tonys, won best musical, and the updated "Rodgers&Hammerstein's Oklahoma!" won best musical revival. "The Boys in the Band," with a starry cast including CMU's Zachary Quinto and Matt Bomer, was the winner among play revivals.
What viewers might have missed, unless they were streaming the preshow, was an entrance that continued the red-carpet reign of Pittsburgh native Billy Porter, a presenter on Sunday. Red-carpet style is generally left to the other big awards shows, but this year there was anticipation for Porter, who had conquered the Golden Globes, Oscars and Met Gala, among others, in 2019.
The winning streak continued in a creation by Celestino Couture: A pink-and-red tailored suit, embellished with Swarovski crystals and a massive train, was made from the velvet curtain that was the gateway to the role of his lifetime, in "Kinky Boots," for which he won the 2013 Tony as best actor in a musical.
Porter, who graduated from and was an instructor at CMU, represented his alma mater by presenting the Excellence in Theatre award, a co-presentation of the university at the Tonys.
DeRoy, who had six nominations, was a producer of Kenneth Lonergan's "The Waverly Gallery." The revival gave lead actress Elaine May, best known for her writing and teaming with Mike Nichols, her first Tony at age 87.
Two of her shows, "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Network," starred Jeff Daniels and Bryan Cranston, respectively. It was Cranston who won the battle of best-known stars on Broadway this year, as mad-as-hell news anchor Howard Beale.
Best musical "Hadestown," which began as Anais Mitchell's concept album that retells the Orpheus and Eurydice Greek myth, won eight of a possible 14 Tony Awards.
Rachel Chavkin, the only female director of a musical on Broadway this season, took home her first Tony and called out the lack of other women directors and directors of color as "a failure of imagination." Another "Hadestown" winner, sound designer Jessica Paz, with Nevin Steinberg, was the first woman to be nominated in that category.
The awards for musical actors were spread out, with favorites Santino Fontana winning best actor for "Tootsie" and Stephanie J. Block for "The Cher Show." It was Block's third nomination. Calling herself a "theater nerd," she said, "This is not a speech. It's a journal entry from when I was about 12 or 13 and talking about how I just wanted to desperately be part of this community."
The updated production of "Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!" took home best revival - there were only two in the category this year - and gave Ali Stroker the win as best featured actress in a musical. The former "Glee" actress, in a wheelchair due to a car accident that left her paralyzed from the chest down, received a standing ovation and said her win was "for every kid . who has a disability, who has a limitation or a challenge who has been waiting to see themselves represented in this arena." She had previously broken barriers as part of the Deaf West company of "Spring Awakening" in 2015.
On hand as a presenter was Smithton native and Oscar winner Shirley Jones, 85, who is best known for her musical movies, including "Oklahoma!" She got her start at the Pittsburgh Playhouse in Oakland and served as honorary chairwoman of the campaign that helped build the new Playhouse Downtown.
"Hadestown's" Andre De Shields, whose Broadway career began in 1975, had previous Tony nominations in 1997 for "Play On" and 2001 for "The Full Monty." He picked up his first win Sunday as best featured actor in a musical. His competition included "Hadestown" co-star Patrick Page, Pittsburgh CLO's Scrooge for two seasons.
You can bet that the musicals that scored big wins, whether or not they hang around on Broadway, will be on tour in the future or coming soon to a high school or college near you.
CMU was in the Tonys winners circle well before the night began. It had been previously announced that alums Michael McElroy would be a Tonys Honor recipient as founder of Broadway Inspirational Voices and actress Judith Light would be awarded the 2019 Isabelle Stevenson Award for her service to those suffering with HIV/AIDS and to the LBGTQ+ community. Light called it a "privilege" to serve, and said it was "extremely humbling" to receive the honor.

New York City's Evolving Skyline

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
More than 1.5 million people commute into Manhattan every day, according to United States Census data. Many of these commuters get to appreciate the fullness of the skyline in a way that those who live on the island may not.
This widely shared experience inspired Ken McFarlin, an art director for The Times's Real Estate section who has commuted by bus from upstate New York into the city for the last 25 years. On a recent morning, before his bus turned into the Lincoln Tunnel, he gazed at the skyline.
"It just struck me," Mr. McFarlin said. "Particularly on the West Side, the skyline has dramatically changed."
Initially, he considered a cover story, but decided that the horizontal nature of the "pano-8," a 48-inch-wide folded pullout, would most naturally serve the skyline. "Touching the Sky," a special section, ran in Sunday's paper.


"In the last 10 to 15 years, we've seen this explosion of new development in really tall buildings," said Stefanos Chen, the reporter on the project.
Seven of the nine completed towers in New York that are over 1,000 feet tall were built after 2007. (The New York Times Building, completed in 2007, is in the top 10, tied with the Chrysler Building at 1,046 feet.) An additional 16 such towers are being planned or are under construction, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a Chicago-based nonprofit that tracks high-rise construction and helped Mr. Chen with his reporting.
"Not since the 1930s, when the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were in this race to become the tallest in the city has the skyline changed so dramatically," said Vivian Toy, Real Estate editor for The Times.
"The West Side of the skyline is completely different than what it was 20 or 30 years ago, namely because of Hudson Yards and all the construction farther up into the 50s," she said.
Before, skyscrapers were mainly built for commercial use.
"Back then, [these buildings] represented sort of the height of engineering as well as commerce," Mr. Chen said. "And this represented a beacon of prosperity in a lot of ways for New Yorkers."
In 1930, a headline in The Times read, "The Empire State Building Soars Upward, as a Modern Army Daily, Defeats Time, Far Above the Throngs on Fifth Avenue."
Today the towers being constructed are increasingly residential and mixed-use.
In a review of Hudson Yards, which privatized much of the last large piece of undeveloped land in Manhattan, Michael Kimmelman, The Times's chief architecture critic, asked, "Is This the Neighborhood New York Deserves?"
"They don't seem to speak to people the same way," Mr. Chen said of the newest generation of skyscrapers. "People still buy postcards of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, but no one's getting a postcard of 432 Park. At least, not yet."
The heights of these residential buildings and their costs -- an apartment at 220 Central Park South closed in January for a record $ 238 million, and is perhaps the most expensive home in America -- seem to illustrate the vast wealth disparity in the city and beyond.
Of course, wealth disparity in New York City is nothing new.
"The Gilded Age was the Gilded Age, right? There was a vast gap between the haves and have-nots then," Ms. Toy said. "Then, they lived along the park in massive townhouses and mansions."
"Now they're willing to pay prices to be higher up and because it's a much more global economy now, they're willing to pay these prices just to spend a few weeks here in the city, as a lot of these people have multiple homes in big cities all around the world," Ms. Toy added.
While the average New Yorker or tourist may not have the money to enjoy the views from the top of these new skyscrapers, there are plenty of free spaces to take in the ever changing skyline in its entirety.
Tony Cenicola, the photographer assigned to this project, shot the skyline while riding the (free) Staten Island Ferry and from parks in Weehawken, N.J., and Queens. (Although, there was a brief moment when he considered renting a kayak to capture the southern views of the city.)
"I grew up in Queens, so this is my skyline because when you're in Manhattan you don't get to appreciate this skyline," Mr. Chen said. "So, this is a story for outer-borough folk as well."

What the media has lost since Watergate

Texto completo: The question from an audience member made the three network chiefs bristle:
Why aren't the news media holding the White House accountable like they did during the Nixon/Watergate era?
One of the TV honchos, Susan Zirinsky, had the perfect background to answer.
Just minutes before, she had described how - as a college student working part time at CBS - she was briefly in charge of the empty Washington bureau on Oct. 20, 1973, when news of the "Saturday Night Massacre" began to break: President Richard Nixon had fired the special prosecutor. Forty-six years later, Zirinsky really is in charge at CBS; she was named president of the network early this year.
"We are holding this White House accountable - this is our job every day," she said, with conviction ringing in her voice.
But it may not seem that way to those members of the public who'd like President Trump's lies and misdeeds to catch up with him the way Nixon's eventually did, but foresee little hope of that.
"You can't compare the eras," Zirinsky said.
As the anniversary of the Watergate scandal's beginning comes around again - the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters was on June 17, 1972 - investigative journalism's effectiveness is weakened. The reporting may be every bit as skilled, but the results are greatly diluted because so much has changed in the nation, including its media.
During the Watergate era, as Zirinsky noted, there were three networks. Now, cable news, talk radio, thousands of websites and social media create a polluted firehose-blast of information mixed with disinformation.
"The cacophony," Zirinsky said, "is very hard to break through." (Her remarks came during a panel discussion at last week's "Future of News" conference in New York City.)
Back then, what was said on those three networks - often fed by revelations from The Washington Post's Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein - was largely believed.
Much more than now, there was a shared set of facts.
That doesn't mean there was agreement about what to do about those facts, or that there wasn't plenty of political spin and denial. ("I am not a crook," Nixon famously said, though he was.)
But in general, straight news was not relentlessly countered by bad-faith propaganda in the style of Fox News's Sean Hannity. (Recall that Fox News, with all of its intended-from-the-start evils, was founded in 1996.)
News came to citizens from sources they trusted - including their local newspapers. While many editorial pages supported Nixon almost to the end, front pages all around the country were telling people what was happening, blow by blow. Those papers are no longer a major news source in many places. Facebook, though, is.
What's more, as Columbia University Journalism School professor William Grueskin pointed out to me recently, today's situation is not only about how the media has changed.
"The press can do only so much," he said.
"Without an independent judiciary, plus a Congress that's invested in a genuine search for truth, rather than covering for the president, even the most intrepid journalism can slip into the void."
Grueskin mentions, in particular, the Watergate-era judiciary, particularly John Sirica, the district court judge who got defendant James McCord to fess up about the Watergate burglary and who helped compel Nixon to turn over the damaging White House tapes. (The first line of Sirica's Washington Post obituary described him as the judge "whose persistence in searching for the facts while presiding over the Watergate cases led to President Nixon's resignation.")
And this: On July 24, 1974, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld Sirica's order that the president must cough up the Watergate tapes. Two weeks later, Nixon announced his resignation.
Grueskin added that there also was a more upstanding U.S. Senate, as personified by Howard Baker, the ranking Republican on the Watergate committee, who despite initial inclinations became genuinely interested in getting to the bottom of the scandal, exemplified by his famous query: "What did the president know, and when did he know it?"
Today's journalistic work - David Fahrenthold's investigation of Trump finances in The Post, Lester Holt's interview with Trump about why he fired FBI director James B. Comey on NBC, the many investigations into the Trump administration's contacts with Russian officials during the campaign - should have made far more difference than it has.
In an earlier era, too, the Mueller report very probably would have blown a presidency out of the water.
As presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren put it with admirable directness in a recent MSNBC town hall, she was left with three undeniable takeaways after an intense session of reading it into the night:
"Part one, a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 elections for the purpose of getting Donald Trump elected. Part two, then-candidate Donald Trump welcomed that help. And part three, when the federal government tried to investigate part one and part two, Donald Trump as president delayed, deflected, moved, fired, and did everything he could to obstruct justice."
Warren added: "If he were any other person in the United States, based on what's documented in that report, he would be carried out in handcuffs."
Much of what was in the report had already been reported in the press - in The Post, the New York Times, on the network news, and by reporters for ProPublica, BuzzFeed News, Mother Jones and the Wall Street Journal.
But, as Susan Zirinsky put it, it's lost in the cacophony. (Televised impeachment hearings, of course, might change that to some degree.)
What does get through the noise to sway the public may then be lost in an increasingly politicized judiciary - Brett M. Kavanaugh, anyone? - and the reactions of a venal Senate majority leader and his minions.
By itself, journalism - no matter how proficient or how brave - can't save us from political corruption at the highest level. It never could.
Just as in the 1970s, the Fourth Estate needs the official branches of government to do their jobs, too.
Sadly, there's less reason now to believe they will.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - When the Trump administration declared an emergency last month and fast-tracked the sale of more American arms to Saudi Arabia, it did more than anger members of Congress who opposed the sale on humanitarian grounds.
It also raised concerns that the Saudis could gain access to technology that would let them produce their own versions of American precision-guided bombs - weapons they have used in strikes on civilians since they began fighting a war in Yemen four years ago.
The emergency authorization allows Raytheon Co., a top American defense firm, to team with the Saudis to build high-tech bomb parts in Saudi Arabia. That provision, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broad package of information the administration released last week to Congress.
The move grants Raytheon and the Saudis sweeping permission to begin assembling the control systems, guidance electronics and circuit cards that are essential to the company's Pave-way smart bombs. The United States has closely guarded such technology for national security reasons.
Multiple reports by human rights groups over the past four years have singled out the weapons as being used in airstrikes on civilians. One attack, on a Sanaa funeral home in October 2016, led the Obama administration to suspend bomb sales to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.
The new arrangement is part of a larger arms package, previously blocked by Congress, that includes 120,000 precision-guided bombs that Raytheon is prepared to ship to the coalition. These will add to the tens of thousands of bombs that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have already stockpiled, and some in Congress fear the surplus would let the countries continue fighting in Yemen long into the future. The move also includes support for Saudi F-15 warplanes, mortars, anti-tank missiles and .50-caliber rifles.
The emergency declaration, invoked in part because of tensions with Iran, prompted a broad bipartisan pushback from lawmakers who were concerned not only about the war, but also about whether the Trump administration was usurping congressional authority to approve arms sales.
A group of senators that includes Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Robert Menendez, D-N.J., announced Wednesday that they would introduce 22 separate measures expressing disapproval of the deals.
"Few nations should be trusted less than Saudi Arabia," Paul said in a statement Thursday. "In recent years, they have fomented human atrocities, repeatedly lied to the United States and have proved to be a reckless regional pariah. It is concerning and irresponsible for the United States to continue providing them arms."
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
A Raytheon spokesman said there was nothing unusual about the production arrangement.
Defense contractors have established close ties with the Trump administration, and key executives from several companies, including Raytheon, have made their way into high-ranking positions. Raytheon's former vice president for government relations, Mark T. Esper, was confirmed as Army secretary in 2017.
The production agreement took some lawmakers by surprise. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., an outspoken critic of the Yemen war, said it seemed "to serve no purpose other than to forfeit our technology and prevent future congressional oversight."
The arrangement, which would effectively outsource jobs, appears to be at odds with Trump's position that arms sales are important because of the American jobs they create.

Texto completo: "The Queen" by Josh Levin Little, Brown, 432 pages, $29, out now: While on the presidential campaign trail in 1976, Ronald Reagan sought to illustrate welfare fraud by referencing a Chicago woman who "held the record" in collecting ill-gotten government checks. The actual woman behind the stereotype, Linda Taylor, was first called "welfare queen" by the Chicago Tribune, but her story is far more complex, ignored by the press and politicians who borrowed aspects of her image to vilify poor people of color. In re-examining the myth, Slate's Josh Levin explores racism in America and oversimplified narratives that still dominate political discourse.
"On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" by Ocean Vuong Penguin, 256 pages, $26, out now: It's a big summer for debut novels, and this one by poet Ocean Vuong may be the most widely hyped of them all. "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" is a letter from a man in his late 20s addressed to a mother who can't read it. Examining race, class, loss, masculinity and the power of story, Vuong's work is already being hailed as "brilliant," "shattering" and "an epistolary masterpiece."
"In West Mills" by De'Shawn Charles Winslow Bloomsbury, 272 pages, $26, out now: Set in a rural black neighborhood in North Carolina, De'Shawn Charles Winslow's first novel follows a headstrong woman, Azalea "Knot" Centre, determined to live life on her own terms. Over nearly five decades, she and other residents of her tightly knit community grapple with interpersonal drama and long-buried secrets. Early reviews applaud the book's "warmth," and Rebecca Makkai, author of "The Great Believers," calls Winslow's voice "arresting and important and new."
"Recursion" by Blake Crouch Crown, 336 pages, $27, June 11: Last fall, Netflix scooped up the rights to Blake Crouch's "Recursion," which will be developed into a feature film and TV series - and the book isn't out until mid-June. The latest novel from the author of the Wayward Pines trilogy is part sci-fi thriller and part police procedural, with a little romance thrown in for good measure. Starring New York City cop Barry Sutton and brilliant neuroscientist Helena Smith, it explores the lengths people will go to preserve their most precious memories - or, given the chance, reinvent them entirely.
"Fleishman Is in Trouble" by Taffy Brodesser-Akner Random House, 384 pages, $27, June 18: Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, tackles marriage, divorce, ambition and identity in her debut novel. When Toby Fleishman and his wife of more than 14 years, Rachel, decide to separate, the Manhattan hepatologist assumes he knows what he's in for: co-parenting their preteen kids, a chance to put himself out there on dating apps, etc. His assumptions are upended when Rachel drops off their children at his place and ghosts.
"The Vagabonds" by Jeff Guinn Simon & Schuster, 320 pages, $28, July 9: Summer road trips weren't always the popular American pastime they are today. Back when cars were unreliable and roads barely passable, they were downright impractical. So it was a big deal when Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and tire-maker Harvey Firestone decided to spend a series of summers from 1915 to 1925 road tripping around the country. Though the self-described "Vagabonds" traveled with chefs, butlers and other personnel (not exactly roughing it), their ultimate mission was to assess American roadways and drive the automobile straight into ubiquity.
"The Need" by Helen Phillips Simon & Schuster, 272 pages, $26, July 9: The author of "The Beautiful Bureaucrat" returns with an existential thriller that unearths truths about modern motherhood. Molly is a paleobotanist at a fossil quarry and mom to two young children whose life turns upside down when an intruder wearing a deer mask confronts her in her home.
"On the Clock" by Emily Guendelsberger Little, Brown, 352 pages, $28, July 16: In a timely and important look at the harsh realities of the modern American workplace, journalist Emily Guendelsberger recounts her experiences doing hourly labor all over the country. Threatened by automation, low-wage jobs have become all about efficiency but at the cost of humanity. Her question: How can we make such work more humane?
"The Nickel Boys" by Colson Whitehead Doubleday, 224 pages, $24.95, July 16: A great deal of buzz surrounds Colson Whitehead's follow-up to "The Underground Railroad," his searing 2016 novel that won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, the National Book Award and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Literary Prize. Set in Jim Crow-era Florida, his new book centers on two boys sentenced to a juvenile reformatory where abuse, assault and corruption run rampant. Whitehead based the nightmarish Nickel Academy on a real reform school that used to operate in Florida.
"Three Women" by Lisa Taddeo Avid Reader, 320 pages, $27, July 27: For this impressive feat of narrative nonfiction, Lisa Taddeo spent nearly a decade with a high school student in North Dakota, an entrepreneur in Seattle and a homemaker in suburban Indiana to write an immersive account of the sex lives of ordinary American women. Critics are already raving about this carefully crafted portrait of female desire.
"Trick Mirror" by Jia Tolentino Random House, 304 pages, $27, Aug. 6: Jia Tolentino's incisive cultural commentary has graced the pages of The New Yorker, the NPR airwaves and even the recent "Fyre Fraud" documentary. Soon, her deft insights arrive in book form with "Trick Mirror," an essay collection that probes these precarious times - scams, the devolution of the internet, our optimization fixation - to consider how a near-constant focus on self warps our vision.
"Coventry" by Rachel Cusk FSG, 256 pages, $27, Aug. 20: Rachel Cusk is admired for her heady autofiction, particularly the much-talked-about Outline trilogy. Now a new collection of nonfiction - covering everything from art and family life to feminism and politics - allows Cusk fans a chance to jump back inside her brilliant brain.
"How to Be an Antiracist" by Ibram X. Kendi One World, 320 pages, $27, Aug. 20: Ibram X. Kendi - author of "Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America," which won a 2016 National Book Award for Nonfiction - turns his attention toward achieving a more just and equitable future. Blending memoir, social commentary, history and science, "How to Be an Antiracist" seeks to reshape the conversation about racial justice in America: from how not to be racist, to how to be an antiracist.
"Everything Inside" by Edwidge Danticat Knopf, 240 pages, $25.95, Aug. 27: Edwidge Danticat, the acclaimed author of such works as "Brother, I'm Dying" and "Claire of the Sea Light," situates her new story collection in Miami, Port-au-Prince and an unnamed Caribbean country. These eight intimate stories confront everything from birth to death, fractured relationships to unlikely reunions.
"Five Days Gone" by Laura Cumming Scribner, 320 pages, $26, Aug. 27: Every family has its secrets but, as Laura Cumming discovered, some are more unsettling than others. The art critic for The Observer learned, half a century after the fact, that when her mother was 3 years old, she was kidnapped from a beach in England and not found for several days. No one was accused of a crime. Cumming revisits the mystery of her late mother's life.

Texto completo: The party isn’t over for the Warriors but the fun is.
You know this thing has gone off the tracks if you’re the wife of the owner, sitting courtside next to the ultimate rapper power couple, when you lean across Beyoncé to ask Jay-Z if you can get him a lime in his vodka and soda … and are vilified globally.
That’s what happened to Nicole Curran, the wife of Warriors owner Joe Lacob, in Game 3 of the Finals when fans of Beyoncé – known as the Beyhive – decided the video showed their idol’s space being invaded, setting off a viral maelstrom, which, a tearful Curran said, included death threats.
In fact, nothing bad had happened, as confirmed by Beyoncé’s spokesperson who asked fans to “spread love, not hate.”
Unfortunately, all that was spreading that night for the Warriors was pain. Minority owner Mark Stevens, also sitting courtside, pushed away Toronto’s Kyle Lowry, who was chasing a loose ball, then, when Lowry protested, cursed at him.
The NBA barred Stevens for a year, fined him $500,000 and may force him to sell his 7% of the team.
Nor did Game 3 go so hot for the team. The injury-plagued Warriors were totally outclassed by the Raptors, a heretofore little-known crew that had avoided overtime in Game 7 of the second round with the stumbling 76ers on Kawhi Leonard’s shot that bounced four times on the rim … then was thought to be toast after trailing the Bucks 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals.
The Raptors led Game 3 for 46:35 of 48 minutes, winning 123-109 as Warriors Coach Steve Kerr took out his starters with 1:37 left, a surrender rarely seen in the Finals.
Remember when the Warriors were the adorable dynasty with cute Steph Curry and his band of merry marksmen?
Remember when they seemed invincible … like last week?
Then, out of nowhere, came this unexpected death struggle, capping a four-year glory run in which the Warriors once posted a record 73-9 finish and then landed Kevin Durant … won three titles, blowing a fourth in 2016 after leading 3-1 … then for the maraschino cherry atop the sundae of their magnificence, got DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year, $5.3 million deal.
Unfortunately for them, or fortunately for fans who tired of their domination and self-inflation, it seemed as if the gods had also had enough of the Warriors, whose starters began disappearing even as they went 12-4 in the West draw.
April 15: Cousins goes out in Game 2 in the opening round against the Clippers.
May 8: Durant is lost in Game 5 in the second round against the Rockets.
June 2: Klay Thompson and Kevin Looney go down in Game 2 of the Finals.
June 5: Raptors go up 2-1 as Curran offers Jay-Z a lime and Stevens reaches out and touches someone. Warriors haters just wish it had involved Lacob, the majority owner, who tipped off his self-importance after winning his first title, telling the New York Times his team was “light years” ahead of the others.
Not that a merely 2-1 deficit discouraged the Warriors. With Thompson returning for Game 4, they expected to lock this up in six games … with them as champions, of course.
“We just gotta continue to battle and win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6, and celebrate,” said Draymond Green, team braggart. “Fun times ahead.”
Oops.
June 7: Klay goes for 28 points in Game 4 but they fall again. Once again, it isn’t close, with the Raptors winning 105-92.
With KD hoping to make it back for Game 5, the Warriors now expect to pull this one out in seven.
Win or lose, they’re going into a new arena in San Francisco next season, in which their fans, known for enthusiastically backing the team in the bad times, will have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in personal seat licenses as well as the standard exorbitant ticket prices.
So they may have already played their last game in friendly little Oracle Arena … which their loyal fans commemorated by fleeing up the aisles before it was over.
To give them their due, the Warriors really have been special.
They haven’t just been good but entertaining, sparking a revolution in offense. Curry is surely the greatest shooter in NBA history. Steph and Klay are surely the best shooting backcourt. The Steph-Klay-KD combination is one of the NBA’s greatest.
They’re also nice people. Kerr is a great quote and a super-nice man. Curry is said to be as wonderful a person as he is a player. For all KD’s whining, he’s considered a nice guy. For all Green’s braggadocio, he’s an unfailing stand-up guy who never uses the dodge of blaming his latest outrage on the press.
Lacob deserves his share of credit. It was his idea to hire Jerry West as a consultant, making the Warriors the first team to pay over $1 million for a part-timer … which turned out to be a bargain. If Jeanie Buss had been as savvy as Lacob when West was looking to rejoin her team, the Lakers might be in far better shape.
In the biggest “unfortunately” for the Warriors, more is at stake than one title.
The season has been played under the shadow of Durant’s ambition after he turned down a $150 million extension for a one-year deal to become a free agent this summer.
Insiders have paired Durant and Boston’s Kyrie Irving all season. Now with reports that Kyrie is leaning toward signing with the Nets … and Brooklyn trading salary to get a second maximum slot … the KD Leaves scenario looks ever more real.
It’s not over yet for the Warriors, but we’re about to see how many light years ahead they are now.

China Warns Tech Companies About Complying With Trade Restrictions; Beijing has been pushing back against the Trump administration's limits on access to advanced American technology

Texto completo: Chinese authorities summoned some of the world's largest tech companies this week to tell them they could face repercussions if they respond too aggressively to U.S. trade restrictions, according to people familiar with the matter.
Called by China's National Development and Reform Commission on Tuesday and Wednesday, the meetings with more than a dozen companies add a new dimension to Beijing's pushback against the Trump administration's restrictions on access to advanced American technology amid a lengthy trade dispute.
Among the companies called in were chip makers Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc., ARM Holdings PLC and SK Hynix Inc., software giant Microsoft Corp., South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co., computer maker Dell Technologies Inc., Finnish electronics company Nokia Corp. and networking equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc., according to one of the people.
Intel and ARM declined to comment. The other companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
The warnings, previously reported by the New York Times, followed several rounds of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on billions of dollars of goods flowing from China to the U.S. As trade talks faltered last month, the administration upped the ante by putting Huawei Technologies Co. on a trade blacklist, further chilling already cold ties between the world's two biggest superpowers.
The move against Huawei disallowed sales to the telecom giant without a Commerce Department license. China responded by announcing an "unreliable entity list" for foreign companies that stopped supplies to China or took other actions seen as damaging the interests of Chinese companies.
On Saturday, Chinese official news agency Xinhua reported the NDRC, China's central economic planning body, was studying the establishment of yet another list system to "more effectively forestall and defuse national security risks." Xinhua also said in a commentary that this new system would prevent "certain countries from using Chinese technologies and simultaneously curbing China's development."
In the meetings this week, Chinese officials told foreign tech companies that there would be unspecified consequences if they pulled out of China, ended business partnerships there or stopped supplying products to Chinese customers, especially if those moves were in line with mandates by countries China saw as breakers of international rules, one person familiar with the matter said.
Another person familiar with the meetings said the Chinese understood that multinational companies had to comply with U.S. law, but that their message was that the firms shouldn't pare back their exposure to China any more than they were required to.
The person described the meetings between midlevel China-based company executives and midlevel NDRC bureaucrats as cordial but unusual. In addition to delivering the warning, Chinese officials asked what the companies' barriers were to doing business and how the Chinese government could help, the person said.
Companies with U.S. operations must comply with the administration's restrictions on their dealings with China. They can, however, seek licenses from the Commerce Department that allow them to continue trading with Huawei or any other entity that faces similar restrictions in the future.
China's targeting of American technology has been central to the Trump administration's trade concerns. The same day Huawei was blacklisted last month, Mr. Trump issued an executive order banning foreign technology dealings when they raised national security concerns, citing "malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage."
Negotiations with China appeared to be progressing toward a trade deal before last month, when the administration accused China of reneging on commitments by seeking significant changes to an agreed-upon deal. That set off another round of punishments and reprisals by both sides, with the U.S. raising tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and China slapping new tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China's NDRC couldn't be reached by telephone late Saturday.

Texto completo: Outspoken host of Parts Unknown Anthony Bourdain died one year ago Saturday. Bourdain was known for his love of travel, food — and his colorful commentary.
Bourdain described himself as merely an "enthusiast" on social media, but fans know he was so much more. He was a favorite TV personality and a commentator on the world.
Here are some memorable quotes from Bourdain on life, travel and food:
"I don’t really care about what people say about me when I’m gone, I guess Jerry Stahl would make an entertaining — if not necessarily flattering — story of the gruesome details," Bourdain said in 2017 New York Times interview.
"As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life — and travel — leaves marks on you. Most of the time, those marks — on your body or on your heart — are beautiful. Often, though, they hurt," he said on Parts Unknown, reported by Thrillist.
On retirement: “I gave up on that. I’ve tried. I just think I’m just too nervous, neurotic, driven,” he told People earlier this year. “ I’m quite sure I can’t. I’m going to pretty much die in the saddle. ”
"Without experimentation, a willingness to ask questions and try new things, we shall surely become static, repetitive, and moribund. " —Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook
“Do we really want to travel in hermetically sealed popemobiles through the rural provinces of France, Mexico and the Far East, eating only in Hard Rock Cafes and McDonald's? Or do we want to eat without fear, tearing into the local stew, the humble taqueria's mystery meat, the sincerely offered gift of a lightly grilled fish head? I know what I want. I want it all. I want to try everything once. ” —Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly
On his favorite food: “Anytime I’m eating spicy noodles in a bowl, I’m happy,” he told Bon Appétit Magazine in an interview published last year.
“I was an angry kid,” he told NPR last year. “I was a happy dishwasher. I jokingly say that I learned every important lesson, all the most important lessons of my life as a dishwasher. ”
"I do not have a particularly prestigious or notable career," he said in the same interview. "And for much of the time as a chef, I was unemployable by respectable businesses. "

"I stand unhesitatingly and unwaveringly with the women," he wrote in an article published on Medium last year.

Texto completo: I'll start with a personal experience and then try to expand into Republicans and big tech.
In the spring of 2016, Facebook came under pressure, stemming from leaks by its workers, over charges of systemic political bias. I was not especially interested: a Silicon Valley company that employs thousands of young people to make decisions that are often ideological will tilt left, and conservatives must factor that in, as they're used to doing.
My concerns about Facebook had to do with its apparently monopolistic nature, slippery ethics and algorithmic threats to serious journalism.
Soon after, I received an email from Mark Zuckerberg's office inviting me and other "conservative activists" to attend a meeting with him to discuss the bias charges in an off-the-record conversation. I responded that I was not an activist but a columnist, for the Journal, and would be happy to attend in that capacity and on the record. That didn't go over too well with Mr. Zuckerberg's office! I was swiftly told that wouldn't do.
What I most remember is that they didn't mention where his office is. There was an air of being summoned by the prince. You know where the prince lives. In the castle. Who doesn't know exactly where Facebook is?
In February 2018 Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein of Wired wrote a deeply reported piece that mentioned the 2016 meeting. It was called so that the company could "make a show of apologizing for its sins." A Facebook employee who helped plan it said part of its goal -- they are clever at Facebook and knew their mark! -- was to get the conservatives fighting with each other. "They made sure to have libertarians who wouldn't want to regulate the platform and partisans who would." Another goal was to leave attendees "bored to death" by a technical presentation after Mr. Zuckerberg spoke.
Predictably, the conservatives "failed to unify in a way that was either threatening or coherent." Many used the time "to try to figure out how they could get more followers for their own pages."
After the meeting, attendees gushed, calling Mr. Zuckerberg and his staffers humble and open. Glenn Beck praised the CEO's "earnest desire to 'connect the world.'"
Never were pawns so happily used.
I forgot about it until last summer, when Mr. Zuckerberg's office wrote again. His problems were mounting. I was invited now, with an unspecified group of others, to "an off the record discussion over dinner at his home in Palo Alto." They used that greasy greaseball language Silicon Valley uses: Mr. Zuckerberg is "focused on protecting" users and thinking about "the future and how best to serve the Facebook community."
I ignored the invitation. They pressed. Their last note reached me at an irritated moment, so I wrote back a rocket, reminding him of the previous meeting and how it had been revealed to be a mischievous and highly political enacting of faux remorse. I suggested that though it was an honor to be asked to cross a continent for the privilege of giving him my time, thought and advice, I would not. I added that I was sorry to say he strikes me in his public, and now semiprivate, presentations as an imperious twerp.
For a second I actually hesitated: The imperious twerp runs the algorithms, controls the traffic, has all the dark powers! But I am an American, and one with her Irish up, so I hit send.
And I'm still here, at least at the moment, so I guess that's OK.
Facebook's famous sins and failings include the abuse of private data, selling space to Russian propagandists in the 2016 presidential campaign, starving journalism of ad revenues, monopolistically acquiring or doing in possible competitors, political mischief, and turning users into the unknowing product. I once wrote the signal fact of Mr. Zuckerberg's career is that he is supremely gifted in one area -- monetizing technical ingenuity by marrying it to a canny sense of human weakness.
None of this is news. We just can't manage to do anything about it.
Now there are moves to push back. The House Judiciary Committee will hold antitrust investigations into big tech. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is warning that "unwarranted concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy." Sen. Elizabeth Warren has made a splash with her pushback on big tech; Sen. Amy Klobuchar included it in her presidential announcement speech.
The New York Times this week had a breakthrough report, from Cecilia Kang and Kenneth Vogel, on how the tech giants are fighting back. They are "amassing an army of lobbyists." Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple spent a combined $55 million in lobbying last year, about double what they spent in 2016. They "have intensified their efforts to lure lobbyists with strong connections to the White House, the regulatory agencies, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress." Facebook hired Mrs. Pelosi's former chief of staff. The speaker herself has received major campaign money from employees and political-action committees of all the tech giants. Google pays lobbyists who worked on the Republican staff of House Judiciary.
They've got it wired, haven't they?
But the mood in America is anti-big-tech. Everyone knows they're too powerful, too arrogant, loom too large in public life.
And something else: This whole new world of new technology was born in the 1970s and '80s. We still think it's new and we're figuring it out, but we're almost half a century into it and we can see what works and what doesn't, what's had good effects and hasn't. It is time to move.
We're Americans and we love money and success and the hallowed story of the kid in the garage who invents the beautiful product that changes the world.
And Republican officials -- they can't help it, they don't just rightly love business; they love big business, they love titans. It's almost romantic: Look what people can do in America! He started it in his dorm room! And now we're at lunch!
It's all too human, and of course greedy: Maybe these guys will start giving me money! I mean Pelosi-size money!
Here's what they should be thinking: Break them up. Break them in two, in three; regulate them. Declare them to be what they've so successfully become: once a pleasure, now a utility.
It all depends on Congress, which has been too stupid to move in the past and is too stupid to move competently now. That's what's slowed those of us who want reform, knowing how badly they'd do it.
Yet now I find myself thinking: I don't care. Do it incompetently, but do something.
Why are Republicans so slow to lead? The Times quoted Republican Sen. Josh Hawley as saying "the dominance of big tech" is a "big problem." They "may be more socially powerful than the trusts of the Roosevelt era, and yet they still operate like a black box."
He's right.
But I read about lobbyists coming at Republican congressional leaders and I think, it's going to be like Mr. Zuckerberg's meeting with the conservatives in 2016. A tech god will give them some attention, some respect, and they'll fold like a cheap suit.
If they are as stupid and unserious as their critics take them to be, they will go to the meeting and be used.
They should say no and hit send.

NOT AGAIN ... ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN WHY 'TARIFF' IS NOT A 'BEAUTIFUL WORD'

Texto completo: Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on Mexican exports unless our neighbor does something - he hasn't specified what - to stop the flow of asylum-seekers is almost surely illegal: U.S. trade law gives presidents discretion to impose tariffs for a number of reasons, but curbing immigration isn't one of them. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="21004">
It's also a clear violation of U.S. international agreements. And it will reduce the living standards of most Americans, destroy many jobs in U.S. manufacturing, and hurt farmers.
But let's put all of that to one side and talk about the really bad stuff.
Mr. Trump tweets that "TARIFF is a beautiful word indeed," but the actual history of U.S. tariffs isn't pretty - and not just because tariffs, whatever the tweeter in chief says, essentially are taxes on Americans, not foreigners. In fact, it's now a good bet that Mr. Trump's tariffs will more than wipe out whatever breaks middle-class Americans got from the 2017 tax cut.
The more important fact is that until the 1930s, tariff policy was a cesspool of corruption and special-interest politics. One of the main purposes of the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which eventually became the template for the modern world trading system, was to drain that particular swamp by removing the capriciousness of previous tariff policy.
Mr. Trump's erratic trade actions, unconstrained by what we used to think were the legal rules, have brought the capriciousness back, and good old-fashioned corruption - if it isn't happening already - won't be far behind.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="21010">
Beyond that, tariff policy is inextricably linked with America's role as a global superpower. Central to that role is the expectation that the U.S. will be both reliable and responsible - that it will honor whatever agreements it makes and, more broadly, that it will make policy with an eye to the effects of its actions on the rest of the world.
Mr. Trump is throwing all that away. His Mexican tariffs violate both Nafta, which was supposed to guarantee free movement of goods within North America, and our obligations under the World Trade Organization, which, like U.S. law, permits new tariffs only under certain specified conditions. So America has become a lawless actor in world markets, a tariff-policy rogue state.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="21013">
But there's more. By deploying tariffs as a bludgeon against whatever he doesn't like, Mr. Trump is returning America to the kind of irresponsibility it displayed after World War I - irresponsibility that, while obviously not the sole or even the main cause of the Great Depression, the rise of fascism and the eventual coming of World War II, helped create the environment for these disasters.
It is, I believe, pretty widely known that America turned its back on the world after World War I: refusing to join the League of Nations and slamming the doors shut on most immigration (fortunately a few years after my grandparents got here).
What's less known, I suspect, is that America also took a sharply protectionist turn long before the infamous 1930 Smoot Hawley Act. In early 1921, Congress enacted the Emergency Tariff Act, soon followed by the Fordney-McCumber Tariff of 1922. These actions more than doubled average tariffs on dutiable imports. Like Mr. Trump, the advocates of these tariffs claimed that they would bring prosperity to all Americans.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="21017">
They didn't. There was indeed a manufacturing boom, driven not by tariffs but by new products like affordable cars and new technologies like the assembly line. Farmers, however, spent the 1920s suffering from low prices for their products and high prices for farm equipment, leading to a surge in foreclosures.
Part of the problem was that U.S. tariffs were met with retaliation; even before the Depression struck, the world was engaged in a gradually escalating trade war. Making things even worse, U.S. tariffs put our World War I allies in an impossible position: We expected them to repay their huge war debts, but our tariffs made it impossible for them to earn the dollars they needed to make those payments.
And the trade war/debt nexus created a climate of international distrust and bitterness that contributed to the economic and political crises of the 1930s. This experience had a profound effect on U.S. policy after World War II, which was based on the view that free trade and peace went hand in hand.
So am I saying that Mr. Trump is repeating the policy errors America made a century ago? No. This time it's much worse.
After all, while Warren Harding wasn't a very good president, he didn't routinely abrogate international agreements in a fit of pique. While America in the 1920s failed to help build international institutions, it didn't do a Trump and actively try to undermine them. And while U.S. leaders between the wars may have turned a blind eye to the rise of racist dictatorships, they generally didn't praise those dictatorships and compare them favorably to democratic regimes.
There are, however, enough parallels between U.S. tariff policy in the 1920s and Trumpism today for us to have a pretty good picture of what happens when politicians think that tariffs are "beautiful." And it's ugly.

Texto completo: What's on TV
A STAR IS BORN (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. In the latest and fourth remake of this film, Bradley Cooper plays Jackson Maine, an alcoholic country-rock star, who meets Ally Campana (Lady Gaga), a waitress with a powerful voice and a gift for songwriting. Throughout the film, co-written and directed by Cooper, we watch the two collaborate and fall in love. But as Ally's music career soars, Jackson's falters. The film was chosen as a New York Times Critic's Pick by Manohla Dargis, who wrote in her review: "Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it's also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better."
VERY VALENTINE (2019) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Valentine Roncalli (Kelen Coleman) is an apprentice at her grandmother's shoe store, which is one of Greenwich Village's last remaining family-owned businesses. The store, which has been making wedding shoes since 1903, is nearing financial collapse and Valentine steps in to help her grandmother, Teodora Angelini (Jacqueline Bisset), save the business. Based on the novel of the same name by Adriana Trigiani, the film follows Valentine and Teodora as they go to Italy and face obstacles involving their business, family and love lives.
LIES, CRIMES & VIDEO (2019) 8 p.m. on HLN. In this eight-part docu-series, viewers get an inside look at the criminal justice system. Surveillance footage, interrogations, body cameras and jail-house recordings weave together true stories of deceit. The first episode, "Crazy, Sexy & Deadly," is about the murder of Ryan Poston, who was shot in the face. Police interrogate his partner, Shayna Hubers, and what they learn is shocking.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
THE BLACK GODFATHER (2019) Stream on Netflix. Throughout his career, Clarence Avant had an effect on how black culture played into music, film, TV and politics. And he was an unofficial mentor to several influential black artists, athletes and politicians. Directed by Reginald Hudlin, this documentary chronicles Avant's expert ability to shape how the world viewed black people. Interviews in the film include the rappers Snoop Dogg and Ludacris, artists like Quincy Jones and Bill Withers, and two former presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. "Clarence is the bridge from the time where there was no opportunity to a time where doors began to open," Obama says.
HOME AGAIN (2017) Stream on Hulu. Having recently left her husband, Alice Kinney (Reese Witherspoon) moves to Los Angeles with her two daughters in the hopes of starting over. But her love life -- and living situation -- are complicated when three young filmmakers (Pico Alexander, Jon Rudnitsky and Nat Wolff) move in. The film is Hallie Meyers-Shyer's directorial debut; and her mother, the director and screenwriter Nancy Meyers, is a producer.

Texto completo: Linda Fairstein, a prominent sex-crimes prosecutor who became a successful crime novelist, was dropped by her publisher this week after a Netflix mini-series renewed focus on her role in the wrongful conviction of five teenagers for a brutal rape.
Since the series, "When They See Us," premiered last week, Ms. Fairstein, 72, has been the target of tremendous public outrage, including online petitions and a #CancelLindaFairstein hashtag. This week, she resigned from a number of prominent boards, including that of Vassar College, her alma mater.
On Friday, a spokeswoman for Dutton, the Penguin Random House imprint that published Ms. Fairstein, said that she and Dutton "decided to terminate their relationship." A person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were confidential, said that Dutton was buying out Ms. Fairstein's contract.
In 1989, a white woman was savagely raped and beaten in Central Park, where she had been out for a jog. Five black and Latino teenagers -- Korey Wise, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray and Yusef Salaam, who became known as the "Central Park Five" -- were convicted based on confessions that were full of contradictions and lacking in crucial information, and which the boys said were coerced. No forensic evidence connected them to the crime, and DNA evidence that was collected did not match any of the five.
In 2002, a man named Matias Reyes confessed to the crime, an admission confirmed by DNA, and he said that he had acted alone. The convictions against the other men -- each of whom had already served several years in prison -- were overturned.
The Netflix series is a dramatized account of the case, and shows Ms. Fairstein, who is played by Felicity Huffman, determined to see the boys convicted, regardless of inconsistencies and evidence that suggested their innocence. Ms. Fairstein has called her portrayal "grossly and maliciously inaccurate" and threatened legal action. Ava DuVernay, who directed the series and was one of its writers, has not commented on Ms. Fairstein's complaints.
After running the Manhattan district attorney's sex crimes unit for 25 years, Ms. Fairstein retired and turned her attention to writing. She has published 24 books, including 16 that reached the New York Times best-seller lists, according to her publicist, Laura Rossi. Her most recent novel, "Blood Oath," came out in March.

Texto completo: Mary Alice Monroe knew from an early age that she wanted to be a writer. Growing up with nine siblings fostered her imagination, as she would often join her brothers and sisters in writing stories, plays and musicals. But it wasn't until she found herself on bed rest during a difficult pregnancy that she finally found the time to write her first novel.
Now, 22 novels and two picture books later, it's safe to say she's found her calling. But for Monroe, it's about more than just telling stories. After her fifth novel, she moved to South Carolina, joined the island turtle team...and had something of an epiphany.
"I decided my next book would be a vehicle to spread awareness about sea turtles," she said. "I knew my passion and awareness would translate into emotions for my readers, and with so many species in trouble there's a real sense of urgency."
Monroe's newest novel, "The Summer Guests," is set against a backdrop all too familiar for Tallahassee: an approaching hurricane and widespread evacuations. Think the evacuations of Hurricane Irma and the threat of Hurricane Michael rolled together. Instead of sea turtles, the featured animals in this story are horses — whose caretakers face the monumental task of safely moving their very large, powerful and valuable cargo out of the storm's path.
"I think the real question of the story is when you evacuate, what do you take? What do you really value?" Monroe said. "After 20 years of hurricanes, I've learned I throw my animals in the car. The rest is just stuff. It's the memories and relationships that matter the most."
Relationships are the focal point of the story; Monroe likes to raise questions in all of her novels about human relationships with animals and nature and how those relationships are intertwined.
"I hope this story inspires," she said. "And I love the fact that my readers can sit on a beach and be in the world in the novel."
As for inspiration, Monroe offered a few words of advice for aspiring authors.
"Being born with a talent to write is a gift, but to be published you have to hone your craft," she said. "And listen to your editor. Your mother will love every word you've ever written. Your editor will make it better."
Monroe also encouraged people to become active volunteers in their communities, noting volunteering has been the bedrock of her career. For more information on volunteer opportunities, especially as the 2019 hurricane season kicks off, please visit https://www.redcross.org/volunteer/.
If you go
What: Midtown Reader will partner with Friends of the Library and Leon County to host Monroe as part of the Leon County Library Lecture Series. As June marks the beginning of hurricane season, Leon County EMS will also be on hand with disaster preparedness tips and resources

Deflating a Trump 'Scandal'

Texto completo: Democrats have grown expert in these Trump days at creating fake scandals. So it's refreshing to read a previously undisclosed email in which Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a presidential aspirant, destroys a leading narrative even as she highlights her own party's excesses.
The "scandal" here involves Twin Metals Minnesota, which holds two mineral leases on government land outside the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the northeastern part of the state. The Interior Department had renewed the leases continuously for decades. But when Twin Metals got serious about a mine, the Obama administration jumped into bed with green activists who ardently opposed it.
In 2014, Interior delayed the renewals, calling for more "study." In early 2016, the department's solicitor issued a howler of a legal opinion, granting the government new authority to deny Twin Metals automatic lease renewals. It was an Obama extralegal classic: The opinion ignored precedent, existing rights and regular procedure. In a midnight kiss to green activists, the department officially blocked the leases on Dec. 15, 2016.
This highly irregular decision was destined to get a fresh look from the Trump team. The new president's appointees at the Interior and Agricultural departments all came to office determined to restore the law and regulatory certainty. In December 2017, the new Interior principal deputy solicitor found the prior opinion fatally flawed and moved to renew Twin Metals' leases. The company moved on to an arduous environmental review, and it could still be blocked by the feds or the state. Beyond some furious greens, that should have been the end of the matter.
Instead, we are in an age where every move by the executive branch is judged not on the policy merits but on a "corruption" scale. Early in 2017, stories started popping up about how Twin Metals was controlled by the family of a Chilean billionaire. And that billionaire also owns a house in Washington, which he rents out to . . . Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Scandal! Payoff! Sleaze!
It didn't matter to critics that the Chilean doesn't know the Trumps, that Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner have never met their landlord, or that they pay a market rent of $15,000 a month. Nor did it matter that the decision was an obvious one for the Trump team to reconsider on the merits, or that the new opinion was rock-solid and corrected a legal embarrassment.
Democrats and activists have instead spun this as straight-up cronyism. Green groups routinely slam the decision as a favor to "Ivanka's landlord." Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton decried the "shameful reversal" as proof that "big corporate money and special-interest influence now rule again." House Democrats sent letters to Interior and Agriculture Secretaries David Bernhardt and Sonny Perdue harping on the landlord question. The goal is to gin up a scandal of the type activists used to run out other Trump appointees.
Enter Ms. Klobuchar. Or, at least enter an email she wrote to then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Dec. 16, 2016, the day after the leases were blocked. Government sources provided me this missive, in which a furious Ms. Klobuchar punctures the scandal narrative and skewers her own party for putting politics ahead of the law.
Ms. Klobuchar bluntly states that the decision not to renew the lease "just floored me. Trump will reverse this. When you guys leave and are out talking about a job message for rural America, I will be left with the mess and dealing with the actual jobs. But you guys sure got a good story in the New York Times." She's the one who has to run for re-election in a state that still values its mining industry.
She lectures Mr. Vilsack that this "should have been handled through the normal process. It wasn't." She notes that she'd asked written questions in July but got no response. She brutally observes that the failure to do this right is "most likely . . . why we have the trump administration to begin with." She also snaps: "Who cares about answering some pesky questions from a woman senator from the Midwest when you guys and the White House and the activists have all the politics down, right?"
She notes that the company "had had the leases for years," that the situation "will now end up in a lawsuit," and that "trump will reverse the decision or a court will." She adds: "I am not for or against this project but I just wanted a fair process based on science that told us the truth." (A Klobuchar staffer says the senator "has serious concerns about this project being so close to the Boundary Waters and has always wanted a thorough environmental review," and "does not believe the Trump administration will move forward in good faith to protect the environment.")
Here is a Democratic lawmaker, steeped in a home-state issue, calling this what it was: an Obama administration perversion of policy and law, done to appease green donors. She reminds Mr. Vilsack that Republicans will reverse the decision, for the obvious reason that this did not go through a "normal" or "fair" process. The Democrats and activists decrying this "scandal" also know this, although we don't have the benefit of their private correspondence.
Remember this story next time the left hurls another "corruption" accusation. Hard as it is for many to accept, Trump administration officials often act on what they believe to be sound policy. No ulterior motive required.

After 50 Years, Police Apology For Stonewall

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The violent police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York City in 1969 is widely regarded as a seminal event in the gay rights movement. But police officials had long refused to admit that officers' behavior and the raid itself were not justified, leaving a rift between law enforcement and gay-rights supporters that seemed to deepen distrust over the years.
On Thursday, as people around the world began commemorating the 50th anniversary of the clash, New York's police commissioner took a step toward making amends, issuing an unusual official apology on behalf of the Police Department for the actions of officers during the Stonewall uprising.
"The actions taken by the N.Y.P.D. were wrong -- plain and simple," the commissioner, James P. O'Neill, said during an event at Police Headquarters.
It was an admission that gay rights leaders said was momentous and unexpected, if overdue.
"To have the N.Y.P.D. commissioner make these very explicit remarks apologizing, it's really moving," said Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, who is gay and who had a day earlier called for a police apology.
Still, some cautioned the Police Department that its future actions needed to back up its words.
"The history of police violence and criminalization of L.G.B.T.Q. people sadly continues to this day," said Richard Saenz, an attorney at Lambda Legal, a national civil rights organization.
Politicians and gay rights leaders had stepped up their calls for Mr. O'Neill to apologize in recent months, urging a public reckoning as New York hosts World Pride, a global gathering that is taking place in the city this year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising.
During a safety briefing related to World Pride at Police Headquarters, the commissioner offered the formal apology that Police Department officials, including Mr. O'Neill himself, had said for years was unnecessary.
"I think it would be irresponsible to go through World Pride month, not to speak of the events at the Stonewall Inn in June of 1969," Mr. O'Neill said. "I do know what happened should not have happened."
"The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive, and for that, I apologize," he added.
The auditorium erupted in applause.
The Stonewall uprising began shortly after midnight on June 28, 1969, when officers with the now-defunct Public Morals Squad raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village.
The police said they had arrived to disperse the bar's patrons because the Stonewall Inn had violated liquor laws. Eight officers and an inspector arrived at the club and ordered about 200 people to line up and show their identification. Some were asked to submit to anatomical inspections.
The officers' behavior that night would quickly become a stain on the department and an electrifying force for the L.G.B.T. movement.
"They came in the bar. They slammed people against the wall. They shoved people, and they hurled insults that you can probably imagine," said Mark Segal, 68, who participated in the protests that night.
Stonewall patrons, fed up with longstanding harassment at the hands of law enforcement, pushed back.
As officers conducted the raid, a crowd gathered outside, shouting "gay power." Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people who were forced out of the bar that night taunted the police. Some threw bottles and stones.
The ensuing clash lasted for about an hour, but days of street protests followed, resulting in arrests, injuries and property damage.
[For World Pride, The Times wants to capture the spectrum of how people talk about identity. Tell us who you are in 10 words or less .]
Mr. O'Neill's comments signaled a remarkable moment in the city's history, a long-awaited acknowledgment of the Police Department's role in harassing gays in past decades.
In the 1960s, it was common for the police to raid gay bars, arrest cross-dressers and harass customers, often on the pretext of cracking down on prostitution or other organized crime activities.
Over time, the department's attitudes toward L.G.B.T. people have shifted, but anti-gay attitudes remained rampant in the police force for decades after the Stonewall uprising. In 1978, the president of the city's largest police union said in an op-ed in The New York Times that having gay police officers was an "unworkable" idea.
As social attitudes and norms changed, so did the Police Department. In a watershed moment in 1982, Sgt. Charles H. Cochrane started the first Gay Officers Action League chapter, an association of gay police officers.
The department now boasts of hundreds of L.G.B.T. officers in its ranks, and since 1996, gay police officers have marched in uniform in New York City's pride parade -- an event that started to commemorate the uprising at Stonewall.
In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. O'Neill proclaimed that times had drastically changed since the raid.
"I vow to the L.G.B.T.Q. community that this would never happen in the N.Y.P.D. in 2019," Mr. O'Neill said. "We have, and we do, embrace all New Yorkers."
The Police Department had resisted calls for an apology in the past. In 2016, at a news conference discussing security for that year's Pride March, William J. Bratton, the commissioner at the time, said he did not believe an apology was necessary.
The following year, a day after the Pride March, Mr. O'Neill also declined to apologize. "I think that's been addressed already," he said. "We're moving forward."
Still, allegations of bias have persisted in the department.
"A lot more action has to be done to undo the history of discrimination and current N.Y.P.D. practices," said Tina Luongo, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society.
In 2017, an internal watchdog found that the city's police officers still lacked proper training in how to interact with L.G.B.T. victims and complainants.
A lawsuit filed in January by a transgender woman accused police officers of ridiculing her during her arrest and charging her with incorrectly filling out her gender on an official form.
Mr. Saenz said that transgender people, especially transgender women of color, were particularly vulnerable to police misconduct.
A national survey of nearly 28,000 transgender Americans conducted in 2015 found that 58 percent of respondents had experienced some form of mistreatment by police.
Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement that she believed that police officers in New York continued to harass and abuse transgender people.
"The N.Y.P.D. must commit itself to the true change in practices and policies necessary to address the crisis of violence facing transgender people," she said.
Even so, she thanked Mr. O'Neill for his apology.
At the Stonewall Inn, now a national monument, dozens of people were present on Thursday paying homage to the history that had taken place there.
Stacy Lentz, 49, a co-owner of the Stonewall Inn since 2006, called Mr. O'Neill's remarks a strong first step toward improving relationships between the police and the L.G.B.T. community.
"For the police commissioner to apologize like that -- it's just incredible," Ms. Lentz said.
But she said there was room for improvement.
"The battle that was started here is not over," she added. "But today was about visibility, and visibility saves lives."

Texto completo: OAKLAND >> Using psilocybin mushrooms, also known as "magic mushrooms," as well as ayahuasca and peyote will now be allowed in Oakland, the second city in the country OK the hallucinogenic fungi.
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to bar police from enforcing laws banning the use of "entheogenic" or psychoactive plants, which include psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca, peyote, iboga, and others. Though Oakland police rarely come across the substances, Councilman Noel Gallo brought forward the resolution in an effort to "empower communities to share knowledge and continue building an above-ground infrastructure around entheogens," he said in the proposal.
Dozens of supporters of the effort packed Tuesday's meeting to testify to the benefits of using entheogens not for recreation, but for therapy. Some psychiatrists said the council's resolution will allow them to use entheogens in their practice, which has become a growing trend despite the substances being illegal.
"We just need the green light to bring these healing tools above ground and carry on what has been done for centuries: healing ourselves through our relationship with nature. Let's start here in Oakland and be a beacon of hope and healing," said Nicole Stewart of Decriminalize Nature Oakland, an activist group that led the effort to legalize entheogenic plants in the city.
The resolution stemmed from a movement at the state level to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms; a state ballot measure failed to qualify in 2018. Activists are gathering signatures to put a measure to legalize the medical use of psilocybin mushrooms on the Oregon state ballot next year.
Denver, in May, became the first city in the U.S. to allow the use of psilocybin mushrooms. Unlike Denver, though, Oakland is allowing the use of other entheogenic plans. One of the most well known is ayahuasca, which contains Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, and has been used by indigenous people in Peru and other parts of South America for centuries.
Part of the movement's momentum comes from a study released by Johns Hopkins University last year that suggested psilocybin could be used to treat depression and anxiety and even help people quit smoking, according to the New York Times. Bestselling author and Berkeley resident Michael Pollan's recent book, "How to Change Your Mind," makes the case that psychedelic drugs can be effective therapy tools, especially for people trying to recover from drug addiction.
East Oakland physician Steve Lovato, at Tuesday's meeting, pointed out that the Johns Hopkins study only recommends that the U.S. Food and Drug Association allow for more research into the substances, not that they be immediately allowed for people to use. Pollan, in a New York Times op-ed penned earlier this month, urged that more research is necessary before psychedelics are fully decriminalized.
"Access to mental health in the community is an issue; mental health and medical professionals in East Oakland are not calling for legalization of mushrooms as a solution," Lovato said.
The resolution does not apply to synthetic drugs such as LSD or Ecstasy. The resolution did not list all of the plants that fall under the entheogen group.
Councilman Loren Taylor, who expressed concern at a committee hearing before Tuesday's meeting that the resolution may lead to adults and children using the plants unsafely, said that he sat down with police officials and advocates from Decriminalize Nature Oakland to come up with some amendments to the resolution that would discourage unsafe use.
One of the amendments was a clause in the resolution saying that entheogens are not for everyone, and that clinicians caution people not to take them if they have personal or family history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or if they are on certain medications. If someone has a condition such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, "they would do well to get serious, professional help before using an entheogen."
Another clause in the resolution urges people who do not have experience with the substances to start with small doses, unless they are doing so under the guidance of someone who has experience with them. The resolution also warns against using entheogens alone.
The amended resolution also clarifies that commercial sale or manufacturing entheogens remain illegal, as does possessing or distributing them at schools and driving under the influence of them.
The resolution goes into effect immediately.

Texto completo: El sistema de recomendaciones de videos de YouTube facilita que los pedófilos hallen videos de niños , denunció un equipo de investigadores que analizó el algoritmo.
Los investigadores afirman que YouTube escoge videos de todos sus archivos, a veces incluso de películas caseras inocuas de familias que no son conscientes de ello . En muchos casos, el algoritmo refería a los usuarios a los videos después de ver contenido de temática sexual .
El algoritmo de Youtube usa inteligencia artificial y es el responsable del 70% de las reproducciones de videos en la plataforma.
“Es el algoritmo de YouTube que conecta estos canales”, dijo a The New York Times Jonas Kaiser, uno de los tres investigadores del Centro Berkman Klein para Internet y la Sociedad de Harvard que examinó los videos mientras investigaba el impacto de YouTube en Brasil . “Eso es lo que da miedo”.
Así le sucedió a Christiane, una mujer brasileña. El video de su hija y una amiguita jugando en una piscina en el patio de la casa llegó a acumular unas 400 mil vistas.
En febrero YouTube deshabilitó los comentarios en los videos con niños , luego de que varios medios reportaron que eran usados como guía por los pedófilos.
Sin embargo, el sistema de recomendaciones -que usa el mismo algoritmo agrupa- decenas de dichos videos en un nuevo depósito, de fácil acceso, a disposición de una amplia audiencia.
Los pedófilos no necesitan buscar directamente videos de niños, sino que el sistema los va dirigiendo a ellos mediante una cadena de recomendaciones .
Por ejemplo, un pedófilo puede buscar videos de mujeres jóvenes y a partir de allí terminar viendo videos de niñas .
The New York Times alertó a YouTube de que su sistema hacía circular videos familiares entre personas con inclinaciones al parecer pedófilas y la compañía retiró varios de ellos, pero dejó otros , incluso algunos subidos por cuentas aparentemente falsas.
Pese a las críticas, YouTube mantiene su sistema de recomendaciones en videos de niños, a pesar de los pedidos de que lo desactive para disuadir a los pedófilos de buscar materiales sobre menores en la plataforma.

Texto completo: La industria de combustibles fósiles se comporta como la prima donna de la economía nacional. Sin importar las consecuencias catastróficas de sus actuaciones, la administración Trump sigue premiándola con ramos de rosas.
Las comunidades hispanas que sufren las consecuencias de estos desastres, en cambio, solo reciben las espinas.
Un claro ejemplo son los barrios hispanos de Houston —Pasadena, Deer Park y Manchester— que recientemente han sufrido de primera mano varios desastres petroquímicos. El más grave fue el incendio en una instalación de almacenaje de ITC que emitió enormes cantidades de sustancias tóxicas al aire y las vías acuáticas colindantes. Decenas de familias, en su mayoría hispanas, sufrieron los efectos tóxicos de venenos como xileno y benceno.
Este abuso ocurre por todo el país. En los dos últimos años se han dado decenas de desastres petroquímicos similares, al mismo tiempo que la administración Trump ha debilitado las protecciones que ayudan a prevenir estas tragedias.
Un estudio del New York Times reveló que desde su llegada al poder, la administración ha debilitado o eliminado 84 protecciones, favoreciendo abrumadoramente los deseos de los contaminadores fósiles.
Esta insidiosa narrativa —sucio, bueno; limpio, malo— es un desesperado intento de ocultar los verdaderos costes de los combustible fósiles. Según un reporte del Fondo Monetario Internacional, Estados Unidos gasta más en subsidiar los combustibles fósiles que en sus fuerzas armadas. En 2015, los subsidios directos e indirectos al petróleo, carbón y gas alcanzaron los $649 mil millones, mientras que el Pentágono recibió unos $600 mil millones.
El cálculo de estos subsidios incluye las llamadas externalidades de esta industria, incluyendo los descomunales costos de su contaminación a la salud nacional. El estudio también reveló que los subsidios mundiales a esta industria se elevaron a $4,7 billones (trillions en inglés). El FMI llegó a la pasmosa conclusión de que si se hubiera puesto un precio justo a estos combustibles, se hubieran reducido las emisiones climáticas en un 28%, y se disminuirían las muertes prematuras en el mundo en un 50%.
Mientras tanto, el avance de la economía de energía limpia continúa imparable. Cinco estados más Puerto Rico y el Distrito de Columbia, y más de 120 ciudades se han comprometido a generar un 100% de energía limpia, y varios proyectos de construcción de gasoductos han sido derrotados o intensamente confrontados en Carolina del Norte , Maryland , Nueva York , Virginia y Virginia Occidental .
En una economía en la que la energía limpia rápidamente se convierte en su prima ballarina, no hay espacio para prima donnas.

Overthrow the Prince of Facebook; Big tech has become too powerful and abusive. We know enough about it to break up its dominance.

Texto completo: I'll start with a personal experience and then try to expand into Republicans and big tech.
In the spring of 2016, Facebook came under pressure, stemming from leaks by its workers, over charges of systemic political bias. I was not especially interested: a Silicon Valley company that employs thousands of young people to make decisions that are often ideological will tilt left, and conservatives must factor that in, as they're used to doing.
My concerns about Facebook had to do with its apparently monopolistic nature, slippery ethics and algorithmic threats to serious journalism.
Soon after, I received an email from Mark Zuckerberg's office inviting me and other "conservative activists" to attend a meeting with him to discuss the bias charges in an off-the-record conversation. I responded that I was not an activist but a columnist, for the Journal, and would be happy to attend in that capacity and on the record. That didn't go over too well with Mr. Zuckerberg's office! I was swiftly told that wouldn't do.
What I most remember is that they didn't mention where his office is. There was an air of being summoned by the prince. You know where the prince lives. In the castle. Who doesn't know exactly where Facebook is?
In February 2018 Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein of Wired wrote a deeply reported piece that mentioned the 2016 meeting. It was called so that the company could "make a show of apologizing for its sins." A Facebook employee who helped plan it said part of its goal—they are clever at Facebook and knew their mark!—was to get the conservatives fighting with each other. "They made sure to have libertarians who wouldn't want to regulate the platform and partisans who would." Another goal was to leave attendees "bored to death" by a technical presentation after Mr. Zuckerberg spoke.
Predictably, the conservatives "failed to unify in a way that was either threatening or coherent." Many used the time "to try to figure out how they could get more followers for their own pages."
After the meeting, attendees gushed, calling Mr. Zuckerberg and his staffers humble and open. Glenn Beck praised the CEO's "earnest desire to 'connect the world.' "
Never were pawns so happily used.
I forgot about it until last summer, when Mr. Zuckerberg's office wrote again. His problems were mounting. I was invited now, with an unspecified group of others, to "an off the record discussion over dinner at his home in Palo Alto." They used that greasy greaseball language Silicon Valley uses: Mr. Zuckerberg is "focused on protecting" users and thinking about "the future and how best to serve the Facebook community."
I ignored the invitation. They pressed. Their last note reached me at an irritated moment, so I wrote back a rocket, reminding him of the previous meeting and how it had been revealed to be a mischievous and highly political enacting of faux remorse. I suggested that though it was an honor to be asked to cross a continent for the privilege of giving him my time, thought and advice, I would not. I added that I was sorry to say he strikes me in his public, and now semiprivate, presentations as an imperious twerp.
For a second I actually hesitated: The imperious twerp runs the algorithms, controls the traffic, has all the dark powers! But I am an American, and one with her Irish up, so I hit send.
And I'm still here, at least at the moment, so I guess that's OK.
Facebook's famous sins and failings include the abuse of private data, selling space to Russian propagandists in the 2016 presidential campaign, starving journalism of ad revenues, monopolistically acquiring or doing in possible competitors, political mischief, and turning users into the unknowing product. I once wrote the signal fact of Mr. Zuckerberg's career is that he is supremely gifted in one area—monetizing technical ingenuity by marrying it to a canny sense of human weakness.
None of this is news. We just can't manage to do anything about it.
Now there are moves to push back. The House Judiciary Committee will hold antitrust investigations into big tech. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is warning that "unwarranted concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy." Sen. Elizabeth Warren has made a splash with her pushback on big tech; Sen. Amy Klobuchar included it in her presidential announcement speech.
The New York Times this week had a breakthrough report, from Cecilia Kang and Kenneth Vogel, on how the tech giants are fighting back. They are "amassing an army of lobbyists." Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple spent a combined $55 million in lobbying last year, about double what they spent in 2016. They "have intensified their efforts to lure lobbyists with strong connections to the White House, the regulatory agencies, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress." Facebook hired Mrs. Pelosi's former chief of staff. The speaker herself has received major campaign money from employees and political-action committees of all the tech giants. Google pays lobbyists who worked on the Republican staff of House Judiciary.
They've got it wired, haven't they?
But the mood in America is anti-big-tech. Everyone knows they're too powerful, too arrogant, loom too large in public life.
And something else: This whole new world of new technology was born in the 1970s and '80s. We still think it's new and we're figuring it out, but we're almost half a century into it and we can see what works and what doesn't, what's had good effects and hasn't. It is time to move.
We're Americans and we love money and success and the hallowed story of the kid in the garage who invents the beautiful product that changes the world.
And Republican officials—they can't help it, they don't just rightly love business; they love big business, they love titans. It's almost romantic: Look what people can do in America! He started it in his dorm room! And now we're at lunch!
It's all too human, and of course greedy: Maybe these guys will start giving me money! I mean Pelosi-size money!
Here's what they should be thinking: Break them up. Break them in two, in three; regulate them. Declare them to be what they've so successfully become: once a pleasure, now a utility.
It all depends on Congress, which has been too stupid to move in the past and is too stupid to move competently now. That's what's slowed those of us who want reform, knowing how badly they'd do it.
Yet now I find myself thinking: I don't care. Do it incompetently, but do something.
Why are Republicans so slow to lead? The Times quoted Republican Sen. Josh Hawley as saying "the dominance of big tech" is a "big problem." They "may be more socially powerful than the trusts of the Roosevelt era, and yet they still operate like a black box."
He's right.
But I read about lobbyists coming at Republican congressional leaders and I think, it's going to be like Mr. Zuckerberg's meeting with the conservatives in 2016. A tech god will give them some attention, some respect, and they'll fold like a cheap suit.
If they are as stupid and unserious as their critics take them to be, they will go to the meeting and be used.
They should say no and hit send.

Texto completo: As Massachusetts continues to open marijuana stores, the government should do more to mitigate health risks associated with increased availability of the drug, a group of public health advocates said Wednesday.
Speaking at an event held by the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, a nonprofit that opposed legalization, researchers and advocates suggested a number of policy changes, including requiring product labels that warn of marijuana's potential to increase consumers' risk for severe mental illness; restricting cannabis companies from advertising on billboards and in other ways; and increasing public awareness about marijuana's risks.
“We need to contain the damage," said Dr. Eden Evins, director of Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Addiction Medicine and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Cannabis use, she said, “is one of the few preventable causes of psychosis."
The event at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum included former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, whose book, “Tell Your Children," warns that marijuana leads to psychosis and violence.
Berenson praised Canada's labeling requirements for cannabis products that warn of an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia.
“We're not at 100 percent certainty, but we're pretty close," Berenson said. “We should be telling people this and we should be telling them loudly."
Massachusetts' labels warn against intoxicated driving and pregnant women consuming the drug, and note that “there may be associated health risks."
Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said it's hard to combat the public perception that marijuana is harmless because its consequences are less visible.
“Yes, tobacco is more harmful for cancer, but marijuana is more harmful as it disrupts who you are as a person," she said. “We have 480,000 people dying from tobacco and none have died from marijuana, but it's a distorted argument because marijuana harms your humanity, your brain."
Will Jones, with the national antilegalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said the government should do more to protect black neighborhoods, which are already targeted by tobacco and alcohol advertising.
“We can create a better future than replicating what we've done with alcohol," said Jones, who is black and lives in Washington, D.C. “Advertisements and promotion of a new addiction-for-profit industry — that is another extreme that will disproportionately impact our communities."
The Massachusetts Prevention Alliance released a statement last week signed by 40 doctors and researchers who called for the state's cannabis regulations to focus more on public health. In response, regulators noted that the state was already doing a lot of the requested actions — such as launching public awareness campaigns and banning cartoon imagery that could appeal to youths — and said the statement badly mischaracterized the state's social equity program.
The nonprofit has also drawn fire from marijuana advocates who say it doesn't seriously engage in policy-making.
“This group was nowhere to be found when we wrote the adult use" regulations, Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commissioner Shaleen Title tweeted this week.
Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital who specializes in cannabis and teaches at Harvard Medical School, criticized the event as one-sided. The participants' arguments, he said, overstated the harms of cannabis and ignored the benefits patients have found in treating pain, insomnia, and other life-altering conditions.
The group's stance “is not representative of what doctors think," Grinspoon said. “This is in the realm of drug war ideology — not the realm of science-based discussion."
Berenson's book has made him a controversial figure in the marijuana debate. Critics say he exaggerates the harms of cannabis, which muddies efforts to educate the public.
Scientists widely accept that marijuana use is correlated with chronic mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, but they disagree about causality.
Berenson's assertion was based in part on a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study in 2017 that found that “cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk."
One of the study authors, however, rebutted Berenson's characterization on Twitter in January, saying that her team only “found an association between cannabis use and schizophrenia."
“Since the report, we now know that genetic risk for schizophrenia predicts cannabis use, shedding some light on the potential direction of the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia," wrote Ziva Cooper, director of the Cannabis Research Initiative at the University of California Los Angeles.
In a study published in March in Lancet Psychiatry, researchers examining 17 sites across Europe found that daily cannabis use and high-potency cannabis use were correlated with psychosis. While just 7 percent of the control group of healthy people used cannabis daily, 30 percent of people experiencing first-time psychosis did. The authors acknowledged they established correlation, not causation, but said the findings were significant for public health.
Dr. David Nathan, founder of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation and a psychiatrist in Princeton, N.J., said that people with family or personal histories of psychotic disorders should stay away from cannabis, but the vast majority of consumers don't experience such issues.
“What we cannot say is whether cannabis will cause psychosis in individuals who are not otherwise predisposed to it," Nathan said. “The problem with Berenson's book is that he goes far beyond what the evidence tells us."
Berenson said the torrent of criticism has been baffling.
“My book has been criticized as racist, alarmist, confusing correlation and causation, and cherrypicking," Berenson said. “To me these aren't just lies, they're stunningly stupid lies."

Texto completo: Many residents of Flowery Branch were already up in arms about a controversial international church's proposal to build a sprawling new complex in their Hall County community.
But news that La Luz del Mundo leader Naason Joaquin Garcia was arrested this week on sex trafficking and child pornography charges has those opposed to the project feeling publicly vindicated -- and cautiously optimistic about the fate of the proposal.
"I would hope that this stops it in its tracks," said David Nixon, a spokesman for the "Flowery Branch Strong Community" Face-book group, which formed in response to the church's proposal. "Now that it's got enough visibility, I can't imagine this still going through."
Representatives from La Luz del Mundo have openly suggested that the opposition from Nixon and his counterparts is racially tinged. The locals maintain that it's not the church or its potential visitors that they're against -- just the strain that the nearly 300-acre complex, complete with hotels, homes and a school, would place on their community of 8,000 residents.
"It's really been about building a 'city of light' within our city, and what it's going to do to our traffic, our property value, our taxes," Dixon said Wednesday.
The arrests of Garcia and his colleagues have given the opposition another angle to work.
Garcia, 50, and three co-defendants connected to La Luz del Mundo -- a Guadalajara, Mexico-based church that boasts having 1 million international followers -- were charged this week in what California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called "a major sex trafficking case."
According the 26-count criminal complaint filed against them, Garcia and others on multiple occasions forced minor girls to perform "flirty dances," take photos, touch each other and perform sex acts.
Garcia gave the girls "a speech about a king having mistresses and stated that an apostle of God can never be judged for his actions," according to the complaint.
The offenses allegedly occurred in Los Angeles County between 2015 and 2018. The investigation was prompted after a complaint was filed through the state's online clergy abuse portal, the attorney general said.
A press release posted to La Luz del Mundo's Facebook page said that the church "categorically rejects each and every allegation" made against its leader.
The church was already controversial in Mexico, where, according to The New York Times, previous leader Samuel Joaquin Flores had faced -- and denied -- his own child sex abuse allegations. Flores died in 2014 and had never been charged with a crime.
The Times reported that some had also questioned the church's political connections and influence in Mexico.
A group affiliated with the church filed preliminary documents with the city of Flowery Branch in early 2017, proposing a 272-acre development on agricultural land along Hog Mountain Road. The project identified as "City of Light of the World" was pitched to include hotel, retail and residential components, as well as a fellowship hall and school, according to previous reporting from the Gainesville Times.
It wasn't until last September when the full scope of the proposal gained the attention of the public. It drew immediate backlash from residents, who balked at the church's stated goal of building a walled city within the city.
The "Flowery Branch Strong Community" page popped up in response, as did a petition opposing the development that now has nearly 8,400 signatures.
The church has shown no signs of backing down, but the exact status of its project is unclear. Though the church has submitted preliminary paperwork, it has not formally submitted a rezoning application.
The local attorney representing the church in the development process could not be reached.
In a statement emailed to the AJC, Flowery Branch City Manager Bill Andrew said the city was "not privy" to the allegations against Garcia and his counterparts. If and when a rezoning application is submitted, Andrew wrote, the City Council's role "would be focused on applying the land use decision criteria set forth in the city's zoning ordinance."
Dixon, the community spokesman, said he's seen trucks and machinery start to appear on the land over the last month or two. For now, he and his neighbors are working to make sure their local representatives are well aware of the recent legal developments.
"As an elected official, it's your duty to make sure that you're not inviting a fox into your hen house," Dixon said.

The Most Crowded Slam Still Has Sanctuaries for Fans, Players and Bees

Texto completo: PARIS -- Of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the French Open has the smallest footprint, perhaps in stature, and definitely in square footage. Crammed into a triangular swath of land next to the Bois De Boulogne, the highly trafficked pathways of Roland Garros are often choked with spectators ambling toward the next match or the next jambon-beurre sandwich.
That is still the case, even after Roland Garros expanded to about 29 acres from a mere 21 (the United States Open sits on roughly 45 acres in Flushing, Queens). The added acreage comes from the elegant new Simonne Mathieu Court, which opened this year adjacent to a set of historic greenhouses, and two new courts at the opposite end of the grounds.
Even with the extra space, it can feel crowded. If it occasionally appears on television that the stands are half empty, be assured that the walkways are full. The average attendance for the first week of the tournament was 37,000, an increase of about 3,500 per day from recent years.
But amid all the human traffic, a few sanctuaries can be found -- some for fans, others for players and one for a colony of about a half-million honey bees.
Starting at one end of the grounds, a spectator can promenade past many treasures hidden outside of the famous red clay courts. From the far western, pointy end of the grounds, where Serena Williams recently practiced her serve in relative seclusion, to the array of comfortable orange beanbag chairs on the east end, where much of this article was written in glorious repose, Roland Garros is now about a kilometer in length.
Court 15, where Williams practiced, is new. It is enclosed by black iron fences that meet at a restaurant at the far end of the grounds, and on each side automobile traffic whizzed by, maybe 10 meters away. And when Williams was done, she descended down a staircase and out of view, into a nearby tunnel that conveys players to the locker rooms away from the bustle. On that day, the overwhelming majority of fans in the area were focused on Court 14, where an overflow crowd stood on tiptoes to watch the Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert defeat Daniil Medvedev in a five-set thriller. A pair of American tennis tourists struggled to see over the top of the throng.
The taller one -- Nick Shanley, a real estate financier from Arlington, Va. -- gave his play-by-play report to his friend Chadd Sullo, a sales executive from Milford, Conn., and former college player at Sacred Heart University.
As busy as Court 14 was, it did not compare to the seven beehives, each containing about 60,000 bees buzzing in the air about 200 meters away. The hives are tucked into a ledge adjacent to a pathway alongside Suzanne Lenglen Court, the second largest stadium on the grounds. A small set of stone stairs leads to an oasis -- a beautiful, hidden garden with a meandering gravel path, no more than 50 feet long. At the end of it, Laurent Villalonga's bees probed the bushes and flowers.
Most of the roughly 480,000 black bees go unseen by spectators or players.
"Fortunately, they don't like the red clay," said Villalonga, a staff gardener since 1994 and the chief beekeeper of Roland Garros.
About four years ago, Villalonga said his bosses asked him to start the colony to help preserve the biodiversity of the area and support the local bee population. He had no experience, but asked a colleague for advice. Now, he produces honey, about 60 kilograms a year, which he puts in little jars with elegant Roland Garros labels and gives to friends and colleagues . (Unfortunately, the delectable treat is not for sale.)
Villalonga cultivates seven wooden hives next to Lenglen and two more on the roof atop Le Village, a large building for sponsors and V.I.P.'s. Last year, he said, the entire colony was wiped out by an infestation of Varroa mites. It was crushing, but a new colony was quickly brought in and it is thriving.
"I think it is a fantastic idea," Villalonga said, "as you can see from all the foliage around you."
Leaving the bees behind, one passes the main Philippe Chatrier Court and the soon-to-be demolished Court 1, known as the bullring. The area where Court 1 stands will eventually become a lawn, which should help alleviate some of the crowding.
Continuing east, one arrives at a distinctive Parisian landmark: a news kiosk.
It is run by Anne-Marie Schneider, a children's caretaker for most of the year, and her husband, Marcel Schneider. Anne-Marie cherishes the festive ambience and international flavor of the French Open, and the relative calm of her location, a shady spot in the shadow of the bullring. She sells newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times and L'Equipe, the French sports periodical that is her best seller.
Occasionally she has to chase down a child who thinks the papers are free, but for the most part her location provides a respite from the crowds jostling through the rest of the grounds.
"I love it here," she said. "It is like a vacation for me."
From there, through a narrow gateway, a visitor enters the newest part of Roland Garros. Down a stone path, past the century-old greenhouses of the Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil on the left and pristine buhrstone buildings on the right, botanically inclined fans can study many varieties of plants from five continents, with small plaques denoting their family and genus names.
At what other Grand Slam do you see a Lagerstroemia Indica tree or a Pittosporum Tobira (a Japanese Cheesewood, of course)? Presumably some of the plants were pollinated by Villalonga's bees.
At the end of the path is the gleaming new Simonne Mathieu Court, designed to echo the old greenhouses. Along the far side of the stadium, as distant as one can be from Court 16 and remain on the grounds, lie fluffy beanbag chairs and a dozen rows of orange deck chairs in front of a giant video screen showing live matches.
Some sit and watch, others read and eat, and a few even doze off.
But on the other side of a little mound with small trees, one discovers the final secluded gem of Roland Garros: a bucolic half-acre meadow called Le Jardin Contemporain, or contemporary garden, which gained more popularity as the tournament proceeded.
On one of the first few days, though, under brilliant sunshine, Alexandra Panova, the 71st-ranked player in the world, stretched with her trainer, Tim Hoper, then reclined on the deck chairs in total seclusion -- until interrupted by a pair of curious passers-by.
"I have never even seen this place before," Panova said. "It is perfect. But don't tell anyone about it."

Texto completo: This has been quite a week for Mike Birbiglia, the comic/actor/writer/director who was announced Tuesday as the comedy headliner for the 12-day 2019 KeyBank Rochester Fringe Festival.
On Sunday, Birbiglia received the annual Drama Desk Award for solo performance, an honor recognizing his one-man Broadway show, The New One, his onstage admission that he's not quite a stellar dad for his new daughter.
The Drama Desk honor stands as proof of the emotional depths Birbiglia plumbs with the self-effacing yet relatable comedy in The New One. Consider that other nominees included acclaimed British actress Carey Mulligan — called by The New York Times "one of the most compelling stage actresses of her generation" — and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, creator of two critically praised series, Fleabag and Killing Eve.
Birbiglia will perform in Rochester at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 20, in Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre.
Onstage, Birbiglia appears an Everyman comic, chatting amiably as if across the dinner table. He admits his longtime love for jokes in the appropriately titled Netflix special, Thank God for Jokes. But his willingness to occasionally wield a one-line quip, coupled with his congenial next-door-neighbor persona, masks a certain quiet fervency to his comedy, and a push to utilize that humor to make connections.
In that same Netflix special, he remembers and mourns the 2015 murders of a dozen workers with the French satire newspaper Charlie Hebdo by extreme Islamist terrorists. He issues a call for civility, something far too rare these days.
Along with his standup, Birbiglia performs across multiple platforms. He is a frequent contributor to This American Life, is a New York Times best-selling author, acts in shows as diverse as Orange Is The New Black and Girls, and wrote, directed, and starred in the well-received film Don't Think Twice, about a comedy improv troupe.
Tickets for the Fringe Festival show start at $29 and will go on sale at 10 a.m. Thursday, June 6, at rochesterfringe.com and at the Eastman Theatre Box Office. (They can be purchased by phone at (585) 274-3000; online at eastmantheatre.org; or in person at 433 E. Main St.)
"I have long been an admirer of Mike Birbiglia's brand of observational comedy and I'm absolutely thrilled to announce Birbigs as our 2019 comedy headliner," said Festival Producer Erica Fee, using Birbiglia's online handle.
The remaining 500-plus performances and events of the 2019 Fringe will be announced at the festival's "Big Reveal" news conference at 10:30 a.m. June 17 at George Eastman Museum's Dryden Theatre.

Texto completo: Flying Southwest this summer and like to stash your boarding pass in those colorful paper holders they hand out at the airport?
You're out of luck.
Ticket jackets, as the document holders are called, have gone the way of peanuts on Southwest. The airline stopped giving out the holders on Saturday.
The airline, which doles out about 22 million ticket jackets a year, eliminated them to "reduce waste, protect our environment, use less paper and ultimately become a greener company," spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement.
Southwest is the last major airline to ditch the ticket jackets, a relic from an era when airlines issued paper tickets.
Most tickets are now electronic, and boarding passes have moved that way, too. Travelers who don't fly Southwest, the nation's largest domestic carrier, may not even know they still exist.
United Airlines said it eliminated ticket jackets in the early 2000s. Delta Air Lines did away with them in 2008. Alaska says it did away with them more than a decade ago. The last time American used them was in 2014. Spirit Airlines eliminated them in late 2016 as mobile boarding passes and self-service check-in kiosks grew in popularity.
Landson said Southwest has seen an increase in the number of travelers using mobile boarding passes and decided now was the time to eliminate the paper holders.
"Through this change in behavior, we feel like we've reached a good point to transition away from paper ticket jackets," he said.
The look of Southwest's ticket jackets, like other airlines', evolved with the airline's style and slogans over the years. The ticket jackets included gate information, Southwest reservations information and ads for Southwest products including gift cards. In the past, baggage claim checks were stapled to them.
A decade ago, one Southwest frequent flier got his close-up on Southwest's ticket jackets.
Terry Buchen, president of Golf Agronomy International, said he was selected to be on the ticket jacket after he gushed nonstop about Southwest at a party the airline hosted for frequent fliers in Baltimore.
Southwest flew Buchen and his wife to Austin, Texas, for a photo shoot and treated them to a luxury hotel, meals and a new outfit from Nordstrom for the ad. (Yes, he got to keep it.)
Buchen was on the ticket jacket from 2007 to 2009.
He was often recognized at the airport by fellow travelers and Southwest employees, earning the nickname "the ticket jacket guy," he told the New York Times in 2008.
"People used to ask me for autographs," Buchen said in a phone interview with USA TODAY. "It was a lot of fun. I really had fun."
Buchen, 72, has a framed copy of the ticket jacket at his home outside Boise, Idaho, and saved about 100 of the ticket jackets with his picture on them.

Apple Touts New Privacy Protections --- Offerings include new login system, tools to prevent location tracking by apps

Texto completo: SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Apple Inc. sought to tout itself as a digital-privacy crusader with an anonymous login system and tools that prevent apps from tracking a user's location, a push that is designed to further differentiate it from Google and Facebook Inc., which have built their fortunes on tracking user activity and behavior.
At a gathering Monday of about 6,000 software developers here, the iPhone maker said its mobile operating system coming this fall, iOS 13, will include an Apple sign-in capability that allows people to log into apps without revealing any personal information. It said users would be able to generate automated and random email addresses provided by Apple rather than provide their own.
"It's a fast, easy way to sign in without all the tracking," said Apple software chief Craig Federighi onstage at the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference. He showed the "Sign in with Apple" feature alongside similar offerings from Facebook and Google, which he said could share user information in a way that compromised privacy.
Apple has weaponized privacy over the past year, marketing it to combat threats posed by rivals increasingly elbowing into its core iPhone business.
Last month, Google released a $400 smartphone that it says offers capabilities similar to those of an iPhone at a fraction of the price, and Facebook is working to develop private messaging, payments and e-commerce that could diminish the value of Apple's iOS.
Apple is also seeking to further separate itself from its peers as the U.S. government ramps up its scrutiny of tech giants' power. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the government's antitrust enforcers, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, are splitting up oversight of tech companies including Google and Facebook over competition concerns. Facebook already faces an FTC investigation over privacy issues.
Amid the skirmishes over privacy, Apple is transitioning from an iPhone-driven company into one powered by a suite of services, such as streaming-music subscriptions, app-store sales and mobile payments. At its developers conference, Apple turned the spotlight back to its other devices beyond the iPhone, introducing new software and services to deepen the appeal of its iPad, smartwatch and Mac businesses. It also bolstered many of its apps, including improvements to Messages that put it in more direct competition with Facebook's apps.
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has stressed privacy by criticizing Google, Facebook and other companies as cavalier in collecting user information. He has cast Apple as pro-privacy, saying it is in the business of selling devices while its peers are in the business of monetizing their customers by gathering data and selling ads.
The company has amplified that message by spending more than $54 million on a TV ad campaign that promotes the privacy offered by iPhones, using the tagline: "If privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on." The campaign is about half of Apple's TV ad spending so far this year, according to the ad-tracking company iSpot.tv.
Facebook and Google have pushed back with privacy promises of their own. Facebook this year said it is going to provide encrypted messaging and encourage small-group chats. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai sniped at Apple in a New York Times editorial that "privacy cannot be a luxury good" available to people who buy expensive devices.
Apple said its newest mobile-operating system will give users more options for how they share location data with apps, including an option to only share location information once.
It also said it is teaming up with security-camera companies to provide more private video tools for people who use cameras to monitor home security.
Though the focus of this event is usually dominated by Apple's newest iPhone software, the company emphasized improvements to its other gadgets.
The iPad is getting its own operating system, iPadOS, with new capabilities that make the tablet more capable of performing like a computer. It will have simple copy-and-paste functions, a desktop mode for its Safari web browser and the ability to plug in a thumb drive.
Apple introduced new programming tools for developers that are designed to simplify the process of developing apps for the Mac, watch and iPad.

Terrific idea? Not to Mets fans.

Texto completo: Brady draws the ire of Seaver faithful by seeking to trademark 'Tom Terrific'
In the battle of Tom vs. Tom, Mets fans are coming down squarely on the side of their guy.
Tom Brady landed on the wrong side of another sport's New York fan base, angering Mets fans with his recent trademark application for a nickname - "Tom Terrific" - that has long belonged to Tom Seaver, one of the biggest stars of the Amazin' Mets era.
The nickname has been applied to Brady's football feats at various and relatively obscure times over the years, but it's unquestionably more often identified with Seaver, the Hall of Fame pitcher and winner of 198 games (out of his 311 wins) over 12 seasons with the Mets. As news spread of the May 24 filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Mets fans were furious with the New England Patriots quarterback, who wasn't born when the nickname was bestowed on the right-handed pitcher.
"Go back to deflating footballs, you jerk," Ronaldo Sosa, a 52-year-old Mets fan, told the New York Post on Sunday at Citi Field.
Another tweeted, "Tom Terrific will always be Tom Seaver to me."
"Go back to Boston and get your own f------ name, Brady," Dom D'Angelo, 55, told the paper.
Patriots boosters blasted back on social media, with one fan tweeting: "6 Super Bowl Rings!!!!!! TOM TERRIFIC!!!!!! 1 World Series! Tom Terrific!"
Even a longtime Yankees fan took offense, calling the application "an unsavory attempt" by Brady. "[T]his appalls me, too," tweeted Clyde Haberman, the former New York Times columnist and editorial writer. "That nickname has been Tom Seaver's for decades. Brady can take a hike."
The Mets offered deferential criticism, telling the Patent and Trademark Office "with all due respect to @TomBrady . . . There's only one #TomTerrific to us."
Brady's TEB Capital Management company filed two trademark applications last month, with both clearly indicating commercial intent. One covers collectible trading cards, sports trading cards, posters and printed photographs; the other is for T-shirts and shirts. The applications, first publicized by Gerben Law Firm, were made on a 1B or "intent-to-use" basis, which means that the company is planning a line of products bearing the nickname. Those are in addition to the numerous trademarks for his TB12 logo and health and wellness products, as well as one for his TB12 Foundation.
The timing was "especially galling" to one Mets fan, "given Seaver's health." In March, Seaver's family announced that the 74-year-old would be making no more public appearances because he has dementia.
"Tom will continue to work in his beloved vineyard at his California home, but has chosen to completely retire from public life," his family said in a statement at that time. "The family is deeply appreciative of those who have supported Tom throughout his career, on and off the field, and who do so now by honoring his request for privacy."
Seaver, the 1967 National League rookie of the year, won the NL Cy Young Award three times and compiled a 311-205 record with a 2.86 ERA, 3,640 strikeouts and 61 shutouts from 1967 to 1986.
He pitched for the Mets from 1967 until 1977, when his desire for a new contract led to a feud with the team and he was traded to Cincinnati. He returned to the team for the 1983 season and also played for the Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox. He made 16 starts for the Red Sox in 1986, going 5-7 in his final season.
Long before Seaver became synonymous with Tom Terrific, that name referred to a cartoon character (along with his pooch, Mighty Manfred the Wonder Dog) on Terrytoons' 1950s cartoon, which appeared on the "Captain Kangaroo" TV show. Terrytoons' two Tom Terrific registrations have expired.

Apple has weaponized privacy over the past year, marketing it to combat threats posed by rivals increasingly elbowing into its core iPhone business.
Last month, Google released a $400 smartphone that it says offers capabilities similar to those of an iPhone at a fraction of the price, and Facebook is working to develop private messaging, payments and e-commerce that could diminish the value of Apple's iOS.

The iPad is getting its own operating system, iPadOS, with new capabilities that make the tablet more capable of performing like a computer. It will have simple copy-and-paste functions, a desktop mode for its Safari web browser and the ability to plug in a thumb drive.
The Mac is retiring the iTunes app, which made its debut 18 years ago, and splitting its functionality across Apple's Music, TV and Podcast. The iTunes brand will continue to exist on the iPhone, and users will still be able to download songs through an iTunes Store tab, the company said.
The Apple Watch is getting its own app store, liberating it further from the iPhone where app downloads were previously managed. It also is adding new health capabilities, including the ability to alert users if the environmental noise around them poses a potential problem for their hearing health.
Apple introduced new programming tools for developers that are designed to simplify the process of developing apps for the Mac, watch and iPad. The 2.2 million iPhone apps available in the App Store dwarf the 20,000 Watch apps currently offered. Analysts say that discrepancy limits the utility of the Apple Watch and is part of the reason smartwatch sales have lagged behind the iPhone and iPad.

The company also sought to promote its growing services business, showing the first trailer from one of the company's new TV shows, "For All Mankind," a show from Ronald D. Moore about the space race. The show will be available when Apple launches its streaming-video subscription service this fall.
(Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.)
Apple needs strong sales of those devices and its services to help counter the downturn in its iPhone business. The company in April posted its first back-to-back drop in quarterly sales and profit as sales of the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of total revenue, fell 16% to $83 billion for the first half of the company's fiscal year.
Although the focus of the conference was on software, Apple introduced a new Mac Pro, its most powerful computer designed for complicated and intense tasks. The computer, which will start at about $6,000, includes a new Intel Xeon processor and system memory of up to 1.5 terabytes. A 32-inch LCD screen with a 6K retina display will cost another $5,000.

Texto completo: Fox News and its parent company are responsible for much of the hate and division in the United States right now, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
But that is not stopping him from petitioning the cable newsgroup for an audience, according to the New York Times. Look, no one ever said being a politician and 2020 White House hopeful would be pretty. The Times reports:
Aides to Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City … recently approached the network. “We want to talk to all voters about why the mayor is the best candidate for working people — regardless of what news channel they watch,” a de Blasio spokeswoman, Olivia Lapeyrolerie, said on Sunday. Mr. de Blasio’s change of heart could be about his newly announced presidential ambitions. But it also speaks to the improbable way that Fox News — a network whose prime-time hours are often devoted to praising the president and skewering prominent Democrats — has squirreled itself into the heart of the Democratic primary.
It was not so long ago that the New York City mayor torched Fox and its parent company, News Corp, by name, claiming both groups are responsible for a great deal of today’s division and animosity.
News Corp. is "dividing people and creating hatred and negativity and changing our political landscape for the worse,” de Blasio told CNN last year, adding that there "would be less overt hate, there would be less appeal to racial division” if the media conglomerate ceased to exist.
"Does News Corp. have a clear right-wing agenda? I think that one's pretty obvious," he said. "Do they sensationalize, racialize, and divide? Yes. Does that compare to CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, the New York Times, the Washington Post? No. One of these things is not like the other."
Earlier that same month, the mayor also said in an interview with the Guardian that News Corp. is almost single-handedly responsible for all that is wrong and dangerous in America.
“If you could remove News Corp. from the last 25 years of American history, we would be in an entirely different place,” he said about the company that owns Fox, the New York Post, the Wall Street Journal, and dozens of newspapers.
Without News Corp., de Blasio added, “we would be a more unified country. We would not be suffering a lot of the negativity and divisiveness we’re going through right now. I can’t ignore that.”
He also argued that his attacks against newsrooms are totally different from President Trump’s attacks against newsrooms.
"There is no comparison between a progressive critique of the media — and overwhelmingly corporate media, by the way — and a president who does not believe in free speech and is trying to undermine the norms of democracy," he argued. “If you see a steady decline in democracy, we’re going to have to vividly defend a lot of media we don’t agree with. But I don’t want to give [Fox] a free pass on what they have done to all of us.”
All that sanctimony and fire-breathing, and here we are with the Times reporting that de Blasio is imploring Fox to give him access to their massive audience numbers. I guess when your political ambition is greater than your professed principles, one necessarily wins out over the other.

Texto completo: Scientists have finally solved an environmental mystery.
After following the trail of a gaseous emission that has been banned for over 30 years, they found the culprit: factories in the People’s Republic of China.
On top of under-reporting carbon emissions and downplaying the poor air quality, a new study in the scientific journal Nature found that 40 to 60% of total global emissions of the chemical compound Trichlorofluoromethane, better known as CFC-11, came from China, specifically the eastern province of Shandong. The mystery was solved a year after scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association discovered that global emissions of the chemical compound Trichlorofluoromethane rose by 25% since 2012.
So just how damaging is Trichlorofluoromethane to the environment?
Trichlorofluoromethane is a chemical used in refrigeration and foams, which causes significant ozone layer depletion. In fact, CFC-11 has an ozone depletion potential of 1.0, the highest of any chlorocarbon because it has three chlorine atoms in the molecule. It’s 5,000 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The compound was on a list of chemicals to be phased out in manufacturing and production under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which the United States followed through on in January 1996.
This is not good for the planet. It's also a very, shall we say, inconvenient truth, for a lot of environmentalists on the Left.
Go back to June 2017, when President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, he was roundly criticized by climate change activists, members of the media, and world leaders.
Amid all the criticism of Trump’s move, a favorite line was that China was becoming a leader in fighting climate change.

Former Vice President Al Gore told ABC News, “The rest of the world is moving on climate […] China’s reduced emissions four years in a row. We’re seeing a massive shift in solar and wind."
Former California Gov. Jerry Brown justified his state working separately with China after Trump backed out of the Paris climate agreement by saying, “We’re going to do more with China, and we’re going to link closely together because it used to be China and the United States as the pillar. Now China is that pillar and California is very much going to be working with them to achieve our mutual goals.”
Former Obama administration official John Kirby said, “In just the last 15 years, there’s 2.5 million jobs in the United States dedicated to the clean energy industry and that number is continuing to climb and that’s the future and that’s where frankly look that’s where China wants to go. So, we’re going to be losing jobs here in the United States. We’re going to be hurting our economy. And we’ll be ceding that territory to China going forward."
And it didn’t stop there.
The Washington Post declared "As U.S. backs away from climate pledges, India and China step up.” A CBS News headline read, “U.S. withdrawal from Paris accord offers China chance to lead world on climate change.” And Bloomberg News declared, “China, Germany Step Up as U.S. Retires from World Leadership.” The New York Times even ranked China as the top country for “filling the void” of being a climate change leader.
Recent news suggests that if the U.S. were to regulate emissions more strictly, it wouldn't be following China, but would be sending lots of manufacturing toward China, which would hurt both the planet and America's interests around the world.

Churches wipe out millions in medical debt for others

Texto completo: The leaders of Pathway Church on the outskirts of Wichita, Kan., had no clue that the $22,000 they already had on hand for Easter would have such impact.
The nondenominational suburban congregation of about 3,800 had set out only to help people nearby pay off some medical debt, recalled Larry Wren, Pathway’s executive pastor. After all, the core membership at Pathway’s three sites consists of middle-income families with school-age kids, not high-dollar philanthropists.
But then they learned that, like a modern-day loaves-and-fishes story, that smaller amount could wipe out $2.2 million in debt not only for the Wichita area but all available debt for every Kansan facing imminent insolvency because of medical expenses they couldn’t afford to pay — 1,600 people in all.
As Wren thought about the message of Easter, things clicked. “Being able to do this provides an opportunity to illustrate what it means to have a debt paid that they could never pay themselves,” he said. “It just was a great fit.”
Churches in Maryland, Illinois, Virginia, Texas and elsewhere have been reaching the same conclusion. RIP Medical Debt, a nonprofit organization based in Rye, N.Y., that arranges such debt payoffs, reports a recent surge in participation from primarily Christian places of worship. Eighteen have worked with RIP in the past year and a half, said Scott Patton, the nonprofit’s director of development. More churches are joining in as word spreads.
The mountain of bills they are trying to clear is high. Medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll showed that of the 26% of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59% reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)
The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a rule this month to curb debt collectors’ ability to bug those with outstanding bills, and some states have tried various measures, such as limiting the interest rates collectors may charge. But until a comprehensive solution emerges, churches and others are trying to ease some of the load by jumping into the debt market.
A big part of RIP’s appeal comes from the impact even a small donation can have, say participating church leaders. When a person can’t pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people’s debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. Those debts usually come from low-income people and are more difficult to collect.
RIP Medical Debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors. But instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.
To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level (about $25,000 a year for an individual), have debts that are 5% or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.
Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap. That’s how, Patton said, those 18 churches have been able to abolish $34.4 million of debt since the start of 2018.
Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of around 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.
Revolution leaders heard about RIP Medical Debt on a segment of John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight” in 2016, said Kenny Camacho, lead pastor. But at the time, they didn’t think they had the resources to make much of a splash.
After hearing about another church that paid off millions last year, Revolution leaders decided to try it. At most, they hoped to have an impact in their area, Camacho said. But the money went much further, eventually covering 14 counties in eastern and central Maryland.
Emmanuel Memorial Episcopal Church, a congregation of about 175 families in Champaign, Ill., had a similar experience. The original idea was to try to have an impact just in Champaign County, said the Rev. Christine Hopkins. But their $15,000 abolished $4 million of debt for the entire diocese, which stretches across the southern half of the state.
“We were bowled over, actually,” Hopkins said. “It was to the point of tears.”
In many cases, churches have not had to do a fundraising campaign because their contribution came from money already on hand. Emmanuel Episcopal, for instance, had leftovers from a campaign set up a year ago to celebrate the centennial of its church building.
The Fincastle Baptist Church, with 1,600 members in the Roanoke, Va., area used money it had budgeted for an annual “Freedom Fest” event to honor first responders, and then partnered with local television station WSLS in a telethon to raise more. That effort abolished over $2.7 million in medical debt targeted at veterans.
The RIP nonprofit allows donors to choose geographic areas they want to reach and can pinpoint veterans as recipients. But beyond that, no restrictions are allowed, Patton said. A church can’t specify which types of medical procedures could be paid for or anything about the background of the recipients.
That didn’t bother church leaders contacted for this story. But it is a subject that’s been broached by donors of all types in the past, Patton said.
For instance, some potential donors have asked to exclude people from different faiths or certain political parties, he said. “It’s just absurd. This is not a revenge tactic,” Patton said. “People who are requesting those things really don’t understand philanthropy.”
Churches don’t necessarily experience a direct return in the way of new members. All the processing goes through RIP Medical Debt, which sends letters notifying the beneficiaries their debts have been forgiven. Donors can have their names listed on those letters, but not everyone opts to do so.
New membership wasn’t the point for Pathway Church in Kansas, Wren said. “Sometimes the more powerful spiritual message is when you’re able to do something for somebody that you’ll never meet.”
The Revolution Church decided against putting its name on the notification letters, Camacho said, because it didn’t want beneficiaries to feel obligated. “When a person has their debt forgiven, we want them to experience that as a kind of no-strings-attached gift,” he said. “We don’t want there to be any sense that because we did this now they should visit our church or something.”
Besides, he said, the gift covered an area large enough that some beneficiaries live a couple of hours away. “I would much rather them think more positively about the church down the street from where they live.”
Donors sometimes hear back from the people whose debts they’ve paid, but not often. Many don’t expect it. “I guess that’s a biblical story, too. Jesus forgave 10, and only one said thank you,” Hopkins said.
Churches have a lot of choices when it comes to charity, but medical debt and affordability issues often resonate with parishioners. Some churches are worried enough about medical costs for their members that they subscribe to cost-sharing nonprofits, in which members pay each other’s medical bills.
Medical mission work has long been an important form of outreach for Fincastle Baptist Church in Virginia, said associate pastor Warren King. The church runs a free clinic, and mission trips to other countries usually include a medical component.
Paying off medical debt is an extension of that line of thinking. “We need to do not just this thing but many things that practically show the love of God,” King said. “It’s hard to tell somebody God loves you if they’re starving and you don’t try to deal with the problem.”
Hopkins said the debt outreach was a satisfying project for her Illinois congregation because it could resolve a problem for the beneficiaries. “We do a lot of outreach that’s food-related and housing-related. This was something different,” Hopkins said. “You help feed somebody, and you’re feeding them again the next day. This was something that could make an impact.”
This story also ran on USA Today.

About the FBI's Spying; What's the difference between surveillance of Carter Page and Martin Luther King?

Texto completo: When Carter Page learned in April 2017 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had obtained a secret court order to listen in on his communications, the Washington Post asked him about it. Mr. Page, the paper reported, "compared surveillance of him to the eavesdropping that the FBI and Justice Department conducted against civil rights leader Martin Luther King."
Everyone had a good laugh. "Never ever, ever, compare yourself in any way whatsoever to Martin Luther King," sneered the Post's Jonathan Capehart. "Ever."
Certainly Mr. Page would have been ridiculous if he meant he was of King's stature. But that wasn't what he had contended. All he suggested was that he, like King, had been a target of an FBI counterintelligence operation run amok.
Now a new report on the FBI's surreptitious tapings of King makes it harder to see the difference between what J. Edgar Hoover's FBI did with King and what James Comey's FBI did with Mr. Page. In an article in Standpoint magazine, David Garrow, author of a Pulitzer-winning biography of King, reports summaries of the FBI recordings collected on the civil-rights leader. The article has stoked a furor for some of the unflattering details reported about King, for example that he "looked on and laughed" while a fellow pastor forcibly raped a female parishioner.
But while the details of King's sexual behavior have attracted most of the attention, the parallels with Mr. Page may be more illuminating. Remember, the FBI sought a warrant on Mr. Page from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court based on the claim that the former Trump campaign associate was "an agent of a foreign power," namely Russia. Yet Mr. Page is one of the few targets of the investigation to have emerged without ever being charged with anything.
The surveillance of King likewise began as a national-security matter. In a Rose Garden conversation, President John F. Kennedy told King he needed to cut ties with one of his closest advisers, Stanley Levison, a former financier for the Communist Party USA. When King refused to cut Levison loose, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy authorized the FBI to wiretap King.
In his book "A Higher Loyalty," Mr. Comey writes that the King case illuminates how "a legitimate counterintelligence mission" could morph into "an unchecked, vicious campaign of harassment and extralegal attack on the civil rights leader and others." To "drive the message home," Mr. Comey writes that as FBI director he kept on his desk a copy of the October 1963 memo, written by Hoover and signed by RFK, approving the King wiretaps.
"I kept the Hoover memo there not to make a critical statement from Hoover or Kennedy, but to make a statement about the value of oversight and constraint," Mr. Comey writes. "I have no doubt that Hoover and Kennedy thought they were doing the right thing. What they lacked was meaningful testing of their assumptions. There was nothing to check them."
Cut to today, when Attorney General William Barr is bringing that "oversight" and "meaningful testing" to decisions such as the one to listen in on Mr. Page. Far from applauding what he himself once called for, Mr. Comey now accuses Mr. Barr of "sliming his own department."
Mr. Comey has also taken issue with Mr. Barr's use of the word "spying" to describe the FBI's behavior. He's not alone. At the Senate hearing where Mr. Barr first used it, Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz asked if he wanted to rephrase because "when the attorney general of the United States uses the word 'spying,' its rather provocative and in my view unnecessarily inflammatory." Meanwhile, the New York Times accused Mr. Barr of using a "charged word."
So here's the question for all those who assert that Mr. Barr was wrong to use the word "spying": Would they use it to describe what the FBI did to Martin Luther King?
We already know the answer to that one. The Washington Post used the word "spying" often to describe what happened to King—without scare quotes. Ditto for the New York Times and others. The word was not considered "charged" until April 10, after Mr. Barr used it.
Just one example. Here's Charles M. Blow's lead sentence in a 2013 Times column: "The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' so disturbed the American power structure that the F.B.I. started spying on him in what The Washington Post called 'one of its biggest surveillance operations in history.' "
In an interview with CBS on Friday, Mr. Barr sounded almost Comeyish when he spoke of what might have led FBI leaders astray in their investigation into alleged Trump ties with Russia. "Sometimes," he said, "people can convince themselves that what they're doing is in the higher interest, the better good."
Sooner or later, Mr. Barr will sort it out. Meanwhile, it may be a good moment for current director Christopher Wray to install permanently at FBI headquarters a copy of the application for the FISA warrant on Mr. Page—signed by his predecessor, Mr. Comey. Maybe it will help "drive home" the need for "oversight and constraint."

Texto completo: If you think investors, workers and consumers are eager for China to stop stealing intellectual property and for the U.S. to stop hiking tariffs, imagine how Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell feel. Family and business ties forged at a time of friendlier U.S.-China relations are bound to attract increasing scrutiny as both prepare to face voters in 2020. Former vice president Biden is currently the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, while Republican Senate Majority Leader McConnell seeks re-election in Kentucky.
For them and for all of us, the possibly hopeful news from the weekend is that the Chinese government says it wants to resolve the trade dispute. Josh Zumbrun and Yoko Kubota of the Journal report :
Beijing released on Sunday a government policy paper on trade issues, accusing Washington of scuttling the negotiations, which broke down in all but name in May. It said the Trump administration's "America First" program and use of tariffs are harming the global economy and that China wouldn't shy away from a trade war if need be. But throughout the document and at a briefing, the government suggested a willingness to return to negotiations.
...The tone, if not the substance, was markedly more measured than the sharp, at times nationalistic, rhetoric adopted by state media and some officials in the past three weeks...
As for officials in our own government, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, who is married to Mr. McConnell, is the subject of a long piece in the New York Times about her American family's relationship with the Chinese government. Michael Forsythe, Eric Lipton, Keith Bradsher and Sui-Lee Wee report :
Ms. Chao has no formal affiliation or stake in her family's shipping business, Foremost Group. But she and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have received millions of dollars in gifts from her father, James, who ran the company until last year. And Mr. McConnell's re-election campaigns have received more than $1 million in contributions from Ms. Chao's extended family, including from her father and her sister Angela, now Foremost's chief executive...
Foremost has received hundreds of millions of dollars in loan commitments from a bank run by the Chinese government... Foremost, though a relatively small company in its sector, is responsible for a large portion of orders at one of China's biggest state-funded shipyards, and has secured long-term charters with a Chinese state-owned steel maker as well as global commodity companies that guarantee it steady revenues.
Much of the Times report tracks earlier reporting by Peter Schweizer, whose 2018 book "Secret Empires" is mentioned in the Times account. Along with detailing the ties of the Chao family to the Chinese government, the book also noted the overseas business pursued by Hunter Biden while his father was vice president—business that often involved countries where his father played a significant role in U.S. diplomacy.
Speaking of the New York Times, the paper recently reported on overseas business pursued by Hunter Biden and an associate named Devon Archer. The Times reports that their work in China and Ukraine "concerned a business partner of Mr. Biden and Mr. Archer, Christopher Heinz, the stepson of John Kerry, who was then secretary of state." The paper adds that Mr. Heinz thought their work "created the appearance of selling influence, according to a person familiar with the conversation... Mr. Heinz, who was not involved in the China or Ukraine efforts, began decoupling his business interests from those of Mr. Biden and Mr. Archer."
If their work bothered a friend and business partner perhaps it will bother voters as well. It's not clear what value Hunter Biden adds when he does deals overseas. But while his father was vice president he seems to have been treated in China as a financier of the first rank. Shortly after Hunter Biden travelled with his father to China aboard Air Force Two, the younger Biden's firm Rosemont Seneca scored a business coup. In 2014, the Journal's Chao Deng reported :
A consortium of foreign and Chinese private-equity firms is aiming to raise about $1.5 billion to invest abroad, with the yuan-denominated portion of the fund to be converted to U.S. dollars through Shanghai's free-trade zone.
The fund—launched by Chinese asset managers Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co. and Harvest Fund Management Co. alongside U.S. investment and advisory firms Rosemont Seneca Partners and Thornton Group LLC—started fundraising in the second quarter, and has raised its target to $1.5 billion from an original $1 billion plan, a spokesman at Bank of China International Holdings Ltd. said. BOCI is one of the largest stakeholders in Bohai.
Participating in such a deal was not a privilege extended to every foreign firm. Noted the Journal:
The Bohai-Harvest fund is likely one of the biggest Sino-foreign collaborations in private equity to take advantage of the free-trade zone's benefits in converting yuan to dollars that can then be invested in foreign companies. The funds are raising a combination of yuan and U.S. dollars... Normally, China restricts free conversion of its currency.
The deal was perhaps also remarkable because to that point much of Hunter Biden's expertise lay in the business of influence rather than investing. In 2013 Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote in the New York Times:
Until 2008, R. Hunter Biden, son of then-Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., lobbied Congress regularly. The Washington Post reported last year that "56 relatives of lawmakers have been paid to influence Congress" since 2007.
While the House and Senate passed rules to limit some lobbying, the House left enough wiggle room for parents and children of lawmakers to still lobby.
If the spotlight remains on U.S.-China relations, how much wiggle room will voters give to Messrs. Biden and McConnell?

But any Brits hoping for reform should maintain reasonable expectations. Mr. Johnson was discussing the possibility of a U.K.-U.S. trade deal following a British exit from the European Union and simply said that "in a trade deal all things that are traded would be on the table," including health care products.

Texto completo: NEW YORK – A couple back, inside the Yankee Stadium press box, Jack Curry made his pitch to David Cone.
"I would love to get inside the mind of a pitcher, you being that pitcher," Curry told Cone. "Tell us what it's like to be on the mound, when times are great and when times are dreary."
After about two minutes, Cone said: "I'm in," and a book was born.
"Full Count, The Education of a Pitcher" hit the New York Times' Best Sellers list last week and "this book would not be successful unless David delivered," Curry said of the insights and anecdotes culled from a 17-year big-league career that included five world championships.
"His honesty about how insecure pitchers can be, how much self-doubt they have out there on the mound, that really stands out to me," Curry said before a recent Red Sox-Yankees game.
"As successful as he was, there were probably moments in every start where he thought, 'Wow, am I going to get through this next inning?' "
Yet, the original book idea probably dates back 20 years, when Cone was pitching for the Yankees and Curry – an Emmy-winning YES Network analyst since 2010 – was covering the Yankees for the Times.
"When he'd talk to us after the game, there was always so much thought that went into the craft of pitching," Curry said. "Once we started working together at YES," where Cone serves as a game commentator, "that burst to the forefront even more."
Jersey strong The pinnacle of Curry's own baseball career is preserved in a laminated newspaper clip from the Jersey Journal:
"Jack Curry bounced a two-out single over third base in the bottom of the seventh inning to give the Hawks a come-from-behind-decision..."
Hudson Catholic wasn't in the midst of a memorable season, but any victory over rival St. Peter's Prep "was a big deal," Curry said of his "one shining moment" as an outfielder for the Jersey City high school.
As a freshman at Fordham University, Curry's thoughts about walking on to the baseball team ended after one practice, surveying the Rams' cast.
"I signed up for the school newspaper and the school radio station the next day," said Curry, a Bergen County resident for the past 27 years.
Around the same time Curry began at Fordham, Cone was in the low minor leagues of his hometown Kansas City Royals, recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee – one of his first major professional hurdles.
Working on the book with Cone, "he talked about some of his Midwest life lessons, and there's some overlap there," Curry said of his Jersey City upbringing.
"There's a toughness of growing up in New Jersey," Curry said. "It's okay to get knocked down in life and prove that you can get back up again."
An inside pitch "Full Count" opens with Cone having a conversation with himself, three outs shy of his perfect game in 1999.
Staring at his reflection in a clubhouse bathroom, "His first words were: 'You better not blow this,' " Curry said of Cone's internal chat. "I think that was indicative of who he was as a pitcher."
Over 300-plus pages, Cone recounts his youthful hardheadedness and the heartbreak of being traded by the Royals. Years later, he hated being dealt by the Mets but loved the idea of returning as a Yankee.
There are stories about his interactions with the late George Steinbrenner that "the late '70s Yankees would never have gotten away with," Curry said.
The authors go inside Cone's need for a catcher as a co-pilot, connecting with Joe Girardi and Gary Carter but struggling with Jorge Posada and explaining why.
"It started out as a pitching journey, and I think the more we dug in...it became a personal journey for him too," Curry said.
And that includes Cone's relationship with his father, "his first and best pitching coach, but his dad was tough."
Guided by Curry, Cone's personal honesty has made 'Full Count' a best-seller.
In a recent interview, Cone described himself as "forever pitcher," who'll never stop thinking about the craft.
"When I die, I'll be thinking about pitching," Cone concluded, prompting Curry to tell him what a phenomenal quote that was. Oh, and one more thing.
"You think you might have given me that for the book?"

Help an author (and fellow readers) by posting a thoughtful book review online

Texto completo: One of the most generous things you can do for the author of a book is to write a review and post it on Amazon.com or Goodreads.com. This is especially true for indie books — those published by the authors themselves or by small presses.
With their tiny (or non-existent) marketing budgets, these books — a million are published each year — struggle to find readers. Receiving a large number of reviews can help raise a book’s visibility on retail sites like Amazon.
Unfortunately, just like grade inflation in our schools, the awarding of “stars” to indie books has been affected by readers who want to help their author friends sell more books. As a result, amateur reviews have lost credibility. Further, because display order depends on algorithms that take into account star ratings, books that don’t sport a large majority of four- and five-star reviews on Amazon effectively disappear.
While authors understandably fret about one-, two- and three-star or negative reviews, that doesn’t mean readers should write only positive, five-star reviews. Even books considered part of the literary “canon” have received harsh criticism. Literary Hub, an online literary digest, frequently collates one-star reviews of famous novels. An example: in a one-star critique of 1984, a reviewer called it “a wet, moody rag.”
On the other hand, five-star ratings that include no comments and one-sentence positive reviews don’t help sell books, either. I know that writing a review can be intimidating for readers who don’t write much other than an occasional email or Facebook post. It’s even more daunting if you think you must be a literary critic to write a review.
Nothing could be further from the truth. No one expects all readers to have the expertise of a book reviewer for the New York Times or the New Yorker. Your opinion is valuable anyway. To make it easier to contribute an Amazon or Goodreads review, I offer the following “do” and “don’t” tips.
Do
Give a brief summary of the plot. This doesn’t have to be comprehensive; just write a couple of sentences so that another reader will have an idea about whether the book will interest them. While doing this, be sure you don’t spoil the answer to a mystery or give away a secret that the author is keeping for the end.
Give a recommendation: up or down. Should others consider buying this book? If yes, what did you get out of it? Did you learn something? Were you unable to go to sleep until you finished it? Did you love the writing? The characters? And if you didn’t like it, always say why as well.
If you received a free copy of the book in exchange for your review, it’s only fair to the other readers to let them know. It only takes a quick sentence: “I received a free copy in return for agreeing to review this book.”
If it’s appropriate, share a sentence or two about yourself that helps other readers understand your perspective. It might be something like: “I grew up in Iowa, so I know the setting well.” Or: “As a child, I also suffered from parental neglect.” This establishes some credibility for your opinion.
Don’t
Review the book that was written. Never suggest the author should have written a different book. I once read a review of a golf novel in which the reviewer felt romance wasn’t a large enough part of the book. She should have looked for books in the romance section, not the sports fiction section!
Don’t use poor grammar, poor punctuation or bad spelling. Even the most glowing review will mean nothing if it is poorly written. Take a few minutes to review what you’ve written before you dash it off. No one expects you to be a great writer, but your review won’t carry any weight if it looks like you’re illiterate.
Don’t get even with the writer for a past snub, a disagreement or a domestic issue. One of my books was once given a number of one-star reviews — sans comments — by the friends of a women who was divorcing a friend of mine. Not fair!
Don’t pick out a minor detail in the book that you don’t like and make the review about it. I recall reading a one-sentence review that took an author to task for having an overweight character in the book, which the reviewer felt was insensitive.
Finally, to see professionals write reviews, there are many free websites where you can read their offerings, including Kirkus Reviews (www.kirkusreviews.com), Foreword Reviews (www.forewordreviews.com) and Midwest Book Review (www.midwestbookreview.com). A caveat: reviews may be less biased if they’re written soon after the book is released. Average ratings tend to fall once a book receives a major literary award, probably because of heightened expectations on the part of readers and jealousy of the literary crowd that didn’t win the award.
Marj Charlier, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and an author of ten novels, writes book reviews for Midwest Book Review and her own website, marjcharlier.com.

Texto completo: The May 23 Espionage Act indictment of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange evoked justified outrage and condemnation from media organizations and free speech advocates. Federal prosecutors claim in the indictment that Assange illegally received classified U.S. government information on United States military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, State Department cables involving U.S. foreign relations and the identities of human sources helping American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Carrie DeCell of the Knight Institute at Columbia University observed on Twitter that the “government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information. That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”
Masha Gessen at The New Yorker addressed an equally weighty issue when she observed, “The last thing we want the U.S. government, or any government, to do is to start deciding who is and who is not a journalist.”
I’m going to take that analogy one step further: the last thing we want is executive branch departments and agencies unilaterally and selectively asserting what should or should not be considered legitimately classified information.
The very law being used to charge Assange was passed over 100 years ago at the beginning of America’s entry into World War I. The Espionage Act of 1917 was used by the Justice Department and Postal Service to cow, investigate, shut down and even prosecute news outlets that challenged the Wilson administration’s wartime policies.
One of the most prominent targets was former Rep. Victor Berger of Wisconsin and his newspaper, the Milwaukee Leader. For publishing editorials critical of the war, Berger was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919. Though the conviction was overturned two years later, in the interim, Berger won reelection to the House twice but his colleagues refused to seat him.
In Assange’s case, he and Wikileaks did exactly what newspapers have done for decades — seek information about U.S. government policies and actions that were either questionable or outright illegal and publish information accordingly.
In 1971 for the New York Times it was the Pentagon Papers — the classified history of the Vietnam War leaked by then-RAND Corporation analyst and former Marine Corps infantry captain Daniel Ellsberg.
For the Washington Post, it was Watergate, including then-Attorney General John Mitchell’s illegal, secret surveillance slush fund used to target Democratic politicians. For Assange and his then-U.S. Army intelligence analyst accomplice, Chelsea Manning, it was about exposing U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the Assange Espionage Act indictment, federal prosecutors specifically invoke Manning’s sharing and Assange’s receipt of classified information as also involving violations of Executive Order 13526, National Security Information, which states (Sec. 1.4(a)) that “military plans, weapons systems, or operations” are considered classified under the executive order.
But the Army officials who classified the 2007 Apache helicopter video released by Assange showing the killing of Iraqi civilians misused the classification system to conceal criminal conduct — something expressly forbidden by Sec. 1.7(a) of the very same Executive Order federal prosecutors cited in the Assange indictment.
So where are the indictments against Pentagon or CIA officials who knowingly and deliberately misused the classification system to conceal acts of torture or other war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere? The hypocrisy and selective application of federal laws, regulations and executive orders in matters of national security is on full display in the Assange indictment. And there is another deeply troubling thing about the latest Assange indictment: the Justice Department’s attempt to criminalize the digital transfer of government information to third parties.
The 18th count against Assange focuses on alleged violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), namely that Assange (via Manning) sought to “knowingly access a computer … to obtain information that has been determined by the United States Government … to require protection against unauthorized disclosure” and to “willfully communicate, deliver, transmit, and cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same, to any person not entitled to receive it.”
The indictment also mentions three times Assange and Manning using “a cloud drop box” for the exchange of the purloined documents. In effect, prosecutors are arguing that the entire chain of digital exchanges between Wikileaks and Manning were illegal, and that the use of a “cloud storage” mechanism was a key feature of the crime.
Multiple news organizations utilize the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s encrypted SecureDrop system for receiving sensitive, including classified, documents from sources seeking to expose illegal or questionable government activities. If federal prosecutors prevail on Count 18 of the Assange indictment, it would open up every news organization in the world utilizing SecureDrop or a similar system to a CFAA prosecution — whether a whistleblower was digitally passing along Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports of immigrant abuse, Pentagon documents showing contracting irregularities, etc.
Prosecutors are attempting to overturn the Supreme Court decision in the Pentagon Papers case through a statutory Trojan Horse (the CFAA) all while deliberately ignoring the real crime in this episode — the deliberate misuse of federal classified information statutes and executive orders to conceal American government war crimes.

Texto completo: Think how you shined during the interview where landed you your job. You were prepared to impress, fully engaged, and leaning forward with enthusiasm. Acutely aware that you were being evaluated, you made sure your answers were crisp and your questions were thoughtful. Simply put, you were ON.
Unfortunately, that moment is the brightest some of us shine. A few weeks into the gig, your effort and enthusiasm wane. As routine sets in, your performance becomes rote and mechanical. This applies to jobs, families, and communities alike.
We know the big moments matter — the job interview, the sales pitch, the promotion request, the board meeting presentation. But we can easily fall into the trap of thinking we are only being evaluated some of the time.
The truth is, you're always auditioning.
Every interaction counts How you conduct yourself between — not just during — those big moments will determine your eventual success. Are you engaged, passionate and proactive on a daily basis or only at the times you think it really matters? We must realize that we're being evaluated by colleagues, bosses, customers, investors, and partners in each and every interaction, not just the big ones.
When that huge promotion opportunity arises, the higher ups reflect on your performance as a whole, not just in specialized moments. The ones who deliver value with stunning consistency are the ones that ultimately snag the brass ring.
When you shine as common practice, you communicate to the world that you're the right person for the job (and the one after that). Even the most mundane and average customer interactions, supplier meetings, community discussions or family interactions are an opportunity to soar. Don't squander them.
Show off your competence Each touch point is your chance to demonstrate competence and reinforce your value. Each touch point is an audition for future opportunity, whether or not it is apparent at the time. Your responsibility is to keep demonstrating the intensity and value you did back at your interview, considering you're always being evaluated.
With the always auditioning mindset, there's no doubt you'll be well equipped to land the starring role, whatever that may look like.

Retracing an 1850s journey through the South

Texto completo: Most people who remember Frederick Law Olmsted credit him with two magnificent accomplishments: his role in the design and construction of Manhattan's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park. His legacy lives on in dozens of parks nationwide that he designed or inspired.
Olmsted was a complicated man; before he settled on creating parks, he was a farmer, a public health worker and, as a young man, a journalist. In the 1850s he set out to travel the length of the South, in search of the truth of the region and its stubborn embrace of slavery. His dispatches ran in the New-York Daily Times (today's New York Times) and influenced the debate on abolition and, eventually, the war. By the end of his journey he had embraced the abolitionist movement, supporting an effort to settle West Texas with anti-slavery advocates.
Tony Horwitz, an accomplished journalist and author ("Confederates in the Attic," "Blue Latitudes"), set out to retrace Olmsted's journey and record his own 21st century impressions. The result is "Spying on the South: An Odyssey Across the American Divide." Readers will find many parallels between the journeys and perspectives of the two men. (Editor's note: Horwitz died unexpectedly Monday. He was 60.)
Horwitz follows, as best he can, Olmsted's meandering trajectory. Traveling by train, boat, car and mule through West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, he drops in on a varied group of communities. He visits hollowed-out West Virginia towns devastated by unemployment and the opioid epidemic, where hard times have turned longtime Democrats toward President Donald Trump. He finds the exuberant Cajuns of southern Louisiana following in their ancestors'dance steps; in one of many eerie historic parallels, one local offered Olmsted this description of the Cajun temperament: "habitually gay and careless, as well as kind-hearted, hospitable and dissolute." Like Olmsted, Horwitz encounters intractable racism in East Texas.
Along the way, his literary companion, the "long-dead Fred," makes for wonderful reading. Olmsted could write - humorous, opinionated and vivid, dropping gems of description everywhere. But Olmsted's position as a well-situated Northerner occasionally blinkered his vision, and to some degree Horwitz follows suit. Olmsted complained about the tacky villages he passed on his river journeys (it's the frontier, mate), and on a quick visit to Nashville, Horwitz, who calls Martha's Vineyard home, laments that "Music City felt like a themed, blocks-long mall anchored by familiar brands." Fair enough, but he skips the city's beautiful old neighborhoods, its extensive 3,100-acre Warner Parks system and its crown jewel, Vanderbilt University.
Both men are food snobs. Olmsted declaimed at length on his loathing of corn pone, missing the obvious fact that it was the staple of poor people who had nothing else to eat. Horwitz despairs of the unhealthy fare in Southern restaurants, apparently unaware of the regional food renaissance blooming across the South.
Horwitz doesn't linger in multicultural Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, because it was "way too big and complicated to get my arms around as a blow-through traveler." There are few young adults in his telling, people in their 20s and 30s using their smarts and imaginations in politics, business and education. He loves the absurd, and he's willing to venture anywhere in the service of a good story, but when a disaffected traveling companion calls him "the concierge of crap," I couldn't disagree.
Horwitz is a dedicated, imaginative reporter and a great raconteur, but this book is one man's travelogue, not an in-depth report from, as the subtitle puts it, "the other side of the American divide." Read it for its humor, for Horwitz's thorough excavation of Southern history and for the delights of Olmsted's own dispatches. For the truth of today's South, go and see for yourself.

"Reconciling Olmsted's South with today's isn't always easy," wrote Jonathan Miles in Garden & Gun. "Vistas lauded by Olmsted are now laced with strip malls. ... But enough parallels remain - physical, cultural and ideological - to give this journey heft, and to require frequent pauses for contemplation, for Horwitz to reckon with those intersections of past and present."

Texto completo: Dawud Shabazz joined the search party, but wasn't prepared for what they found. The little girl's hair was still in beaded pigtails. Her bones were scattered in the grass.
"I just saw my kid laying there," recalled Shabazz, whose own four children ranged in age from 3 to 13 at the time.
The remains were those of LaTonya Wilson, 7. She was one of 29 black youths and young adults killed from 1979 to 1981, the era of the Atlanta Child Murders.
The ongoing horror story changed life forever for many in Atlanta.
"It's 11 o'clock, do you know where your children are?" longtime Channel 2 anchor Monica Pearson would begin nightly broadcasts during that time. "It
affectedhow people saw the city," she recalled.
Police investigated dozens of suspects. Some confessed but were eliminated because cops believed they were mentally ill and lying. State and local authorities debated whether one killer or many were taking children who'd vanished while walking home from the roller rink, while working odd jobs or just standing on the sidewalk.Concerned residents responded by patrolling neighborhoods, some carrying baseball bats.
"The city was like a powder keg ready to explode," said activist Michael Langford, then a Morris Brown College student.
Shabazz installed new locks and rarely slept through the night. He and his wife sent her two sons to live with their dad in West Africa, believing they'd be safer there than in Atlanta.
"I'm so hurt and upset these things happened to these innocent children," Shabazz said.
All these years later, the hurt hasn't left him. Neither have lingering doubts about whether Wayne Williams is the one culprit guilty of all the crimes ascribed to him. After he was convicted in 1982 in the cases of two adults' murders, police closed most of the other cases. Williams was given two life sentences, and charging him with further crimes was unnecessary, authorities decided at the time.
In March, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced that police and prosecutors would take a new look, using modern technology to test old evidence in case something was overlooked the first time.
"It may be there is nothing left to be tested," said Bottoms, who recalled living through the grim chapter in Atlanta's history as a terrified 9-year-old. "But I do think history will judge us by our actions and we will be able to say we tried."
It's unclear what the new efforts have borne out.The Atlanta Police Department has declined to detail its progress with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, but did grant an interview to The New York Times.
"I think the investigators were under such political pressure that they were not allowed to do their jobs to the extent they could," Police Chief Erika Shields told the Times, stressing that she was not judging the original officers. At the mayor's March news conference, Shields said officials had an obligation to do everything possible to bring closure all these decades later.
A somber milestone
The 40th anniversary of the beginning of the Atlanta Child Murders sparked a surge of renewed interest, and in Williams, who is held at Telfair State Prison in southeast Georgia. He has maintained his innocence.
Local broadcaster Frank Ski interviewed Williams in prison years ago, after receiving letters from him. He didn't open the letters at first, and approached their meeting with some trepidation.
"At first I was afraid," Ski said during an interview with the AJC. "I didn't know what he was going to be like."
He was surprised at Williams' slight stature and left wondering, like many have over the decades, if he could indeed have pulled off all of the crimes.
"Wayne maybe weighed 160 pounds wet.When I first met him that's what I thought: who is this itty bitty guy?" Ski said. "He said he is not the guy and he feels like he was framed."
Ski also has interviewed some victims' family members about their doubts, and deems himself skeptical that Williams is sole guilty party behind all of the killings.
There's been disagreement among investigators as well.
Retired Atlanta homicide Detective Danny Agan, who appeared at Bottoms' news conference and in a recent Investigation Discovery documentary, said he believes Williams committed most, but not necessarily all of the murders. His former colleague, Bob Buffington, believes Williams is behind 24 of the crimes. Late prosecutor Jack Mallord always maintained the case against Williams was solid and based on unassailable fiber and hair evidence.
"There are some doubters who continue to beat the drum on behalf of Williams' claims that he was railroaded and framed. As in other high-profile cases, no doubt conspiratorial claims will continue," he wrote in "The Atlanta Child Murders: The Night Stalker." His 2009 book includes details about the police and FBI stakeouts that led to Williams' arrest, the hair, fiber and blood evidence investigators examined, trial testimony and details about the victims.
The skeletal remains of LaTonya Williams, Mallord wrote, were identified through dental records and her clothing. They were discovered in October 1980, four months after she disappeared, "by a search party of volunteers."
'God is with you'
LaTonya's parents reported her missing on June 22, 1980. The perpetrator would have had to remove a pane of glass from a window, come inside and carried the child out the back door, all without waking LaTonya, her parents or siblings, police said at the time. Investigators called the case odd and surprising.
Shabazz was among the volunteers who joined officials for a massive search on Oct. 18, 1980. His team came upon the child's remains at Sewanne Avenue and Verbena Street, not far from her home. Shabazz felt weak and had to sit down as officers and news crews swarmed.
After word spread that a body had been found, Willie Mae Mathis came to the scene and began sobbing. Mathis' son Jefferey, 10, had gone missing in March 1980.
"Hold on, sister," Shabazz told her. "God is with you, and so are we."
Jeffrey's body would be discovered the following February. Nearly 24 years later, Willie Mae Mathis moved from the Atlanta house she'd lived in for 30 years. She didn't go far, relocating right next door, and made sure to keep the same phone number.
"I have been thinking about my son every day since he left the house," she told the AJC in 2005. "Every time the phone rang, I thought it was him."
The late Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's mayor at the time, had come to Mathis' house to personally deliver the terrible news when Jeffrey's remains were found. Still, she clung to the hope that maybe there had been a mistake.
"If someone got him after all these years, maybe he can find his way home. That is why I have never changed my phone number," she said during the 2005 interview. She died the next year.
It was a meeting with another long-gr ieving parent that prompted Bottoms to announced the new investigative efforts. Catherine Leach-Bell's son, 13-year-old Curtis Walker, was among the victims. Leach-Bell feels sickened at the thought that the case may yet be unsolved.
"I ask the Lord who did it, she said, "and why."

|The only person ever charged with any of the murders was Wayne Bertram Williams, then a 23-year-old photographer and wannabe music producer.
|Williams' convictions hinged on dog hairs and fibers that prosecutors argued linked his home and car to Nathaniel Cater's and Jimmy Ray Payne's bodies. |Though Williams was tried for just those two killings, the Atlanta Police Department attributed at least 22 of the other 29 known homicides to Williams and closed those cases. |Williams, now 61, is serving a life sentence at Telfair State Prison in southeast Georgia. He maintains his innocence and many people still doubt that he was the serial killer. "Nobody ever testified or even claimed that they saw me strike another person, choke another person, stab, beat or kill or hurt anybody," Williams said in a 2010 CNN interview. "Because I didn't."

Texto completo: KOVEL'S ANTIQUES

This elaborately decorated puzzle pitcher was made in Budapest, Hungary. In 1839, Moritz Fischer bought a factory that had been operating in Herend, Hungary, since 1826. He started making dinner sets for Hungarians because the old sets from Europe and the Far East were no longer available. The company started making figurines in the 1870s. At the turn of the century, Jeno, Moritz Fischer's grandson, took over the company, revived the old patterns and made new ones.

Fischer Company was nationalized in 1948. Another company named Herend started importing Herend china into the United States in 1957. Herend was privatized in 1993 and is still working making Hungarian-style ceramics.

Just how old is this traditional puzzle jug marked "Fischer J Budapest"? In Hungarian, surnames are written first, and I and J are the same. The Fischer J in the mark stands for Ignac Fischer, a distant relative of Moritz, who trained with his father and later with Moritz. In 1867, Ignac started making his own ceramics that were similar to those made at the Zsolnay factory. Around 1895, Ignac Fischer's company became part of the Zsolnay factory in Pecs. The mark on the puzzle jug was used from about 1867 to about 1895, even though the pieces look much older.

QUESTIONS FROM READERS ...

I am trying to find out what my silver tray is worth. It is oval and has a rope twist rim. There is a mark on the bottom with a three-leaf stem, a crown and a standing lion over two more lions and a star. The mark also has old-English-looking letters: EBM & S.

The letters on your tray are actually EGW & S, which stand for E.G. Webster & Son of New York City and Brooklyn. The Elizur G. Webster firm started in New York City in 1860. In 1864, Webster partnered with William Dupree and the firm became Webster & Dupree. After a few changes in partnerships with William Dupree and Webster's brother Adelbert Webster, E.G. partnered with his son Fred H. Webster in 1886, and the firm became E.G. Webster & Son. E.G. died in 1900. His son continued the business until 1928, when it was sold to International Silver Co. In 1981, it was sold to Oneida. Your tray is silver plate and the pattern is No. 210. The mark dates it from 1886 to 1928. Medium-sized silver-plated serving trays in good condition are worth $35 to $50.

I have an antique buffet that I bought 30 years ago at an antiques shop in Florida. It has two long drawers and two cupboards with interior shelves. There is a paper label that says "Fulton Street at Hoyt, Abraham & Straus, Brooklyn" and "No. 445-1" is burned into the wood. I'd like to know more about the buffet and its value.

Abraham & Straus started in 1865 as Wechsler & Straus. The name became Abraham & Straus in 1893 after the Straus family bought out Weschler. It became part of Federated Department Stores in 1900, and the name Abraham & Straus continued to be used until 1995.

The number is probably the model number. Your buffet was made in the first half of the 20th century, as many reproductions of earlier styles of furniture were made before 1960. A buffet would sell for about $750-$1,000 depending on style and condition.

Is there any value to an old box of phonograph needles? I have an unopened tin that contains 200 needles. It says "Columbia medium tone needles" on the lid. It says "Brilliant" above that and "Use each needle once only" below. It's yellow with brown and white and has music notes on either side of the writing.

Tin phonograph needle cases appeal to people who collect phonographs, music memorabilia or advertising items. The tins are very small, about 2 inches across, and often have attractive graphic designs lithographed on the top and sides. Your tin is from the 1920s and sells online for about $15. The unused needles are also wanted by those who play their old records.

Can you tell me the approximate value of old newspapers and magazines? I have the full copy of The New York Times newspaper from Saturday April 15, 1865, with the headline "Awful Event, President Lincoln Shot by an Assassin," as well as a newspaper of Kennedy's assassination. I also have old Playboy magazines from the 1950s-'70s.

Old newspapers covering major events, like the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, the sinking of the Titanic, the San Francisco earthquake and other major catastrophes, sell for the highest prices. The front page of the April 15, 1865, New York Times sold at auction for $450 last year. A copy of the same issue, with eight pages, sold for $1,200 three years ago.

Most Playboy magazines sell for only a couple of dollars, though a collection of 30 magazines sold for $76.

But beware, many copies have been made of the famous newspapers. Old newspapers yellow and fall apart unless properly stored.
